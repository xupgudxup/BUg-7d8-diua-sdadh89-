    "title": "Creatine, ADHD video games: The quest for a better brain is turning into a gold rush",
    "description": "Americans love trying to upgrade their brains — one scoop, zap, or gaming session at a time",
    "fullText": "At this point, you've probably at least thought about dropping a few scoops of creatine into your morning smoothie. An amino acid compound that promotes energy production in brain and muscle cells, it's been a gym staple for building muscle for decades. In recent years, researchers have started to unpack creatine's potential cognition-boosting benefits, including promising early studies for sleep-deprived people and Alzheimer's patients.\n\nAt the Vitamin Shoppe, sales of creatine are up 320% since 2019, the company said in its 2025 trend report. Searches for \"creatine gummies\" spiked 1,300% last year, while the powder remains a \"mainstay.\"\n\nIf supplements aren't your thing, but gaining a neuro edge is, you might have considered a brain-training headset, which promises to combat brain aging and cognitive decline, as well as improve sleep. Or a game that promises help with the symptoms of adult ADHD.\n\nConsumer products that promise sharper thinking, calmer moods, and a cognitive edge are suddenly everywhere.\n\nMeta and Apple are developing, patenting, or acquiring devices we could soon wear around our wrists, on the collars of our shirts, or inside our nostrils to improve our mood — and maybe even \"boost\" intelligence by providing a kind of IQ-enhancing adrenaline boost for the brain. Much of the new brain tech is being driven by AI, which enables more real-time feedback.\n\nBrain hacking is also becoming a high-end perk at some workplaces.\n\nIn 2014, there were just 41 consumer neurotech companies, according to a recent report from the Centre for Future Generations. By 2024, that number had soared to 153, outpacing medical device manufacturing for the brain.\n\nAnd who wouldn't want a little brain enhancement?\n\nA rapidly aging population that's increasingly extending working lives well into the golden years, longevity-focused biohackers, and women looking for treatments for menopause-related brain fog all add up to a potentially massive consumer base.\n\n\"People want to find that one magic thing: one magic game or app or something that makes you better at a whole suite of things in a super short time,\" UCSD cognitive neuroscientist Bradley Voytek, who studies how brain communication changes as we age, told Business Insider.\n\nIt all sounds great, right? But what does science have to say about any of this?\n\nThe trouble with optimizing our brains is that no two brains work the same way. The question worth asking is not so much what the human brain needs, but rather what your brain needs.\n\nDepending on the answer, you might be better off pursuing something that's tailored to your specific needs or goals, rather than a mass-marketed brain booster.\n\nTake creatine. An emerging body of research focused on older adults suggests that it can improve sleep and potentially help stave off cognitive decline. Large, well-controlled studies are scarce, especially for younger, generally healthy individuals. That's not to say that creatine is bad; it's just that it may help you build muscle but not meaningfully improve cognition.\n\nDoctors generally suggest blood testing for nutritional deficiencies before you start taking supplements. That same advice holds for fancy, brain-boosting tech.\n\nSimilarly, a lot of neuro-edge devices might offer some benefit. They may not address your precise concerns or your very specific, long-term cognitive vulnerabilities.\n\n\"The way you improve cognition is to work around the areas of weakness,\" says neuroscientist Dean Sherzai, the executive director of clinical research at Charles R. Drew University and best-selling author of \"The Alzheimer's Solution.\" \"You build it back up.\"\n\nThere are some things, of course, that are good for everyone. Quality sleep. Regular, moderate-to-intense exercise. A healthy, nutrient-rich diet. Meaningful social interaction. Virtually every neuroscientist agrees on this foundational, grandma-approved advice.\n\nThere is also promising research around the power of brain games.\n\nBrainHQ, which sells a mind-training program, released a study in partnership with McGill University in Canada that found that adults aged 65 and up, who did the exercises for 30 minutes a day for 10 weeks, experienced a roughly 2% increase in their acetylcholine levels — a key brain chemical that aids in movement, memory, and learning.\n\nBrain-body training can also offer clear benefits for various aspects of cognition, including visual perception, balance, coordination, focus, relaxation, and working memory.\n\nThat can be great for anyone hoping to promote a performance edge, whether they're a professional athlete or a stock trader.\n\nSome companies are taking note, and offering such training as a high-end perk.\n\nLast year, JLL, the commercial real estate giant, set up a \"brain gym\" in its Singapore office that was outfitted with the same kind of gear that high-performance athletes use to train their brains, like lighted pods and vision training boards.\n\n\"Wouldn't you want those people to be 1% more high performing or more focused or more productive?\" said Ben Hamley, JLL's global head of research and development. He said employees who participated saw improvements to their focus, including being better able to resist distractions.\n\nFor all the options, experts say that consumers are left to figure out what they, personally, need most and filter through what's bogus versus what could be good for them — and do it all on their own.\n\nNone of the neuroscientists I interviewed for this story said they personally use brain games or pulsating devices regularly — at least, not yet.\n\nExperts agree that one of the most important things you can do is to continuously challenge yourself in the real world. This might include discovering new places, engaging in deep conversations with other people, and picking up a new skill, such as a foreign language or a musical instrument.\n\n\"If you're not getting in nature and walking and interacting with other people, you are missing core ingredients of keeping a healthy brain,\" says Dr. Adam Gazzaley, founder and executive director of the University of California San Francisco's Neuroscape center.\n\nGazzaley believes in the power of technology to help train our brains — he spent 15 years developing what became EndeavorOTC, the first video game approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult ADHD.\n\nHe also sees its limits. \"No amount of hacks are going to help,\" he said, if you haven't built that healthy foundation. \"Watching TV all day would be the opposite example of that, where you just passively, like a fire hose, have information flood into your brain as opposed to interactively pushing yourself and thinking and interpreting information that's outside of your normal inputs,\" he said.\n\nFor all the exciting promise of neurotech products, what we'll most benefit from is the right device, the right technique, the right prescription, and all at the right time.\n\nFor now, we don't quite understand how to exercise each person's brain in the most effective way every day.\n\nVoytek, the neuroscience professor, says when students come to him struggling with focus or are unable to complete assignments, he never suggests brain training.\n\n\"I would recommend sleep,\" he said.",

However, there's another thing to consider when looking at the year ahead: the staggering number of series with major anniversaries.\n\nIt's hard to believe the first Donkey Kong game was released 45 years ago, and I swear I heard my knees crack as I realized that Pokemon is officially 30 years old. Nintendo in particular has a lot to celebrate this year, with big anniversaries for The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Kid Icarus, and Animal Crossing coming in addition to the games I mentioned previously. That said, both Sony and Xbox have reason to celebrate as well, as Tomb Raider turns 30 and Halo--and Xbox as a brand overall--hit 25.\n\nBut perhaps the most exciting thing to consider in light of all these anniversaries are the announcements that could be lingering just around the corner. Though we've already received confirmation that a remake of the original Tomb Raider is in the works, and other series such as Donkey Kong, Pokemon, and Resident Evil all have new or upcoming entries, there are a few games on this list that have been dormant for some time. Could 2026 be the year we get a new Kid Icarus or Castlevania? No clue, but a girl can hope, right?\n\nSo without further ado, is a round up of all the series with milestone anniversaries in 2026:",

No, it's not the cost that bothers me, but rather how little these new Joy-Cons differentiate themselves from the pair that already exist.\nSimilar to the original Switch's Joy-Cons, it appears that the various colorways for the Switch 2 versions will feature two different colors; in the case of these newly announced Joy-Cons, those colors are a bright, pastel purple and a vibrant aqua that the company refers to as \"Light Green.\" Despite not fully agreeing with Nintendo on what constitutes light green, I actually really like these new colors.",

In case you couldn't make it to Las Vegas this year, here's a quick look at the technology that caught our eyes.\n\nAsus and XReal have teamed up for a new set of extended reality glasses, and on paper, these have some seriously impressive tech inside. Scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses and a dock that lets you connect them to a console or PC via HDMI and DisplayPort.\n\nWhat's better than one 3K 16-inch OLED screen on a gaming laptop? Two 3K 16-inch OLED screens, of course. While this isn't the first time Asus has experimented with a multi-monitor display on one of its ROG laptops, this new take on the Zephyrus Duo looks like a wild approach to dual-screen gaming.\n\nHolograms make everything cooler, and Asus is leveraging this technology to create a seriously cool PC gaming case. The Asus ROG GM1000 can use its case fans to project holographic images, and users can upload their own GIFs and short MP4s to create custom effects.\n\nGameSir might be onto something, as the idea of a gaming controller with a dedicated steering wheel right in the center sounds like a fun idea. You've got all the inputs you'd require from modern gaming, a direct drive motor, and up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering, the company claims (via The Verge). Pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed.\n\nGameSir's other big controller reveal was the X5 Alteron, a Swiss Army knife of a peripheral designed for iPad, iPhone, Android, and Nintendo Switch. HyperX is helping develop it, and the modular system lets you customize the controller with various modules. This means that you can customize it extensively with different D-pads, thumbsticks, and buttons to create your dream controller.\n\nA gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port, the 8BitDo FlipPad borrows heavily from the design of the classic Nintendo Game Boy. The company says it'll reveal more details on the Android and iOS controller ahead of its launch in Summer 2026.\n\nIt might look visually inspired by Nespresso coffee machines, but the new mid-tower case unveiled by CyberPowerPC at CES has an elegant quality. It has everything you'd expect--tempered glass panels, mesh ventilation, and ports--but the real showstopper here is a selection of knobs for controlling the LEDs on this sleek case.\n\n8BitDo makes some of the best controllers, and at CES 2026, it unveiled the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E wireless modular controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple devices, and Android. Just don't expect this to be a budget-friendly option, as the Ultimate 3E will retail for $150 at launch in Q2 2026.\n\nIf you're a fan of Kojima Productions--the studio headed by famed game developer Hideo Kojima--then you'll want to check out these new peripherals from Asus. This special-edition hardware features hand-drawn illustrations by Yoji Shinkawa--the art director for the Death Stranding games--and it'll launch on February 4.\n\nThe newly revealed Corsair Galleon 100 SD mechanical keyboard doesn't have a numpad, but it does have a built-in Elgato Stream Deck Plus. This part of the keyboard features 12 customizable buttons, a five-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and rotary dials. It launches on January 29 and it's priced at $350.\n\nRazer's Project Ava is aiming to be a holographic AI desktop companion that can fulfill several roles. From lifestyle reminders to gaming wingman, the device will come with several AI personalities and is expected to launch within the first half of 2026.\n\nWe're skeptical about this concept for a \"non-invasive\" gaming headset that supposedly improves your skills in competitive games, but at least Neurable and HyperX's protoype looks like a comfy set of brain-scanning cans.\n\nUltrawide monitors have become a popular option over the years, but laptop users can't enjoy them on the go--unless they want to lug a spare monitor around. That's where this concept for a rollable screen comes in: Lenovo is courting \"athletes who need pro-level performance\" with its gaming laptop. The screen can unfurl to 16, 21.5, and 24 inches.\n\nHyperX isn't the only company with AI-powered headphones at CES 2026, as Razer also showed off its Project Motoko concept. The idea behind this wireless headset is that it uses a ton of tech--including two 4K cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, near and far field microphones, and built-in AI--to serve a similar function to other AI wearables, like taking photos, translating foreign text, or conversing with an AI assistant.\n\nIt's not gaming tech, but this $399 ultrasonic chef's knife from Seattle Ultrasonics is the closest thing we have to owning a high-frequency blade in real life. Can it effortlessly cut through a Metal Gear mech? Probably not, but the vibrating piezoelectric ceramic crystals will let you slice through fruit and vegetables easily.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't have a new GPU to show off this year, the company did reveal its DLSS 4.5 upscaling technology. The company claims it can dynamically boost performance in compatible games, enabling up to 240+ frames per second with path tracing on 50-series GPU cards.",

    "fullText": "Gaming controllers are just one of those things that I love to collect, but living in a small New York apartment, eventually enough is enough. At CES this year, I saw three new controllers that are all trying to be the last ones I'll ever need to buy (for specific systems, at least). It seems like modularity is in, and all three of these devices want to meet all of your needs. However, they're not settled on what the best approach is.\n\nThe GameSir x Hyperkin X5 Alteron is probably the cutest controller on this list, especially if you grew up playing GameCube or Nintendo 64. Essentially, it's a telescopic mobile controller that stretches to fit around your phone or small tablet, but the gimmick is that all of the face buttons and sticks come in hot swappable modules, and can be freely mixed-and-matched for multiple configurations.\n\nYou could do a standard Xbox style layout. You could opt for a layout with symmetrical, PlayStation style thumbsticks instead. You could use GameCube or Nintendo 64 style face button configurations, which is a unique touch. There are even options for a six-button arcade style layout or a Steam Deck style trackpad.\n\nEssentially, play your cards right, and this thing could fit any need you might possibly have, so long as you're playing on mobile. You could even get weird and slot in a GameCube layout for your left hand and a Nintendo 64 layout for your right hand.\n\nThe different configurations all pop in and out easily, but don't feel loose when you're using the controller. And there are also bells and whistles like back paddles and trigger stops, for extra buttons and quicker reaction times. The sticks are also capacitive, which essentially means they shouldn't drift, but also won't cause magnetic interference like Hall Effect or TMR sticks (other popular anti-drift technology) can.\n\nThe catch? While this isn't a concept, pricing and availability aren't set in stone yet. GameSir also told me it's still figuring out distribution, so it's unclear how many control modules will come with the controller, if you'll be able to buy them separately, and how much they'll cost if you do. The company did say it's targeting a $100 release, but that could change, and it's still figuring out how to make that a reality.\n\nThe other issue, of course, is that this is mobile only, although GameSir said it might make a more traditional version in the future. This isn't the first controller with hot swappable modules, but others are usually pro-level and don't have nearly as many options as the X5 Alteron does.\n\n8BitDo is one of my favorite controller companies, especially for retro style controllers. Last year, it already dipped its toes into modularity with the 8BitDo Pro 3. That was a PlayStation-style controller that allowed you to individually swap out any of the main four face buttons to place them in whatever order you wanted, which made it easier to swap between Xbox (ABXY) and Nintendo (BAYX) style layouts. Now, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3e is taking that concept and really running with it.\n\nOfficially licensed by Xbox but also compatible with PC and mobile devices, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3e looks like a standard Xbox controller at first, but has a removable face plate that gives you access to a bunch of options. Take it off, and you can lift out the sticks, D-Pad, or face buttons to swap them for ones with a different feel.\n\nYour overall control layout will still be the same—there's no mimicking the GameCube, swapping the order of the ABXY buttons, or changing your stick position here. But you could opt for either a four-way or circular D-Pad or sticks with different lengths or grips, for instance. The ABXY button modules also come in both quiet silicone versions or clicky, micro-switch versions.\n\nThat's a lot of control, and it comes on top of 8BitDo's standard Ultimate controller features, like the included charging dock, extra macro buttons, trigger stops, a gyroscope, and 1,000hz polling.\n\n8BitDo says the Ultimate 3e controller will cost $150 and will come with all your control options. It's set to ship later this year.\n\nWhen I reviewed the MCON magnetic gaming controller late last year, I wanted to love it. It was my favorite product from last CES, but when it came to market, I had a few issues with it that made me feel like it wasn't quite complete. Well, they're still in the prototype phase, but MCON makers OhSnap are now working on two new MCON models that are looking to fix pretty much all of my problems with the original device.\n\nCalled the MCON Slim and the MCON Lite, these versions of the device are much smaller and should be much cheaper than the version that's on the market now, but retain almost all of its features. There are a few compromises to make that happen, but ultimately, they look like moves in the right direction.\n\nFirst, both the MCON Slim and the MCON Lite have manual sliding mechanisms for their controls. That means the controls normally slip tucked away behind your phone, but can be pulled out like an old-school Android keyboard. I actually prefer this. The original MCON instead uses a spring-loaded sliding mechanism, and it's pretty violent, and can send your phone flying if you're not careful.\n\nSecond, when I say these are smaller, I mean it. If the original MCON felt like attaching a MagSafe battery bank to your phone, these feel a lot more like using a MagSafe wallet. I didn't mind the size of the original too much, but it really is impressive how much the new models have slimmed down.\n\nFinally, while pricing isn't finalized yet, MCON told me to expect the new models to be somewhere between 1/3rd to half the price of the current one. That's a huge markdown on the pricey $150 original, even as these fix some of my problems with it.\n\nTo be fair, you do lose out on a little bit here, but not much. The MCON Slim and MCON Lite still have a kickstand mode, and still feature a full set of buttons, but they handle their shoulder buttons and thumbsticks differently. Both the Slim and Lite have \"inline\" shoulder buttons, which means the L1/R1 and L2/R2 buttons are next to each other horizontally rather than stacked. Not a big deal for me, but some people may prefer a console-like layout. The bigger differences come in the thumbsticks.\n\nThe MCON Slim uses 3DS-style circle pads instead of Switch-style thumbsticks, which is how it's able to save so much space. They aren't my favorite, but I've never had any problems making them work. The MCON Lite, then, uses dual-trackpads instead of thumbsticks. That makes it even smaller than the Slim, but I've never had great luck using trackpads for analog style inputs. It could be useful for games that need a mouse, though.\n\nSo, what makes these modular? Well, aside from giving you more model options and carrying forward the removable kickstand mode from the original MCON, part of what allows these models to be so thin is that they use custom backplates designed for certain phones, whereas the original model used a bulkier solution that fits all phones.\n\nThe MCON Slim and MCON Lite are the most conceptual of the devices on this list, but OhSnap assured me that at least one will make its way to market, hopefully this year. Apparently, there are still internal debates about whether the model with trackpads is worth releasing or not.",

    "fullText": "In this week’s newsletter: Stranger Things’ climactic showdown is the latest pop culture spectacle to feel like its been ported straight from a console. The industries’ reciprocally influential relationship can be to everyone’s gain\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nIt had begun to feel like an endurance test by the end, but nonetheless, like the sucker I am, I watched the Stranger Things finale last week. And spoiler warning: I’m going to talk about it in general terms in this newsletter. Because approximately 80% of the final season comprised twentysomething “teenagers” explaining things to each other while using random 1980s objects to illustrate convoluted plans and plot points, my expectations were not high. After an interminable hour, finally, something fun happens, as the not-kids arm themselves with machine guns and molotovs and face off against a monstrously gigantic demon-crab. Aha, I thought – the final boss battle!\n\nThe fight was like something out of Monster Hunter, all scale and spectacle with a touch of desperation. For a very long time, video games sought to imitate cinema. Now cinema (and TV) often feels like a video game. The structure of Stranger Things’ final season reminded me a lot of Resident Evil: long periods of walking slowly through corridors, with characters exchanging plot information aloud on their way to the action, and occasional explosions of gunfire, screeching monsters or car chases. Those long periods of relative inaction are much more tolerable when you’ve got a controller in your hands. I am all for TV and film embracing the excitement, spectacle and dynamism of video games, but do they have to embrace the unnecessary side-quests and open-world bloat, too?\n\nThe reciprocally influential relationship between games, TV and film has developed a lot in the last few years. A generation of gen X and elder-millennial gamers have recently aged into creative and commissioning power in these industries. That’s why we’re getting people such as Jonathan Nolan heading up an excellent Fallout TV show, and indeed why all video-game-to-screen adaptations have become dramatically less terrible in the past five years or so. It also inevitably means that the boundaries between interactive and non-interactive entertainment are becoming more porous: where previously game-makers were heavily influenced by film (primarily but not exclusively Alien/s and Star Wars), now that relationship works both ways. Most Marvel movies look and feel like a video game to me, and not just because they’re all full of computer-generated graphics. It’s the mood and pace of them.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow remains the most video-game-ish movie I’ve ever seen: its premise revolves around dying and respawning, trying out different things on each run. It’s a sci-fi roguelike of a film. I wanted to play Mad Max: Fury Road the entire time I was watching it, and John Wick 4 was literally a fighting-game boss rush. When film critics say that a film feels like a video game, they often mean it disparagingly; a lot of cinephiles still see games as the lower form. When I say a movie feels like a video game, it’s a compliment – unless it feels like a boring video game.\n\nThis was the problem, for me, with Stranger Things: every episode felt like loading up an open-world game that I hadn’t played for a few months. More and more characters kept appearing, and I didn’t remember or care who most of them were. Between the Upside Down, Vecna’s mindscape, real-world Hawkins and an entirely new dimension introduced in the last couple of episodes, there were too many locations to keep track of. Every episode brought on the mild despair I feel when I think I’m near the end of an overlong game, only to discover yet another entirely new area to explore. The painfully long epilogue, meanwhile, was rivalled only by Red Dead Redemption 2’s interminable post-game hours. Please, just let it end already!\n\nOf course, in modern pop culture, nothing is ever allowed to end properly, not if it’s still making money. I’m surprised there’s been no word of an official Stranger Things video game tie-in (outside of a retro-style smartphone beat-em-up from 2019). Come to think of it, we don’t see many of these kinds of licensed games any more: back in the 00s and 2010s, most major movies and TV shows launched with an interactive accompaniment. Presumably this is because of the spiralling cost of game development – you can’t knock out a mediocre PlayStation 2 game in nine months any more – but also, when TV shows feel so much like games, do we really need an adaptation anyway?\n\nThe first game I’ve finished in 2026 is Indika, a surreal and mildly horrible game about a young nun questioning her faith and having conversations with the devil as she goes on an extremely strange journey through bleak, snow-covered villages and abandoned factories with an escaped convict. There are much-needed flashes of humour in here, but also stuff about religion, control and sexuality that I haven’t seen in a video game before. It’s also part of a small wave of games (see Baby Steps) that mocks gamer mentality: there are points, but they are pointless; explore off the beaten path and you will find something useless and inconsequential rather than a secret or something fun. And that’s if you find anything at all.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch\n\n Estimated playtime: five hours\n\nDavid Rosen, the co-founder of Sega and an influential figure in the history of arcade video games, died on Christmas Day at 95. Keith Stuart writes about his very interesting life.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong has picked up a game-of-the-year trophy in PC games storefront Steam’s publicly voted awards. The Sit Back and Relax award was won by something I’ve never heard of: RV There Yet. I have bought it out of curiosity.\n\nMy book about Nintendo is out next month! It’s called Super Nintendo and it’s a lively cultural history of the most beloved company in games, based on 20 years of interviews (and 30 years as a player). You can support the Guardian by ordering it through the Guardian Bookshop, and I’ll also be doing launch events around the UK throughout February.\n\nThe 15 best PS5 games to play in 2026\n\n‘I wanted that Raiders of the Lost Ark excitement – you could die any minute’\n\nFrom K-pop and The Traitors to Grand Theft Auto VI: your A-Z of the biggest culture of 2026\n\nIn a recent Pushing Buttons, Keza mentioned that games have consolidated into five established mega-franchises and I was trying to work out which franchises these are? I guessed GTA, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft and EA FC, but don’t have huge confidence in that!\n\nYou’re not far off. According to data from Circana, the top five most played games on PlayStation 5 this year were exactly the same as last year: Fortnite, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto 5 (including Online), Roblox and Minecraft. All of these games are five to 10-plus years old. This stagnation at the top is why every big publisher has spent millions in the last decade trying to create live-service games, and why most of them have flopped. Last year on Steam, meanwhile, only 14% of all playtime was spent on new games released in 2025. Any developer releasing something new, be they blockbuster or indie, is competing for a sliver of a sliver of players’ time and money. These stats explain a lot about why the games industry is where it is right now, and why there’s such a bleak mood among many developers.",

    "fullText": "The Fallout episode this week also depicted an important event from a beloved DLC.\n\n on January 7, 2026 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week's episode of Fallout to follow.\n\nThis week’s episode of Fallout was an explosive one. Between Lucy (Ella Purnell) and Cooper (Walton Goggins) finally arriving in New Vegas, Maximus (Aaron Moten) causing conflict within the Brotherhood of Steel, and Vault 31 struggling to survive without their waterchip, there was no shortage of exciting events. With exciting events come easter eggs and deeper ties to the Fallout video games that are a treat for new and returning fans. Let's take a look at some of this week’s easter eggs as the show arrives in the City of Sin.\n\nThis week’s episode began with a pre-war flashback depicting Cooper fighting on the Alaskan front. In Fallout lore, Alaska was occupied by Communist Chinese forces and fought the United States over control of Anchorage. The liberation of Anchorage was most famously depicted in the Operation: Anchorage DLC for Fallout 3, which saw the player character entering a simulation to relive the historical battle.\n\nThe Alaska flashback also depicts the first time the United States deployed the T-45 power armor, which helped to aid their victory against the Chinese forces. Power armor ends up becoming the main tool of the Brotherhood of Steel after Roger Maxson left the United States army to form the organization, but longtime fans will also recognize the T-45 model of the armor as the centerpiece on the cover of the original 1997 Fallout game.\n\nWhen Lucy recovers we learn that she was being pumped up with Buffout, a chem from the video games that provides a boost to strength stats and is essentially a powerful, in-world steroid. Like many other chems in the games, Buffout becomes addictive after prolonged use and leads to negative stat effects unless the player keeps using it regularly or goes many in-game days without use. With no time on her side, Lucy has to keep using Buffout or face negative repercussions from her addiction.\n\nThroughout the episode--particularly whenever they run into trouble on The Strip--Cooper suggests that they take a detour to Freeside to either avoid combat or learn information. Players of Fallout: New Vegas will recognize Freeside as one of the last locations they can visit before they reach their destination of The Strip. Overrun by gangs such as The Kings (who appear in this episode as ghouls), Freeside is inspired by the real-life location of Fremont Street. The real world location is disconnected from the Las Vegas Strip and offers cheaper (and sometimes more rambunctious) entertainment options for travelers and tourists.\n\nWhile Lucy is high on Buffout and gets into a shootout with The Kings, her final kill is showcased with a slow motion gory headshot that is very cinematically pleasing. This shot replicates a critical headshot in V.A.T.S. from the Fallout video games. The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System allows players to slow down or freeze time to line up gory head and body shots and was introduced in Fallout 3 as a way of replicating the turn-based combat of the first two entries.\n\nThe credits of the episode depict an abandoned Camp McCarran inside a derelict Las Vegas International Airport. In Fallout: New Vegas Camp McCarran was the largest active military base of the New California Republic and served as the NCR’s stronghold in their activities against Caesar’s Legion. With the NCR all but non-existent in the Mojave Wasteland as of late, it’s not surprising to see Camp McCarran has met the fate it has.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "title": "CES 2026: This Lenovo Gaming Laptop Can Stretch From 16:9 to ‘Ultrawide’ With the Push of a Button",
    "description": "It's the best of both worlds.",
    "fullText": "Choosing a gaming monitor is a tough choice. Do you want a standard, 16:9 monitor that takes up a small amount of desk space, or a larger 21:9 or even 32:9 ultrawide monitor that takes up more space, but will also show you more of your game? This goes double for laptops, where ultrawide models are few-and-far between, and are absolutely gigantic. Lenovo's new concept for CES, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable, aims to give you the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen the laptop is closed, or when you first open it up, the Legion Pro Rollable looks like any other gaming laptop. It's a little thick, with RGB keys and a full numpad, but otherwise isn't notable. It's also got a bog standard, 16:9 aspect ratio. But with the press of a button, it can extend to a 21:9 ultrawide screen. And while it's not quite as fancy as the 32:9 screens the most spoiled gamers use, you can actually extend it further to a 24:9 screen if you want.\n\nThat trick is possible thanks to a rollable OLED panel, something Lenovo's shown off and even released before, but for laptops that extend vertically, and aren't meant for gamers. The transformation is quick and quiet, and Windows doesn't even need time to adjust to match your new aspect ratio. It kind of feels like you're unfurling a scroll.\n\nIn total, the screen space can extend from 16-inches in 16:9 (or \"Focus\") mode to 21-inches in 21:9 (or \"Tactical\") mode to 24-inches in 24:9 (or \"Arena\" mode). Aspect ratio numbers don't always match screen space measurements that neatly, but hey, they're easy to keep track of here.\n\nHaving up to 24 inches of screen space on-the-go could be a life changer, and not just for gamers. Currently, I'm writing this article while traveling, which means I'm stuck with just my laptop screen. I'm sorely missing the second monitor I have at home, and being able to swap my screen into an ultrawide mode could easily fix that issue. Plus, I could just shrink it back down to a more standard form factor when it comes time to pack it away.\n\nThe only real catches would be weight and price. I don't have specific numbers for how heavy this is, but it didn't feel too different from any other gaming laptop in my hands. Beefy, but not back-breaking.\n\nAs for price, here's the kicker. Because this is just a concept, there's no pricing or availability info, since it's not guaranteed to come out. Lenovo does say the unit I saw is based on a top-specced Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, though, which currently goes for around $3,000.\n\nThat would be a lot to pay, especially because the extending screen would probably add a couple hundred dollars to the price tag. I wouldn't put too much stock into the demo unit right now, though—if this does make it to market, you'll probably be able to configure it to better match your needs.\n\nPersonally, though, I might be willing to pay that $3,000. Not only is this truly unique in the space, but it also conveniently solves one of my biggest pain points when I have to use my laptop, which is the lack of a two-screen setup. It could even be useful for desktop gamers looking to make the transition to portable gaming—no more having to choose which type of monitor you want.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Lenovo's New 'AI Frame' Gaming Monitor Might Actually Just Be Cheating",
    "description": "Is it OK to use AI to zoom in on your reticle in a shooter?",
    "fullText": "It's easy to take this for granted, but not everyone is able to immediately look at a shooting or strategy game and find the reticle or map. Gaming UIs can get complicated, and for less-seasoned gamers, they can be pretty intimidating, too. Lenovo's new concept \"AI Frame\" monitor, shown off at CES 2026, aims to make some games a bit more approachable, although experts might consider it cheating.\n\nHardware-wise, this is a normal 21:9 ultrawide gaming monitor, but it's not actually meant to be used like that. Instead, you play your game in a left-justified 16:9 rectangle that takes up most of the screen, and in the remaining space, the AI will automatically zoom in on part of your gameplay and show a blown-up version of it. For instance, it might show you a zoomed-in map in a MOBA, so you don't have to look at the tiny mini-map in your main gameplay to know where you or your team are. Or, it might zoom in on your reticle in a shooter, letting you better see your targets. There's even enough space left over for you to pull up an internet browser and look up some help.\n\nIt worked pretty well for me in-person. Again, it doesn't actually generate any visuals, but instead just blows up the most important parts of your game screen so you can more easily glance at them or see them in more detail. That does mean resolution can suffer a little, but that's what your main gameplay screen is for. For getting across information, it's a good option.\n\nPlus, while some games will automatically know what to zoom in on, there's also a generic zoom mode that will just blow up whatever your mouse is hovering over, so it can work with any content. The AI Frame is being pitched for games, but you could also use it like a digital magnifying glass on an article in your browser, for instance.\n\nThe catch? It's maybe not exactly \"fair\" to play this way. While a bigger map in a MOBA might just save you some eyestrain, an AI-assisted zoom on a shooting reticle basically lets anyone act like a sniper, regardless of what character you're playing or gun you have equipped. For me, characters in the distance that were basically ants became immediately visible on the AI Frame, which made gunfights much easier to handle.\n\nI suppose we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The AI Frame is just a proof-of-concept for now, so there's no hard specs sheet or pricing or release date as of yet. But if this does ever actually make it to market, Lenovo might have to contend with companies like Valve. The developer has banned similar \"this is arguably cheating\" peripherals from its games before, and the AI Frame could be the next battlefront in an ongoing war between peripheral makers (who want to sell you on the idea that buying their products can make you a better player) and developers (who, at least theoretically, want all of their players to be on an even playing field).",

    "title": "CES 2026: I Tried a Gaming Headset That Can Read Your Mind",
    "description": "Lock in before you drop in.",
    "fullText": "Before this CES, I thought gaming headsets had gotten about as complex as they ever would. How many improvements can you possibly make on speakers and microphones? Well, forget all that. Apparently, the future of gaming headsets is mind reading.\n\nIn a private demo with a colleague from IGN, I tested out a collaboration between HP's HyperX gaming brand and brain-computer interface company Neurable. Neurable's been at CES before, but most of its work has been in the defense and enterprise sectors. The brand is specifically aimed at helping you nail down your focus, and now, Neurable thinks it can use that to help gamers.\n\nBefore trying on the Neurable x HyperX headset, I did a quick run-through in a target shooting game, where I shot down 30 targets with a 547ms response time. Then, I was guided through a focus program called Prime. This showed a cloud of dots on the screen, and I was told to do whatever I needed to do to focus up. I decided to stare into the distance and count, and in about 90 seconds, the dots had shrunken down into a small orb and I was \"primed.\" Neurable also suggested focusing techniques like repeating a word in your head over and over, or following one of the dots as it moved about the screen, but these didn't work for me.\n\nThen, I did the shooting test again. Theoretically, I should have been better, but I actually scored slightly worse this time—a 559ms response time. Still, that response time isn't terrible, and your mileage may vary. I might have already been locked in before priming. In contrast, my colleague actually reduced her response time by about 40ms after priming. If all of that optimization sounds really nitty-gritty, it is. This is aimed at esports players and streamers, where every millisecond counts.\n\nThat's probably where the headset's coolest feature comes in for me. Alongside Prime, Neurable and HyperX are also working on an overlay plugin for streamers that can show their focus levels on screen. You can display this as a speedometer, or as that cloud of dots, or even as a progress bar that shows whether you're \"on tilt\" or not. It should make for some pretty fun interactions with viewers, and play well with existing plug-ins, like eye trackers that show where a streamer is looking.\n\nPlus, my slightly worse response time after priming wasn't totally useless. Neurable said the headset could be used to help you \"practice choking,\" where you psych yourself up shortly after locking in and end up worse off. I thought that sounded like marketing spin, but my colleague, a high-level raider in World of Warcraft, said it would have real use for her.\n\nIt's still just a concept for now, but it's exciting to see this kind of tech getting ready to hit the mass market. What also sets Neurable apart is how portable it is. Unlike other brain-computer interfaces, this just looks like a normal headset, and all the contacts are just stored in the ear cups. There's no need for a giant helmet with discs and wires attached to it, thanks to Neurable's expertise in AI. The company says that using such a compact form factor does result in getting a small amount of data (and a lot of junk data, at that), but thanks to an on-device AI model, it's easily able to detect trends in your focus and translate them into something usable.\n\nThat seemed to be true in my demo, which at the end of the day, kind of felt like a guided meditation with real-time feedback. You could use this for more than gaming, but it's a clever use case for digital mind-reading, and the streaming plugins really take the cake, helping solidify the concept into a clear product with a concrete goal and target audience.\n\nIt'll take a while for the gaming version of Neurable's tech to be ready, although the company said it hopes to get it out this year. In the meantime, you can buy an ultra-luxury headset with Neurable's mind-reading built in, although it's currently on pre-order and will set you back $500. It also won't come with Prime or that streaming plugin, although because those are based in software, that could change in the future.",

    "title": "CES 2026: XREAL's New Gaming Glasses Put a Huge, Fast Gaming Monitor Right on Your Face",
    "description": "Asus and XREAL are working together to make the big screen better for gaming, and smaller than ever before.",
    "fullText": "I've been a fan of XREAL for a while, but outside of people who are really into AR, it's still a lesser-known company. Lifehacker has given XREAL's glasses stellar reviews before, but in the company's new collaboration with Asus, it's aiming to expand its market. The new ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses are the first XREAL glasses aimed specifically at gaming (though its other models aren't exactly bad for gaming), and they basically put the best gaming monitor you could ever want right in front of your face.\n\nYou wear these like a normal pair of sunglasses, and you get a massive 171-inch virtual TV floating in a black void right in front of you. It's an OLED, so there are crisp colors and high contrast, and the resolution is a respectable 1080p. Most importantly, the glasses max out at a 240Hz refresh rate, meaning they can display up to 240 frames per second.\n\nTaken all together, that's better than pretty much all of the full-size desktop monitors I have at home, but these are portable. They're barely heavier than my reading glasses, too, and you can set your virtual screen to either be anchored in one spot (meaning it won't follow your head) or stay in front of your eyes at all times. I prefer the former, since it shakes around less.\n\nI also didn't get any of the usual problems I have with AR or VR, like light bleed or fuzzy graphics. Aside from the black void, this really did feel like looking at a real-life screen. And you don't even have to use the full 171 inches, if you prefer something smaller.\n\nAside from the glasses, Asus is also shipping these with a dock, to help you better use them with your various devices. It has two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort connection, so you can have up to three devices ready to go at one time. It's probably the most realistic way to simulate gaming on a movie theater screen, and it's only set to improve down the line. Asus told me these glasses will eventually support XREAL's 2D-to-3D conversion tech, which just came out on the new XREAL 1S glasses and automatically converts any image to 3D. The effect uses AI to determine how to split the image between your eyes, but it was so convincing to me when I tried it with Mario Kart World that it felt like it was officially developed by Nintendo.\n\nAnd on that end, I have confirmation from XREAL that the ROG XREAL R1 glasses are compatible with the XREAL Neo mobile dock and battery pack. This is much more compact than the dock that comes with the headset, and, if you plug the glasses and the Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 into it at the same time, it will allow you to play your Nintendo console in AR. Even Asus' dock can't do that without another Switch dock acting as an intermediary first. Plus, this will charge whatever device you're playing at the same time.\n\nThe ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses will release later this year, although pricing isn't available quite yet. They're expected to release in the first half of this year.",

Whether you've been playing consistently since launch, or want to dive back in and see what your villagers have been up to over the past few years, you may be looking to make your grand entrance on a shiny new Switch 2.

That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts. If you haven't had a chance to pick up Hogwarts Legacy yet, it is available on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nHogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she was not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was one of the more important RPGs ever made due to its revolutionary open world map and quest design, two core pillars of Hogwarts Legacy. While you can still play the original, Oblivion Remastered is a better product in almost every single way. The 2006 masterpiece has been completely remastered, featuring overhauled graphics, character models, dialogue, and mechanics. The core game is still intact, though, as you start your adventure on an epic quest to uncover the mystery of why your emperor was murdered.\n\nAlong the way, you'll encounter five distinct guilds, each with its own questlines, several sprawling cities teeming with life, and an open world that features dozens of unique locations. Also, if you're a fan of the magical combat in Hogwarts Legacy, Oblivion Remastered lets you become a full-blown mage who can use a variety of different magic attacks. It doesn't officially support them, but a collection of Oblivion Remastered mods have also begun to pop up that can further improve the experience.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nImmortals Fenyx Rising is an action-adventure game in the mold of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that places a large emphasis on combat, but still has many qualities that appeal to Hogwarts Legacy fans. You'll get to explore the world right from the start of the game, and when you're not fighting enemies, you can solve a number of challenging puzzles that lead to rewards or other areas within the world. As for combat, you'll get to challenge mythological beasts such as Medusa as well as a plethora of other smaller enemies. The combat in Immortals Fenyx Rising is quite faster than in Hogwarts Legacy, but it's easy to pick up once you understand the controls.\n\nIf the lore and story were your favorite parts about Hogwarts Legacy, then why not hop over to another beloved pop culture franchise? Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an original story in the Star Wars universe that takes place between the events of the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy movies. It's a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but you don't need to play that game to understand what's happening in Survivor.\n\nThe game continues to follow protagonist Cal Kestis as he attempts to lead a rebellion against the Empire with a band of outlaws. Survivor sees you visit several planets that are somewhat open world and all have different enemies to face, puzzles to solve, and collectibles to find. As you progress, you'll unlock more attack types, including additional Force abilities and lightsaber forms. The combat in Survivor can be fairly difficult, especially against the late-game bosses, but you have plenty of tools at your disposal to take down enemies. For newer video game players, you can simply set the difficulty level to its lowest setting and take in one of the best Star Wars tales told in recent memory.\n\nLA Noire might not be the first game you think of when you think of Hogwarts Legacy. However, the two games have \n\nIf you enjoyed the outskirt areas of Hogwarts Legacy that extended beyond the castle grounds, then Ghost of Tsushima might be right up your alley. This open-world RPG is set in 13th-century Japan during the Mongol invasion and features extremely detailed and beautiful landscapes outside of the war-torn towns and fields. Ghost of Tsushima sees you play as a samurai who's trying to navigate the invasion and protect their island from the Mongols. When you're not actively doing story missions, you can explore a huge world filled with real-life locations that are still standing in Japan today. You'll come across your fair share of enemies while exploring, but the combat in Ghosts of Tsushima is beginner-friendly while still being difficult to master as you unlock more weapons and skills. A sequel, Ghost of Yotei, is on the way in 2025.\n\nThe Horizon series features perhaps the closest games to Hogwarts Legacy. The first game in the series is Horizon Zero Dawn, but you can also play its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, for an equally thrilling adventure. We recommend playing Zero Dawn first, though, as there's so much lore you need to understand before you can fully appreciate Forbidden West.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, you play as Aloy, an orphan born in the midst of a post-apocalyptic period in an alternate version of the United States in the 31st century. In this version of the US, man-made machines have taken over the planet, and tribes of hunter-gatherers and warriors try to survive without antagonizing them. Throughout Zero Dawn, you'll uncover the origins of Aloy's story, which is deeply entangled with how this future came to be and what happened to the humans before the machines took over. It's an epic adventure with a huge open world, combat centered around a bow and arrow, and plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe Dragon Age franchise is one that Hogwarts Legacy fans should find enjoyable. They're RPGs with an emphasis on narrative elements and exploration through a large, open world. There's also plenty of magic at play, both in combat and with basic mechanics. In The Veilguard, you play as Rook, who's tasked with stopping a pair of corrupt gods who have escaped their imprisonment. At the beginning of the game, you'll be by yourself, but over time, you can recruit a number of companions to join your party and fight alongside you for the duration of the adventure. Magic, an open world, and a mysterious story all make Dragon Age: The Veilguard an enticing option for any Hogwarts fan. You also don't have to play any of the original Dragon Age games to understand the story, so feel free to hop right in regardless of your experience.\n\nSpeaking of a franchise with some deep lore, the Marvel universe is a natural stepping stone for any Hogwarts Legacy player to dive into. While some fantastic Marvel games have been released in the past several years, Spider-Man was the game that marked Marvel's revival in the video game industry. This is an original story for the webbed hero that follows Peter Parker trying to navigate a day job while also being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The story starts off relatively slow, but develops into a thriller with all sorts of twists and turns.\n\nThe setting for Marvel's Spider-Man is an open-world New York City, and swinging through its skyscrapers or Central Park is one of the best feelings you can experience in a video game. The swinging mechanics along with the Arkham-style combat are thoroughly crisp, leading you to feel like you really are Spider-Man.\n\nIf puzzles were one of your favorite parts of Hogwarts Legacy, but you still want some exploration, then look no further than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Breath of the Wild is one of the most celebrated video games of all time, combining a staggeringly massive open world with fantastic puzzles that actually require you to use different parts of your console to solve. Some puzzles can simply be solved using the joysticks on your Switch, while others use the console's gyro controls and both Joy-Cons. The puzzles can be surprisingly difficult to get through, but they might not even be the hardest part of the game.\n\nInstead, the combat and gear degradation systems in Breath of the Wild will likely have you more challenged than the puzzles. Combat can be difficult if you run into a boss or enemy that outlevels you, but even easy fights have the potential to turn difficult if your favorite sword breaks from too much use. While all of this sounds overly challenging, Breath of the Wild allows you to play at your own pace, and players of all skill levels can pick it up and immediately enjoy what it has to offer. An enhanced Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and its excellent sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, are out now and boast some very nice upgrades.\n\nNow, your first thought when you see a game like Baldur's Gate 3 might be that you're not a fan of turn-based combat. After all, if you liked Hogwarts Legacy, going from fast-paced wand fights to slow, turn-based moves in every encounter could be jarring. However, if you can get past the shift to turn-based combat and really sink your teeth into Baldur's Gate 3, you'll discover why it's considered one of the best RPGs ever made.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is an epic tale of your character, who can either be a preset character or completely your design, trying to stop an alien force from taking over an entire continent's minds. The game isn't necessarily open world, as it features distinct zones that are a part of the different story acts, but the zones themselves are very large. Within these zones, you'll be able to pick up new party members, who you can completely control, go on winding side quests that feel like their own mini-story, and explore the beautiful and dangerous landscapes that make up each one of the maps. Baldur's Gate 3 also features cross-play and is fully co-op, so you can partake in the adventure with a friend or two.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed franchise is somewhat divisive, as many fans seem to either love or hate the different styles of games in the series. If you were to pick one to play to scratch your Hogwarts Legacy itch, though, make it Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in 400 BC Greece, Odyssey sees you take control of either a male or female protagonist who comes from humble beginnings. However, over the course of the game, you'll take part in a war between Athens and Sparta, command a ship across high seas, and explore perhaps the biggest open-world map on this list. The story in Odyssey has a few different branches that all clash by the end of the 50-hour-plus campaign, and it's one of the most memorable in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Hogwarts Legacy fans should find the combat easy to pick up, and exploration on a much larger scale than they find in the Wizarding World.\n\nFable III is one of the few games on this list that's somewhat difficult to play in 2025. However, if you're subscribed to Game Pass, then you shouldn't have any trouble on Xbox or PC. Fable III is the most recent game in the Fable series, but the next entry, currently known simply as Fable, is coming sometime in 2026. The Fable series is widely beloved in the gaming community thanks to the charm of its characters and gameplay. Fable III specifically sees you embark on a quest to take down an unruly leader and manage the kingdom for the people of your country.\n\nWhile the story in Fable III isn't especially long, it does offer you a plethora of choices to make that drastically impact how the narrative plays out. During your adventure in the main story, you'll come across a slew of combat engagements, which play out in real time and feature melee, ranged, and magic attacks. The combat can be a little clunky in Fable III, but the world and characters will keep you enthralled throughout the entire game.\n\nIf we're recommending games like Hogwarts Legacy, let's go with one of the only other Wizarding World titles on the market that's easily playable in 2025. Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 allows you to play through the first four years of the Harry Potter series as Harry himself. You'll get to explore a slimmed-down version of Hogwarts Castle and meet the cast of characters that you know and love. The game doesn't play out exactly like the movies or books, so there will be some different events that take place. Of course, you'll still get to partake in the classic Harry Potter events, such as playing Quidditch, sneaking around after dark, and even battling the Basilisk. Given the Lego nature of these games, they're meant to appeal to a more casual gaming audience, but any Harry Potter fan should find something to enjoy in Years 1-4.\n\nLife is Strange is strictly a game for Hogwarts Legacy players who value the story above anything else. Life is Strange doesn't feature any sort of combat or an open-world map to explore. Instead, the game takes place over a series of episodes that follow Max Caulfield, a high school senior who discovers that she can rewind time. Using this ability, Max tries to save her best friend, but altering the past can come with severe consequences. Your job is to find a way to navigate the pitfalls of time travel to try and get as happy an ending as possible. The story is gripping throughout every episode of Life is Strange, and there is some puzzle-solving along the way.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most well-reviewed games ever and easily a top 10 RPG of all time. If the lore and world of Hogwarts Legacy are something that appeals to you, there's arguably no better game to turn to than The Witcher 3. Don't be intimidated by the \"3\" in the title, as it helps to know the lore of the first two games, but it's not imperative whatsoever.\n\nThe Witcher 3 sees you take control of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter who possesses unnatural abilities and strengths. Geralt begins the game on the hunt for his adopted daughter, Ciri, as he's having dreams of an undead army called \"The Wild Hunt\" coming for him and Ciri. While this is the premise of the game, The Witcher 3 is so much more than its initial plotline. The game takes you across an incredibly detailed and large open world where quests and new locations are waiting around every corner. The Witcher 3 even features its own card-based minigame, Gwent, which is now a full-fledged game in its own right.\n\nThe Tomb Raider reboot in 2013 kicked off one of the best gaming trilogies of the modern era. Consisting of Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, these games are extremely well-done and provide you with a very similar experience to that of Hogwarts Legacy. You play as Lara Croft, a world explorer who comes from a wealthy family but finds herself constantly embroiled in some controversies with rival explorers. The Tomb Raider games offer fast-paced and stealthy combat, where you can use a variety of weapons, but you'll also be tasked with solving puzzles, or \"tombs,\" as you progress through the story. With a solid mix of combat, storytelling, and puzzles, you should find yourself right at home as a Hogwarts Legacy fan.\n\nIf you want to step into another established franchise with a cast of iconic characters and villains, then look no further than the Batman Arkham trilogy. Consisting of Batman Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, these games revolutionized an entire generation of action-adventure and RPG titles with their \"Arkham-style\" combat. Naturally, you play as Batman in these games, and each title offers a new story for the Caped Crusader. The stories often revolve around the villains of the game, and the second and third titles allow you to explore an open-world Gotham City. While there's crime around every corner in Gotham, there are also puzzles you can solve that are doled out by none other than The Riddler. There's a slice of gameplay for all Hogwarts Legacy fans, but the Arkham games lean more on the side of combat than puzzles.",

    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 3:02AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nThe MOBA genre is one of the most extensive and daunting in gaming, due to the high complexity of the strategic, competitive experiences. That said, if you want to know the best MOBA games worth playing right now, you are in the right place. MOBA games traditionally follow a lane structure with little minions that fight alongside the core heroes with unique powers, controlled by online players.\n\nThere is a little bit of something for everyone among the best MOBA games below. Even if you are a diehard existing MOBA fan with hundreds of hours in the top games in the genre like League of Legends, there’s likely something new to check out. And if you are a newcomer looking to get your feet wet, these best MOBA games are worth a try.\n\nWhen it comes to the premier MOBA experience for fans of both the casual and competitive levels, League of Legends is the go-to game. Free-to-play, like most of the games on this list, you have access to years and years of content, new characters, maps, changes, and balancing adjustments.\n\nThere is so much to League of Legends that it feels like a game you can play forever. Riot Games has fine tuned every aspect of the experience to a T, allowing every character to fill a distinct role in each of the five core roles. You won’t find a higher budget, more grandiose MOBA game out there. That said, this does mean it is quite daunting to get into for newcomers.\n\nDefense of the Ancients (DOTA) was the progenitor of the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena genre, and DOTA 2 is its successor. Still going strong since its release in 2013, this is some of Valve’s finest work. You are blessed with choice in DOTA 2, with more than 120 heroes and counting available to play as.\n\nYou won’t find that level of freedom and content in almost any other MOBA available. While considerably older than a lot of the games on this list, like most Valve experiences, it still holds up as well, if not better, than every other game in the MOBA genre. Better yet, competitive events like The International are massive celebratory events that are a blast to experience even for people that don’t play the game.\n\nTencent’s Honor of Kings (also known as Arena of Valor on some platforms like Nintendo Switch) is a solid attempt at a League of Legends-level game that works on a variety of platforms, including mobile phones. The intuitive controls ensure no platform feels bad to play on and that even includes controllers.\n\nIt is impressive how Honor of Kings is one of the most widely available MOBA games that has the traditional top-down, three-lane approach to the genre. Players who want something like LoL or DOTA 2 but in a more simplified manner should check out this experience. After all, each character, while unique, has only a handful of skills to use in combat.\n\nHonor of Kings is quite easy to get into and learn, but it has intense depth available for those who want to go beyond the casual unranked matches. Plus it has some surprising crossover characters like Batman and Superman.\n\nAn element of MOBAs that might be unappealing to some players is the top-down, more isometric-style perspective. If you are turned off by that viewpoint, Smite 2 is the game for you. The original Smite pulled the camera back behind the character for a more traditional third-person action-style experience.\n\nSmite 2, fully released for everyone in 2025, is essentially the original Smite but looking much better and being available on every modern console and PC. The best part is how approachable the experience is beyond just the more action-packed controls and perspective.\n\nYou can play with anyone on Smite 2 no matter the system via crossplay. In addition, you don’t have to worry about the sometimes terrifying MOBA elements like creating your character’s unique build and skill upgrades as you level up during a match, as there are automatic versions available. Smite 2 is simply one of the best ways to get into the MOBA genre.\n\nThe Pokemon Company’s own take on the MOBA genre is unlike anything else on this list. While it may look at a glance similar to other top-down titles, the gameplay is vastly different and takes full advantage of the Pokemon franchise. You pick between different Pokemon, each with their own role to play on the battlefield, and many of them even evolve as they level up in the match.\n\nA slow, tanky Defender like Snorlax feels radically different to a fast-moving Speedster like Zeraora. There are other parts of the franchise that find neat ways to implement themselves into the game, such as Trainer customization and the signature held items.\n\nThen there are the matches themselves. In most MOBAs, the objective is to advance across the map across various lanes to help your minions take over or destroy towers and eventually the enemy base. However, in Pokemon Unite, your objective is to score points at goals. This gives a fascinating sports take worth checking out.\n\nThere are more than 130 characters to choose from in the ever-growing Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. This wide variety is helped by some intriguing twists on the MOBA genre, such as hybrid characters. Sure, you have your typical roles like Assassin and Marksman, but some characters fit into both nicely.\n\nThis lets you have some freedom in deciding what type of playstyle you want to go for. Chances are you can think of a type of character and they exist in this free-to-play mobile adventure. It is a great option for Android and iOS users, too, offering a very clean UI that is not full of clutter and can be easily viewed even with smaller screens.\n\nThe Warcraft franchise is where the entire MOBA originated via the popular Defense of the Ancients mod, so it is only fitting that Blizzard has its own official take on the genre. Heroes of the Storm feels like a celebration of nearly every Blizzard franchise and game from World of Warcraft to Starcraft to Diablo.\n\nYou can play as famous characters like Kerrigan to Tyrael to even Diablo himself. Of course, this is all within the traditional MOBA setting of 5v5 lane battles with the usual class roles. Where Heroes of the Storm really stands out is in its beautifully diverse battleground maps that look great and the Talents system that feels more natural for customizing character builds compared to the usual items.\n\nSupervive is unlike any other MOBA out there. At a glance, it looks like your traditional colorful fantasy game in the veins of a standard top-down MOBA, but the gameplay is anything but that. It takes the ideas of MOBA gameplay and smashes them into the engaging battle royale cycle.\n\nTeams of three players compete using more than 20 varied characters to survive and take out the competition before it happens to them. This is quite different from the usual conquer-style objective and it works better than it should. Of course, if you want to play the usual arena-style MOBA experience with your favorite character, that is also available.\n\nRiot Games finally answered the requests of players to release League of Legends for other platforms with Wild Rift. Available on Android, iOS, and eventually consoles, this is the LoL experience but streamlined entirely for mobile and controller support.\n\nWhile Wild Rift is still behind its parent game in terms of content and characters, there are still more than 130 characters and counting to enjoy. Better yet, it doesn’t hold back from the unmatched depth of the PC version, instead tailoring the control scheme and performance to work on a multitude of devices and platforms.\n\nFor those who look at the original 2009 game and want to try it but don’t know where to start, the Wild Rift experience is a great way to get into LoL.\n\nDragon Ball has its own take on the MOBA genre with Gekishin Squadra. The name sure is a mouthful, but this is one of the most welcoming experiences for newer MOBA players, even if you aren’t too familiar with the Dragon Ball universe. But if you are an existing fan of the late Akira Toriyama’s masterful manga and anime series, you’ll be pleased with the wide selection of characters and abilities.\n\nThe likes of heroes like Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta are all here alongside the infamous villains of the series like Frieza and Cell. You make your way across a map from a top-down perspective to take down the enemy team’s God of Destruction and win the match.\n\nThe way Dragon Ball: Gekishin Squadra implements the iconic abilities like the Kamehameha is as flashy and exciting to use as it should be. This Dragon Ball MOBA is one of the funnest to play on this list, but there are some kinks in terms of performance and progression that hold it back some and will, hopefully, be resolved in time.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Intel's New Chips Are Coming For Your Gaming Handhelds",
    "description": "Intel's got a new integrated GPU, and is promising better battery life.",
    "fullText": "Every year at CES, Intel and AMD announce their newest processors. This year, Intel debuted its first line of chips made with its 18a process, which stands for 18 angstroms, or under 2nm. To make that a little less nerdy, that means these chips can fit a lot of tech into a small area, which means big gains in performance.\n\nColloquially called Panther Lake, the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips are focused on laptops and mini-PCs. But that doesn't mean they don't put out impressive numbers. During its keynote, Intel promised \"77% faster gaming performance,\" and for everyone actually using their PCs to do work, \"60% better multithread performance.\" Impressively, it also said its new chips would also enable \"up to 27 hours of battery life,\" rivaling Apple's M-series chips and other ARM chips from manufacturers like Qualcomm. Battery life has been a sore spot for both Intel and AMD for a while, and I'm excited to get my hands on machines that use Panther Lake processors.\n\nAnd then there's the AI. Intel says its top Intel Core Ultra Series 3 models have 50 NPU TOPs and 180 TOPS in total when you combine the NPU and GPU numbers. To translate, that basically means faster AI performance for developers who don't want to bother with the cloud, and would prefer the speed and privacy of a locally downloaded AI model.\n\nSpeaking of that GPU, Intel's upgraded its integrated graphics this generation to the Intel Arc B390, which has twice the cache of its prior GPU and 50% more cores. I already mentioned that 77% increase in gaming performance, but AI developers will also see a 53% increase in performance over Intel Core Ultra Series 2, and a two times performance increase over Intel Core Ultra Series 1.\n\nSo, better computers. That's pretty par for the course for CES, but there is a \"one more thing\" here. Intel is coming for AMD's dominance in handheld gaming PCs.\n\nUntil now, most handheld gaming PCs have used AMD chips, with those that have opted for Intel getting hit in reviews for buggy or poorly optimized performance. The Steam Deck uses an AMD chip, and so does the Xbox handheld. Intel says it's going to change that.\n\nAfter announcing the new integrated GPU and walking through features like frame generation and ray tracing, the company said it \"will be launching an entire handheld gaming platform with Panther Lake.\"\n\nThat means big moves, and soon—Panther Lake won't last long before getting replaced. The company didn't say much more, but it did show a slide with partners set to use Intel chips in their handhelds, including Acer, MSI, and hey, Microsoft. I guess we'll see another Xbox handheld model soon.\n\nAnd that's about it for Intel this year. The new chips are smaller, stronger, and more efficient, but smartly, the company is also planning to use them to shore up its weaknesses, specifically in gaming and battery life. That makes sense. With developers like Apple having famously ditched Intel throughout the decade, the company has been on the backfoot.\n\nAccording to Intel, the earliest machines powered by Intel Core Ultra Series 3 will start accepting pre-orders on January 6, with availability beginning on January 27.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Hisense Just Announced the RGB MiniLED Evo",
    "description": "The company also revealed that Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming to its TVs.",
    "fullText": "Hisense is all about TVs at this year's CES—specifically, how those TVs display color. If the company's keynote is any indication, Hisense is extremely invested in leading the charge in color reproduction. Though its tagline this year is \"Innovating a Brighter Life,\" the pitch is less on how bright their TVs are, and more on how true to life their colors are, especially when it comes to accurately displaying the filmmakers' original intent. Will consumers buy a TV because their favorite movie looks a bit more how the director intended it to be? I'm not sure. But that's largely the idea behind Hisense's new RGB MiniLED Evo.\n\nHisense's biggest announcement of the day is its RGB MiniLED Evo. This iteration of the company's RGB MiniLED technology comes with three key upgrades: First, there's the \"Chromagic\" precision backlight. The company says this technology helps avoid color bleeding and tint shifting when watching content. It also boosts the colors offered by existing RGB MiniLED technology: Hisense says this new standard can display 110% of the BT.2020 color gamut with four-primary colors (red, green, blue, and sky blue, or cyan), while RGB MiniLED can achieve 100% BT.2020 with the standard three primary colors. The company says Evo also comes with AI-powered RGB color dimming with \"134 bit precision.\"\n\nSecond, RGB MiniLED Evo has a \"Hi-View AI engine,\" to sync color across the TV's backlight. This engine comes with a three-core RISC CPU and a 2TOPS NPU for AI processing. Hisense claims the chip provides a 40% boost in computing performance, a 70% improvement in scenario recognition computing power, and 100% upgrade in scenario adaption computing capability. The company says the RGB MiniLED Evo can help display shows and movies as the original creators intended them to look. Hisense compared it to OLED, which it says displays content with too little brightness, and QD MiniLED, which it says compromises the color by being too bright.\n\nHisense's RGB MiniLED—not necessarily just Evo—also supposedly cuts down on blue light. Hisense says its new display tech emits 60% \"less harmful\" blue light than QD OLED, though the science doesn't necessarily support the claims that blue light is any worse for you than other light colors. The company also says RGB MiniLED is 30% more energy-efficient than QD OLED, though it didn't include any references to back up those claims in the keynote. Finally, Evo comes with an AI calibration feature, which Hisense touts as a way for users to turn their TVs into professional reference monitors.\n\nThe company says RGB MiniLED evo is coming to its product lineup, including the U8, UX, U9, and U7 series, this year.\n\nWhile the RGB MiniLED Evo was undoubtedly Hisense's biggest announcement this year, the company also ran through some other news at the keynote. First, there's the XR10, a new projector that can reach up to 300 inches. It comes with liquid cooling, lens shift supporting a 4K projection, and 6,000 lumens of brightness.\n\nThe company also announced the MXS MicroLED TV, which can scale up to 163 inches. Despite devoting only a moment to the TV, company says the MXS won an CES 2026 Innovation Award. Hisense also made some announcements about its TV OS, including features like weather, calendar, and integrations with other smart home devices. But perhaps most notably, Hisense announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring both Copilot and Xbox Cloud Gaming to its TVs. That's pretty big news.\n\nFinally, if you're both a Hisense and a FIFA fan, you can buy products from the \"Hisense Elite Collection,\" which are designed specifically for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. I'm not sure how big that crossover is, nor do I think I'd buy a TV because it was made for one soccer event, but it was part of Hisense's announcement.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Asus' New Gaming Laptop Looks Like a Gigantic Nintendo DS",
    "description": "The ROG Zephyrus Duo is back for 2026, with two full-sized screens.",
    "fullText": "CES is the time of year for weird computers, and Asus is bringing back an old fan favorite to help fill its unusual form factor quota. Gamers who miss the days of dual screens, get excited: the ROG Zephyrus Duo is returning for 2026, and it's bigger than ever.\n\nLooking a bit like a gigantic Nintendo DS, the new ROG Zephyrus Duo stacks two full-sized 3K OLED screens on top of each other, with a standard laptop hinge in between. It's a lot like the company's existing Zenbook Duo, but that one's geared more for productivity users—the Zephyrus Duo is fully specced out for gamers, with a 120Hz refresh rate on both screens, the latest Intel Core Ultra chips, up to an RTX 5090 laptop GPU, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. Plus, it supports 250W fast charging and can play games using up to 125W of power.\n\nThat's plenty for even the most demanding games, although its price is still an unknown for now. What we do know is how different this is from the last Zephyrus Duo, which came out in 2023. That laptop's lower screen was a simple small angled panel above the keyboard, instead of a full-sized display matching the upper one. It was great for displaying stats at a glance while playing, but not much else.\n\nInstead, the new Zephyrus Duo can display the same game across both screens, mirror them, or pull up reference material on one screen while you play on the other. It's also got a bunch of new ways you can use it: It comes with a detachable wireless keyboard, and you can either use it like a normal laptop with that keyboard covering one of the screens, or get creative.\n\nAn example photo from Asus show the laptop with one screen above the other, both screens in a side-to-side portrait mode, the whole laptop laid flat on a table (perhaps for head-to-head play), and tent mode. Tent mode is especially interesting—an Asus representative told journalists that gamers could play the same game against each other while sitting across from each other in tent mode, with each display acting as a private screen. He did acknowledge that this might impact performance and compatibility might differ based on game, but I could see it being an especially great option for, say, fighting games.\n\nAgain, this format has been used for non-gaming laptops before, but it's seemingly got a lot of potential for gamers, too. There's a reason one of Nintendo's most popular handhelds opted for a dual-screen setup. And hey, maybe you could even play some DS games made on this, too.\n\nThe new ROG Zephyrus Duo is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

    "fullText": "With the rise of streaming culture, a lot of gamers have started investing in computers that don't just play games well, but that look good while doing it. Asus's newest pre-built gaming desktop, the ROG G1000, is pretty by-the-book when it comes to high-end performance, but it's got one major selling point when it comes to those all-important gamer aesthetics: holograms.\n\nBuilt into this computer's front panel and one of its side panels, safely tucked into inaccessible glass windows, are rapidly rotating LED strips that, when in motion, create convincing full-color images that appear to have depth. The \"frame rate\" can be a little low, but it's a known technology that's all over the show floor at every CES now, and you can actually buy generic standalone hologram fans on Amazon for around $60-$100. It's just rare to see it integrated into something like a PC.\n\nThis hologram tech, called AniMe Holo, should make for a great way to show off on camera (or to your buddies in a college dorm) and Asus is promising some pretty expansive customizability. You can put still images and gifs on it, sure, but Asus also told journalists it can support full videos or mp4 files, without any limit on length. I think I'd try to use it to watch Shrek.\n\nThe effect comes across a bit better in-person, but it's still unusual enough to look enticing over video, even if you lose some of the depth. Unfortunately, still photos aren't really a great way to show this thing off, since they can't depict the rotating motion.\n\nAesthetics aside, the G1000 is also at the top of the power game, coming with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X 3D CPU, an RTX 5090 GPU, up to 128GB of RAM, and a 2TB storage. It's got bite to back up its bark, and will be able to play the latest games at max settings with no issue.\n\nOf course, specs like that are likely to cost you a pretty penny, especially with the hologram gimmick tossed on top of them. Asus hasn't tipped its hand on pricing yet, but the ROG G1000 is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",

    "fullText": "Fallout Season 2 Episode 3 brought back a familiar face.\n\n on January 2, 2026 at 7:17AM PST\n\nThis week’s Fallout episode traded in personal stories for status updates on fan-favorite factions from Fallout: New Vegas. While we briefly saw the Khans and primary followed the Brotherhood of Steel storyline, we finally got caught up with the NCR and Caesar’s Legion. With this expansion of the Mojave Wasteland, this episode had a healthy dose of easter eggs and callbacks for fans of the video games. Let’s take a look at what this week had to offer.\n\nThis week’s episode revealed the fate of Squire Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) and his new life as a ghoul. Instead of exploring the wasteland as part of the Brotherhood of Steel, he’s running a bottling plant that employs an army of abandoned children. The drink they’re bottling? Sunset Sarsaparilla, the most popular drink on the west coast in the Fallout games and a common consumable item in Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nWhen the Brotherhood of Steel are discussing their potential alliance to stand against The Commonwealth, Elder Cleric Quintus mentions a “an ordinary captain was sent to a research center in California” named Roger Maxson, a character Fallout fans should be extremely familiar with. While Maxson is never featured in a Fallout game, his story is told through holotapes that appear throughout Fallout, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 76.\n\nPaladin Xander (Kumail Nanjiani) suggests to Maximus (Aaron Moten) that a conflict could send the entire Brotherhood of Steel into chaos. He tells of a time when the Brotherhood was nearly destroyed because of internal strife in the Capital Wasteland. Fans of Fallout 3 will be familiar with this conflict as the time a group of BoS members formed a splinter faction called the Brotherhood Outcasts when they opposed Elder Lyons’ views. This was one of the central conflicts of that game, and we could potentially see a repeat event happen in the Mojave.\n\nThough set in the same universe as the video games, Fallout has had very little crossover when it comes to characters (Mr. House not withstanding). This week’s episode bucked this trend by bringing back a familiar face in the form of Victor the sheriff securitron. Those who played Fallout: New Vegas will recognize him as the friendly face that saved the courier and served as sheriff of Goodsprings (though he had other motives as revealed later on).\n\nThough Fallout is no stranger to including the artillery from the video games, this week’s episode featured one of the more iconic weapons. When Xander and Maximus are surveying the Mojave they decide to go after hunt rogue securitrons in the area. Though they have the standard issue rifles, Xander brings along a Super Sledge, a powered up melee weapon that's the first choice of super mutants everywhere.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Now, though, fresh leaks suggest that things are only going to get worse in 2026. According to Korean publication, Newsis, both AMD and NVIDIA are planning to gradually and permanently increase GPU prices \"over the next several months.\" This is expected to start as early as January 2026, when AMD is expected to increase prices. NVIDIA will allegedly follow suit in February. \n\nIf the publication's insider sources are correct, the NVIDIA RTX 5090, which launched at $1,999, will reach as high as $5,000 before the end of the year. No prediction has been made for AMD's RX 9000 series, but memory has already been said to take up as much as 80% of the average GPU BOM cost, and memory prices are expected to increase by as much as 40% by Q2 2026. We've already reported on the fact that instability and price increases in the DRAM market will likely affect launch windows for upcoming hardware, potentially reaching as far as next-gen console launches, and ASUS recently announced that it would be increasing hardware prices starting in early January 2026, despite also increasing DDR4 motherboard production in response to the changing market.",

    "fullText": "At CES 2025, NVIDIA spent the bulk of its presentation touting (what else) its leading position in the artificial intelligence arena. But it also spent time talking up new hardware, including its RTX 5000-series GPUs and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed Spark). This year, the company's website says it's \"lighting up CES 2026 with the power of AI.\" To that end, NVIDIA is pulling out all the stops at its Vegas installation, promising hands-on demos in its booth at the Fontainebleau, replete with the \"latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.\"\n\nBut don't worry if you're not on the ground in Vegas. Here's how you can watch the livestream of the company's January 5 press conference, and what to expect from NVIDIA at CES this year.\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on January 5 at 4PM ET via NVIDIA's website (and likely on YouTube as well). We'll embed the link here once it's available.\n\nNVIDIA's game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including \"cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.\" It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we're unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.\n\nGiven NVIDIA's sky-high valuation and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers – largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang's remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company's Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA's partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang's presentation.",

Isabelle and villagers gather in the square, music ramps up as midnight approaches, and fireworks cap off the celebration.\n\nBecause islands are persistent social spaces, players can invite friends over to experience the countdown together. Everyone can dress for the occasion, emote, exchange gifts, and wander the island after midnight. It feels less like a mini game and more like a shared holiday ritual, which is why it remains the gold standard for virtual New Year’s parties.\n\nWe have Mario Kart World listed here, but nearly any Mario Kart game will work. The series is known for gorgeous tracks that feature stunning visual effects, many of which are fireworks that would fit in on any New Year's Eve parade or celebration.\n\nHop online, hit up a few tracks, and if you're up for it--setup a race along one of those courses that feature fireworks just as the countdown triggers. We're talking Crown City or several iterations of Rainbow Road, among others.\n\nMario Kart World does offer custom lobbies that make it easy to connect with friends, but you can also tout Mario Kart out as part of any in-person New Year's Eve party too!\n\nWhile Epic Games has been known to feature fireworks in live battle royale lobbies near the end of the year, the real party kicks off in Fortnite Creative. Here you can find player-made game modes that let you play your own way--including custom trivia night mods, prop hunt, and party royale-like modes.\n\nOf course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with hopping from the battle bus together as the remaining hours in the year grow fewer and fewer. WinterFest takes place in Fortnite around the end of December each year, giving the island a snowy backdrop as you fight for your life.\n\nWarzone doesn't have the flexibility of something like Fortnite Creative, but its high-octane action makes for some scenes that feel like a New Year's Eve fireworks show. Blowing up helicopters out of the sky or sending trucks off the ground with explosives are little milestones on the way to battle royale victory.\n\nWarzone has become more popular than traditional Call of Duty--and for good reason. Battle royale brings the survival element of war that no other Call of Duty has before. Doing so, with friends, at the end of the year is a blast.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV excels at player-driven celebrations. Housing districts, Free Company estates, and public hubs often host New Year’s countdowns organized by the community. Players dress up, set off fireworks, and gather around stages while DJs stream music externally.\n\nThe game’s strength is how social it feels even without official events. Emotes, glamour, and roleplay-friendly systems allow players to turn the night into a true virtual party. It feels communal, intentional, and uniquely festive.\n\nGTA Online offers endless locations for hosting a New Year’s party, from penthouses and yachts to nightclubs and rooftops. Fireworks launchers, champagne animations, and curated music help sell the celebration without much effort.\n\nPrivate sessions make it easy to turn chaos into a controlled party environment. Friends can dress up, take screenshots, and roam Los Santos together at midnight, blending sandbox freedom with a party atmosphere.\n\nMinecraft is a blank canvas for New Year’s parties. Players can build stages, countdown clocks, and massive firework rigs, then invite friends to explore and celebrate together. Redstone allows for surprisingly elaborate countdown mechanics.\n\nBecause it is player-driven, each party feels personal. Whether it is a cozy survival world or a creative server spectacle, Minecraft lets groups define what celebration looks like.\n\nRoblox thrives on social experiences, many of which are designed specifically for events. Player-creators and professionals regularly create countdown rooms, concert spaces, and dance clubs perfect for New Year’s Eve gatherings.\n\nIts accessibility makes it easy to invite large groups, even casual players. Jumping between games keeps the party moving, while social hubs provide a place to gather at midnight.\n\nFall Guys feels like a party game by design, with colorful characters and short, high-energy rounds. Friends can queue together and treat matches as playful chaos while chatting through the countdown. The lack of downtime makes it ideal for New Year’s Eve. It keeps energy high without demanding focus, letting players celebrate and laugh together.\n\nSome minigames offer the perfect backdrop for a New Year's Eve gathering, including Short Circuit and Hex-A-Terrestrial, complete with a night sky and bright lights to get you in the festive mood.\n\nNo Man’s Sky offers a surprisingly calm party atmosphere. The Nexus serves as a shared social hub, while player-built bases can become private celebration spaces complete with fireworks and emotes. The game works well for laid-back New Year’s parties. Players can explore, take group photos, and ring in the new year against alien skies.\n\nSea of Thieves turns New Year’s Eve into a pirate celebration. Crews can sail together, play shanties, drink grog, and fire cannons into the sky at midnight. The trick shots people have been able to pull off by launching themselves out of cannons, across the sea, and onto other ships are nothing short of incredible. Drunken-madness induced incredible, though.\n\nSea of Thieves adventures are less about competition or loot and more about the shared memorable moments created. Even just sailing under the stars can make for a wonderful way to ring in the new year.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic leans into rowdy celebration through its Space Rig hub. Players can dance, drink at the bar, and trigger music before or after missions, making it a natural gathering spot. Honestly, the Overwatch-like mining adventure is a blast, but sometimes you don't even need to jump into the action to have a good time.\n\nA New Year’s party here feels communal and silly. It is perfect for smaller groups that want something social without leaving co-op gameplay behind.",

You must carefully place climber Aava’s hands and feet to make your way up a forbidding mountain, camping on ledges and bandaging her fingers as you go. Like real climbing, it is challenging and somewhat brutal. \n\n PC, PlayStation 5; 29 January\n\nA two-player animated horror game in the Tim Burton mode, minus all the whimsy. In a setup reminiscent of the famously discomfiting games Limbo and Inside, a brother and sister must escape a twisted mockery of their home town, finding their friends as they go. They are stalked by horrible spike-limbed monsters and grotesquely reanimated creatures. Genuinely frightening and artistically impressive. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation5, Xbox; 13 February\n\nCapcom’s horror series is very old, but it still comes up with new ways to make your skin crawl. In Requiem we play as bookish Grace, whom the game’s director calls “the biggest scaredy-cat in Resident Evil history”, and the confidently combat-proficient cop Leon S Kennedy, pursued by monsters through the iconic Raccoon City. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; 27 February\n\nImagine dropping Pokémon into the world of Animal Crossing, with a hint of Minecraft’s blocky aesthetic. This family-friendly Nintendo game has you building and tending habitats for Nintendo’s beloved creatures. You play as a Ditto, the shape-shifting pink blob, which can helpfully transform into other Pokémon, using those other critters’ abilities to bring a barren landscape back to life and build a vibrant town. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, 5 March\n\nThe most anticipated James Bond game since the Nintendo 64’s GoldenEye 007. Made by IO Interactive, famous for Hitman, it stars a younger, twentysomething Bond who has not yet earned his 007 status, and hopes to blend the expected car chases, shootouts and gadgets with some genuine spycraft, as Bond infiltrates parties and digs for information. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; 27 May\n\nFrom the Finnish developer behind Returnal, the exceptional, intelligent time-loop sci-fi shooter, this mysterious action game stars another stranded astronaut on a different hostile planet, one where a dying sun is sending its creatures and colonists mad. Long-time gamers will recognise the lineage of arcade bullet-hell shooters in this very modern action game. \n\n PlayStation 5; 30 April\n\nIt has been in development for more than a decade and, despite several delays (GTA VI was on this very list last year), expectations have never been higher for the biggest game in the world. It’s a crime story and a love story, featuring the series’ first female protagonist, Lucia, and her boyfriend, Jason, and set in Rockstar’s fictional Floridian state of Leonida. There has been so much to satirise about contemporary America since 2013’s GTA V that Rockstar’s writers will surely have been spoilt for choice. \n\n PlayStation 5, Xbox; 19 November\n\nThe modern Spider-Man games have gone down a storm, so it’s no surprise that developer Insomniac is now turning its attention to a different Marvel hero. This new game features an ensemble X-Men cast and a whole lot of gratuitous comic-book violence, as Wolverine sticks those adamantium claws through a succession of foes trying to chase him down. \n\n PlayStation 5; date TBC\n\nLooking for an alternative to established wizarding-school fiction? Witchbrook is a charming pixel-art slice-of-life game about a witches’ college. In school you learn spells and broom flight; outside school you involve yourself in the life of the whimsical town outside. It supports four players at once, too. \n\n PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; TBC",

    "title": "Chinese billionaire who has fathered more than 100 children hopes to have dozens of U.S.-born boys to one day take over his business",
    "description": "Xu Bo, the founder of one of China’s largest mobile gaming companies, is looking to have “50 high-quality sons” in the U.S. to take over his billion-dollar empire.",
    "fullText": "Billionaires like Telegram founder Pavel Durov and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have fathered legions of children who are slated to inherit their empires. Now, an ultra-wealthy Chinese businessman is doing the same in the U.S., in hopes of producing around 20 U.S.-born children to inherit his video game fortune.\n\nXu Bo is the founder and chairman of Guangzhou Duoyi Network: one of China’s largest mobile gaming companies. Despite the 48-year-old entrepreneur growing his company in Guangzhou, he’s not looking to pass down his $1.1 billion fortune to a child born in his home country. A Wall Street Journal investigation into Xu’s surrogacy history in the U.S. found that the Chinese billionaire was seeking parental rights to at least four unborn children, and had previously fathered and was actively fathering at least eight more surrogacy kids. There could be dozens more.\n\nThe billionaire’s video game company had also reportedly stated that Xu has more than 100 children born through surrogates based in the U.S., according to WSJ reporting. He was allegedly seeking “50 high-quality sons,” according to accounts linked to Xu on Chinese microblogging website Weibo, and said that “having more children can solve all problems.” During a 2023 court hearing, Xu also said he hoped to have around 20 U.S.-born children to one day take over his business, according to WSJ. He also fantasized about his American kids marrying Musk’s children in the future. Last month, Xu’s ex-girlfriend also alleged that he had 300 children living around the world—a claim his company denied.\n\nXu’s Duoyi Network has since made a statement against the Journal, stating the publication had “deliberately confused the facts and fabricated false information,” and that only 12 of the alleged 100-plus children were born in the U.S.\n\nXu is among a growing number of ultra-rich men parenting dozens of children to shepherd their companies and expand their legacies. And just like Xu, the video game billionaire, Telegram founder Pavel Durvo has helped conceive over 100 babies across 12 countries.\n\nOfficially, the entrepreneur worth $14.2 billion has six “official” children with three different partners. In addition to this parentage, Durov has also been donating to a sperm clinic for the past 15 years, which told him has led to more than 100 pregnancies.\n\n“I wrote my will very recently,” Durov told French publication Le Point in an interview this June. “I make no difference between my children: There are those who were conceived naturally and those who come from my sperm donations. They are all my children and will all have the same rights! I don’t want them to tear each other apart after my death.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Let the ceremony begin …\n• The 20 best video games of 2025\nSo, how was 2025 for your household? Was it really all as good as you pretended it was on Facebook?",
    "fullText": "There was no shortage of fun and video games in the Diamond household in the last 12 months. Which ones did we play so much our thumbs hurt? And which one saved my soul? Let the ceremony begin …\n\n The 20 best video games of 2025\n\nSo, how was 2025 for your household? Was it really all as good as you pretended it was on Facebook? Full of A-grades for the kids and riotous themed fancy dress birthday parties for the grownups? Or was it a sea of disappointment with only occasional fun flotsam? And was any of it actually real, or are we all now seven-fingered AI slop beings with Sydney Sweeney’s teeth?\n\nI have gathered my thoughts (and the Diamond household) together, whether they wanted to or not, to reflect on the most important thing in any given year: which video games we enjoyed the most. Without further ado:\n\nGame eldest daughter played the most: Just Dance 2024/Horizon Zero Dawn/Pikmin\n\nOn her phone, meanwhile, she’s been playing Cityscapes and “trying to find decent healthcare”.\n\nGame middle son played the most: Overwatch\n“I don’t play games on my phone.” He was offended that I even asked him that question. I respect that.\n\nGame youngest daughter played the most: Resident Evil Biohazard\nShe is trying to get into theatre school, but when she wasn’t singing, she was playing Resident Evil. She also went on in great detail about her achievements on The Sims, where the Shark has a thriving utopia with infinitely better healthcare than her big sister has in real life.\n\nGame the wife played the most: Crash Bandicoot: It’s About Time\nShe started the year at 60% completion and ended it at 82%. It’s a marathon not a sprint for her. On her phone: something called Woodle, where you have to unscrew pins.\n\nGame I laughed at my kids for still playing: Minecraft\nAny time I see my 21-year-old son playing Minecraft, I set about him like a cross between Steve Martin with that guy in the pub in Roxanne, and Joe Pesci with Spider in Goodfellas. When he complains, I reply that I am doing this to toughen him up so he can be a man and play games for grownups. It’s a very Scottish father/son relationship.\n\nMost impressive gaming family member 2025: Eldest daughter on Just Dance 2024\nThere was no contest for this one. She is a machine. Even better than I was at the Cure’s Lovecats on Dancing Stage MegaMix in my prime.\n\nGame I played the most: Marvel Snap\nNothing came close to the hours I spent on this insanely well-crafted deck building wizard’s poker, with its constantly evolving range of cards and game variations.\n\nGame I wish I had played less: Marvel Snap\nThe worst thing about games that constantly evolve their range of cards and variations is you wake up one day and realise it is all just an attempt to suck you into fomo-fuelled microtransactions. So love turned to hate halfway through the year and it went into the bin.\n\nGame I wish I had played more: Doom: The Dark Ages\nGlorious reinvention of a classic. Immersive atmosphere from the off. I wish I could eviscerate my demons so effectively in real life.\n\nGame I wish I had played more (cerebral edition): Blue Prince\nI refuse to rush this beautiful, unique game and I just didn’t have the time or headspace to give it what it deserved earlier this year. My mother is staying with us over Christmas and the New Year, so I will be playing this in the wee small hours after I have prosecco’d her into oblivion.\n\nGame that saved my soul when I needed It: Balatro\nI know Balatro was 2024’s breakout game, but I was late to it. And it is remarkable. It just gets every single thing right. Crazy Poker is a wonderful concept, but the powers behind the different joker cards are so imaginative it has become a game I literally would play any time of the day or night. Throw in the wittiness of the card design, and this is an absolute high-water mark of gaming. I dream of being stuck in a broken-down lift for hours just so I have nothing to do but play it.\n\nGame I got the most criticism for criticising: Outer Worlds 2\nI experienced a minor pile-on when I wrote about how the Paintress boss battle bug in Clair Obscur ruined the whole game for me, but it’s still a gargantuan gaming achievement in terms of art, sound, acting, battle gameplay and ambition – which I appreciated even more after slogging through Outer Worlds 2. So thank you to the reader who took the time to email me personally, through my website, to say that my Outer Worlds 2 review was “bitter, confused resentment because YOU DON’T GET THE GAME OLD MAN and your son is an idiot as well sorry to inform you.” I present that in the exact way it was written, because I appreciate the effort, and he is obviously an excellent judge of character where my son is concerned.\n\nGame everybody loved that I just didn’t get: Hollow Knight: Silksong\nSure. Give me a bastard-hard Metroidvania-esque thing and don’t tell me what I am supposed to be doing, except “explore”. Great fun. I get that it looks ace and is perfection if you are into this kind of thing, but I cannot think of a gaming experience I want less of in my mid-fifties. I was around back when all games were like this, and I’ve had enough. It was fine when I was a kid, but so was polyester.\n\nBiggest gaming scandal of 2025: Toss-up between EA getting in bed with Jared Kushner and the Saudis, and Outer Worlds 2 costing £70. Both morally indefensible and repugnant.\n\nGames I would name my children after, if I was ever stupid enough to have more: Clair Obscur, Despelote and Bananza would all sound good bellowed from the doorstep at tea time.\n\nPart of my body that aches most from gaming: Right thumb joint. Seriously. I don’t know if it’s because of video games or doomscrolling on my phone, but it burns like the mines of sulphur in the mornings now. I knew I should have got my thumbs insured back in the 90s.\n\nGame I am looking forward to the most in 2026: GTA 6. \n\n And it will come out in 2026, even if we have to make 2026 last until the heat death of the universe.\n\nGame I am looking forward to the most in 2036: The Witcher 4.",

Here are the best games you weren’t playing this year\n\n The 20 best video games of 2025\n\n More on the best culture of 2025\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nHave you ever wanted to romance your record player? Date Everything! offers players the chance to develop relationships with everyday objects around your house, in a fully voiced sandbox romp featuring over 100 anthropomorphised characters. Wonderfully meta; you can put the moves on the textbox, or even “Michael Transaction” (microtransaction – get it?) himself. Meghan Ellis\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nA raucous debut by indie studio à la mode games, Sorry We’re Closed is a survival horror where the monster is love and the dungeon is a dingy London neighbourhood. Fight demons, fend off unwanted admirers and survive work shifts in this queer, neon homage to 1990s PlayStation-era horror. ME\n\nWeb browser\nThe trick of this daily logic puzzle is that you can’t guess, or make wrong answers. Presented with a grid of characters, you must identify the “innocent” and the “criminal” based on clues revealed with each correct answer. But the game will only accept an answer if it’s sure you know it for a fact. An idealistic vision of a criminal justice system. Duncan Fyfe\n\nSwitch, Playdate, PC\nBlippo+ is a channel surfing simulator that rides the line between video game and absurd cable subscription service. Experienced entirely by trawling through the interface of a virtual TV guide, you can tune into intergalactic music videos, curious cooking shows, and psychic weather reports, learning an alien culture through charming live-action skits that evoke the sketch comedy of Tim and Eric. Sarah Thwaites\n\nSwitch, PC\nA sequel in all but name to Love-de-Lic’s 1997 role-playing game satire Moon, Stray Children is a monster-taming adventure where you whisper away the worries of troubled “Olders” that have come to dominate the inhabitants of an unfinished video game. Finessed by a crunchy pixel art style and a combat system inspired by Undertale, this nostalgic odyssey will pull on your heartstrings while testing your reflexes at the same time. ST\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nA fiendish, almost cruelly addictive mashup of Vampire Survivors-esque monster horde control and Breakout-style ball-bouncing. Descend into a pit full of demons and shoot a continuous stream of richocheting, burning, poisonous and otherwise deadly balls at them until the screen is just a brain-melting confusion of visual effects. Keza MacDonald\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nYou are a cheerful pubescent boy with a unique problem: your arms are stuck out in a T-pose. How do you navigate school, family, friendships and brushing your teeth when you can’t bend your arms? A sweet, family friendly slice-of-life physical comedy game with an unexpectedly affecting message, and excellent songs sung by a gourmand giraffe. KM\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nJust a chill bike-racing game where your ride is possessed by an ancient speed spirit. Wheel around a soothingly minimalist island of cycling obsessives, picking up new swappable bike parts and blasting past local gangs of racers on downhill courses. Uncomplicated, good looking and thoughtfully put together. KM\n\nPC\nPowerhoof’s excellent pixelated point-and-click game teases its dystopian plot throughout, mixing influences such as The Thing, Michael Crichton’s Coma and Total Recall. It’s an intriguing mix: combined with a heartfelt story full of painful human emotions and some fantastic audio, it’s a tense yet warming tale, guaranteed to coil its way around your heart. Graeme Mason\n\nXbox, PC\nWhile the combat mechanics are familiar, it’s South of Midnight’s evocative backdrop that marks it apart. Set in an overgrown and misty American deep south, it stars Hazel, a young woman thrust into the aftermath of a hurricane and forced to battle the evil manifestations of deep-rooted sorrows. Beautiful and engaging, its soundtrack is also wonderful, perfectly complementing the uncanny scenery. GM\n\nPC\nYour task is simple in the brilliantly silly Skin Deep: save a bunch of talking cats from marauding space pirates. The execution is anything but as you crouch in vents, pull glass from your feet, and deploy sneezing powder and slippery soap bars to incapacitate your foes. Like Metal Gear Solid meets a Looney Tunes cartoon, the pleasure here lies in pushing the game’s miniature sandboxes to their slapstick limit. Lewis Gordon\n\nPS5, PC\nCasting you as a knight with a hoverboard, Sword of the Sea is a mystical journey through a desert which roils like an ocean. You pull grab tricks and get big air on cresting dunes, but the greater enjoyment stems from simply soaking up the game’s breathtaking, nature-infused landscapes at high speed. A gorgeously dreamy, new age take on extreme sport. LG\n\nPC\nIf ancestry.com has yet to reveal your hidden royal lineage, try digging into the Roottree clan instead. Armed with a 1998 web browser, you have to deduce the loves, losses and lies of a sprawling candy dynasty (no relation to Rowntree). A compelling blend of Her Story and Who Do You Think You Are? Matthew Castle\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nShakespearean dialogue, bruising boss battles and a tale steeped in class struggle make this a refreshingly different Final Fantasy. As you command a troupe of society’s most downtrodden, excellent voice acting lends this once silent PlayStation 1 game new life. As rewarding to play as it is affecting, in 2025, Yasumi Matsuno’s tale of inequality and division has never felt more relevant. Tom Regan\n\nPS4/5, Switch, PC\nCombining the best parts of Hades with the immediacy of Streets of Rage, this colourful co-operative caper is an endless delight. As you roam Talamh’s lived-in fantasy world, this roguelike rewards you with satisfying new powers and beguiling side quests. With precise combat and varied movesets, Absolum adds some much-needed depth to the oft shallow beat ’em up genre. A co-op classic. TR\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nIf the prospect of a disgraced mobster tooling around small-town Japan accompanied by a giant depraved thumb doesn’t intrigue you, keep moving. But give Promise Mascot Agency some time and you’ll discover this compact open-world adventure is filled with chaotic charm. At its heart it’s a story of redemption, as you manage a gang of weirdo mascots and restore a dilapidated community, all while driving the best pickup truck in any video game. Christian Donlan\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nHere’s a fantasy role-playing game that’s happy to embrace elemental powers, even if it leads to pinwheeling chaos. In a world where fire attacks can spread uncontrollably and ice can lead to giant dragons dropping out of the sky as their wings freeze up, this colourful piece of whimsy offers fun that genuinely scales to your own imagination. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nMatt Newell’s hymn to photography is also a gorgeous investigation into the creative power of solitude and of paying attention to your surroundings. Learn your way around a beautifully simulated digital camera, but also explore the visual potential of a range of exquisitely crafted 3D landscapes. There are no puzzles and not much in the way of scoring, just you and your ever-developing eye. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nA football game that’s closer to the likes of Rocket League than it is Fifa, Rematch has you feeling as if you’re playing an actual match of five-a-side: developer Sloclap have utterly mastered the sensation and pace of charging up a field and passing between your mates before knocking the ball into the back of the net. Daniella Lucas\n\nPS5, PC\nProof that love and hate can be two sides of the same coin, this ridiculous adventure has you taking control of a grown man in a onesie trying to remember how to walk. You have to separately control each of your legs over a series of obstacles that lead to some absurdly funny moments, but equally has you kneeling in despair as you fall, yet again, off a wooden plank while trying to get a stupid hat. Worth it though. DL\n\nSwitch, PC\nA game all about slowing life down, While Waiting takes mundane situations – from breaking down in your car to waiting for a delayed train – and gives you multiple choices on how to handle them. Due to the way it rewards experimentation, and squeezing the fun out of everyday moments, While Waiting has taught me how to be more patient – and that wasting time by fiddling around with things is the key to a healthy life-balance. Thomas Hobbs\n\nSwitch, PC\nOne for the Halloween-loving girlies and ghoulies, this companion to Strange Horticulture has you dealing in occult objects rather than plants. Explore gothic Cumbrian locales to find artefacts, identify them via vague tomes, solve puzzles and occasionally divert the plot by giving a customer something other than what they wanted. Jordan Erica Webber\n\nSwitch, PC\nDeveloper Wadjet Eye keeps the point-and-click adventure genre alive in an apt tale of time-travelling tourism. As punters pay to revisit lost loves and settle scores, it’s your job to protect the timeline. From a timeloop farce to an urgent visit to pre-9/11 New York, Old Skies unfolds like a short story anthology. A surprise on every page. MC\n\nSwitch, PC, iOS, Android\nSudoku meets speed dating. This charming puzzle game sees you play matchmaker via seating plans, seating cute little characters together based on their hilarious pet peeves and preferences in a host of fun settings. Its puzzles are cosy, relaxing and never frustrating. Bex April May\n\nPC\nWhat if your friendly neighbourhood turned into a waking nightmare? That’s the premise of this RPG-style survival horror set in an apartment complex where unspeakable horrors are going on right outside your window – but whatever you do, you mustn’t look at them, or you risk mutating like your poor, revolting neighbours. Best enjoyed with the curtains drawn. BAM\n\nPS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nFrom its tongue-in-cheek writing to its ridiculous creatures, Toby Fox’s episodic role-playing game is charming and witty. Like Undertale before it, Deltarune flips the genre on its head with humour and heart, leaving you itching for more. (The game’s next chapter isn’t until the second half of 2026 at the earliest.) We dare you not to crack a smile at this one. Vic Hood\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nThis psychological horror immediately tells you what to expect: “This is a story about death.” As Sam, you attempt to escape your home, an increasingly twisted labyrinth of puzzles and memories. Channelling the unsettling atmosphere of Hideo Kojima’s PT, Luto delivers a powerful message about grief and life after loss. VH\n\nPS5, Switch, PC\nYou play as a fly in Time Flies, buzzing around different environments – a home or a museum, for instance – doing fly things, such as tickling people’s feet or avoiding lightbulbs. The time you have to complete the fly’s bucket list depends on your actual location, leaving just minutes or seconds to get everything done. Who knew speedrunning a fly’s life could be so delightful? Nicole Carpenter\n\nSwitch, PC\nAnd Roger is disorienting, devastating and one of the most emotional games to be released this year. From developer TearyHand Studio, And Roger’s evocative story and simple-yet-distinct art is reminiscent of Mountains’ 2018 release Florence. Within three chapters, a mystery unfolds: Who is this man in the house? Where’s my father? The answers reveal a tragic, beautiful story of love and family. NC\n\nXbox, PC\nSoft Not Weak’s Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To is a visual novel, dating simulator, and match-three game all in one. While it’s driven by its classic puzzle gameplay,this is a masterclass in characters and character design: Each individual you meetis just as interesting and well-developed as the last. It’s a must-play for both puzzle fanatics and visual novel lovers. NC",

    "fullText": "In this week’s newsletter: Pushing Buttons readers on their favourite games of the year, from Death Stranding 2 and Arc Raiders to Ghost of Yōtei and more\n\nHappy holidays, Pushing Buttons readers! Once again, we are approaching the cherished time of year between Christmas and New Year when we might actually have the time to play some video games. I hope Santa brought you something new to play, instead of taking one look at all the unplayed games in your Steam library and putting you straight on the naughty list.\n\nOver the past few weeks you have been sending in your favourite games of the year. I maintain that you readers have excellent taste: there’s crossover with our own Guardian games of the year list, but also plenty here that I haven’t played myself. Thank you to everyone who sent in a recommendation, and I hope you find yet another game to add to your pile of shame among the following suggestions. I’ll be back next week with a year-in-review issue – in the meantime, go enjoy yourselves!\n\n“Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I absolutely devoured this gem of a game; the story, setting, music, characters and visuals are all on point. I was itching to get back to playing it, while simultaneously never wanting it to end. Fantastic work from a debuting Sandfall Interactive [game] – I can’t wait to see what they do next!” Jen Baker\n\n“Death Stranding 2 is a true masterpiece of a game. Absurd at times, deeply emotional, scary, all with an absolutely amazing score. The characters are superb. In particular, Rainy was absolutely wonderful and Higgs, the guitar-shredding Paul Gilbert look-alike villain, was insanely brilliant. And blimey ... the graphics. Just sensational stuff.” Simon White\n\n“Avowed. I’ve started but never finished Skyrim (or any of the Elder Scrolls games), Starfield, any of the Fallouts or Outer Worlds that I think fall into the same category. But Avowed got its hooks into me with a great script and voice acting, seeing the difference my choices made and possibly the best first person, non-shooter combat I’ve tried.” Matt Froggatt\n\n“Split Fiction is the most fun co-op I have played for ages, they have ripped off every genre going and all for the greater co-op good! Plus, it’s not an expensive game and you don’t have to buy two copies. PS: The pigs and hotdog section was beyond funny!” Simon Watson\n\n“My favourite game this year has to be a triumphant return to the Lies of P universe and the DLC, Overture. It was so brilliantly done, the storyline was so sad and thoughtful. I just loved the way the prequel developed the main game lore and explained the characters backstories so well. The boss fights were so epic and I loved how stupidly hard some of them were. Oh, and the new music was great too. Big fan.” Tara Cooper\n\n“My favourite game of the year has been my favourite for years: Ghost of Yōtei. It looks incredible, the gameplay is fluid and the story is good. There are loads of side missions but they never feel like a chore or repetitive because of the quality of the action. In short, it’s everything that Assassin’s Creed wishes it could be.” Gareth Jones\n\n“Mechabellum. This game was catapulted into my online friend group seemingly out of nowhere, but we all love it. It’s a round-based 1v1 or 2v2 autobattler with lots of layers of skill and strategy. A match is about 20 mins 1v1. It’s also not an RTS which is great for me and my late-30s lads who mostly can’t put in the hours to stay good at Dota (our old go-to for Friday night games).” Thomas Jones\n\n“The top VR game of 2025 has to be Ghost Town by Fireproof Games. It has an incredible narrative with a strong female lead that is set in the 1980s. Fireproof Games is known for The Room series, so it’s no surprise that the visuals are stunning, the puzzles challenging and creative and the characters brilliant. An absolute joy to play.” Martina Stender\n\n“For me, it has to be Monster Train 2! The perfect rogue-like card battler that has learned and applied everything it can from other greats. It’s a mix of chance and strategy that never feels like it leaves you too high and dry, and challenge modes that help you find new ways to play in the main game. A wonderful, addictive and fun way to while away an afternoon, or a late night!” Nell Guy\n\n“Maybe it’s recency bias, but Arc Raiders has come out of nowhere and completely taken over my gaming life. The sound design, the significant risk of death, but also the surprisingly kind community – I’m using public voice chat for the first time since the 360 days – have combined for an immersive experience unlike anything I’ve ever played. We’ll see how the community evolves over time, especially as the game increases in popularity, but for now, it stands as a tremendous accomplishment that deserves to be recognised.” Brett Bates\n\n“One game I played this year will stay with me for life: Chicory: A Colorful Tale, an old-Zelda-like where the gameplay is based on painting every stage and interacting with colours. It’s fun to play, never tiring, an amazingly well-written story dealing with depression in a constructive and original way, incredible music by Lena Raine ... [I] cried multiple times, had fun from start to finish, and I left no screen in black and white.” Silvano Cardin\n\n“Absolum. I was quite excited for this one since playing the demo, so not entirely unexpected that this is my favourite release of the year. A rogue-like beat-’em up where style and substance are dealt out in massive quantities; the tight mechanics and setting are so striking that even after 100%-ing the game, I’m still coming back for more. I really look forward to hearing what the developers have next for this, as they have promised more, and I am waiting with bated breath!” Asher Alexander\n\n“There were many great games this year and I’ve spent a lot of time on Silksong and Clair Obscur Expedition 33. Nothing had me obsessed like Blue Prince, though … it got to the point where I was constantly thinking about it, even when I was not playing. I’m thoroughly done, and it makes me really sad.” Marie-Jill Landry\n\n“Kaizen Game Works’ Promise Mascot Agency is a weirdly wholesome game about a Yakuza hitman rebuilding a small Japanese town through the use of incredibly odd store brand mascots. Just unique, and a perfect follow-up to the equally weird Paradise Killer.” Paul Jones\n\n“My favourite game of the year is, very much, Dispatch – and I can’t wait for the final episodes to drop tonight. It’s unique, as far as I’ve seen, with a great blend of story and game, with a compelling narrative that keeps you going with interesting decision points. The animation is great, and I’m sure I’ll replay it as soon as I’ve finished to see what differences the other choices make. And it was cheap – no need to pay £70-80 for this!” Chris Cunliffe\n\n“Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is outstanding in all respects. It’s my game of the year – all-time favourite.” Bob Watkins\n\nKarts, cakes and karaoke: the eight best party games to play with family this Christmas\n\nTerminator 2D: No Fate – the least bad Terminator game in a long while | ★★★☆☆\n\nCall of Duty’s Vince Zampella was a video games visionary\n\n‘I plugged in Zelda and everything changed’: developers share their fondest Christmas gaming memories\n\nWe’ll skip the reader question this week – instead, why not get in touch to let us know what you’ve enjoyed about Pushing Buttons this year, what we could do better, and any games, themes or stories you want us to look into in 2026?\n\nYou know what to do: email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.\n\nRead our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here\n\nIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.\n\nRead our review of Ball X Pit here\n\nIf you are \n\nRead our review of Blue Prince here\n\nWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.\n\nCheck out a bit of the history behind Peak here\n\nWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!\n\nRead our review of Super Smash Bros.

    "fullText": "Zampella created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today, and his cinematic and epic military, sci-fi and Star Wars games thrilled and moved millions\n\nVince Zampella dies aged 55 – news\n\nOn Sunday, Vince Zampella, the co-creator of the Call of Duty video game series, died in a car crash in Los Angeles at the age of 55. Though best known for that series of blockbuster military shooters, Zampella touched a huge number of lives – not only the hundreds of people who worked at the game development studios he led under Activision and EA, but the millions of people who played the games that bore his imprint.\n\nA lifelong gamer, Zampella had a Pong console as a child, then an Atari 2600 and a Commodore 64. He told IGN in 2016 that his favourite game from childhood was Donkey Kong: “I would spend hours at the arcade playing it.” Zampella’s first job in the industry was at GameTek in Miami, which specialised in video-game versions of popular US quizshows. He described his role on the small team as: “producer slash customer services slash tester – whatever needed to be done.”\n\nIt was at a developer called 2015, Inc in Tulsa that Zampella had his first smash hit as lead designer. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was the third title in the acclaimed series of second world war shooters, which had been inspired by Saving Private Ryan and written in conjunction with Steven Spielberg. Zampella had envisioned a new type of shooter with an epic, cinematic sense of immersion. The game was a bestseller, acclaimed for its globetrotting narrative and taut, tense action – especially during its thrilling depiction of the Omaha beach landing.\n\nWhen publisher Electronic Arts made the decision to take the development of Medal of Honour in-house, Zampella and his colleague Jason West left, together with Grant Collier, and set up Infinity Ward in Los Angeles. There they created Call of Duty, a second world war shooter designed to exceed Medal of Honor’s sense of epic drama – indeed, its original development title had been Medal of Honor Killer. Critically, the game featured a range of lead characters including US, British and Russian fighters rather than giving players control of a single “super soldier”. “It’s meant to show you that no one side won the war – it was an allied effort,” Zampella said at the time.\n\nOnce again, the emphasis was on dramatic set-piece battles on a vast scale, with the player surrounded by computer-controlled allies giving the impression of being a small part of a wider campaign. “We’re all about authenticity and intensity,” Zampella said. “We’ve strived to put as many guys on screen as possible. It’s about your squad, not you as a lone gunman.”\n\nThis emphasis on teamwork and cinematic intensity would become emblematic of Call of Duty. While two sequels remained in the theatre of the second world war, for the fourth title, released in 2007, Zampella and West decided to move into the modern era. The result, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is one of the most important and influential first-person shooters ever made.\n\nIts campaign features a group of special forces operatives, including newcomer John “Soap” MacTavish and grizzled SAS captain John Price, taking on Russian ultra-nationalists and a Middle Eastern warlord. It had imaginative and exciting missions, including All Ghillied Up, a sniper mission in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster, and the eerie Death From Above, in which players control the various weapons of a C-130 aircraft, taking out enemies on the ground who appear merely as dots on an infrared screen. Meanwhile, the game’s online multiplayer mode brought new innovations including kill-streaks, which allowed players on a winning run to call in special attacks such as airstrikes. Infinity Ward created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today. Call of Duty’s DNA is present in every modern hit of the genre.\n\nIn 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Infinity Ward by publisher Activision, and went on to form Respawn Entertainment, taking more than 30 Call of Duty staff with them. Under new publisher Electronic Arts, the company released Titanfall in 2014, a multiplayer-focused sci-fi shooter intended to innovate within the genre. The game emphasised the player’s freedom of movement, allowing for smooth, parkour-style navigation of obstacles and structures. Players were also able to call in and pilot giant, heavily armed mechs. As Zampella explained at the time: “It’s taking the old paradigm of these shooter games being very grounded and two-dimensional and now adding this verticality to it and making it something that’s a new experience; something that people haven’t seen before.”\n\nAfter splitting with Activision, Zampella advised several other game creatives who found themselves at odds with their publishers and were considering striking out on their own. One of them was Hideo Kojima, creator of Metal Gear Solid and, at his own studio Kojima Productions, the Death Stranding series. “When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways,” wrote a “heartbroken” Kojima on X after Zampella’s death. “He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures”\n\nTitanfall’s sequel added an extraordinary single-player story to the original’s fluid online play – it is still one of the best shooter campaigns around. That series’ emphasis on smooth, seamless movement would also characterise Respawn’s entry into the battle royale genre: Apex Legends. Released with almost no pre-publicity in 2019, it would attract 10m players in its opening 72 hours and still maintains a place in the pantheon alongside Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone.\n\nRespawn next made two excellent single-player Star Wars games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Zampella’s peers have noted that working on the Star Wars franchise brought him and his colleagues at Respawn great joy.\n\nIn 2020, Electronic Arts put Zampella in charge of the Battlefield franchise, with a remit to recharge the series after the disappointing performance of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Released in October, Battlefield 6 was widely praised as a return to form, especially the online multiplayer modes. It sold 7m copies in three days, the best ever opening for the series.\n\nZampella will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his era and a ceaseless innovator in the first-person shooter genre – and with the Star Wars Jedi series, outside it. He was someone whom you always looked forward to encountering or interviewing at games industry events, an outspoken creative who cared deeply about video games and the player’s experience.\n\n“Vince was an extraordinary person – a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognise talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,” wrote Geoff Keighley on X, who runs the Game Awards and, as a former games journalist, worked on a documentary about Titanfall with Zampella. “Even when it was difficult or uncomfortable, Vince never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency. He believed that the truth mattered, and he was willing to share it with the world. Vince cared deeply about doing the right thing. And even while working inside large organisations, he consistently pushed to put players first – to prioritise the experience, the craft and the people who played the games. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of work … I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play it.”",

    "fullText": "This year has brought us many brilliant video games – but as wealth continues to concentrate, and games are used to exert economic and political influence, we need to keep an eye on the top players\n\nI love playing video games, but what interests me most as a journalist are the ways in which games intersect with real life. One of the joys of spending 20 years on this beat has been meeting hundreds of people whose lives have been meaningfully enhanced by games, and as their cultural influence has grown, these stories have become more and more plentiful.\n\nThere is another side to this, however. A couple of decades ago, video games were mostly either ignored or vilified by governments and mainstream culture, leading to an underdog mentality that has persisted even as games have become a nearly $200bn industry. As their popularity has grown, so have their political and cultural relevance. And the ways in which games intersect with real life are now coloured by the economic and political realities of our times.\n\nWhen I look back on this year’s happenings in the world of games, I see a lot of positives. A theme of the past few years has been comparatively small-scale games outperforming expensive blockbusters: the best examples this year have been the now multi-award-winning Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and Hollow Knight: Silksong, which has sold seven million copies. Despite year-long discussions over the finer points of what counts as “indie” and how many people really contribute to games made by “tiny” teams – a lot of them use contractors, who deserve to be acknowledged – the point remains that it is very possible to make brilliant and creative games to extremely high standards without a $100m budget, and that is something to be celebrated.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 was also (finally) announced and released this year, and has been very well received despite Trump’s best efforts to scupper its launch with tariff drama. Having a new console to enjoy tends to revive one’s enthusiasm for games, and though the Switch 2 didn’t feel enormously different from the original Switch, when I go back to my old machine now I really feel the difference.\n\nBut the broader story of 2025 is of a games industry reckoning with the same late-capitalist, techno-feudalistic forces that are threatening every creative industry. Wealth continues to concentrate at the top, while workers continue to face huge instability: more than 5,000 games industry jobs have been lost this year, and have several studios, including Monolith Productions. AI disruption is everywhere, meanwhile, as companies try to force their workforces to justify immense investments in the as-yet-unprofitable technology. AI-generated artwork and voiceovers have made their way into some of this year’s more successful games, and the pushback has been vociferous.\n\nAll this has led to much greater visibility for video game workers’ unions. In March, United Videogame Workers formed in the US and Canada, part of the Communications Workers of America. (They could be found protesting outside the Game Awards earlier this month.) In the UK, the firing of 30 staff from Rockstar Games pushed the UK’s IWGB Game Workers Union into the spotlight. Unionisation is slowly becoming more common even in the US, where there is not a strong culture of workplace organisation.\n\nAnother theme of the past few years has been consolidation: when Microsoft acquired Activision in 2023, it made me feel very uneasy about the concentration of economic power. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying its way into the games industry for years via esports partnerships and companies such as Savvy Games Group and Scopely, but this year it was kicked into high gear by a $55bn deal for EA. The Saudis also bought Niantic, makers of Pokémon Go, in March. (If you are wondering why the PIF is quite so ethically troubling, and how these video game investments form part of a strategy to whitewash the country’s image and that of its royal family, Eurogamer’s interview with Human Rights Watch from earlier this year is an essential read.)\n\nWhat we see here is money and power concentrating in the video game world in the same way as in the wider world. And games have immense power to influence people’s thoughts and attitudes: the most powerful people in the world have started to realise this. (Even Elon Musk sees the value of appropriating game credibility: he was discovered to be a fake gamer in January after boasting about his Path of Exile 2 character online.) Why else would the Trump administration be tweeting AI-generated images of the president as Halo’s Master Chief? Or using Pokémon and Halo memes to recruit for ICE? Why else would rightwing agitators continue to feed culture war spats over a black samurai in Assassin’s Creed, or a non-binary actor in a PlayStation game?\n\nI don’t pretend to be neutral on any of these things. Earlier this year, after I wrote about the Saudi acquisition of EA, I got an email from a reader asking if “some of this stuff is more editorial opinion rather than fact/news”. The answer to that is: it’s both. I will never report anything here that isn’t true, but I also won’t shy away from delivering my informed opinion on the things that go on in the gaming world. Unsurprisingly for a Guardian journalist, my values are inclusive, left-leaning and somewhat sceptical of corporate power, and of course that informs what I write in Pushing Buttons. I think that those values are vital context in these times.\n\nPlaying games is something a lot of us do for escapism, and a lot of people still react defensively if you talk about their relevance to real-world politics. Don’t we play games to get away from this stuff? Can’t we just concentrate on the hundreds of fantastic games that come out every single year, from creatively fired-up developers and artists all over the world? But games are inextricable from what’s happening in the real world. All art is. As if to symbolise this, this year’s Summer Game Fest – a showcase of forthcoming games held in LA in June – was interrupted by city-wide LA protests against ICE.\n\nIt matters, who has power. Games feel so exciting because they often give so much power to their players, to carve their own paths though their worlds. As players we leave an impression on games, and they leave an impression on us. In an ideal world, players and developers would be the people who held the power in the video games industry, too. If we enjoy video games, it is worth keeping an eye on the biggest players.",

From this simple premise comes a joyful game of mindfulness and social interaction, as Alta learns how to serve up witty conversation and decent hot drinks. Colourful and highly stylised, it is a thoughtful study of burnout and recovery.\n\nInkle/Nintendo Switch, iPhone/iPad, Mac, PC\nAn attempted-murder mystery set in an a 1920s all-girls private school reveals itself to also be an eviscerating takedown of British class politics. Witty and beautifully drawn, it is full of amusing boarding-school stereotypes, from self-interested prefects to a terrifying matron, whose motivations and personal grievances must be slowly unpicked. It has the feel of a really excellent graphic novel.\n\nSupergiant Games, PC, Switch\n\n A stylish return to Greek mythology for developer Supergiant Games, this time starring daughter of the underworld Melinoë, who is trying to prevent the titan Chronos from destroying everything. You are aided in your attempts to kill Time by a range of absurdly attractive fellow immortals and vicious familiars. Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.\n\nSokpop Collectiv, PC\n\n A gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.\n\nMegagon Industries, PC, Xbox\n\n All is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.\n\nCapcom, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n Capcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.\n\nHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Two aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.\n\n11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n After crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone. The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.\n\nPanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Set at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.\n\nTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n The Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.\n\nSucker Punch/Sony, PS5\n\n A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing the shamisen or wielding a sumi-e ink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.\n\nKojima Productions/Sony, PS5\n\n Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.\n\nSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n An extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.\n\nHexecutable, PC \n\n A satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funny and has a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.\n\nSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PC\n\n It’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.\n\nNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n In 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.\n\nTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n Even the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.\n\nDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n A young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.",

There was also the relative newcomer Dan Da Dan, which saw its second theatrical adaptation with Evil Eye.\n\nThe rankings also show a shift away from single launch moments toward steady output. According to Fandom's study, Roblox's top placement reflects how fans now prefer platforms with constant updates and community-created content. Smaller Roblox games, such as Dandy’s World and Grow a Garden, ranked higher than well-established worlds like Minecraft and Disney by focusing on frequent events and active, niche communities.\n\nThe same pattern appeared elsewhere with franchises such as Dungeons and Dragons and Cookie Run Kingdom performed well by releasing content regularly, showing that consistency mattered more than occasional peaks in attention.",

    "fullText": "SCOR, the interactive sports ecosystem, launched Fun.SCOR.io – a mobile and Web ecosystem.\n\nThe gaming firm has launched its much-awaited unified ecosystem across two chains for improved accessibility.\n\nThe native token SCOR is now live on OKX, Gate, and Bybit.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of blockchain gaming, SCOR is making some notable moves that could shake up the landscape for sports fans and crypto enthusiasts alike.\n\nThey’ve just rolled out Fun.SCOR.io, a new web and mobile platform that serves as a one-stop shop for their extensive ecosystem of sports-themed mini-games.\n\nThe on-chain sports giant debuts its central web and mobile platform, empowering its massive player base with true wallet freedom via a simultaneous deployment on two major blockchains. The native token, SCOR, is now available on Bybit, OKX, and Gate.\n\nWith over 2 million active users already on board, it’s building on existing integrations in messaging apps and now providing players with a dedicated space to participate in tournaments, collect athlete characters, and prepare for PvP battles in the future.\n\nThe new web and mobile platform enables fans to play a variety of minigames with a pro sports theme, collect on-chain professional athlete characters, compete in tournaments, and soon participate in skill-based PvP challenges.\n\nTom Mizzone, Founder/CEO of Sweet, the developer of the SCOR ecosystem, said;\n\n“With the launch of Fun.SCOR.io, we are effectively opening the stadium doors to the broader Web3 world. A platform this size requires robust infrastructure, that is why we are going multichain on day one. By deploying on both Base and Mantle, we are ensuring our 2 million users enjoy a seamless, low-cost experience with true asset portability, regardless of which wallet or network they prefer.”\n\nThe real game-changer here is SCOR’s move to go multichain from day one, rolling out simultaneously on Base and Mantle.\n\nBase, the Ethereum Layer 2 from Coinbase, offers extremely low fees and lightning-fast transactions, making it ideal for high-volume trading. Mantle, with its modular design, adds another layer of scalability and efficiency.\n\nThe Fun.SCOR.io ecosystem launch provides gamers with a plethora of options, including the ability to connect any self-custody wallet on either chain. Thanks to the SCOR-ID system, gamers’ progress and assets flow seamlessly across both chains.\n\nFun.SCOR.io is now live, serving as the central hub destination for the ecosystem’s skill-based sports gaming.\n\nUsers can connect via their preferred self-custody wallets on either Base or Mantle, enjoying the specific benefits of each network.\n\nSCOR’s multi-chain play feels like a practical evolution toward more open and user-friendly Web3 sports experiences.\n\nWith such a strong user base already engaged, it could push the whole sector away from single-chain limitations and toward something truly interconnected. Exciting times are ahead for sports fans who are dipping into blockchain.\n\nThe post SCOR Launches Fun.SCOR.io as 2M-User Sports Ecosystem Goes Multichain on Base and Mantle appeared first on ccn.com.",

    "fullText": "With ​a blend of retro-futurism, moral ambiguity and monster-filled wastelands, Fallout became an unlikely prestige television favourite. Now there is something a bigger, stranger and funnier journey ahead\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nThe Fallout TV series returns to Prime Video today, and it’s fair to say that everyone was pleasantly surprised by how good the first season was. By portraying Fallout’s retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic US through three different characters, it managed to capture different aspects of the game player’s experience, too. There was vault-dweller Lucy, trying to do the right thing and finding that the wasteland made that very difficult; Max, the Brotherhood of Steel rookie, who starts to question his cult’s authority and causes a lot of havoc in robotic power armour; and the Ghoul, Walton Goggins’s breakout character, who has long since lost any sense of morality out in the irradiated wilderness.\n\nThe show’s first season ended with a revelation about who helped cause the nuclear war that trapped a group of people in underground vaults for a couple of centuries. It also left plenty of questions open for the second season – and, this time, expectations are higher. Even being “not terrible” was a win for a video game adaptation until quite recently. How are the Fallout TV show’s creators feeling now that the first season has been a success?\n\n“We’ll take ‘not terrible’ – let’s get that on a poster,” says Jonah Nolan, the director who co-created the series with Geneva Robertson-Dworet. I’m speaking to them alongside Bethesda’s Todd Howard, director of the most recent Fallout video games. I last met with Nolan and Howard in 2024, before the first season premiered. Howard had been holding out a long time to make a Fallout adaptation, waiting for someone who seemed to really understand the series. Nolan, a lifelong player, was that person. Howard was poised with a red pen when he received the first script, but was relieved to find it was “fabulous”.\n\n“Going into the first season everyone’s like, ‘Just get it right’,” says Howard. “We’re over the moon with the reception to the show, so this time people are coming in with more excitement and different expectations.”\n\nThe second season is set in New Vegas, the site of 2010’s Fallout: New Vegas, which had the best writing and characters of any game in the series, even if it was a bit broken. The post-nuclear Strip was a kind of decaying criminal paradise full of warring factions and down-and-out inhabitants having as good a time as they can, given the bleak circumstances. It was shot in the real-world Nevada desert, and all over California. “It’s more of a desert vibe, a Mohave vibe, that’s so essential to that game,” says Nolan. “That dusty, blasted-out Route 66 vibe of the game is so much fun to bring into the show.”\n\nIn the show, a long time has passed since the events of the New Vegas game by the time Lucy and the Ghoul arrive in the city, but Howard says that it does reference the player’s journey. “When you’re doing a location that gamers know so well … honouring everyone’s journey through that game was a trick,” he says. “Time has moved on. What is New Vegas like now?… if you’re a fan of that game there’s so much to love in season two, visually and also with the factions and what’s going on with them.”\n\nThe Fallout TV series has a tactile feel – its creators ensured real props and sets were built, echoing the cobbled-together nature of the settlements in the games, where everyone is building stuff out of trash and every town is shoved together from whatever anyone can find. “As a sci-fi fan, so many shows I watch, I’m aware that they’re all standing in front of a blue screen,” says Robertson-Dworet. “The whole point of an adaptation, especially of a video game, is to feel like it’s real … of course, we still augment with VFX but, wherever possible, actors are actually standing in front of locations I loved seeing in the game.”\n\nIn fact, pretty much everything you see on-screen is real, even the infamously terrifying irradiated monsters, the Deathclaws. They were scary even as blobs of pixels in the original 90s Fallout games. In the show, they’re puppets, and apparently pretty frightening up close. “It was the closest look I’d ever gotten at a Deathclaw. In Fallout 4, whenever I saw one, it would instantly kill me,” laughs Nolan. “It was quite peculiar being able to stand there and stare at it.”\n\n“Even the radscorpion puppet was amazingly scary,” adds Robertson-Dworet. “It was so big – the mama scorp, that is. The little ones were fine, they were like overgrown lobsters, but it was genuinely very scary when the puppeteer was charging the big one at me.”\n\nThe Fallout series works because it’s made by talented film-makers who are also players and with the help of the people who created the actual games. Howard is replaying Red Dead Redemption 2 at the moment and resuming a long-dormant obsession with EA’s college (American) football games; Nolan has spent the summer playing Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with his entire family; Robertson-Dworet is still working on scripts for the show, so she’s playing a lot of New Vegas (as is her husband).\n\n(Not everyone involved with the show is a gamer, though. In an interview with PC Gamer, Goggins the Ghoul said he had never played a Fallout game and had no intention of doing so. “No, I haven’t sat down to play the games. And I won’t. I won’t,” he said. “I won’t play the games. I’m not interested.” It’s OK, Walton, nobody is judging your gamer cred.)\n\nThe second season is coming out weekly rather than in one binge-able batch of episodes, so we will all be experiencing it differently from last season – including Howard, Nolan and Robertson-Dworet, who will now be looking out for people’s reactions every week.\n\n“It has more depth, it’s bigger, it’s funnier, it has a lot of surprises,” says Howard. “I’m looking forward to seeing what people think.”\n\nSwedish developer Simogo made some of the most interesting iPhone and iPad games of the 2010s, from the unforgettable puzzle game Device 6 to the eerie Year Walk. It recently released a compilation of these games, an attempt to preserve them before they are either removed from mobile storefronts or become unplayable thanks to iOS updates.\n\nAvailable on: Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 5-plus hours\n\nThe Game awards took place last week, a typically brisk affair at just under four hours. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won nine awards, including Game of the Year, kicking off a predictable online discussion about whether it is even that good. See the full list of winners here, a rundown of the most notable trailers and announcements here, and look out for the Guardian’s games of the year list on Friday.\n\nLara Croft is back for two new Tomb Raider games, starring the self-assured version of the tank-topped action heroine from the 1990s. The first game, Catalyst, is a new adventure set in northern India, out 2027; next year we’ll see Legacy of Atlantis, a ground-up remake of the very first Tomb Raider game.\n\nGood news for our young and sprightly readers: the Quickshot II, the legendary joystick beloved of many Amiga and C64 players, is making a comeback in January. It will work with anything with a USB slot, including all the recent modern reissues of Amiga, Commodore and Spectrum home computers.\n\n‘Our industry has been strip-mined’: video game workers protest at the Game awards\n\nRockstar co-founder Dan Houser on life after Grand Theft Auto\n\nBluey’s Quest for the Gold Pen: after some misfires, we finally have the first good Bluey video game\n\n‘If we build it, they will come’: Skövde, the tiny town powering up Sweden’s video game boom\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 – how a tiny studio developed the Belle Époque-set gaming blockbuster\n\nFallout season two – this post-apocalyptic thriller is absolutely hilarious | ★★★★☆\n\nOmniscient Reader: The Prophecy – life gets gamified in one-note Korean sci-fi | ★★☆☆☆\n\n“We love games we can play as a pair, whether they are designed as single-player (eg Blue Prince) or multiplayer (eg For the King, Gloomhaven, Sunderfolk). Puzzle games and turn-based games seem to work particularly well. Do you have any suggestions for something to try next?”\n\nWe’ve answered a few variations of this question before, but as it’s Christmas, I suspect that plenty of people will be looking for something to play while cosied up on the sofa – so here are some fresh recommendations for local multiplayer and pad-passing games. If you like a challenge, Absolum is a punishing but stylish fusion of beat-em-up and adventure game. Powerwash Simulator 2 lets you soothingly scrub down filthy objects together. For nominally single-player games, narrative games often make good pad-passers; Lost Records: Bloom and Rage and Dispatch are two of the year’s best. You might want to try trading attempts at Baby Steps, the year’s most infuriating game. And my partner enjoyed taking turns at Ball x Pit, the fiendishly compelling game where you defeat demonic hordes with magic ping-pong balls.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "fullText": "If I could use only one word to encapsulate Terminator 2D: No Fate, it would be \"authentic\": Both in the way it faithfully recreates James Cameron's seminal 1991 action movie and its nostalgic love affair with the 16-bit era of video games. Movie tie-ins were mostly awful in the early '90s, but I could easily see myself renting No Fate from my local Blockbuster and blasting through its sidescrolling run-'n'-gun action in between episodes of Dragon Ball Z and WWF Smackdown.\n\nIt's a brief experience, with the credits arriving in less time than it takes to watch the entirety of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, but No Fate is a licensed video game done right, created with palpable reverence for both its source material and the era of video games it emulates.\n\nNo Fate's story mode opens with a shot of rolling tarmac, as the painted yellow lines in the middle of the road scroll past at regular intervals. If you're a fan of Terminator 2, this shot will be a familiar sight, albeit one now rendered in gorgeous pixel art, with chiptune music and Sarah Connor's monologue presented as blocks of text rather than through Linda Hamilton's hushed tones. It's also in a different place--on a desert road instead of a Los Angeles freeway--and opens the game as opposed to bookending the movie.\n\nWhere it once wrapped up two hours of pure movie-making excellence with a hopeful glimpse of an undetermined and hopefully better future, No Fate warns of the horrors to come--of Judgment Day and the rise of the machines. It's a scene that wonderfully captures the vibe of Terminator 2 while also putting developer Bitmap Bureau's own spin on things, remaining authentic and faithful to the source material with an additional sprinkling of unique flavor on top.\n\nThis is a common theme throughout No Fate's story mode. When it's not a beat-by-beat 16-bit recreation of one of the greatest movies ever made, it's filling in the blanks and professing its love for '90s gaming, fluidly shifting gameplay styles to suit the adaptation's needs.\n\nTake the opening level as a prime example: In a new scene set shortly before the film's events, Sarah is teaching John Connor how to fight so he can become the soldier he may need to be in the future. This moment of atypical bonding is interrupted when a musclebound thug pays homage to Double Dragon by punching John in the gut and flinging him over his shoulder before walking off. What follows is a side-scrolling action platformer with more than a few similarities to the console and early arcade games of the '90s.\n\nAs you move Sarah from left to right, mowing down bad guys by shooting vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, games like Metal Slug, Super Star Wars, and RoboCop Versus The Terminator come to mind. Movement is responsive, and human enemies go down in a couple of shots, making for some satisfyingly fast-paced action.\n\nAfter rescuing John, Sarah heads to a Cyberdyne research lab to destroy it, only to be shot, arrested, and sent to the Pescadero mental hospital: a moment mentioned briefly in the film but afforded more prominence here. With Sarah's plans to prevent Judgment Day foiled, No Fate takes inspiration from Terminator 2's explosive opening scene, putting you in control of a grizzled John Connor as he leads the resistance in the Future War of 2029.\n\nThese levels resemble Konami's Contra series more than anything, right down to a familiar defensive wall boss fight and temporary weapon pickups that grant homing plasma rounds and split shot fire. Bitmap Bureau introduces a few modern wrinkles as well, such as the ability to take cover and an evasive roll for avoiding enemy fire, though the game gets more interesting once you're done destroying the various T-800s, Centurions, and Hunter-Killers of Los Angeles' future.\n\nOnce John reaches the time-travel device and sends a T-800 back to 1995, No Fate transitions to Arnold Schwarzenegger's first appearance in Terminator 2 as he emerges in the parking lot of The Corral biker bar--though it's worth noting that Arnie's likeness isn't included, despite Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, and Robert Patrick all starring. From here, the game begins taking scenes from the film and transforming them into playable levels, nailing every memorable moment while adapting gameplay styles to fit each scene.\n\nAfter a naked Arnie asks for a biker's clothes, boots, and motorcycle, No Fate momentarily turns into a beat-em-up as you clobber The Corral's patrons, throwing one onto a steaming hot grill and culminating in a boss fight set to George Thorogood's \"Bad to the Bone.\"\n\nLater on, the iconic motorcycle/truck pursuit through Los Angeles' flood-control channel draws inspiration from Battletoads' Turbo Tunnel and the bike level from Contra 3: The Alien Wars, challenging you to avoid static hazards while keeping Robert Patrick's T-1000 at bay--complete with one-handed shotgun reloads that are still the coolest. The freeway chase from later on in the film functions similarly but differs slightly, as you alternate between weaving in and out of traffic and taking control of Sarah as she fires upon the pursuing T-1000-manned helicopter.\n\nSarah's escape from the Pescadero Hospital is another highlight, briefly turning No Fate into a stealth game. With the T-1000 hot on your tail, passing through metal bars and melting into the floor, there's a sudden injection of tension since you have no way of fighting back. Instead, you need to duck into doorways and various alcoves to avoid the T-1000 and bide your time before taking out the hospital's abusive orderlies. There isn't an instant fail state if you alert any of the human enemies; it's just easier to take them out with a swift blow to the back of the head, so being spotted is never frustrating.\n\nThis level fits the era, too, even if you might not necessarily think of stealth mechanics when recalling 16-bit games. 1990's Bonanza Bros was the primary inspiration behind No Fate's stealth mechanics, but games like Rolling Thunder and Elevator Action Returns were also influential, showcasing the depth of Bitmap Bureau's love for the era.\n\nWhile your first venture through No Fate's story mode covers the rest of Terminator 2, from blowing up Cyberdyne HQ to fighting off the T-1000 in the steel mill finale, subsequent playthroughs allow you to change the future. After all, the game's title comes from the famous line \"there's no fate but what we make for ourselves.\" The future isn't predetermined, and so the game leans into this ethos, letting you make a couple of different choices to alter events and unlock three alternative endings.\n\nIn practice, however, this sounds more interesting than it actually is. The branching paths introduce a few new levels, including an escape from a police station that feels like an ode to the original 1984 Terminator, but the other endings are brief and, much like the ending in the film's extended cut, can't compare to the original.\n\nAlong with a ranking system, global leaderboards, multiple difficulty settings, and other unlockable modes, seeking out the other three endings adds some replayability to what is otherwise a remarkably short game. My first playthrough took 42 minutes, with that number decreasing with each subsequent completion. The other modes include a Boss Rush, where you try to defeat all of the game's bosses as quickly as possible, and an Infinite mode that tasks you with walking down an endless corridor, killing as many enemies as you can to achieve the highest score. If you're interested in leaderboards, you might get some longevity out of these modes, but otherwise, you'll likely play each of them once just to unlock the rest of the modes.\n\nArcade mode adds an extra challenge by removing continues, while Mother of the Future condenses the story mode to only Sarah Connor's levels, with completion unlocking the hardest difficulty setting. The options are nice, but still just offer different ways to replay the same game. No Fate's brevity is fitting for a time period where most games had to be finished in a single sitting, but if you have no intention of elongating the experience by unlocking every mode, it's unlikely you'll be completely fulfilled.\n\nThose with few qualms about duration will find a game made with evident love and affection for both the source material and the moment in time it was released. Its music is excellent--with perhaps the best rendition of the Terminator 2 theme to date--aiding the game's visuals in its mission to transport you back to a time when blowing into cartridges and inserting coins were the norm. Whether it's the T-1000's haunting fluidity of movement, Sarah Connor's one-armed reloading of a pump action shotgun, or the way the T-800 clambers onto the hood of a semi-truck to unload an entire magazine into its windshield, Terminator 2D: No Fate recreates the movie's most memorable moments with pitch-perfect authenticity. It's a shame it ends far too soon, but this is still the definitive Terminator 2 video game.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Several dozen people protested on Sunday in the Siberian city of Tomsk against Russia's ban on U.S. children's gaming platform Roblox, ​a rare show of public dissent as popular irritation over the ban gains ‌some momentum.\n\nIn wartime Russia, censorship is extensive: Moscow blocks or restricts social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp ‌and YouTube while distributing its own narrative through a network of social media and Russian media.\n\nRussia's communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said on December 3 it had blocked Roblox because it was \"rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children\".\n\nIn Tomsk, 2,900 km (1,800 miles) east ⁠of Moscow, several dozen people braved ‌the snow to hold up hand-drawn placards reading \"Hands off Roblox\" and \"Roblox is the victim of the digital Iron Curtain\" in Vladimir Vysotsky Park, according ‍to photographs provided by an organiser of the protest.\n\n\"Bans and blocks are all you are able to do,\" read one placard. The photographs showed about 25 people standing in a circle in the snow, holding up ​placards.\n\nIn Russia, the ban on Roblox has triggered a debate over censorship, child safety in ‌relation to technology and even the effectiveness of censorship in a digitalised world where children can bypass many bans in a few clicks.\n\nMany Russians simply circumvent bans by using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), though some young Russians have questioned the logic of a ban if it can be so easily bypassed while others have questioned why there are so few Russian alternatives to the ⁠apps which the state has banned.\n\nSome Russian parents and ​teachers have said they were concerned Roblox allowed children ​to access sexual content and communicate with adults.\n\nRoblox, headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been banned by several countries including Iraq and Turkey over concerns about ‍predators exploiting the platform ⁠to abuse children.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When the Russian ban was introduced, Roblox said it has \"a deep commitment to safety\" and provides \"rigorous ⁠built-in protections to help keep users safe\".\n\nRussian officials say they need censorship to defend against a sophisticated \"information war\" unleashed ‌by Western powers, and what they cast as decadent Western culture which undermines \"traditional\" ‌Russian values.",

    "fullText": "He rewrote the rule book with Rockstar then left it all behind. Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queens\n\nThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and 12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.\n\n“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”\n\nAt first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now they are the medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of Seismic Games and Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.\n\nIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.\n\n“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”\n\nTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?\n\n“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”\n\nHaving turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.\n\nAlso in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”\n\nHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects to Grand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”\n\nWe talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.\n\n“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”\n\n“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game about that’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”\n\nSo he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”",

As part of the State of Play for First Light, Gibson was officially confirmed while five other cast members were revealed.\n\nOne role that is currently unrevealed is the game's nemesis, 009. This former MI6 agent is being hunted by Bond and his allies, but the extent of 009's ambitions are unclear.\n\nIO Interactive was more forthcoming about other aspects of the game, which we included in our recap of everything we learned about 007: First Light. The publisher also unveiled multiple editions of the game, which you can find in our First Light preorder guide.\n\n007 First Light will hit PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S on March 27, 2026. You can find all of the currently announced cast members below.\n\nPatrick Gibson is making his video game debut as the voice and likeness of James Bond in 007 First Light. In the absence of a 007 actor on the big screen, he's the incumbent Bond for the moment.\n\nGibson recently had one of his biggest roles to date as young Dexter Morgan in Dexter: Original Sin. Prior to that, he had leading roles on Netflix's Shadow and Bone and The OA. One of Gibson's earliest acting credits was in Showtime's The Tudors. On the big screen, Gibson has appeared in a handful of movies including the 2019 J.R.R. Tolkien biopic, Tolkien.\n\nPriyanga Burford had a small role in the last Bond movie as a MI6 scientist in No Time To Die. She has a considerably bigger part as M in 007 First Light.\n\nBurford's credits are primarily in television, and she had leading and supporting roles in Steeltown Murders, Before We Die, Avenue 5, Industry, Housebound, and Press.\n\nThe Walking Dead and Fear the Walking Dead fans will surely recognize Lennie James, who portrayed Morgan Jones across both series. In First Light, James will play Bond's mentor, John Greenway.\n\nJames has also lent his voice to the Destiny games, where he portrayed Lord Shaxx. The English actor has a long list of credits across TV and film, including Blade Runner 2049, Human Target, Invincible, Archer, Jericho, and Mufasa: The Lion King.\n\nKiera Lester is a relative newcomer to the entertainment industry, with only a handful of television credits to her name. She has appeared in Sister Boniface Mysteries, Wreck, Ruby Speaking, Grace, and Death in Paradise.\n\nLester's role as Miss Moneypenny in 007 First Light will be one of her most prominent parts to date.\n\nVeteran actor Alastair Mackenzie will voice Q, the man who creates all of Bond's incredible gadgets. We don't know yet how Mackenzie's take on the character will differ from his on-screen predecessors. But unlike the last Q, Ben Whishaw, Mackenzie is considerably older than the actor playing Bond.\n\nAndor fans may recognize Mackenzie from his role as Perrin Fertha, the husband on Mon Mothma. Some of his other credits include The Crown, Dracula, Unforgotten, Outlaw King, and Backdraft 2.\n\nWho is Miss Roth? She appears to be the femme fatale Bond girl in 007 First Light. Noemie Nakai will lend her voice and likeness to Miss Roth in the game.\n\nNakai's most prominent TV role was in HBO Max's Tokyo Vice, and her other credits include Army of Thieves, Never Let Me Go, The Emperor's Cook, and Death Note: New Generation.\n\nBritish actress Gemma Chan--known for her roles in Transformers: The Last Knight, Crazy Rich Asians, and Captain Marvel--will appear in First Light as the character Selina Tan.\n\nShe's described as a \"brilliant and passionate academic with a background in psychology and game theory.\" The character, who works at MI6, played a \"critical role\" in helping James Bond earn his 00 status.\n\nThis is not Chan's first video game role, as she also portrayed Erys in Diablo IV. Chan lent her voice and likeness to 007 First Light.\n\nMusician and actor Lenny Kravitz will play the villain Bawma.",

    "fullText": "What started as Guillaume Broche’s personal project has been nominated for 12 Game awards, sold more than 2m copies and been praised by Emmanuel Macron as a ‘shining example of French audacity’\n\nThe record-breaking 12 nominations at the Game awards this year was beyond the wildest dreams of Guillaume Broche when he first began inking out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as a personal project while working at Ubisoft.\n\nBefore selling more than 2m copies, the narrative-driven roleplaying game with “a unique world, challenging combat and great writing” was a technical demo called We Lost. It was Broche’s appetite for risk and a few hopeful Reddit posts that would create the game’s world of Lumiere and its struggle against the Paintress.\n\n“I was doing like eight hours per day after work and not sleeping at all for a few years,” Broche says. And while he would be joined by Tom Guillermin on the programming side and Francoise Meurisse as producer, the next few members of the nascent studio – Lorien Testard, lead composer and Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, lead writer – would only come to Clair Obscur by chance, via social media.\n\nTestard, a guitar teacher at the time who had never composed or published any music commerically, was discovered by Broche on SoundCloud. “We liked the same philosophy in games,” says Testard, who had been writing music inspired by his favourite titles. Similarly, Broche found his art director, Nicholas Maxson-Francombe, through personal works he posted on ArtStation. “We are all deeply engaged in our subject areas,” says Svedberg-Yen, who says that was what bonded the team together. “If you listen to Nicolas talk about art or Lorien talk about music, it’s just something that fills our minds and our days.”\n\nSvedberg-Yen, meanwhile, had come from the world of finance. She saw Broche’s Reddit post and auditioned to not only write but also to voice some of the prototype characters of Clair Obscur, namely Maelle and Lune. Despite a deep love for video games, storytelling and a childhood engrossed in novels, Svedberg-Yen had not considered it as a career option. “It never crossed my mind as possible. As the adage goes, for Asian parents [it’s] doctors, lawyers, or finance.”\n\nWith a rudimentary team assembled under the banner of a new studio, Sandfall Interactive, they rebooted We Lost as Clair Obscur. It was there a world took shape and the gained its unmistakeable Belle Époque setting. “There’s a specificity,” Svedberg-Yens says. “I think that vision gets diluted when you’re trying to appeal to too many people.”\n\n“It’s not meant to be French propaganda,” jokes Broche, about the game’s very Gallic aesthetic. The characters yell putain and merde, there are berets and extremely scary mimes not only because it’s fun, he says, but born from a desire to make something “sincere and authentic”.\n\nSame goes for the story. Clair Obscur’s narrative drives the game forward and, as lead writer, Svedberg-Yen says it all has a “grounding and a basis in truth”.\n\n“We are all first-time writer and game developers in this sense … and so we kind of only know instinctively how write to what instinctively comes from within. And for a lot of the characters in those particular situations, to write them [you] have to really delve into the parts of my life that resonate with the situation that they’re in.”\n\nAccording to Svedberg-Yen, a conversation Broche had with his mother became core to the story’s emotional heft. When he asked her what would be the worst thing that could possibly happen, his mother responded saying it would be to lose her children. “The story deals with a lot of trauma,” she says, and that process of writing like that was often a scary process. “If people don’t like it, they don’t like you.” It was this ability to be vulnerable and open a communicative environment that Broche believes contributed to the success of the game.\n\nDespite an anxiety in the industry about the rise of AI in the development of video games, the team at Sandfall isn’t worried – especially Testard, who composed the game’s orchestral score based off the narrative beats of the game and the eponymous concept of clair obscur (or chiaroscuro), AKA the interplay of light and dark. “Music is the language of the soul,” he says. In fact, the evolution of technology like Unreal Engine 4 and the later 5, which the game runs on today, made a lot of the game possible. “More games will be 3D, because we have a lot of tools now,” says Broche, who describes the budget of his game to be on the “lower end of AA.”\n\nThe team at Sandfall have been overwhelmed by their success. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, lauded the game as “shining example of French audacity”. None of them expected the experience of Clair Obscur to resonate so deeply with so many people. “I’ve gotten a lot of very heartfelt messages from players who have experienced loss in some way and who have felt that the story helped them deal with their grief or change their relationship with grief,” Svedberg-Yen says.\n\n“What’s really cool is I’ve gotten tons of messages from creatives, writers, aspiring writers who felt creatively drained or just felt like they wanted to quit, but then the game inspired them to start again and they started creating their own art again, to start writing.”",

    "title": "How to Get Games on Your Retro Gaming Handheld",
    "description": "How to actually get games on your brand new Linux or Android gaming device.",
    "fullText": "I recently put together a list of the best small portable gaming handhelds for people who are tired of how big the Nintendo Switch 2 and handheld gaming PCs like the Steam Deck are. In an era of gaming devices that often feel like laptops with grips and buttons added to them, these retro gaming handhelds (as I call them) can be a great solution for people who miss the days of the PSP and Nintendo DS. But since they come from smaller companies, and run either Linux or Android, actually getting games on these devices is not quite so straightforward. After all, it's not like the people making these handhelds are publishing cartridges for them.\n\nWhile that's true, there are plenty of ways to play games both new and old on these devices, even if they were originally made for other consoles. And despite a reputation to the contrary, if you do them right, they're all legal.\n\nEmulation is a common use for retro gaming handhelds, to the point where some people just call them emulators. It isn’t the only thing you can do with these devices, but it’s definitely a popular way to put games on them, especially the weaker ones.\n\nThrough emulation, your system can mimic older devices like the Game Boy, Super Nintendo, and PlayStation 1, to play games originally released for those platforms. This works by using your modern device’s more powerful hardware to run software that virtually recreates all the processes of old consoles, making older games think they’re running on the real thing. This is in comparison to games that “run natively,” meaning they’re running on the system they were built for. Emulators developed by fans are well-known, but even large companies like Nintendo use emulation. In fact, the games you play on Nintendo Switch Online are technically all emulated.\n\nThis can come with downsides. You might run into minor inaccuracies in sound or graphics, but typically, the more powerful your device’s chip and the weaker the system you’re emulating, the less common these will be. You could also experience input lag, although I’ve never once been able to actually feel it across most of the devices I’ve used to emulate. (I say this as someone who has beaten all three of the original Ninja Gaiden games using emulation.)\n\nAnd there are upsides to emulation, too. Games can be upscaled to push out higher resolutions than ever intended natively, which can make for homebrew HD remasters if played on a nice enough screen. And most emulation programs support save states, which let you save your progress anywhere, anytime, separate from a specific game’s built-in save system. Save states can be a lifesaver for especially difficult games, or while playing on the go.\n\nThe biggest hurdle, then, is setup. Some devices come with emulators built in, although you'll probably want to configure them to your specifications, and if you're on a Linux-based handheld, possibly run them alongside a custom, third-party firmware (more on that later).\n\nSpecifics will vary from device to device, so for help, I suggest YouTuber Russ Crandall's guides on emulation. Crandall runs the channel Retro Game Corps, and has been a big help in my own emulation journey. He's also exhaustively catalogued the steps you'll need to go through for various handhelds.\n\nTruth be told, though, you'll probably be using similar programs across your handhelds. RetroArch is popular for emulating older systems, while newer ones require specific apps like Dolphin (for GameCube and Wii) or PPSSPP (for PSP). After you've set these up once, doing it for other handhelds is kind of like riding a bike. The biggest difficulty you’ll probably encounter will be providing ROM files for your emulators, which leads me to the elephant in the room.\n\nEmulation is convenient, and a great way to experience games that haven’t been re-released for modern consoles. But it also has a bit of a reputation for being shady. For comment, I reached out to YouTube Bob Wulff of Wulff Den, another mainstay in guides and reviews for retro gaming handhelds. Ultimately, Wulff thinks this reputation is undeserved.\n\n“I don’t like this stigma that Emulation [equals] Piracy,” he told me. “There are plenty of ways to acquire your ROMs legally.”\n\nAnd therein lies the rub. When people think that emulation is illegal, they’re usually conflating emulator programs with pirated game files, or ROMs. The process of writing original software to mimic a console’s function is actually perfectly legal, to the point where Apple now allows emulators on the App Store, but distributing copyrighted software to run on those emulators is where you get into legal issues. That’s why handheld companies like Anbernic have a bit of a bad reputation for including ROMs with their devices, as I highlight in my list of the best retro gaming handhelds. But theoretically, if you legally own a game, U.S. law allows you to make your own backup of it, which you could then play on an emulator without issue. Unless you’re downloading your games off pirate sites or buying SD cards with pirated ROMs pre-loaded onto them, playing games using an emulator shouldn't be any different in the eyes of the law than playing games on original hardware.\n\nAs for how you can actually get your own legal backups of games you own, there are a number of devices that will read your cartridges and back up their ROM files for you, as well as PC programs that will do the same thing for disc-based games. Also note that you can emulate on phones and PCs, too, although there is a certain magic in emulating using a small handheld with controls built-in.\n\nBut as much as some fans like to call retro gaming handhelds “emulators” and leave it at that, these devices can do more than mimic old consoles. The hardware for these devices is usually versatile enough to support playing modern games natively, streaming games from the cloud, or in some cases, even playing games originally meant for PC. You can play new games on these handhelds, too. Let's start with Android and cloud gaming, as they're among the simplest ways to get games on these devices.\n\nThis is the obvious one. If your retro gaming handheld runs Android, then it stands to reason that it can run Android apps. This means that in addition to emulation, you can play phone games like Genshin Impact or Call of Duty Mobile. Your device's built-in controller will work with the game like any standard phone controller, and you’ll be able to play just as well as anyone on a phone could. Android-based gaming handhelds also come with touchscreens, so you shouldn’t run into problems if your game needs one. The only catch is that some devices with a square-ish aspect ratio might use a lot of letterboxing to actually show anything other than retro games on-screen, which could make for a tiny image (they'll be great for old, 4:3 games, though). Otherwise, know that the Play Store is your oyster.\n\nIf your retro gaming handheld has Android installed on it, then you can also use it to stream games from the cloud. That means you could connect it to either your own home console, your PC, or a subscription service to play games that your device isn’t able to run on its own, or that you don’t want to install to it. The only issues you’ll face will be potential input lag and video compression, plus the need for a constant internet connection. But given that Sony sells a whole handheld built entirely around Remote Play, it’s great to have it as an option on these devices, while knowing that they can also play games on their own power, too. It’s an especially great choice for turn-based games, or other titles that don’t require twitchy, fast-paced inputs.\n\nThis is a more recent innovation, but there are currently two ways to play PC games on your retro gaming handheld without relying on the cloud. One runs them natively, and one uses technology similar to the Steam Deck’s.\n\nThe first method is for retro gaming handhelds that run Linux. These are usually the cheaper devices, the type you’ll get from companies like Anbernic or Miyoo. The version of Linux on these isn’t the same as on handhelds like the Steam Deck, so don’t expect to just be able to log into your Steam account with these and go off to the races. But thanks to the fan-made program Portmaster, you can still play some of your Steam games on these handhelds.\n\nPortmaster connects you with fan-made ports of PC games built to run natively on your retro gaming handheld. Some of these are freeware, and some will need you to plug in files from your own Steam installs to avoid violating copyright. But both types of games can be up-and-running in just a few steps, and like with emulation, Crandall has a guide to help get you started on your particular device.\n\nThe big caveat here is that, to get Portmaster, you'll probably need to install a third-party firmware, also fan-made, to your device, rather than using what comes with it out of the box. I use muOS, but if you want something with a different style, there are other options, depending on your device. Since there's so much variation, I haven't personally tested all options, but Crandall again has you covered.\n\nYou’ll also mostly be stuck with retro and lightweight games using this method, but there's an upside to that, too. I’ve already used it to help get through the indie darlings in my Steam back catalog, like Undertale.\n\nThe second method is for devices that run Android. Much like the Steam Deck uses real-time compatibility layers to convert Windows games to run on its version of Linux, there are now Android apps that can help you run your Steam games on either your phone or your retro gaming handheld.\n\nThe three popular ones are called GameHub, GameHub Lite, and GameNative. These programs add extra configuration and user friendliness on top of an existing app called WinLator, a compatibility layer that allows Windows programs to run on Android. You can log right into your Steam account using these apps, then download your games and play them on your Android handheld, complete with cloud saves. You’ll still be limited in what you can play, based on what’s had the most compatibility work put into it, but it’s great for lightweight games, older AAA games, and if your handheld is powerful enough (think the AYN Odin 3), even more recent AAA games from the PS4 era.\n\n“These Windows containers are really exciting,” Crandall told me when I reached out for comment. “I don’t think they are anywhere close to replacing a PC, but it’s exciting to get a lightweight PC game running nicely on a smaller handheld.”\n\nThat said, there are a few concerns with using these apps. While Gamenative is open source, and GameHub Lite is an independent fork of GameHub that tries to fix its issues, GameHub will likely be the easiest app for most people to use, as it has the simplest interface and the most compatibility updates for various games. Unfortunately, it comes with a number of privacy concerns.\n\nGamehub is made by controller company GameSir, which has made reputable products in the past, but it does want you to log into a GameSir account to use it, and some users might be uncomfortable linking their Steam data to that. It also includes, in Crandall’s words, “some fairly intrusive telemetry permissions.”\n\nHowever, both Crandall and Wulff are ultimately positive enough on GameHub.\n\n“It’s frankly no more nosy than any of the various social media apps we already have on our phones,” Crandall told me, also saying that if you’re uncomfortable logging in with a GameSir account, you can use “a Steam login token via QR code,” which should be more secure.\n\nWulff, meanwhile, said “I don’t personally think there are any potential security issues with GameHub,” citing GameSir’s reputation and saying “I also just don’t think our Steam data is worth a damn.”\n\nI see where both creators are coming from, but I have been a bit more cautious on this front. Still, it’s an enticing option if you’re willing to try it out, and it actually points to things to come. Recently, Valve announced its Steam Frame VR headset, which runs on the same type of framework that Android phones do. With that, retro gaming handheld enthusiasts are hopeful Valve will soon release an official way to play Steam games on these devices (and phones). That's something the company recently hinted at in an interview with The Verge, saying it has been quietly bankrolling much of the development on the compatibility layers that apps like WinLator and its derivatives use.\n\nOn that note, if you’re brave, you could also just play your PC games on these devices using WinLator itself, or other alternatives like Pluvia. However, these have been too complex for me to fiddle with, and I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone but the most hardcore tinkerers. I think I’m with Crandall in saying that “I’d much rather have a proper Steam-derived solution.” Fingers-crossed.",

    "fullText": "Sam Eng/Devolver Digital, PC, PS5, Switch 2\nAn exquisitely fluid game of tricks, grinds and manuals is framed by a story that uncovers the poignancy of the infamously painful pastime\n\nSkateboarding video games live and die by their vibe. The original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater titles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s beloved Skate franchise offered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.\n\nThe premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.\n\nThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.\n\nThe vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.\n\nThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.\n\nGradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.\n\nThese questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is \n\nThe result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.",

Cross-play or cross-platform support, allowing players to connect with their friends and other players on different systems from their own, has been a very welcome development. 10 years ago, this feature wasn't present in most titles--now, there are hundreds of games that let you play alongside or against other players regardless of their platform of choice.\n\nCross-platform games are still few and far between in the grand scheme of things, so it might be difficult to discern which have the feature andare worth playing. If you have friends with a different system but want to play together, we've assembled a look at the 33 best cross-platform games you can play right now. This list is in no particular order. Be sure to also check out our lists of the best PS5 games, best Switch games, best Xbox games, and best PC games.\n\nFortnite is the game that popularized the cross-platform feature when it was released back in 2017. More specifically, the battle royale mode that took over the gaming community in the late 2010s featured cross-platform play at a time when platform holders were resistant to the idea. Regardless of if you had a friend on PS4 and you were on PC, you could squad up with them by simply adding their Epic Games ID. Developer Epic Games is responsible for many industry standards we see today, but perhaps its most influential work came with adding the cross-platform feature into Fortnite--something that was initially \"accidentally\" added to the game before being pulled.\n\nCall of Duty has featured cross-platform play for several years at this point, and that didn’t change with the release of Black Ops 7. In addition to Warzone, which continually gets integrated with the mainline series games every year, Black Ops 7 features an extremely seamless cross-platform experience. However, players can choose to only matchmake with other players on the same platform as them, allowing PlayStation and Xbox users to avoid the potential cheating issues on PC. Whichever way you decide to play Call of Duty with your friends, there will always be a title to hop into and plenty to do once you're playing.\n\nSea of Thieves is a late bloomer when it comes to both the gameplay experience and cross-platform functionality. While cross-play has been available between Xbox and PC for years, the game recently came to PS5 and introduced an entirely new crop of players. PS5 users can take full advantage of cross-play and join up with friends on both Xbox and PC. More players getting to hop in and experience Sea of Thieves only bodes well for a game that has become one of the best co-op games on the market.\n\nEA's battle royale darling, Apex Legends, is one of the best free games on Steam and also lets you play with those on any platform. The free-to-play game came out of nowhere in 2019 and offered cross-platform features right out of the gate. Since its release, the Apex community has only gotten stronger and the game has an almost overwhelming amount of content to consume. There are ranked playlists, different battle royale modes, loads of customization, and new non-BR modes being added all the time. You can experience all of that with friends on any available platform.\n\nOne of the more recent additions on this list, Helldivers 2 has been an extremely pleasant surprise in 2024. Featuring extremely fun and inventive gameplay, few current games can match the same level of enjoyment Helldivers 2 offers. While the game's not currently available on Xbox, there's full cross-platform functionality between PS5 and PC. You and up to two friends can spread democracy across the universe, blowing away robots and bugs alike. Working together as a team of three is extremely rewarding, especially when your Stratagems are all working in concert. Friendly fire makes the action all the more chaotic and hilarious.\n\nDestiny 2 has become a live-service behemoth, releasing back in 2017 but still pulling in large numbers of players in 2024. While the cross-platform feature wasn't available at launch in Destiny 2, it has since become one of the game's main selling points. You can play with any friend, anywhere, as the game promotes. There's a little something for everyone in Destiny 2, as you can take part in both PvE and PvP modes, with PvE being the game's strong suit, where activities like raids and dungeons require intense cooperation amongst players. Best of all, though, the base game in Destiny 2 is completely free. You can check out our previous list of the best free games in 2024 as well.\n\nOften referred to as \"car soccer,\" Rocket League is one of the longest-running games on this list. Cross-play was added post-launch, and the way it works has slightly changed over the years, especially after Epic Games acquired developer Psyonix, but the functionality is still as seamless as ever. Rocket League features one of the highest skill ceilings of any multiplayer game on the market, but it's incredibly enjoyable to learn and play. You can experience car soccer for yourself at no charge.\n\nDead by Daylight is an online survival game with some horror elements, but nothing too major that you have to play it with the lights on. The premise of the game is simple, as there's one killer in a lobby with four other players. The killer attempts to, you guessed it, eliminate the four players while the players band together to survive. You can use a myriad of tools and equipment to stop the killer, but the killer has access to some lethal weapons as well. There's cross-play available across all of Dead by Daylight's platforms, and the game is a true treat with a full lobby of friends.\n\nIf you're a fan of cross-platform games, you knew this entry was coming. Minecraft is one of the most successful video games of all time, reaching as far as any game can in the modern world. There are dozens of different ways to play Minecraft, and all of them offer cross-platform functionality. Unfortunately, if you're on PS3 or Xbox 360, you won't get to partake in any cross-play features. The rest of the platforms can join up with anyone else, provided you're all on the same edition of Minecraft. The timeless crafting/survival gameplay lets you adventure with friends, building bases, and exploring limitless worlds.\n\nOverwatch 2 carried over plenty of features from the original game, and cross-play was one of them. Cross-play in Overwatch 2 works exactly as it did in the first game, allowing you to play in a lobby with any other player. This is a great feature for Overwatch 2, as playing as a team is critical due to the interplay between support characters, tanks, and damage dealers. You and your friends can tackle both unranked and ranked playlists as well as other modes that are available with the various in-game seasons. Having everyone pick their hero and work through a map in unison is a terrific feeling.\n\nNBA 2K is another long-running franchise that has featured cross-platform play. Similar to how other online games operate, though, NBA 2K26 only allows cross-platform functionality for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users. If you're on a last-generation console, PC, or Nintendo Switch 2, you won't have any sort of access to cross-platform features. The game features a revamped hub area, The City, where players can engage with their friends as well as random players in a massive online environment.\n\nBefore No Man's Sky launched, the developers at Hello Games promised that you could run into other players when exploring the vast universe. That initially turned out to be untrue but was eventually corrected following a series of updates as No Man's Sky slowly won back the trust of its community. Now, you can run into other players as well as play with any player, regardless of their platform. Cross-play is terrific in No Man's Sky, as you and some friends can roam the galaxy together, build bases on new planets, take part in intergalactic warfare with other players, and complete quests at various space stations.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic in 2020, certain games became instant phenomenons within the community as everyone was gaming at home. Fall Guys came out at the perfect time, and it just so happened to be one of the more enjoyable and inventive titles of the past few years at the time of its release. A new take on the battle royale genre, you control a bean as you maneuver different obstacle courses and try to be the last player standing in a lobby of 60. You can party up with any player on any platform and compete against them to prove you're the superior gamer.\n\nSpeaking of games that became popular during the pandemic, few games have brought the gaming community together like Among Us did in 2020. Among Us blended strategy and horror with the murder mystery genre to create an experience like few others. You and other players all load into a map, where your main job is to complete various tasks. However, one player has been designated as the impostor, whose job is to blend in and slowly eliminate other players without being caught. Among Us creates some truly hilarious moments, and you can experience it with anyone on any platform, even on mobile.\n\nIt was inevitable that one of the best MMORPGs would make this list, and it's only right that Final Fantasy XIV take the spot. One of the most-respected games in its genre, FFXIV is bursting with content and is still receiving regular expansions and updates. While it does cost money to experience the entire game, you can play the full story plus two expansions at no cost. Moreover, you can meet up with players across all of the available platforms. Whether you're completing quests, exploring new lands, training one of the many jobs, or taking part in combat, there's something for everyone in FFXIV.\n\nDiablo IV has kept a core audience in place with seasonal updates that keep adding content to Sanctuary. The ARPG features a fantastic base game with an enthralling story, interesting characters, and plenty of loot. The class system is also engaging, allowing you to fully shape your character's playstyle and your abilities. Diablo IV features full co-op with up to four players and those players can be from any available platform.\n\nOne of the titles that popularized the \"gacha\" system in games, Genshin Impact is a massive game that's still going strong in 2024. An open-world action-RPG, the title allows you to play as numerous characters and use a wide variety of weapons as you navigate an expansive map. Part of what makes Genshin Impact so popular is the party system, where you can join up on a friend's world and clear Domains or complete quests together. It doesn't matter what system a player is on; if they're playing, you can join their world, provided you're playing on the same Adventure Rank.\n\nThe term cross-play is technically spelled \"Krossplay\" in Mortal Kombat 1, but the feature still does everything you would expect it to do. Support for it was added in early 2024, allowing friends to fight each other in online playlists or private matches. However, cross-platform features aren't available for Nintendo Switch players. Mortal Kombat 1 doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to the fighting genre, but it's a highly enjoyable game with a high skill ceiling that's not for the faint of heart.\n\nRacing games aren't as plentiful in the market as they used to be, but it's difficult to beat the experience you can have in Forza Horizon 5. A true graphical marvel, Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible racing game that features a large open world set in a fictional version of Mexico and plenty to do across all the locations. You can unlock a myriad of vehicles, including iconic cars, and race against NPCs or real players. There are also dozens of other game modes to take part in, which you can do so against friends who are on Xbox or PC. It's one of the best games on Game Pass, meaning if you have a subscription, you'll be able to play it without buying it.\n\nThere's really no succinct way to describe what Roblox has evolved into. The game is essentially composed of thousands of other games, all available to download with a few clicks. The genres in Roblox are bountiful, with first-person shooters, RPGs, action-adventure games, strategy games, and more. If you want to take part in any specific game with a friend, all you need to ensure is they have the game properly downloaded. Mobile players can join up with console players and even VR users can create a part for anyone to join.\n\nA newer entry into the FPS genre, The Finals is a high-octane shooter that rewards ingenuity, aggressive gameplay, and accurate shots. You play across arenas that are all completely destructible, making each match feel different from the last depending on what you or others decide to destroy. The core feeling of The Finals is an arcade shooter where the goal is to eliminate enemy players, but it features more replayability than many FPS titles on the market today. You can experience the game in full cross-play with any other player regardless of platform.\n\nBorderlands 4 is the newest entry in the famed looter shooter franchise, and unlike its predecessor, Borderlands 3, the cross-platform features actually function correctly. All platforms feature cross-platform functionality, and the Shift system makes it fairly simple to use. Players just need to make a Shift account and then link it to their system. After that, other players can add you using that account, and then you can join their party to play through Borderlands 4 together. Ideally, most players in your party are roughly the same level, but you can still play with people who are at different parts in the story than you. Keep an eye on our list of Borderlands 4 Shift codes for an extra helping hand in snagging some sweet loot.\n\nChivarly 2 is a first-person action game that takes place in medieval times. You can take part in massive bow-and-arrow and sword-and-shield wars on a battlefield or mount a steed and take a more fast-paced approach to combat. The game takes you through historical battles, letting you live out what it was like for soldiers back in the medieval era. Chivarly 2 is incredibly realistic, allowing you to fight through an excessive amount of damage, and can be played with a friend on any available platform.\n\nWhile Smite might not be the most popular MOBA on the market, it's an enjoyable experience that you can play for free with friends and other players across any available system. Like most MOBAs, Smite features a steep learning curve, as you have to understand each character's abilities and how they work on the map. However, with time, you'll start to master the \"deities\" you enjoy playing as and can take that knowledge into several different game modes. It's also worth noting that Smite 2, the upcoming sequel to Smite, is also going to be cross-platform with the current-gen consoles and PC.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic takes players on a solo or co-op adventure to some of the deadliest mining locations across the galaxy. Players are tasked with clearing out mining sites that are infested with enemies, collecting resources and leveling up their character along the way. Deep Rock Galactic isn't technically classified as a looter shooter, so don't expect weapons and items to fall from the enemies you eliminate. However, there are horror elements and tons of randomized levels to clear out. Deep Rock Galactic supports cross-platform, albeit with some limitations: PS4 and PS5 players can join up together, but PC players need to be on the Xbox Store version of the game to link up with those on Xbox consoles. Users on Steam are limited to playing with other Steam players.\n\nSplit Fiction is the newest co-op adventure from developer Hazelight Studios, the same team behind former Game of the Year Winner It Takes Two. While Split Fiction isn't a sequel to It Takes Two by any means, it takes many of the concepts from the game and cranks them up a notch. You still have to have a partner to play the game, but the Friend's Pass makes it easy to invite any friend you want, regardless of their platform. It allows them to play with you without even buying the game.\n\nIn-game, you and your partner take control of two characters and they try to escape a virtual reality experiment gone wrong. You'll travel to cyberpunk-inspired cities and fantasy lands while engaging with a number of different genres along the way. There's platforming, third-person shooting, vehicle racing, and more awaiting you. It's a terrific experience, earning a rare 10 in GameSpot's Split Fiction review.\n\nThe Monster Hunter series is back with Monster Hunter Wilds. The new installment keeps the same formula in place from previous games in the series, but adds in several fan-requested mechanics, a dynamic world, and updates to combat that can change up your style from fight to fight. Some of the new features include a larger and more interactive map, the ability to ride around on a mount, and a secondary weapon that you can swap to at any time.\n\nThere's no shortage of content in Monster Hunter Wilds, as you can go through a 15-hour campaign and eventually reach the endgame, where dozens of more monsters and quests are awaiting your challenge. One of the best parts of your journey through this content is that you can play with up to three friends during any part of the game. That said, playing with those on other platforms can be unintuitive, so be sure to check out our Monster Hunter Wilds cross-platform explainer for assistance.\n\nMarvel Rivals took the gaming industry by storm at the tail end of 2024, and it's still going strong in 2025. The free-to-play hero shooter utilizes a lineup of nearly 40 Marvel characters that you can use throughout a variety of modes. Each one of these heroes possesses different abilities and has a designated role: Vanguard, Duelist, or Strategist. Every match in Marvel Rivals can only have one of every hero per team, so it's worthwhile to master several characters in case your main gets taken.\n\nAside from the heroes, Marvel Rivals features several maps, casual and ranked modes, and a plethora of events and cosmetics. An important distinction to make with Marvel Rivals is that you can only use cross-platform play in casual modes; ranked modes require you to play with players solely on your platform.\n\nTekken 8 is the first game in the storied franchise to implement any form of cross-platform play. The eighth installment of the long-running series is what fans have come to expect from the fighting game genre. You have access to a huge lineup of fighters that you can use to go through the story mode with or engage in multiplayer fights with online players. There are some quirky game modes as well, such as Tekken Ball, where you're fighting a real opponent but using a beach ball instead of your fists/feet.\n\nAlso, even a year after its release, Tekken 8 is still delivering impactful updates that change the game on the fly. The recent Season 2 update completely changed several different characters to make them stronger, added a new character, and adjusted combat across the board.\n\nThe tactical, first-person shooter genre has started to evolve over the past several years, as games like Valorant have added new spins to change up the formula. FragPunk is the latest game to add a twist on the genre, delivering high-octane gameplay that incorporates both existing and fresh mechanics. Every FragPunk match consists of a team of individual Lancers, who all have unique abilities that need to be purchased through the game's economy system. You can also purchase weapons and equipment with the money you earn throughout the match.\n\nHowever, the major curveball that FragPunk throws is the introduction of Shard Cards. These can be used at the start of a match and implement new twists that every player has to adapt to. Depending on what cards and Lancers are used, matches can play out completely differently. FragPunk delivers cross-platform play across all modes, so you can easily figure out a strategy with your team before each begins.\n\nPath of Exile 2 is an ARPG that plays extremely similarly to something like Diablo IV. You can pick from a variety of different classes that offer completely unique playstyles, abilities, and gear preferences. You'll then enter the world that's cut up into levels and different areas within those levels. Each level contains several bosses, side quests, and a main hub town. The main draw of Path of Exile 2 is its extraordinary class design, which allows you to craft thousands of in-depth character builds using passive and active abilities as well as specific gear. You'll often need to design new builds as you progress the story in PoE 2, as the difficulty curve in-game is something ARPG fans might not be used to. Enemies and bosses can be very tough to defeat, and there's no way to lower your difficulty other than playing in a group with friends so you can maximize your damage output.\n\nAfter a couple of years of waiting, cross-platform play was finally added to Baldur's Gate 3 in one of the game's final updates. You can now play with up to three other players in your party, and all of them can be on different platforms. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best RPGs and video games to be released in recent memory. It's a stunning role-playing experience that allows you to fully create a character from scratch or use an existing pre-made character with their own backstory, abilities, and attributes. Once your character is made, you'll embark on an incredible journey that sees you travel through several massive levels, all of which have dozens of characters to meet and interact with, in-depth quests to take on, and secrets to uncover. The combat in Baldur's Gate 3 is turn-based, so if you're not used to that style, you'll have to take some time to understand it. Once you do, though, every combat situation is enthralling as you try to figure out the best strategy to take out enemies with your party and all of their unique characters.\n\nSplit Fiction is a co-op game that requires two players to play; there's no solo option or any form of online matchmaking. This means you have to find a friend who's willing to play with you. Fortunately, Split Fiction is fully cross-platform and only makes one person buy the game, as the Friend Pass allows your buddy to join for free. The other player just has to accept an invite code. From there, you and your partner will start your split-screen adventure in Split Fiction. The game follows two author protagonists as they get entangled in a virtual mess that results in them being stuck in the plot of each other's book ideas. Using co-op mechanics and communication, you and your partner will experience jaw-dropping visuals, hilarious moments, and several side stories that will keep you thoroughly entertained as you work your way through the game. Split Fiction also features some varied combat, vehicles, and plenty of other wacky mechanics that always keep you guessing throughout every level.",
