    "fullText": "PlayStation 5 (version tested), Xbox, PC; Grasshopper Manufacture/Marvelous Inc \nAfter some dumb fun hacking at zombies, legendary developer Suda51’s first original game in a decade sadly only delivers a host of incoherent disappointments\n\nEver since he baffled GameCube owners with 2005’s Killer7, Japanese game director Suda51 has had a reputation for turning heads. From parodying the banality of open-world games with 2007’s No More Heroes to collaborating with James Gunn for 2012’s pulpy Lollipop Chainsaw, his games often offer a welcome reprieve from soulless, half-a-billion-dollar-budget gaming blockbusters. It was with considerable excitement that I fired up Suda’s first new game in 10 years.\n\nThe game kicks off with a slick cartoon that shows our hero, Romeo Stargazer, being eaten by a zombie. Hastily resurrected by his zany scientist grandfather, Romeo returns from the brink imbued with new powers – and then we’re off. Almost immediately I am bombarded by an impenetrable wall of proper-noun nonsense. It’s like this for the next 20 hours.\n\nRomeo is now a “deadman” – a being trapped between life and death – who has been recruited by the FBI’s space time police to stop interstellar criminals from terrorising the cosmos. Along the way you’ll be taking down wave after wave of unstoppable zombies – known in this world inexplicably as “bastards” – while a woman called Juliet sporadically appears in different dimensions, terrorising your dreams in PS2-era 3D, before battling you as an end of level boss. If this description sounds like it’s been written by a kid who hasn’t done his homework, I’m sorry to say that’s because even after playing this game to completion, I’m still none the wiser.\n\nIn an interview last year, Suda cited Rick and Morty as a major influence on Romeo Is a Dead Man, struggling to explain the game’s story while espousing his love of chicken katsu and sticking it to “the bastards”. I remained hopeful that there would be a deeper meaning underneath all the bafflingly juvenile nonsense, but more fool me.\n\nOutside of the story, the game itself initially seems promising. Main missions see you swinging a legally distinct lightsabre as you carve up wave after wave of “bastards”, playing like a souped up successor to the seminal No More Heroes series. Hacking and slashing at zombies is dumb fun, with stylish attacks inviting screen-filling bursts of colour. The boss fights are fun and stylised, and everything feels satisfyingly chaotic. Yet as the game drags its nonsensical story kicking and screaming to the end, even the game engine decides it’s had enough. Despite reviewing this on a PS5 Pro, I found that the frame rate regularly slowed to a crawl as I was mobbed by waves of enemies in later levels, making an already flawed game almost unplayable.\n\nIn between inter-dimensional killing sprees, players roam a charmingly retro hub world – your FBI-branded spaceship. Here everything is depicted in 16bit-era 2D pixel art, as you roam the spacecraft chatting to Romeo’s shipmates – which include an ancient Roman god, a talking cat and a Jamaican journalist. You can buy new stuff, play mini games and tend ability-granting plants inspired by the different zombies you slay along the way.\n\nOne thing Romeo Is a Dead Man has going for it is it’s always interesting to look at. From fully animated cartoon sequences to PS2-tribute polygons and sculpture-esque art, this is a game that features more disparate visual styles than most game publishers’ entire catalogue. Yet while it looks eye-catching in trailers, the final playable collage ultimately feels less auteur-led and closer to a child mashing together all the disparate contents of their toybox.\n\nRomeo Is a Dead Man is certainly not predictable. It’s capable of getting a baffled smile out of you, and its anti-gaming-establishment attitude will have diehard fans searching for an irony-drenched reason to celebrate it. But where No More Heroes’ simplistic yarn kept the fights flowing and the jokes rolling, Romeo Is a Dead Man’s sprawl feels disappointingly directionless. Instead of coming together as a kitschy universe-spanning epic, this sci-fi story is sadly told with all the mastery of a rambling drunk in Wetherspoons.\n\nRomeo Is a Dead Man is out 11 Feb; $49.99",

    "fullText": "Ergonomic shape, quality materials and satisfying clicks, now with novel haptic feedback and repairable design\n\nLogitech’s latest productivity power-house updates one of the greatest mice of all time with smoother materials, a repair-friendly design and a haptic motor for phone-like vibrations on your desktop.\n\nThe MX Master 4 is the latest evolution in a line of pioneering mice that dates back more than 20 years and has long been the mouse to beat for everything but hardcore PC gaming. Having given it a magnetic free-spinning scroll wheel, plenty of buttons and precise tracking, now Logitech is trying something different for its seven-generation: the ability to tap back at you.\n\nThis level of innovation doesn’t come cheap. The MX Master 4 costs £119.99 (€129.99/$119.99/A$199.95), placing it firmly in the premium market alongside high-end gaming mice and expensive peripherals aimed at creative professionals.\n\nThe overall ergonomic shape of the mouse remains very similar to the previous outstanding versions from 2019 and 2022. It is finely balanced providing great grip, support to your palm and eight buttons all within easy reach – no stretching required – but it is only available for the right-hand.\n\nEverything about the mouse feels high quality and satisfying to use. After user feedback, the materials have since been updated to be harder wearing and easier to clean (no one likes a grubby mouse).\n\nThe button clicks feel strong but are virtually silent, which will please those around you. The best-in-class MagSpeed scroll wheel uses magnets to create a silent ratchet for line-byline movement, but flick it hard enough and the magnets disengage to allow it to spin freely like a flywheel so you can effortlessly shoot through documents or pages.\n\nThe thumb scroll wheel, back and forward buttons and the gesture button are better placed than previous iterations and are particularly useful for scrolling around in photography or design packages. Press the gesture button to switch between windows by default without having to reach for the keyboard.\n\nBelow this is the new haptic button. Press it to invoke Logitech’s “actions ring”, which is a circle of app-aware actions around your cursor you can quickly click without reaching for a menu or keyboard shortcut.\n\nThe haptic feedback is a click or tap similar to a modern laptop trackpad or the little vibrations from virtual buttons on your phone, first when depressed and again when you mouse over an on-screen button. The ring is customisable and provides rapid access to useful tools, such as volume and playback control, screenshots or AI tools on the desktop or the crop tool, layers or colour picker in apps such as Adobe’s Photoshop, Lightroom or Premiere Pro.\n\nThe haptics can also be used for certain actions outside of button presses. It can tap when your mouse moves from one display to another or gives feedback when you adjust sliders, snap to a grid or have finished exporting a clip in various Adobe apps.\n\nThe feedback shows a lot of promise but it relies on plugins for individual apps to be installed from the Logi Marketplace, of which there are just seven available at the moment, including for the Adobe creative suite or Zoom. If you use alternatives, such as the Affinity suite by Canva, you are out of luck.\n\nDimension: 128.2 x 88.4 x 50.8mm\n\nConnection: Bluetooth 5.1 or Logi Bolt USB\n\nSensor sensitivity: 200-8,000 DPI\n\nThe mouse connects to any Bluetooth device, so can work with computers, tablets, phones and other devices, but it can also use the Logi Bolt USB-C dongle for computers, which provides a more secure connection. The mouse can remember three devices at once, switching between them via button on the underside – handy for use with different computers or tablets.\n\nIt works on practically any surface, including glass, without the need for a mouse pad and the battery lasts about 70 days of typical use, charging via USB-C.\n\nIn a first for the line, the mouse is designed to be disassembled with exposed screws and has a battery that can be replaced at home with instructions, meaning this could be the last mouse you ever need.\n\nThe mouse’s basic functionality works without any additional software, but the actions ring, smart actions, AI, more advanced haptic feedback and many other productivity features require the free Logi Options+ app for macOS and Windows.\n\nThe software offers a lot of customisation and optional tools, and can be safely left to run in the background most of the time, but was recently subject to a complete failure. It has worked reliably with the MX Master 4, but occasionally has problems detecting other Logitech Bluetooth keyboards and is notorious for consuming computer resources unnecessarily.\n\nThe MX Master 4 is made from recycled plastic and cobalt. It can easily disassembled at home with standard exposed screws, including replacing the battery which costs £22.99.\n\nThe Logitech MX Master 4 costs £119.99 (€129.99/$119.99/A$199.95)\n\nFor comparison, the MX Master 3S costs £89.99, Keychron M6 costs £54.99 and the Razer Basilisk Mobile costs £89.99.\n\nThe MX Master 4 takes one of the best productivity mice, makes a bunch of refinements to make it even better, and adds the potentially gamechanging haptic feedback.\n\nUnfortunately, how much use you get out of the excellent haptic system relies entirely on plugins being available for the apps you use, which is great for the Adobe creative suite of apps, but not much more.\n\nThe Master 4 is super comfortable to use for extended periods, is quiet and has all the right buttons in the right places, including its best-in-class scroll wheel. Having Bluetooth and the Logi Bolt dongle makes it easy to use with several devices. The collection of useful additional productivity tools via the Logi Options+ app can speed up your workflow no end with a bit of power-user configuration.\n\nIt is an expensive, luxury mouse. But it is the best productivity mouse you can get and with a repairable design and a battery you can change at home, it may just be the last mouse you need.\n\nPros: super comfortable, excellent design and button placement, best-in-class scroll wheel, quiet, innovative haptics have potential, plenty of customisation options, serious productivity tools including the actions ring and smart actions\n\nCons: expensive, not many plugins available to support the haptics, Logi Options+ can be a resource hog, right-handed only.",

    "fullText": "Nintendo’s monster-collecting franchise was pilloried as a ‘pestilential Ponzi scheme’ in the 90s. But as its celebrates its 30th birthday, it now stands as a powerful example of video games’ ability to connect people\n\nWhen I was 11, it was my dream to compete in the Pokémon World Championships, held in Sydney in 2000. I’d come across it in a magazine, and then earnestly set about training teams of creatures, transferring them between my Pokémon Red Game Boy cartridge and the 3D arenas of Pokémon Stadium on the Nintendo 64. I never made it as a player but I did finally achieve this dream on my 26th birthday, when I went to Washington DC to cover the world championships as a journalist. I was deeply moved. Presided over by a giant inflatable Pikachu hanging from the ceiling, the competitors and spectators were united in an unselfconscious love for these games, with their colourful menageries and heartfelt messaging about trust, friendship and hard work.\n\nIt is emotional to see the winners lift their trophies after a tense final round of battles, as overwhelmed by their success as any sportsperson. But it’s the pride that the smaller competitors’ parents show in their mini champions that really gets to me. During the first wave of Pokémania in the late 90s, Pokémon was viewed with suspicion by most adults. Now that the first generation of Pokémaniacs have grown up, even becoming parents ourselves, we see it for what it is: an imaginative, challenging and really rather wholesome series of games that rewards every hour that children devote to it.\n\nOver the three decades since the original Red and Blue (or Green, in Asia) versions of the video game were released in Japan in 1996, Pokémon has earned a place among the greats of children’s fiction. Like Harry Potter, the Famous Five and Narnia, it offers a powerful fantasy of self-determination, set in a world almost totally free of adult supervision. In every game, your mother sends you out into the world with a rucksack and a kiss goodbye; after that, it’s all on you.\n\nLike The Simpsons, Pokémon is a kind of cultural shorthand for the millennial generation. More than Mario, Zelda or any other Nintendo creation, Pokémon brings people together. It was designed from the beginning to be a social game, encouraging (and indeed necessitating) that players traded and battled with each other to complete their collection of virtual creatures and train their teams up into super-squads. Today, the internet has entirely normalised the idea of video games as social activities, but in the late 90s this was a novel idea. You can’t play Pokémon without other people: in 1999, that meant huddling in the playground, using a cable to link your Game Boys together; later, in 2016, at the height of the Pokémon Go phenomenon, it meant hundreds of people converging improbably at the same park with their phones to catch a Gengar.\n\nPokémon is often thought of as a turn-of-the-century fad, so it might be surprising to learn that it brings in more money now than it ever did at the height of its first wave of popularity. It has become the highest-grossing entertainment franchise of all time: between the TV series, the merchandise, the trading cards, the games and everything else adorned with the adorable faces of Pikachu and pals, the franchise has brought in north of $100bn, more than Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThis global phenomenon has its roots in Machida, a city on the outskirts of Tokyo, where Pokémon’s creator Satoshi Tajiri was born in 1965. Like many Japanese children in the 60s and 70s, little Satoshi collected bugs, becoming such an expert that his elementary school classmates referred to him as Dr Bug. As a teenager a new obsession arrived: video games, then just making their way into Japanese arcades. His enthusiasm was such that he started putting together a monthly zine, with his friend Ken Sugimori, called Game Freak – later the name of the video game development company they founded together, which still adorns the title screens of modern Pokémon games.\n\nThe idea for Pokémon began to percolate for Tajiri around 1990. Watching people link their Game Boys together with cables to play Tetris, the hit puzzle game, he envisioned the bugs he’d collected crawling between the consoles. But it took six long years for this idea to transform into a monochrome world full of 151 collectible critters, in chunky black Game Boy pixels. During this time the developer nearly went bust several times, taking on projects for Nintendo and other game developers to keep afloat; Tajiri regularly went without a salary.\n\nPokémon’s astronomical success wasn’t instant, but the result of slow-burning sales over years. When it eventually came out in 1996, Pocket Monsters Red and Green – as they were known in Japan – were indie underdogs, made by a tiny team with limited technology for the ageing handheld Game Boy console. Nobody expected it to be much of a hit, but the world of Pokémon Blue has an unexpected sense of place that transcends their technical limitations. The symbiotic relationship between humans, nature and Pokémon permeates every aspect of life, and is often quite touching – particularly at in-game locations such as Lavender Town, where the mourning owners of dead Pokémon come to honour them at a giant commemorative tower.\n\nBut the real marketable genius of Pokémon was the fact that the game came in different versions. The reason that Pokémon games always come in pairs is that different monsters reside in each cartridge. If you want to collect them all, to complete your Pokédex field guide, you need to trade them. Creatures could be sent between cartridges, so friends with different versions of the game could help each other accumulate covetable creatures. With Tetris, the Game Boy’s link cable was used for competition. Here it was used for connection.\n\nPokémon’s popularity spread through playground word-of-mouth. By the time it arrived in the US in 1998, and Europe in 1999, it was already a franchise: Pikachu-adorned games, TV shows, toys, films and lunchboxes, were rolled out carefully by marketers with a proven playbook.\n\nToday, Tajiri is a reclusive figure. Almost everything we know about him comes from a single 1999 interview with Time magazine. The tone of Time’s piece is shockingly dismissive. Declaring the series “a pestilential Ponzi scheme” it describes the “delinquent” and “criminal” behaviour of young Pokémon fans, and the moral bankruptcy of the whole craze – which, it comforts, is likely to peter out soon, like it did for the Power Rangers.\n\nNow that Pokémon has become one of the most enduring and successful entertainment properties of all time, this alarmist attitude seems ridiculous. But the scaremongering was very real. Some of this was simply older people failing to understand the new thing that the kids were into. But there was also an alarmingly xenophobic flavour to the moral panic, this scary Japanese thing with its sinister monsters coming over the seas to captivate children. Christian pastors in the US were proclaiming Pikachu to be a demon. There were movements to ban the TV show from airing.\n\nPerhaps understandably, given the disrespectful and, presumably, hurtful tone of that Time interview, and the moral panic that Pokémania unwittingly ignited, Satoshi Tajiri has shunned the limelight ever since. Now 60, he remains at Game Freak and is still involved in the creation of each new Pokémon game (as of 2025, there are 38 in total), though he reportedly stepped back from day-to-day development in 2012.\n\nJuly 2016 saw the launch of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that quickly became the most popular in US history, with 232 million players across the world. Pokémon Go works kind of like magic. With the app open, you walk around your neighbourhood; on your phone screen, you see a map of your real surroundings, with icons showing where Pokémon might be found. When you encounter a creature it is superimposed on your real surroundings, a Gengar posing casually in your local park. From there you simply flick a Pokéball at the creatures to capture them.\n\nThere’s a unique aspect too to Pokémon Go that makes it different to every other video game-related phenomenon I’ve witnessed. Most of the time when we talk about how games can help people through hard times, we talk about escapism: how virtual worlds can be a reprieve from the problems of the real one. But Pokémon Go was not so much about escapism as connection, a continuation of the lineage of those first games decades before.\n\nAt its height, it connected its players with their local area and the people around them. For a few months, there we were, all looking at our surroundings through a different lens, thinking that there might be a little bit of magic out there in the world, like a bug hiding under a rock.\n\nDr Bug may not be as involved as before, but the pastoral nature he instilled in Pokémon has persisted throughout the last 30 years: the interrelationships between people and Pokémon form the touching core of the games, movies and TV shows, and there is even a quasi-environmentalist bent to its stories. This is, after all, a game about evolution and living in harmony with the natural world. There is a resonance with nature that prevents this $100bn franchise from feeling nakedly cynical or exploitative. Pokémon’s story speaks to an important truth about video games: they are a powerful vector for connection between people. Millions are united by these imaginary creatures, born from one boy’s love of the natural world.\n\nSuper Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun by Keza MacDonald is published by Guardian Faber.

    "fullText": "Perfect Tides perfectly captures the older millennial college experience, and a time when nobody worried about being embarrassing online\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nI’ve noticed an interesting micro-trend emerging in the last few years: millennial nostalgia games. Not just ones that adopt the aesthetic of Y2K gaming – think Crow Country or Fear the Spotlight’s deliberately retro PS1-style fuzzy polygons – but semi-autobiographical games specifically about the millennial experience. I’ve played three in the past year. Despelote is set in 2002 in Ecuador and is played through the eyes of a football-obsessed eight-year-old. The award-winning Consume Me is about being a teen girl battling disordered eating in the 00s. And this week I played a point-and-click adventure game about being a college student in the early 2000s.\n\nPerfect Tides: Station to Station is set in New York in 2003 – a year that is the epitome of nostalgia for the micro-generation that grew up without the internet but came of age online. It was before Facebook, before the smartphone, but firmly during the era of late-night forum browsing and instant-messenger conversations. The internet wasn’t yet a vector for mass communication, but it could still bring you together with other people who loved the things that you loved, people who read the same hipster blogs and liked the same bands. The protagonist, Mara, is a student and young writer who works in her college library.\n\nThe earnestness with which Perfect Tides presents the college experience – quoting full paragraphs from pretentious texts, awkward interactions with classmates, stilted phone calls with Mara’s boyfriend back home – predates the concept of cringe. A key difference between the millennial generation and that of gen Z is that millennials did not grow up curating an online image on social media, and therefore had a much lesser terror of being perceived. We’d put up entire albums of terrible, blurry photos from a single night out, write nonstop on LiveJournal, produce appalling juvenilia and then post it on fanfic or art forums.\n\nNaturally, we find this embarrassing now, as do the younger generation, who enjoy making fun of millennial cringe. But Perfect Tides takes place in a time where nobody was worried about being embarrassing online or, indeed, in person. It’s a time before “hipster” emerged as an insult. Mara inhales everything around her – an anarchist philosophy book, music and movies, everything she hears professors say in class, new relationships – and reading, talking to other characters, and writing essays deepens her understanding of these topics, opening up new avenues of conversation in turn. It’s a cute way of gamifying the process of expanding your intellectual and taste horizons. She’s at an age where every experience and idea is new.\n\nPerfect Tides shares an aesthetic with Consume Me. Each embrace the sometimes messy pixel-art of 90s computer adventure games – but Consume Me’s tone is comedic and satirical where Perfect Tides’ is earnest. Both, however, are part of a long tradition of coming-of-age stories that emerge from every generation that has had the luxury of education and a free-form young adulthood. “Emerging adulthood”, a phrase coined by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett in 2000, is a useful descriptor for this stage of life: the extended period of identity formation, distinct from adolescence, that usually happens between 18 and 29 in societies where it is economically possible and culturally permissible for young adults to pursue further education.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is an especially redolent and memorable period of life, which is why there are so very many novels, films and TV shows about young adulthood. Playing Perfect Tides reminded me of Douglas Coupland’s youth-memoir novel, Generation X, which was part of the cultural canon when I was a teenager. And it makes sense that the first generation to truly grow up with games – my generation – is now making sense of those experiences through creating games. The bildungsroman of the 1800s has become the autobiographical indie game of the 2020s.\n\nIt is the very specificity of Perfect Tides – the year, the setting, Mara herself – that makes it feel so human and personal. You don’t have to be part of a specific generation to appreciate that generation’s art: when I read autofiction set in the 1960s or the 80s, I learn something about what it felt like to be alive in that time. When I play these millennial autofiction games, I relate to them more closely – there are aspects of Mara’s young-adulthood experience that closely mirror my own – but I’m still learning something. By spending a little time in these fictionalised memories, I’m learning how someone else experienced those same formative years.\n\nLook, I just can’t face another capitalist-dystopia piece of media at the moment. So I’m going to have to save Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator for a little later in the year, when I’m feeling more resilient. In this strategy-game-meets-stock-market simulator, you bet your credits on the life outcomes of fictional alien babies, watching their lives play out in text alerts. This anticapitalist satirical offering is from the people at Strange Scaffold, a studio that has now made a profitable habit of turning tweet-length jokes into full games (see also Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion and An Airport for Aliens Run By Dogs).\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 1-3 hours\n\nSony has patented the idea of personalised AI podcasts hosted by characters from its games. I am equal parts horrified and darkly amused by the thought of PaRappa the Rapper reading out patch notes.\n\nUK game retailer GAME has died yet another death, reports the Game Business, having struggled since the early 2010s. Its last three shops will close, and most of its other operations have already wound down. It will continue to exist within Sports Direct and House of Fraser stores.\n\nI’m still not done thinking about Hollow Knight Silksong, so I enjoyed this article by Nicole Clark, on the new feminist games website Mothership, about the game’s unexpected compassion.\n\nBloomberg visited Obsidian – one of Microsoft’s most interesting developers – for this studio profile, in which its leaders talk about how they ended up releasing three games in 2025.\n\nAnd finally: my book about Nintendo is finally out this week in the US, and next week in the UK. I’m doing a bunch of launch events in Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews, London and Brighton. I’d love to see you there – tickets are here.\n\nThere’s a reason that Wii Bowling remains my mum’s favourite game of all time | Dominik Diamond\n\nCairn – obsession, suffering and awe in a climbing game that hits exhausting new heights | ★★★★☆\n\nIron Lung – YouTuber Markiplier crash lands with big-screen sci-fi horror | ★★☆☆☆\n\nThis week’s question comes from reader Gavin:\n\n“Could you explain the current debate around physical game ownership v digital? And the grey area of buying a digital code in a physical box? I can’t imagine those codes will be collector’s items in 10 years’ time ...”\n\nOnce upon a time, all video games came on cassette tapes, discs or cartridges, usually in tragically damage-prone cardboard boxes, with paper manuals. Then, when digital downloads became practical, we had a choice: either you buy your game on a disc in a box, or you go for the convenience of a downloaded version that exists on your hard drive. Now, however, it is difficult or even impossible to buy many games in a physical format. And even when you do, the disc simply prompts a 50GB download, or the box contains nothing but a redeemable code.\n\nDigital downloads are preferable for the businesses that run the gaming industry, for two reasons. Firstly: there are no manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs. Secondly: Sony, Apple, Steam, Microsoft or Nintendo gets around a 30% cut of every game sold digitally on their platforms, which is essentially free money for them. At one point, game retailers had too much power for these platform holders to abandon physical games: too many copies of FIFA and COD were sold at branches of GAME. But now, with bricks-and-mortar game retail a vanishing business, digital downloads are the norm.\n\nDigital downloads are convenient for players, of course, but they also come with huge disadvantages. What you’re buying is a licence, which at some theoretical future point could expire or become unusable, rendering your games unplayable. You can’t sell on a digital code or transfer ownership. For this reason a lot of people still prefer physical media, of all kinds. And everybody hates code-in-a-box. It’s the worst of both worlds.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "fullText": "With the incredible market demand around DDR5 memory and significantly elevated pricing on the more premium DDR5 memory modules, as part of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D launch there's been some communication that thanks to 2nd Gen AMD 3D V-Cache, using lower memory speeds like DDR5-4800 can be suitable without much of an impact to the gaming performance. But what about for Linux gaming? And other workloads with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D? Complementing yesterday's Linux review of the Ryzen 7 9850X3D are benchmarks of DDR5-4800 vs. DDR5-6000 performance with Ubuntu Linux and this new 3D V-Cache 8-core / 16-thread desktop processor.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D Linux review was done with the GSKILL DDR5-6000 EXPO memory along with the other tested processors while today's article is evaluating the performance of the 9850X3D across 300+ workloads when paired running at DDR5-4800 speeds.\n\nAMD's messaging with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D with DDR5-4800 is that for gaming there can be minimal performance impact compared to using DDR5-6000. They cited 2 x 16GB DDR5-4800 DIMMs costing around $400 to 2 x 16GB DDR5-6000 DIMMs for around ~$470 USD. The prices are very volatile still and so the testing in this article is focusing solely on the performance impact and thus the performance-per-dollar/value being an exercise for the reader depending upon your local memory pricing and whether you'd plan to re-use existing DDR5 memory in your possession or not.\n\nThese benchmarks are mainly done for reference purposes in seeing the performance difference of DDR5-4800 vs. DDR5-6000 not only for gaming but other workloads to help you decide in the cost/benefits of opting for DDR5-6000+ as opposed to potentially going for lower-cost DDR5-4800 DIMMs or re-using some existing DIMMs if you are considering an upgrade to the new AMD 3D V-Cache Zen 5 processors.\n\nThe testing with the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D on the ASRock X870E Taichi was done while running Ubuntu 25.10 with the Linux 6.17 kernel. Thanks to AMD for supplying the review hardware for making this independent benchmarking comparison possible.",

    "fullText": "Accused, isolated and constantly under scrutiny, The Traitors contestant drew on years of social deduction gaming to stay calm under pressure\n\nThe latest series of The Traitors, which ended last week on a nail-biting finale, featured some of the usual characters – from guileless extroverts to wannabe Columbos endlessly observing fellow contestants for the slightest flicker of treachery. But one faithful stood out for her quiet determination, despite a ceaseless onslaught of suspicion and accusation. That person was Jade Scott, and I wasn’t at all surprised when, quite early on in the series, she revealed she was a keen gamer.\n\n“Minecraft was my way in, when I was 15,” she says. “I made loads of friends at school playing that.” From this innocent introduction, however, she moved on to darker titles: the first-person shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and the multiplayer battle-arena game Dota. “That’s where my interest in strategy gaming really kicked in,” she says.\n\nThe Traitors is, after all, a game in a way that other reality TV shows aren’t. It’s heavily inspired by the parlour game variously known as werewolf or mafia, in which participants use social deduction skills to identify a murderer in their midst. Indeed, the original version of the show, the Dutch series De Verraders, emerged after the first Covid lockdown, during which hundreds of thousands of people had discovered the multiplayer online game Among Us, in which a group of players have to carry out menial tasks on a spaceship while working out which of them is a killer. So a video game player would have an advantage in The Traitors, right?\n\nIn the year up to appearing on the show Scott had been playing two indie games based around social deduction: the survival adventure Project Winter and the office satire, Dale & Dawson Stationery Supplies. Both require groups of players to carry out a range of tasks in a high-tension environment, while a select few are there to sabotage progress. The honest workers must discover and unmask the miscreants before it’s too late. She was, effectively, in training to be a faithful.\n\n“I always wanted to go in as a faithful,” she confirms. “My opinion has changed on this since leaving the castle, but I always thought the game was way harder for the faithfuls and I like playing games on a harder setting. As a faithful you’re trying to solve who the traitors are, but as a traitor, I thought you lost out on that puzzle-solving aspect. My strategy was to go in and immediately garner some suspicion, because that way you’re protected from murder … I just didn’t realise how much suspicion I would get!”\n\nIndeed, Scott was a constant target of accusations and suspicion. It was difficult. With gaming, you sit behind a screen, and communicating via Discord, so you just start talking and build friendly relationships with people, but with The Traitors, you have nothing to hide behind. It was a very different environment in which to think about strategy and how I communicate with people.”\n\nSo did the tactics she’d learned playing games such as Project Winter and Dale & Dawson immediately fall apart? “I was quite good at defending myself at the roundtable,” she says. “A lot of that came out of the practice I got with social deception games. The second you approach the table with some logic and reasoning, and say, ‘I understand why you think that, but I have done nothing to suggest it’, they have nothing to argue with. I also didn’t feel I had anything to prove to anyone – I think, when you’re on the defensive, it makes it worse if you go around and try to mingle. I was thinking, if I go up and speak to this person does it just look like I’m trying to get in their good books?”\n\nOne aspect Scott definitely took from playing strategy sims was observing the mechanics of the game and making notes. “I had different formats,” she says. “Every day I had a sort of traffic light system of how I felt about each person. Green indicated who I thought was a faithful, although you’re never 100 per cent sure – and inevitably those people would just get murdered! Red was who I was more convinced was a traitor at that point. I also wrote everyone’s names on a piece of paper and then I’d draw lines between them, based on who I saw having conversations – a bit like those cork boards TV detectives use, with the red lines between photos. I’ve alluded to this previously, but I’d stare and stare at that page and the only contestants I hadn’t drawn lines between were Rachel and Stephen. I was so busy working out ways to defend myself … you just miss the obvious, don’t you?”\n\nSince leaving The Traitors castle, Scott says she hasn’t played a social deduction game – perhaps she’s done with fielding other people’s suspicions. Now she’s moved on to games such as Outer Wilds and Blue Prince, which pitch you against strange puzzling environments rather than other human beings. There’s been another interesting effect of her time on The Traitors, though. Currently studying for a PhD, she thinks her experiences at the sharp end of the roundtable have been extremely useful for one particular aspect. “Something I’ve been really apprehensive about, and I think a lot of PhD students are the same, is the viva,” she says. “You literally sit in a room with examiners and have to defend your thesis. Well, I’ve really learned how to defend myself and argue a point!”",

    "fullText": "Tony Stark relied on his ultra-polished, tech-heavy \"Iron Man\" suit to achieve his superhero feats.\n\nJack Buser, the global director for games at Google Cloud, thinks AI will help game developers in the same way.\n\n\"There will always be holdouts, just like every technological revolution, but it's becoming so common now,\" Buser told Business Insider. \"We're seeing a major shift.\"\n\nBuser and other tech industry leaders have said that implementing AI could transform how people work. In the gaming industry, the tech could help streamline operations, resulting in cost cuts, faster production times, or help developers tackle an array of tasks.\n\n\"It's like the Iron Man suit of armor, right? It's still you inside the suit of armor, but you're suddenly able to do things that you couldn't do before,\" Buser said. \"If you armor everybody up in your studio with suits that allow them to work more quickly and remove the drudgery, that tends to be well received after it's been implemented.\"\n\nBuser urged executives at studios and companies to take the lead by giving developers the necessary tools.\n\n\"If you're the CTO of a games company, make that suit of armor available. Make sure that it's safe. Make sure that you take the time to work with people inside your company so that they can understand what the technology can and can't do, and what your intentions for the technology are and what they are not,\" Buser said.\n\n\"It has as much to do with getting these tools up and running in your development pipelines as it does working culturally with your company to help it make that transformation,\" he added.\n\nGetting comfortable with AI, he said, shouldn't be confined to developers alone.\n\n\"It can be tricky at the executive level. You don't have a crystal ball of where this is all going,\" he said. \"It takes getting your hands dirty, experimenting with the technology, seeing what it does and what it doesn't do.\"\n\nMany global industries are undergoing a technological shift driven by advances in AI. Companies are increasingly adopting the tech in their workflows, which some critics say could diminish job prospects for humans. Supporters argue it's a powerful tool that can help workers do their jobs better and faster.\n\nFor Buser, who has worked in the gaming industry for 30 years, AI has created an opportunity to push the boundaries of player experiences. At Google, that means embracing the era of \"living games.\"\n\nThe live games model, in which developers continue to add new content to a game after its initial release, is already common. AI, however, could make living games more adaptable, personalized, and immersive. The AI could also shorten update turnaround time, making the transition for players more seamless.\n\n\"As we look forward, we're looking at things like real-time game experiences,\" Buser said.\n\nFor now, though, the gaming industry will be focused on scaling and normalizing the tech.\n\n\"2026 is where companies start to scale these efforts,\" Buser said. \"Game developers who were using AI in one or two parts of their development workflow will suddenly be using it throughout their workflow. You'll start to see games that are using multiple AI-based features that are affecting the player experience.\"",

    "fullText": "I’ve been a games journalist since 2007, but still there isn’t much video games coverage that feels like it’s specifically for people like me. So I’m creating a home for it: Mothership\n\nWhether you’re reading about the impending AI bubble bursting or about the video game industry’s mass layoffs and cancelled projects, 2026 does not feel like a hopeful time for gaming. What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is using video game memes as ICE recruitment tools, and game studios are backing away from diversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.\n\nThe manosphere is back, and we’ve lost mainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.\n\nEverything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry that Gamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).\n\nAfter all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. The GDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025 found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with 75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.\n\nMore people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.\n\nI have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.\n\nBut I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.\n\nLater, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.\n\nBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent a mass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.\n\nAnother one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No, we should do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.\n\nSix months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such as Defector, the Flytrap, and Aftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (I knew the readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people who don’t fit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s.

    "fullText": "May 01, 2020 \n\n • \n Socio-Economic History\n and Medievalism\n\n • \n\nThis blog post explores the historical accuracy of medieval city-builder video games.\n\nSince many of us are working from home in these trying times, it seems safe to assume that more people than ever are indulging in playing the occasional computer game. A city builder is a specific kind of computer game in which you design a city, extract resources, set up production chains and ensure that your settlement grows. City builders are very similar to strategy games as they reward patience and strategy. In this article, I will take a look at one sub-genre of the city builder, the medieval city builder, and explain how this gaming genre relates to our knowledge of medieval settlement planning.\n\nThe city builder has its origins far back in the 1990s in the combination of the strategy genre and the management genre, leading to games such as Sim City (1989), Caesar (1992) and Age of Empires (1997).\n\nIt did not take long before medieval-themed city builders popped up. We may think of Settlers (1993) and Knights and Merchants (1998). In addition, the Anno games (1998-2019), although initially set in the 1600s basically had a medieval theme.\n\nThese games often start with plopping down a village center on a promising location near abundant resources. You then continue to gather these resources which grant you building materials for building new homes and facilities for your settlement.\n\nSetting up specialized production chains might involve growing grain, milling the grain for flour and turning the flour into bread which feeds your villages. Similarly, another production chain might involve rearing sheep for their wool, turning the wool into cloth and turning the cloth into clothing. When done correctly, the reward of correct investments and planning is that you see your settlement grow.\n\nThis often leads to settlements growing organically from a couple of houses around a community center to a larger settlement with hundreds of people. However logical such an organic growth of a settlement might seem, it is not historically accurate.\n\nAny gameplay loop that tells a story of linear settlement growth is incongruent with how a medieval economy worked (see Foussier 2004). Medieval villagers were often living on the edge of subsistence. Agricultural surpluses were skimmed by the church and the feudal lords. Bad harvests, banditry, warfare and disease might decimate a village community at any time. For this very reason, the demography of many European villages remained relatively stable between the twelfth and the eighteenth century. It may therefore be clear that the gameplay loop of city builders pivots around the concept of doing the historically exceptional (i.e. growing a settlement to a town) and thereby strays far from what actually happened in the lives of our medieval forebears. \n\nA notable exception to this genre trope is the game Banished (2014) in which high mortality rates and bad weather do seriously stifle any kind of linear growth. In this city builder you are constantly fighting the odds and settlement growth is not guaranteed. However, also in Banished it is your goal to overcome the stagnation and lead your settlement to expansion.\n\nA thing that is rarely touched upon in medieval city builders is how complex village life actually was. This can be exemplified by how the community related to its overlords. Land ownership here is key. Land in the community might be owned by a lord, a local liegeman, a monastery or even directly by the duke or count. Taxes, rents and tithes were the organisational structures in which the landowner was tied to the farmers who worked the fields. Often the payment of taxes and tithes was linked to feast days and the visit of the tax collector represented a big event in the agricultural year. An interesting side note is that some obligations which the commoners had to the lord and the church (such as seigneurial duties like working a mill) might drain the community from the needed manpower for tilling the land. Furthermore, a rural community that was its own seigneury had access to a law court with sheriff, aldermen and a local militia (Middle Dutch schutterie) to fight off bandits with. Harsh capital punishments were set in place to deter anyone from raiding the farms and hamlets and the village gallows were often the first thing one saw when approaching a medieval settlement.\n\nBut something that is much more fundamental to the theme of a settlement building game, is how medieval settlements were actually planned and grew. Landscape historians and archaeologists have acquired a lot of insight into how this worked.\n\nLet's start with the realization that medieval settlements in their first stages of development were planned and laid out according to a specific design. In my own research into the settlement history of West-Brabant (southern Netherlands, from 1000 to 1300 CE) I have encountered the following types.\n\nHere is a sketch of a Brabantine circular manor (Middle Dutch vroonhoeve). This is a reinforced circular homestead with moat, often next to a bend in the river, containing several farms and a fan-like plot pattern radiating out from it. Such manors were often called BORCH.\n\nHere is a sketch of a Brabantine street settlement, often built with exploitation of nearby fenland in mind. It consists of a line of farms with associated evenly sized rectangular plots built in a line perpendicular to a raised road.\n\nHere is a more complex exploitation village which is set up with a moated enclosed church homestead and a central meadow as its center. There is a line of farms next to the road. The arable land to the east is bordered by a ditch supplying fresh drinking water (Middle Dutch bansloot). In layout, this type represents a hybrid between the two earlier settlement types.\n\nLet us first make clear that these different types of exploitation settlements often existed alongside each other and can be found in one and the same region. In part, the different types reflect different chronological layers but some types were also more suited to certain geographical environments than others.\n\nSo how were these settlements planned? Many medieval exploitation enterprises were initiated by a monastery or a consortium of free men who were granted permission by (or bought permission from) the feudal lord to “colonize” the wilderness.\n\nClearing the wooded landscape in order to create arable land was done by cutting away the trees and bushes (Middle Dutch rode) or, alternatively, burning it away in controlled fires (Middle Dutch brant).\n\nLand surveyors sent by the lord would then measure out the block or strips that would be taken in cultivation. Strips of arable land were often 1250m deep (6 Middle Dutch voorlingen = furlongs) so that the plough could go straight in a long line before having to turn. Important blocks or strips were demarcated by hedges, earthwork, woodwork, ditches or roads. Medieval names for these blocks often survived into the modern day.\n\nThe presence of drinking water (a river or a brook) in the vicinity was an important factor in choosing the location for the settlement. The vicinity of water entailed risk and reward because flooding was an ever present danger. Floods could devastate arable land but might also fertilize it. Meadows in particular were often situated in flood areas.\n\nSo how was such a settlement managed? First of all, the quality of the soil had to be carefully controlled by crop rotation: specific crops were sown on different segments of the arable land with one part laying fallow to recover from the tilling (English three-field system, Dutch drieslagstelsel). The cattle and sheep were put out to pasture on the common meadows guarded by a shepherd or cowherd. Pigs were allowed to forage in the nearby forests and killed in autumn before the winter starvation set in.\n\nRoads and rivers were important for transport of crops and livestock. These roads, some of them paved, some of them not, needed to be maintained. They were essential to the payment of the tithe, since tithe collectors assessed the harvest on the field and later collected the sheaves on the side of the road.\n\nThe buildings within the community also needed maintenance. Farmhouses, community barns and stables were made of wood and had to be rebuilt every few generations, only the name of the farm or homestead being continued.\n\nSo what kind of threats did a medieval settlement face? First of all, the weather was an important factor which dictated the success of the harvest. Storms, droughts and floods could devastate the harvest and decimate the community.\n\nDiseases and epidemics were another danger threatening the community. The situation on the countryside was a lot better in this regard than in the medieval towns, but an epidemic could still mean the end of a village. Similarly, diseases among livestock impacted the medieval subsistence economy in a brutal way.\n\nThen there are the consequences of medieval warfare affecting the community: Armies that passed by could plunder the village, burn the farms and execute villagers at will. Or they could also demand supplies, food and provisions as an emergency \"tax\"\n\nBut war also brought indirect consequences; a liege lord calling the banners and levying troops from the village community might extract a large part of the adult men. Warfare also disrupted the trade networks that supplied a village with building materials and commodities.\n\nThen there were internal threats to the fabric of the village community. We may think of social unrest because of land disputes. Feuds could also tear a community apart with endemic vendetta’s causing death and despair. A socially unstable society was also more prone to internal accusations of heresy and witchcraft.\n\nSo, which of the above listed features could potentially contribute to a more historically accurate computer game about medieval settlement building? First of all, it would be more realistic if the settlement could first be planned out and was not forced to \"grow organically\" from a community center. The first settlement phase would be a test of how “successful” a layout is in adapting to the exigencies of the terrain and the needs of the community. Only after that initial layout proved successful, further expansions can be planned.\n\nSecondly, it would be more realistic if we could build both straight roads and curved roads, just as in Cities Skylines (2015), a modern city builder well known for its incredibly flexible layout tools. Incidentally, the tools of Cities Skylines can also be used to recreate medieval settlements, as was done by YouTube creator Play Curiously who constructed an impression of a medieval Croatian village.\n\nSuch a flexible road drawing tool can then also be used to lay out ditches, hedges and enclosures since these features were central to the medieval experience of the cultivated landscape.\n\nThirdly, It would be interesting to see a medieval-themed game embrace the concept of flood valleys that limit and endanger pasture and arable land. Other historical city builders such as Pharaoh (1999) and Children of the Nile (2004) already implemented this feature for their setting in Ancient Egypt. However, such a mechanic would likewise fit a medieval city builder and show the general public how medieval society dealt with seasonal flooding as well as the devastating effects that storm floods could have.\n\nAnd finally, something that would, in my opinion, really add to the realism and historical flavor of a medieval-themed city builder would be the introduction of mechanisms in which agricultural surpluses are skimmed by the church and the feudal lord. Tithes, taxes and rents! Instead of merely abstracting the taxes into an income modifier or letting the player be the extractor himself, we could be shown the tax collector visiting the village, counting the sheaves by the side of the road, selecting the calves and chickens. This way, the experiences of our medieval forebears are visualized and may help to educate the public about medieval village life.\n\nThere are some good reasons why city building games are not that historically accurate and instead adhere to the established formula of the city building game.\n\nFirst of all, a linear growth model makes sense from a gameplay perspective, since it is rewarding to see your settlement grow.in a linear way. It fosters a feeling of progress and motivates the player to keep momentum and push through to the next expansion phase. Secondly, games are generally wary of punishing failure too harshly in order to avoid demoralizing the player. Thirdly, in order to facilitate path finding for the simulated villagers it is easier to implement a gridlike road and building system rather than an off-grid building system that allows for curvy roads. So far only Cities Skylines has managed to do this in a satisfactory way.\n\nLastly, for marketing purposes and recognizability, game developers generally don't stray too far from the image of the Middle Ages that the public is already acquainted with. For a medieval city builder this means windmills, industrious peasants, lots of sheep and stone castles. Things like land surveying, crop rotation and tithe collection do not fit this image and challenge the romanticized picture of the uneducated farmer in his pre-industrial environment.\n\nAlthough I think medieval-themed city building games could benefit from incorporating some of the things we know about medieval settlement history into the gameplay loop, it may not be desirable for game developers to stray too far from the established formula. The idea that medieval settlements developed organically according to messy road plans is strongly imbedded in popular perception. Allowing both straight and curved road building in medieval city builders, may serve to challenge some of the stereotypes that exist about medieval village life. And if you ask me, that would be a good thing for it is an enriching experience to see the world through the eyes of our medieval forebears. One may find out that their lives were not that different after all...",

    "fullText": "Video game publisher to cancel Prince of Persia remake and close studios after several difficult years\n\nThe video game publisher behind the Assassin’s Creed series has cancelled six projects including a remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time as it fights to stay competitive in the global gaming market.\n\nUbisoft announced a sweeping reorganisation and said it would cancel six games, sending its shares to their lowest level in more than a decade on Thursday.\n\nUbisoft is abandoning development of six titles, including a highly anticipated remake of Prince of Persia – a series that dates back to 1989 and received an ill-fated Hollywood adaptation in 2010 – and delaying a further seven. Studios in Halifax, Canada and Stockholm are being closed, with restructuring to follow in other countries, it said.\n\nAfter the announcement, Ubisoft’s shares fell by a third to their lowest level since 2011 on Thursday, valuing the company at €590m (£514m) compared with a peak of more than €10bn in the previous decade. The Paris-based company said it planned to split its operations into five creative divisions organised by genre, part of a broader attempt to sharpen focus and rein in costs after years of disappointing releases and weak results.\n\nThe company said the restructuring was driven by the competitive market for AAA games, the term for big-budget, high-profile titles such as Grand Theft Auto.\n\n“The triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,” said Ubisoft’s founder and chief executive, Yves Guillemot.\n\nHowever, Guillemot added that successful triple-A games have “more financial potential than ever”.\n\nUbisoft also blamed an “increasingly competitive market” for shooters, a key genre for the industry.\n\nLaurent Michaud, a gaming industry economist, said action adventure titles such as Prince of Persia were out of step with a market dominated currently by shooters like Fortnite and Call of Duty, cooperative adventure titles such as Peak and sports titles and multiplayer games such as those available on the Roblox platform.\n\n“The expectations of gamers are quite different to where they were 10 years ago. That’s why it’s difficult to keep in touch with an audience that has changed so much over the years.”\n\nHe added: “Ubisoft is still one of the most popular content providers in the video games industry. It has developed one of the best IP slates in the industry but even if the games are really good, it is not enough. It has to meet people’s expectations and tastes.”\n\nThe latest overhaul follows several difficult years marked by game delays, cancellations and weak execution, which have eroded investor confidence and strained the group’s finances. In November 2025, Ubisoft postponed the publication of its half-year results at the last minute, triggering a week-long suspension of trading in its shares and bonds. The company later said an accounting change had revealed a breach of the terms for its debt.",

All You Can Eat is often the first name that comes up when people talk about co-op cooking games, and for good reason. This collection brings together multiple Overcooked experiences into one package, focusing entirely on the cooperative chaos offered by the franchise. Players work together to prepare, cook, and serve dishes across a series of increasingly absurd kitchens, many of which actively interfere with your ability to function as a team, so pretty standard for the catering industry.\n\nIdeal for players who enjoy fast-paced action and don’t mind getting a little heated in the kitchen, Overcooked! All You Can Eat is especially well-suited for local co-op sessions, where you can embrace your inner Gordon Ramsay and get your point across in an instant. This edition also features an assist mode, where several accessibility options mean everyone can join in, whatever their chef-ing ability. Overcooked also made it onto our best Xbox co-op games list, and works flawlessly either locally or online.\n\nGameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom\n\nYou can probably guess the premise of One Armed Cook without much prompting: you're a cook and you have one arm. But the simple concept gives way to hours of physics-based fun when you consider that between you and a friend, you'll have all the required arms. The game very quickly goes from \"I'm not doing too badly, considering,\" to \"oh my god the floor is covered in onions,\" so if you want the video game equivalent of a three-legged race, you don't have to look much further.\n\nCarrying ingredients, chopping food, and assembling dishes often requires both of you working in sync, especially when dealing with awkward customers or a full house. One Armed Cook is best enjoyed by pals who appreciate goofy, unpredictable gameplay and don’t mind failing spectacularly on the way to success.\n\nPlateUp! blends the more traditional elements of co-op cooking with light restaurant management, meaning it's as much about planning ahead as it is about the actual execution of each dish. It's another of the more popular entries on the list, but continues to prove itself in the multiplayer arena, even against more recent games. Players work together to run a restaurant over 15 in-game days, choosing layouts, upgrading equipment, and deciding how to handle increasingly demanding customers. Every three days, you then have to choose a card that will permanently impact the game from there on--sometimes for the worse.\n\nUnlike more linear level-based cooking games, PlateUp! leans toward rogue-lite mechanics, changing things up with every full game. Decisions made early--such as kitchen layout or menu/card choices--directly affect later runs. Cooking, serving, cleaning, and managing customer flow all happen simultaneously, making teamwork essential and genuinely challenging.\n\nDiner Bros 2 asks a lot of you, so if you want a co-op cooking game with a bit of bite, this is the one for you. Alongside serving up delicious dishes, you'll have to keep enhancing your restaurant, optimizing its layout, impressing food critics, learning new recipes, hiring staff, and even dealing with sneaky customers who try to dine-n-dash. There are no gimmicks or environmental hazards, just good honest work and the potential of a thriving business driving you forward.\n\nThe game emphasizes clear task-division, meaning it's best with four friends, but can also be played alone (by hiring staff) or with two players. One player might focus on blasting through all the cooking while another handles serving and cleanup, but the most effective teams adjust roles dynamically depending on customer flow. Progression unlocks new content, encouraging players to improve efficiency and coordination over time, so you'll find plenty of replayability here, too.\n\nGalaxy Burger is a little different from many of the games on this list, as there's no frantic energy and no chaotic time limits. It's a laid-back game with no stress, where you and up to seven friends can create cosmic burgers for aliens, space creatures, and mecha cats. Different burgers require different ingredients and combinations, meaning you'll be prepping all manner of accompaniments, toppings, and side dishes to complete challenges.\n\nIf you're sick of cooking co-op games making you frustrated, stressed, or even downright angry, Galaxy Burger offers an alternative in chilled, casual cooking in which gentle creativity is rewarded. Galaxy Burger doesn’t reinvent the genre, but it adds enough thematic flair to keep teamwork feeling fresh. Plus, some of the cats are really cute.\n\nWitchtastic handles like a co-op cooking game, but throws in a witchy twist by having you and your pals brew potions instead of preparing food. Speed is the key, as you want those potions flying out of there ASAP. While there is a single-player campaign, it's a lot more fun to team up and scurry around increasingly elaborate cooking setups.\n\nIf you're a big fan of cozy games, Witchtastic might appeal with its cottagecore cauldron-in-a-forest vibes--just watch out for ghouls, wolves, and other halloween-y horrors that might distract you from your noble pursuit. Between foraging, scooting about on a broomstick, and customising your witch, there's always something to do between brewing sessions.\n\nCook Serve Delicious 3 is a lot to explain. It's a co-op cooking game set in dystopian future America where cyborgs mingle with humans--and instead of freaking out about this, you're taking your food truck on a road trip. If there is such a thing, this is basically the Dark Souls of cooking games, so if you want something that'll pose a genuine challenge to you and your friends (perhaps to knock a smug pal down a peg or two), you'll want to check the series out. It's one of those great two-player co-op games that'll reward you handsomely if you reach its incredibly high bar for challenge.\n\nSingle-player is supported in the campaign, but local co-op is where Cook Serve Delicious 3 really shines. Between rounds, you'll upgrade and customize your food truck, expand your menu, and travel across the war-torn future USA, before launching into another round of trying to cater to the hungry masses. When on-shift, you and your friends will have to coordinate almost seamlessly in an unforgiving onslaught of demanding customers. The game packs a ridiculous 387 levels, so you've got plenty of time to hone those chopping, flipping, and frying skills.\n\nLet’s Cook Together 2 is a wholesome co-op game that can be played with just about anyone, but works best with younger kids. The game rewards cooperative puzzle-solving and well-timed cooking collaboration, with kitchens designed as challenges that require players to coordinate movements, timing, and task execution to complete recipes efficiently. It's a great introduction to co-op gaming for your less-experienced kids or siblings, and offers more than 250 levels to try.\n\nFast reflexes aren't much of a consideration in Let's Cook Together 2's lower difficulty levels; you just need to be able to communicate, plan ahead, and support each other. Everything you need to serve up your dishes is scattered across a wide room, so sometimes you're going to have to throw stuff with perfect timing.\n\nShakes on a Plane centers on cooperative milkshake-making in unusual environments, but we'll loosely group milkshakes into cooking for now. Players work together to fulfill orders while dealing with airplane kitchens that move, tilt, or change unexpectedly, as they gain altitude and deal with turbulence, demanding passengers, and even aliens.\n\nThe game thrives on shared chaos, and although it does offer single-player, we personally think it's not the best way to play it. Having multiple players support you in co-op makes it easier and more engaging, allowing you to progress at a comfortable pace. At its heart it's a fairly cluttered Overcooked clone, but the unique concept and fun setting make it a good alternative party game if you're not afraid of heights.\n\nBone’s Cafe combines cooperative cooking with a creepy-cute aesthetic, tasking players with running a cafe filled with undead workers and patrons. Players work together to preparing dishes, serving customers, and managing shared responsibilities--as well as literally raising the dead.\n\nCoordination and timing are hugely important, with progression introducing new recipes and challenges that require better teamwork. Decorate and upgrade your cafe, and increase your Skull Ranking for better rewards, all while trying to automate and streamline your work. The cute pixel art belies the fact that your job is to strategically attract, kill, and harvest customers for fresh ingredients and use their souls to raise an undead army. Adorable.",

    "description": "If a person claiming to be Conor McGregor on a gaming platform is to be trusted, he needs a new UFC contract.",
    "fullText": "With each passing couple months, the chances that Conor McGregor ever will fight in the UFC get slimmer and slimmer.\n\nThat's not something the former fighter or his fans likely ever would admit, or the UFC brass, for that matter, but that's just the cold, hard math.\n\nAnd if a person purporting to be McGregor is to be trusted, there may be another hint now available about his future. On a video game live stream, a person who claimed to be McGregor and sounded like the Irishman said because of the UFC's new broadcast deal with Paramount+, which eliminated the traditional pay-per-view model, his contract is, in essence, void and needs to be reworked.\n\nThat, the purported McGregor said, will take place in February.\n\nConor McGregor said he has to negotiate a new contract with the UFC next month 👀\n\n“My contract is essentially void right now.” pic.twitter.com/c7wVzFEkIG\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) January 18, 2026\n\nIn July, it will be five years since McGregor (22-6 MMA, 10-4 UFC) last fought. He broke his leg in a second straight loss to Dustin Poirier at UFC 264. He coached Season 31 of \"The Ultimate Fighter\" opposite Michael Chandler (23-10 MMA, 2-5 UFC) and was supposed to fight him, but that never has come to fruition despite Chandler desperately pining for it, and McGregor consistently teasing it. UFC CEO Dana White recently took it off the table nearly entirely.\n\nSunday, the former UFC fighter continued his years-long spiral with a lengthy proclamation that he once again has seen the light – this time thanks to a hallucinogenic treatment in Mexico.\n\nThis past November, McGregor said he saw his own death, when it was going to happen, and how it would impact the four children he has with Dee Devlin, whom he recently married after years together. Then, he said, Jesus descended from heaven and put a crown on his head to save him during a hallucinogenic treatment in Mexico..\n\n\"To God, I am yours,\" McGregor posted on social media. \"Thank you for bestowing upon me this incredible blessing that I take with great care and absolute seriousness! I live my life per your word and nothing more.\"\n\nLast year, McGregor dropped out of a bid to become the next president of Ireland. He couldn't get support to even get his name on the ballot, so he wasn't actually in the race. McGregor has said he aspires to political office in the near future and has taken up a nationalistic right-wing rallying cry similar to Donald Trump in that pursuit. Like Trump, McGregor has multiple sexual assault accusations against him, and like Trump, a ruling against him for one, too.\n\nMcGregor was found liable for the 2018 sexual assault of Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel. Then McGregor lost his appeal to have the decision reversed. After that, McGregor made a plea to his countrywomen and countrymen to stand with him in the wake of the mountain of civil and criminal charges against him over the years, and the civil rape and sexual assault trial that came home to roost. A poll found that just 7 percent of people said they would vote for McGregor to be president of Ireland.\n\nMcGregor also is part-owner of the BKFC and his appearances at those events are regular.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Conor McGregor purportedly says UFC contract void in Paramount era",

    "fullText": "The team behind Baby Steps discuss why they made a whiny, unprepared manbaby the protagonist – and how players have grown to love Nate as he struggles up a mountain\n\n“I don’t know why he is in a onesie and has a big ass,” shrugs game developer Gabe Cuzzillo. “Bennett just came in with that at some point.”\n\n“I thought it would be cute,” replies Bennett Foddy, who was formerly Cuzzillo’s professor at New York University’s Game Center and is now his collaborator. “Working on character design and animation brings you over to liking big butts. I could give you an enormous amount of evidence for this.”\n\nFoddy and Cuzzillo are talking about Nate, the impressively pathetic manbaby protagonist of their profound and ridiculous comedy game Baby Steps, developed together with Maxi Boch. When I was preparing to talk to them, I felt like I was about to meet my tormentors: I spent a week last year in the grip of this purposefully, transcendentally frustrating game about going on a horrible hiking holiday with the world’s most incompetent loser.\n\nBaby Steps’ premise seems like a cruel joke at first: watch the hapless man suffer! And you will suffer too! But the more I played it, the more meaning I found in it. As the hours passed and I helped Nate overcome his own uselessness and get himself up the mountain, I came around to him.\n\n“People coming around to him is common,” Foddy says. “We’ve had a lot of people say they hated him at the outset – and then they started either identifying with him or identifying him with other people in their lives. Some people end up sexualising him. The commonality between all these things is people coming around in some way, and that is the core philosophy of the game. It should be that it starts out feeling arduous and awkward and annoying and hostile, and then we try to bring you around to find pleasure in it … that happens to Nate in the story as well. He would never go outside for a hike.”\n\nNate is a large, bearded, russet-haired 35-year-old guy with glasses who lives in his parents’ basement. He is socially awkward, a shy urinator, whiny and massively averse to accepting help from anyone. Early in the game you come across another hiker who offers you a map of the mountain; a little mini-map pops up in the corner of the screen for a few seconds before Nate refuses it and it disappears. I guffawed at this. Like most of Baby Steps, it’s a joke about the comfortable, streamlined gaming experiences that we’ve become used to. But it’s also a joke about Nate, and the kind of guy he is.\n\nTalking to Cuzzillo threw me off at first because he is also the voice of Nate; he and Foddy improvised every line in the game. But he also has a deeper connection to the character. “Nate is one manifestation of my personality,” he says. “He’s an aspect of who I am. He’s not a made-up guy. I totally have refuse-the-map guy within me. That’s deep in who I am. If someone tries to help me, I run away screaming. Sometimes that’s a joyful part of who I am, and sometimes it isn’t.”\n\n“In video games you do this too – you immediately put it on the hardest setting and turn off the assists,” attests Foddy.\n\nLike (almost) all game characters, Nate was once a stickman with a block for a head and tissue boxes for feet. Foddy and Cuzzillo ran through nine or 10 prototypes before alighting on the concept for Baby Steps, prototypes that Cuzzillo describes as “very bad”. “We were looking for something with legs,” adds Foddy, straight-faced.\n\nFoddy’s games are full of ostensibly pointless suffering. It’s a theme of his work, alongside the idea of awkwardly moving a character’s body: a previous game of his, Getting Over It, has you trying to fling a guy in a cauldron up a hill with a sledgehammer. This prototype, in which you’d individually control a character’s feet to walk them around, fit that bill: within a couple of days the blockman had become a helicopter pilot, an off-the-shop placeholder asset. It was a couple more years before he became Nate, and six more before the game was finished.\n\n“The idea is that he’s not prepared and he’s out of shape,” says Cuzzillo. “Having an unprepared character gives the player an excuse if they’re feeling like they’re insufficient. They can blame him,” Foddy elaborates. “We had the idea of a cute lumberjacky guy with a little backpack, based on one of our friends, who will never need to know that he was the inspiration.”\n\nAnother of Foddy and Cuzzillo’s friends and colleagues was the source of Baby Steps’ name. They both now teach at NYU’s Game Center, whose chair emeritus Frank Lantz burst into their office with an idea for the name; at that point the main character was a giant baby (you could argue that he still is). Plenty of infantilising imagery remains, from rivers of breast milk to massive sandcastle toys to the gigantic woman who picks Nate up and cradles him in one especially surreal scene.\n\nAs they were playtesting the game with their friends, another aspect of Nate’s personality began to emerge: his misplaced pride. “This slightly obstinate vein of toxic masculine play starts coming out, from seeing some of our friends play it in a certain kind of way,” Foddy says. One of those friends, Julian Cordero (maker of Despelote), started looking very intently off the edge of cliffs after climbing them, inspiring a scene in which Nate’s fellow hiker Mike sits on the edge of a platform contemplating throwing himself all the way down again.\n\nBaby Steps’ interesting exploration of what masculinity means to a guy like Nate is delivered both through the story and the experience of play. You can unlock short, abstract, playable flashbacks to his childhood and the humiliating experiences that have shaped him. There are also somewhat less subtle symbols around, such as the omnipresent phallic imagery. An interesting thing about this game’s meditations on masculinity is that it doesn’t involve women at all: at a time when men’s insecurities are continually being lumped on women and feminism by common-or-garden internet misogynists, this is refreshing. As Foddy says: “Men can have problems with masculinity just by themselves.”\n\nThere is one thing that Nate straightforwardly loves: fruit. Pieces of shiny fruit hang tantalisingly in almost-inaccessible places, tempting you to waste a chunk of your life trying to reach them. If you do, you are treated to a ludicrous close-up of Nate’s face as he noisily consumes it before screaming its name into the wind.\n\n“We needed something to put on top of stuff,” explains Cuzzillo, deadpan. And a selection of increasingly esoteric fruits was the obvious choice? He explains that rewarding the player would be antithetical to the game’s philosophy. “[So] what if it’s a reward for Nate? What if it’s something he loves, so you get to vicariously watch him get a reward? The day we came up with it, we recorded the first five vocal takes … It’s funniest when you’ve tried hardest for it, and what’s at the top is just him having this crazy fruit orgasm.”\n\nThe inspiration for the dumb camera angle – the wide-angle lens from the top of the forehead – was trainspotter Francis Bourgeois. “Something we both got into during Covid, when we were doing initial exploration on this game, is the vein of culture that emerges when people are critically bored,” explains Foddy. “The idea is that these fruit cutscenes are coming when the player is feeling as unhinged as Nate is when he’s enjoying the fruit.”\n\nThat is the joke that Baby Steps keeps coming back to: you might hate Nate, but also if you’re playing a game like this, then in some way you are Nate. After many, many hours on the mountain, out in the snow, you reach an ending when Nate finds a cabin owned by a donkey-man whom he’s sort of befriended on his journey. After a few false starts, he finally knocks on the door and asks to be let in from the cold. You can go for a walk after that concluding scene, but the game goes to great lengths to warn you that there’s no point. There’s nothing else out there.\n\nBaby Steps’ final joke is that it’s lying to you: there is a final cutscene at the top of the mountain. You can go find it if you want, if you’re just irredeemably that kind of person. But for me, the game’s true ending is Nate finally learning to ask for help. I was rather moved by it.\n\nAfter Cuzzillo finished his first commercial game, 2019’s Ape Out, he felt ambivalent about it. “I wasn’t sure whether it was worth it; whether, once I was at the top of the mountain, I really wished I had climbed it,” he says. But he’s feeling much better about Baby Steps in retrospect, and about Nate.\n\n“I understand it way more now after finishing it. I feel like I’m re-realising all the things the game is about… Nate is a microcosm of the whole game, where it’s both a piss-take and sincere at the same time. It’s not one or the other.”",

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos.",

Luckily, there are a ton of other games that are like Elden Ring--those that conjure a similar feeling of setting out into a dark and hostile world, whether through their combat systems, dark and intriguing storytelling, or world design. Below, you'll find 24 RPGs, souls-like games, and open-world games that each capture elements of Elden Ring's gameplay, providing you with more tough battles to fight and incredible worlds to chart. These aren't necessarily meant to be duplicates of what Elden Ring is going for, but games that might appeal to those who like certain elements of it.\n\nAlternatively, we've got suggestions for the best RPGs and the best Elden Ring mods, the latter of which can expand and refresh your experience if you just want more Elden Ring.\n\nSucker Punch’s follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima moves the action up 300 years to the 17th century Ezo, as a female warrior, Atsu, dedicates herself to hunting down the Yotei Six who murdered her family and left her for dead.\n\nWith only two exceptions, Ghost of Yotei lets players choose which of the six she wants to target, and win. The game’s combat and open-world exploration should appeal to Elden Rings players, and this period of Japan’s history has been meticulously recreated. A player can lose themselves going through all of the side missions and finding the hidden secrets. The backgrounds are stunningly beautiful and the game is a worthy successor for the Ghost franchise.\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC\n\nGame Science really elevated their game--so to speak--with Black Myth: Wukong, a beautifully rendered dive into Chinese mythology that loosely adapts Journey to the West. It’s not a fully open-world game, but Elden Ring fans should appreciate its soulslike aspects and the fantastic combat system. The Destined One’s staff turns out to be one of the most versatile weapons in the game, and it has plenty of tricks to master.\n\nThe Destined One is a humanoid monkey who is attempting to free his master from a trap that was set centuries earlier. That quest will take the Destined One across the country and into countless battles with enemies that stand in the way of his goal. Knocking the hell out of them with the staff is a good way to destress, but don’t get complacent. There are always harder battles to get through before the end.\n\nWuchang: Fallen Feathers is another soulslike title with a female warrior at the forefront. Bai Wuchang, however, has access to a deadly arsenal of weapons including multiple swords, dual blades, axes, and spears. If it’s sharp, she can use pretty much anything to kill her foes, and her combat options are like deadly poetry in motion. Even her defensive moves are impressive.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of this game is that Wuchang is infected with a virus that can transform its victims and drive them crazy. Players have to monitor Wuchang’s sanity and take steps to bring her back from the brink. Wuchang’s madness can also be a super power that temporarily makes her much stronger. But if her sanity is nearly depleted, it means her death won’t be far behind.\n\nHell Is Us breaks from the conventions of the other games on this list by setting its story in an alternative present that’s mired in supernatural threats. The main character, Remi, even uses a drone to help him distract his enemies. But when it comes to taking down Hollow Walkers, the old ways are best. That means swords, axes, and other melee weapons are the most effective tactics against these creatures.\n\nRemi’s story takes him back to his war-torn homeland as he attempts to locate the parents that he barely remembers. What he discovers is a deeper mission that will test him every aspect of his being. It turns out you can go home again, but no one ever said anything about leaving alive. The semi-open world around Remi has its own life to it, and he’ll need to talk with other survivors to figure out what he should do.\n\nThough not the first of From Software's games to use the formula, the Dark Souls trilogy crystalized the essential elements that make up Elden Ring, and went on to define an entire subgenre. It's the feel of Dark Souls that informs Elden Ring, as well as so many other games that have come after it. Combat is slow and methodical, requiring you to pick your moments to attack as you learn how to deal with powerful opponents that can easily destroy you if you're not smart and careful. The combination of melee mechanics with a stamina gauge, a health system that gives you a limited quantity of healing items you can continually refill, and a checkpoint system that forces you to choose between replenishing yourself and reviving all the creatures you just defeated, have led to so many games borrowing its ideas that it has given rise to its own genre: the Soulslike.\n\nThe original Dark Souls is really the quintessential game, taking players through tough battles against a variety of fantastical bosses, and features an incredibly interesting and interconnected world. It's not exactly an open-world game--it hides a pretty linear experience--but it feels huge, open, and strange, and the sense of exploring that world is part of what has made Dark Souls so powerfully influential for more than a decade. Dark Souls 2 and 3 expand on and refine the experience in different ways to offer iterations on the theme that are both worth exploring, especially to see how they would eventually give rise to Elden Ring.\n\nFanatical is owned by GameSpot parent company Fandom.\n\nThe Dark Souls games (and Demon's Souls) hew closest to Elden Ring's approach to things like combat and healing. In terms of a vast open world where exploration is just as big a part of the experience as following the prescribed path, however, it's hard to find a better example than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom. Both games reimagine the classic Zelda framework of melee combat, dungeon-crawling, and amassing a huge inventory of weapons and tools to make your way in the world, with an expansive open world that gives way to a much more free-form experience. Just as you can set out in any direction in Elden Ring and find a viable path through the game, you can wander both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and chart your own way through Hyrule. You'll be hard-pressed to find any other games that capture Elden Ring's sense of open possibility the way these do.\n\nThe quickest way to understand Remnant 2 would be \"Dark Souls with guns,\" although especially with Remnant 2, that description is a big disservice. Remnant 2 uses key elements of the souls-like formula, like finite healing items that can be replenished, a stamina gauge for dodging away from enemy attacks, and checkpoints that revive enemies in the area around you, but it expands on it in a ton of meaningful ways. Most notably, Remnant 2 makes use of an impressive procedural generation system that mixes in bespoke elements, making unpredictable maps that are filled with intricate, well-designed dungeons. It also has a series of phenomenal, often-massive boss fights, each different from the last and interesting in its own unique way. However, it's in its secrets that Remnant 2 really excels--the procedural generation elements mean you can play the same dungeon over and over and discover new elements each time, like hidden rooms, additional battles, and alternate ways to defeat bosses. The best way to experience Remnant 2 is in co-op, thanks to a system that rewards you for mixing and matching different classes and working together to explore its constantly changing world.\n\nBloodborne takes the more linear approach generally inherent to the Dark Souls games and gives it a faster pace, while setting it in a bloody Lovecraftian horror tale. There's a reason Bloodborne is the favorite of From Software's oeuvre among many fans--it's an often-brilliant iteration on the core ideas. Bloodborne does away with the slower elements of the Souls games, like blocking with a shield, in favor of dodging, parrying, and a health-rally system that rewards you for being aggressive by letting you gain back health lost to enemies by pressing the attack. Even better than that, though, is a dark and twisting story about a plague that turns people into horrific beasts, which you're tasked with stopping as you take part in the blood-drenched Hunt, only to discover that there are forces beyond your comprehension at work in the cursed land of Yharnam.\n\nWhere Bloodborne iterated on From's approach with faster and more aggressive gameplay, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice brought that line of thinking to its ultimate conclusion with a game that demands you never back down from a fight. In Sekiro, every battle is a duel, whether you're fighting a samurai general or a towering ape. It introduces a \"posture\" system, which rewards you for pressing the attack and perfectly parrying your opponent's strikes by staggering them and opening them up for a massive, deadly blow. Sekiro is also From's most narrative-driven game, taking you through a tragic story set during Japan's Sengoku period, and adds stealth mechanics and platforming to the formula to create something unique among From's catalog.\n\nRise of the Ronin takes a stab at combat similar to Elden Ring--it's maybe \n\nIt's tough to think of an open-world RPG without thinking immediately of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Bethesda's incredibly popular game has been ported basically everywhere, and endures more than 10 years later because it puts players in a vast world with a huge amount of things to discover. Defined by first-person combat that includes dual-wielding weapons and magic spells, Skyrim has an absolutely enormous number of things to do and find, and stories to uncover and take part in. It stands as the gold standard of Bethesda's approach to games and has been hugely influential on open-world titles and RPGs ever since. Plus, it has an expansive, robust modding scene on PC that adds to and remakes the game in a phenomenal number of ways, just in case getting lost in the northern reaches of Tamriel for hundreds of hours wasn't enough for you.\n\nA lot of developers have tried to replicate the feel of a From Software Souls game, but none have ever quite managed it. Few have gotten as close as Neowiz Games with Lies of P, though. A riff on the story of Pinnochio, Lies of P is a little bit like if Bloodborne was set a little further in the future and focused on killer clockwork automata instead of werewolf-like monsters, but with a hearty helping of Sekiro's parry-focused approach to combat and weaponry. The game excels in fast-paced dueling combat, especially in its many killer boss fights. It's also set in a dark, fantastical world and explores some fascinating ideas of personhood in between all the beat-downs you give both robots and other \"humans.\"\n\nThe 2018 reboot of God of War reworked its gameplay in some significant ways, not the least of which is a \"wide linear\" focus on exploration that puts you not quite in an open world, but not quite in a fully linear experience, either. That approach provides a lot of Norse mythology-inspired places to explore, where you'll uncover fascinating stories and quite a few tough mythological creatures that need walloping. Reworked combat tightens the series' combo-centric battles against lots of enemies to make for some tougher duels, and God of War and its sequel, Ragnarok, have evolved to be \n\nMortal Shell is an indie souls-like game very obviously inspired by the Dark Souls approach, with a haltingly told story and a dark and shadowy fantasy world. Its tough combat is very similar to what the Souls games turn out, but with a few tweaks that might make it a good introduction to the genre. Two elements define Mortal Shell: the ability to inhabit the bodies of fallen soldiers to take on their different capabilities, kind of like choosing a class, and the ability to \"harden\" your body and tank a hit from an enemy. The harden ability is the key to Mortal Shell's combat, as it allows you to bait your opponent into attacking and then capitalize on the opening their blow bouncing off you creates. Mortal Shell is a smaller-scale souls-like than most, but it does a great job of dialing in on a few key elements that make these games so engaging while fleshing them out very well.\n\nTitanfall and Apex Legends' developer Respawn Entertainment's take on Star Wars is more than a little Souls-y. The series, now two games deep, tells the story of a Jedi hiding out in the aftermath of the Jedi Purge from Revenge of the Sith, before he sets out with a band of misfits to take on the Galactic Empire. Lots of games put you in the role of a Jedi, but Respawn's mixture of souls-like influence does a better job of making that compelling than most--instead of just slicing through everything with your laser sword, you're forced to use skills and reflexes, as well as the Force, as you fight tough duels against opponents ranging from Purge Troopers to Rancors to Sith Inquisitors. The Jedi games also add metroidvania elements and large areas to explore on various planets, scratching your exploration and puzzle-solving itch as well.\n\nIn some ways, Ghost of Tsushima is to Sekiro what Elden Ring is to Dark Souls: It plays in similar ways, but brings elements of Sekiro to an open-world format. Those elements are mainly a big focus on stealth assassinations and intense dueling gameplay. Ghost of Tsushima strikes out in its own direction with an emphasis on fighting stances--using the right stance against the enemy you face is essential to success--but a big focus is on parrying blows and knocking enemies off-guard so you can land your strikes. While its open world is more traditional than Elden Ring's, with lots of characters to talk to and side quests to complete, its minimalist presentation helps it capture that sense of wide-reaching exploration that makes From Software's game so engaging.\n\nThough souls-like games are often defined by their combat, the more effervescent element of the Elden Ring experience is the sense of scale and discovery it can often portray, as you ride over a hill and discover something incredible--often towering in the distance and waiting to kill you. That's the experience of Shadow of the Colossus to a T. You venture into a beautifully realized but ultimately lonely world filled with staggering, enormous monsters--only to destroy them. Shadow of the Colossus nails a sense of vastness that is empty and ponderous, something that also marks the best moments of Elden Ring, and excels at making you feel like you've just stumbled on something ancient and inscrutable. Its minimalist narrative makes the most of that world, as well as its awe-inspiring creatures, to capture a feeling few other games ever manage.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is revered as one of the best open-world RPGs made in the last decade, if not longer. It expands on CD Projekt's Witcher series in just about every way, from placing you in a truly huge game world full of well-told stories and side quests, to deepening combat and exploration. The gist is still the same--you're monster-hunter Geralt, a strong fighter with a handful of impressive special abilities and access to magic powers. And it's in fighting its various monsters that The Witcher 3 really hits a stride, pitting you against fantastical beasts that are all weird, deadly, and challenging in their own ways. Beyond that, though, its world is filled with quests that are worth taking and tales that are worth unfolding. The way The Witcher 3 lets you get to know the world and take part in it, and shows you the beauty and tragedy found within, elevates it beyond most RPGs.\n\nHollow Knight is a pretty big departure from Elden Ring, as games on this list go. It's not a 3D open-world game or an RPG--it's a side-scrolling metroidvania. But like a lot of other games on this list, it nails the sense of exploration through a strange world full of long and sometimes tragic history. It also draws from the souls-like formula for its combat, distilling some of those elements into 2D battles against a huge host of bosses. The combination of tough battles, a dark and expansive world through which you chart your own path, and an incredible amount of atmosphere and intriguing world-building give Hollow Knight a similar feel to what makes Elden Ring so enticing.\n\nThe Horizon games are \n\nOne of the joys of Elden Ring is just setting out in a direction and seeing what's out there. In Dragon's Dogma 2, just about any venture away from the safety of a settlement is met less with fascinating things to discover like hidden caves or underground cities, and more with unpredictable chaos in the form of the various vicious and magical creatures that want to make a meal out of you. The unpredictable ways these systems can interact with each other is the joy of Dragon's Dogma 2--as is hanging out with the miscreant \"pawns,\" companion characters you and other players create. Sharing them with pals you can't join in-game gives Dragon's Dogma a multiplayer feel similar to Elden Ring that goes perfectly with a fun open world where the journey is always as important as the destination.\n\nThe Nioh games were the result of developer Team Ninja combining its pedigree for fast, intense combat with souls-like mechanics. A lot of the familiar elements are present, like your offensive and defensive moves being governed by a stamina system. Team Ninja riffed on that underlying idea, creating an approach to stamina that also works in strategic planning in the midst of combat, along with precise timing, to make sure you can keep your stamina up and survive the onslaught of your foes. With clever bosses and winding level design, the Nioh games take souls-like ideas off in new directions to create some fresh but familiar experiences.\n\nYou'll immediately recognize the souls-like elements in combat in No Rest For The Wicked, with the usual stamina system, dodge-rolls, and parries. The differences are in its presentation: No Rest For The Wicked is an isometric dungeon-crawler, making it feel something like Dark Souls via Diablo. Each new weapon you find offers different move sets that will drastically change your approaches to combat, which offers a lot of variety in battles and gameplay as you take on some tough and often huge bosses. No Rest For The Wicked is set in its own dark fantasy world that's equal parts strange, fascinating, and horrifying, making it very interesting to venture through and fight to survive within.\n\nTeam Ninja riffs on the souls-like formula again in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, but goes in a different direction. It experiments with different ideas, allowing you more opportunities to customize a character and to build into different stats and gameplay approaches as you level up. Choosing different weapons and sets of armor, and hot-swapping between weapons on the fly, lets you change your fighting style whenever you want, offering a lot of versatility for Sekiro-style, parry-heavy battles. Wo Long also makes some interesting tweaks to the souls-like formula--instead of having to run back to where you died in order to reclaim what you lost there, for instance, you now have to face down whatever killed you. The result is a feeling of fighting out a series of battles and duels that have an element of rivalry baked in. Making your way through Wo Long's world isn't just about leveling up, but about staking a claim on each new piece of the map, turning exploration into a system that makes you stronger.\n\nDrawing inspirations from both From Software's games and Team Ninja's Nioh series, The First Berserker: Khazan does what those games do well: intense fights against huge, intense bosses. Khazan will scratch the itch for difficult combat against interesting enemies, especially with its unique art style and weapon-specific upgrade trees that give you incentives to lean into a specific combat style. The game is also part of the Dungeon & Fighter universe, so while it won't give you a huge open world full of lore to explore, there are deeper narrative underpinnings to intrigue fans of the franchise.\n\nInstead of going to the past or to a fantastical world, The Surge 2 takes place in a dystopian sci-fi future. Rogue robots threaten the world, and you'll face a variety of enemies both human and mechanical in a bid for survival. The Surge 2's melee combat adds a new dimension to the usual souls-like formula by allowing you to hack off specific limbs or parts of your foes in order to loot their weapons, armor, or items. If you're looking for an action-RPG that goes the apocalyptic future route rather than toward fantasy tropes, The Surge 2 will give you a whole new ruined world to explore.\n\nIf you're looking for more story and anime influence in your souls-like, Code Vein has you covered. Set in a world ravaged by a cataclysm that has resurrected the dead as vampire-like people called Revenants, you play an amnesiac character with a special ability--where other Revenants have what is essentially a single class called a Blood Code, you're able to compile and swap between many different Blood Codes and the special abilities that come with them. You'll use your vampiric powers to battle other Revenants after they've transformed into hideous monsters in an effort to save those who remain from a similar fate.\n\nWhile Diablo's combat is more oriented toward managing special abilities and cooldowns than it's geared toward dealing with stamina and parries, there's still a lot of similar DNA between it and Elden Ring. The Diablo series originated the RPG loot chase that defines so many games these days, and there's plenty of mechanical satisfaction in constantly chasing greater power. Diablo IV's story and world also play up the horror elements that often infuse Elden Ring, giving you a strange and terrible world to explore, along with massive, challenging bosses to defeat.",

Below, we examine this reality in a feature originally published in July 2025.\nIn a July 2025 shareholders meeting, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot made a salient yet obvious point about online video games: \"You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal.\" He added: \"Support for all games cannot last forever.",
    "fullText": "The idea of a \"forever game\" is a myth, and game makers should be cognizant of the end of their products.\n\n on January 15, 2026 at 9:38AM PST\n\nIn light of Anthem's recent shutdown, the topic of games going away for good is once again a hot-button issue. Below, we examine this reality in a feature originally published in July 2025.\n\nIn a July 2025 shareholders meeting, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot made a salient yet obvious point about online video games: \"You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal.\" He added: \"Support for all games cannot last forever.\"\n\nThis was in response to \"Stop Killing Games,\" a consumer movement that rallies against purported \"planned obsolescence\" of online video games from publishers. Sparked by the shutdown of Ubisoft's The Crew, the movement has gained traction in the past year through petitions directly to European governments.\n\nFrom a certain point of view, Guillemot sounds dismissive--like an elected official shrugging off constituent concerns about healthcare coverage by citing the inevitability of mortality. But the limited lifespan of modern live-service games is a reality that publishers and studios never address, at least publicly--or until it's suddenly time to pull the plug. Rarely does an executive acknowledge that their online game will, one day, come to an end.\n\nWhenever a company ships a video game, there's hope from all stakeholders involved that the title will make an impact. Newly shipped online games, in particular, would love to become the \"forever game\" for as many players as possible--the next Fortnite or Destiny 2. Nowadays, online games are in a relentless and never-ending pursuit of an unknown and unseen finish line. However, as we've seen with the likes of Concord, MultiVersus, XDefiant, and too many others to count, becoming the next Fortnite is an uphill, and perhaps in current market conditions, unfeasible goal.\n\nThe failures of so many aspiring killers of Genshin Impact, Call of Duty, Destiny, etc., lead me to ponder the \"forever games\" that continue to thrive. Will we be playing Fortnite Chapter 30 Season 4 in our twilight years from the cloud through data centers on Mars?\n\nIf we all take the \"nothing is eternal\" comment to heart, Fortnite will not literally last forever. One day, perhaps in the absurdly far future, Epic Games will stop adding new content to Fortnite. Some number of years later, Fortnite will go offline, and the game as we knew it will be dead.\n\nMaybe companies can stop killing games, but that won't stop games from dying. And the folks who make online games should at least consider how they'll give their games a merciful death when it's time.\n\nNintendo--a company not renowned for its online titles--did something strange before releasing Splatoon 3: it gave the game an endpoint. The shooting game would only get two years of seasonal content, including new maps, weapons, and clothes--though the game would very much remain playable.\n\nI recall going through all stages of grief while playing Splatoon 3. Having an expiration date for new content was conflicting. At first, playing it felt meaningless; I knew that, despite whatever level of success or popularity it reached, Nintendo was already planning to toss it aside, as it had with Super Mario Maker 2 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Yet, unlike those two other cases, Nintendo was very clear upfront about the level of support Splatoon 3 would receive.\n\nFrom my own experience, those two years with Splatoon 3 were immensely meaningful and special--knowing how long the game would remain fresh made me want to experience as much of that time as possible. And the fact that it got a Switch 2 update with new weapons, beyond the two-year limit, served as a pleasant surprise.\n\nBut what about a case like Mortal Kombat 1? Upon its release, game director Ed Boon sometimes spoke of \"years of content\" for the fighting game. So, when the news broke about this \"Definitive Edition,\" which would feature less than two years of content, including 12 new characters and a story expansion, it produced outrage from fans. After all, that's about the same amount of new content--and just a few months short--of the amount of support the preceding game, Mortal Kombat 11, received.\n\nTo fans dissatisfied with the state of MK1, this perceived death of the game was premature. It's an example of how the \"fairness\" of a video game's end-of-life support is ultimately defined by the relationship between the developers' transparency and the consumers' expectations. Maybe NetherRealm Studios wasn't candid enough about the life of MK1, but players might have expected too much--how many more characters did that game need? Still, any imbalance on either side of that developer-player relationship can lead to a PR nightmare.\n\nDespite video games having more than enough \"video game\" in it, today's business models have consumers constantly yearning for more. These games need to be constantly supported, improved, and iterated upon; otherwise, they're a \"dead game.\" Yet we also hear cries that online games are becoming too bloated, rooted in FOMO, and becoming second jobs.\n\nTo escape either of these pitfalls, developers of a live game could make it clear from the start that their service will only have, say, three years of new content. It may sting to hear at first, but I'd argue that it could make those three years impactful.\n\nDevelopers can stay focused with a clear goal in mind and move on to the next project afterward. Players can have proper expectations, knowing they have something quantifiable and solid to look forward to without devoting an indefinite amount of time. It's an option that might not make investors happy, but it's not one that companies should count out.\n\nThere lies the distinction, though, because at least Splatoon 3 and Mortal Kombat 1 are still playable online. Where the more challenging conversations lie is when those online services cease entirely.\n\nWith the total shutdown of a live-service game, especially one like The Crew, in which digital licenses are stripped away, there are legal and financial ramifications--and since the genesis of Stop Killing Games, there has been no shortage of internet debates surrounding them. But from a moral and philosophical standpoint, what does the complete shuttering of a game really mean?\n\nAs simple and true as Guillemot's point might be, it doesn't actually address one of the bigger points from Stop Killing Games, which is preservation and additional end-of-life options. When a video game is completely unplayable in any form, that is certain death.\n\nThe possible solutions for averting demise aren't revelatory: offline modes like with Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League and private server support like with Knockout City are viable options. These solutions take time, labor, and devotion to implement, and as developers will tell us, they aren't easy to accomplish.\n\nYet, the industry must rethink the path it is on where it has trained players into expecting endless content, and any gap or shortcoming spells death. We have to imagine a time when Fortnite concerts will be a thing of the past, and Destiny 2 actually has a final shape. This broader existential issue of end-of-life for video games and how to make it palatable for consumers is something that game makers must consider, and soon. \"Forever\" is running out.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "description": "Cygames, the developer and publisher behind the popular series of Granblue Fantasy video games, just opened an AI-focused studio. In response to the backlash toward this announcement, Cygames put out a message trying to assuage players' fears about generative AI's use in its games. The message isn't very reassuring, though.\nThis kerfuffle started on January 9, when a post on Cygames' Japanese website revealed that Cygames AI Studio had been established. The announcement explains that this new studio will research and develop its own models and provide services to others while drawing on Cygames' game development history and expertise.",

The former topic has fallen out of fashion now, after more than a decade’s worth of scientific research failed to prove any causative link between video games and real-world violence. But studies on the positive effects of games have shown that performing complex tasks with your brain and hands is actually quite good for you, and that games can be beneficial for your emotional wellbeing and stress management.\n\nThat’s all well and good, but I’m obsessed with the concept of “gamer brain” – that part of us that is drawn to objectively pointless achievements. Mastering a game or finishing a story are normal sources of motivation, but gamer brain is inexplicable. When you retry the same pointless mini-game over and over because you want to get a better high score? When you walk around the invisible boundaries of a level, clicking the mouse just in case something happens? When you stay with a game longer than you should because you feel compelled to unlock that trophy or achievement? When you refuse to knock the difficulty down a level on a particularly evil boss, because that would be letting the game win? That’s gamer brain.\n\nI am not sure whether games cause this very particular flavour of obstinacy, or whether people with obstinate tendencies are drawn to video games. But almost everyone I know who plays a lot of video games is susceptible to it. It’s the part of you that simply will not give in, the part of you that’s determined to bend a game’s rules to your will. The extreme version of it is learning to play impossible DragonForce songs from Guitar Hero at 2X speed, just because you can. Or everything that happens at Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), marathons of joyful gaming pointlessness in which people take on increasingly esoteric challenges, such as playing The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask blindfolded, or speeding through a cursed, modded version of Halo that’s full of random items from other games.\n\nIt was this year’s AGDQ, in fact, that got me thinking again about gamer brain, and why we love this stuff. But I also thought about it a lot while playing Baby Steps last year. It’s a game that embraces yet gently mocks the concept of gamer brain – not least through its main character, the useless Nate, who embodies a bunch of stereotypical gamer characteristics, including being totally unwilling to ask for help.\n\nTwo of its creators, Gabe Cuzillo and Bennett Foddy, told me a lot about this when we spoke in November. Baby Steps is full of moments that tease you, the player, into attempting ridiculous feats. At several points you’ll find big holes in the ground that you can purposefully fall into, just to see what happens (spoiler: nothing is ever down there). One character warns you away from a tower, telling you there’s no reason to climb it because there’s nothing at the top; of course, I immediately tried to climb the tower. Once, I spent 10 minutes inching my way up a river to a waterfall to see what was behind it; on the rocks behind the water was nothing but a crudely drawn penis.\n\n“There is a normal dirt path by a cliff that you can walk up perfectly safely, and then along the cliff is a series of wooden pegs that you could walk up instead, if you wanted to risk losing 20 minutes of progress,” says Foddy. “That’s a joke that you’re making with the player, because for them to find that funny, they have to know that they’re tempted to walk on the pegs. If the player didn’t feel anything about that other than, ‘Oh, that’s not the correct way to go, I won’t walk on those pegs’, then there’s no joke. But the player gets it because they do want to do the difficult thing.”\n\nThe most exquisite joke in all of Baby Steps, for me, comes when you find a pair of glasses that make invisible steps visible. If you decide to try to walk all the way across a bunch of rocky pillars to find these glasses, risking a fall at any moment that would waste perhaps an hour of your time, you will see a path of invisible steps that eventually lead to an invisible trophy. Nate will practically weep with joy in front of this trophy that nobody else can see, calling over a fellow hiker to admire it, who of course can only see Nate dancing around triumphantly in front of absolutely nothing.\n\n“The joke that we keep coming back to is when the player puts themselves in a particular psychological or emotional state and then Nate gets to reflect that in some way,” Foddy says. “You’re seeing yourself reflected in this loser. That’s the deep joke: this guy, this couch potato, he’s actually you in this moment.”\n\nCuzillo, who also voices Nate, has a chronic case of gamer brain. “Over time, we came around to this idea that a lot of the level design is an opportunity for introspection about why you’re playing the game at all, what kinds of rewards you’re attuned to and why you play games in general,” he says. “You’re asked as a player: What do you care about? Who are you as a person? If you don’t jump into the hole, you’re [left] wondering for the rest of the game about whether you should have jumped in the hole.”\n\nGamer brain is thought of as a masculine concept, though I can attest that you don’t have to be a man to suffer from it. “I think this is a gendered type of play, toxic masculine play, or at least it’s constructed as such,” Foddy says. “That stuff is riddled through gaming culture. It’s riddled through the kinds of characters that players are asked to embody. Nathan Drake in Uncharted is determined and full of grit, but is that the same thing as being obstinate and dogged and pursuing something stupid?”\n\nBaby Steps is one of those games that you can only truly appreciate if you have a bit of gamer brain in you. Trying to explain why it’s funny is close to impossible – you have to have some understanding of the compulsion and strange transcendence of pursuing pointless objectives. But here’s the key thing about gamer brain, and perhaps about games in general: these things aren’t pointless if they actually mean something to you.\n\nWhen I started Sword of the Sea last night and found myself surfing over dunes of tastefully rendered animated sand, I immediately thought of Journey. A lot of this game brings Journey to mind, from the art style and animation to the minimal demands that it makes of you as a player. But you know what? It’s been almost 15 years since that landmark PlayStation 3 game, and it’s been lovely to play something that channels its best moments. You swoosh around the desert, occasionally jumping, occasionally pressing square to make something happen, finding places where your magical sword can bring water back to your arid surroundings. After you’ve flooded the former desert, you surf around on the water instead, ocean creatures flitting around you. It is beautiful, mindful and soothing, if admittedly a little insubstantial; I have found it a comforting, achievable January play.\n\nAvailable on: PS5, PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 2-3 hours\n\nThis week I wrote about playing Hollow Knight: Silksong while living with a chronic pain condition; this beautiful, punishing game has become emblematic of a time when I was thinking a lot about the nature of suffering.\n\nLego’s take on Pokémon has finally been revealed, featuring a £579.99 Kanto evolutions set and a rather unfortunate-looking Pikachu. The Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise set does look extremely cool, but I do wonder who has the money for incredibly expensive nerd nostalgia toys in this economy.\n\nRockstar Games employees who were dismissed last year in an alleged act of union busting have been fighting the company in court, supported by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. After a preliminary hearing in Glasgow last week, a judge has denied the workers’ request for interim relief, meaning that they will not be paid while the legal case is ongoing.\n\nThe 15 best Xbox Series S/X games to play in 2026\n\nThe 15 best Nintendo Switch 2 games to play in 2026\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles – remastered 1997 classic is even more politically resonant now | ★★★★★\n\nPunchdrunk’s new mission: inside ‘live action video game’ Lander 23 – in pictures\n\nGames correspondent Keith Stuart answers this question, which came in from reader David on email:\n\nMy new year resolution is to cut down on Baldur’s Gate 3 and Battlefield and play a few more experimental indie games. But what’s the best way to find them?\n\n First of all, congratulations on deciding to expand your gaming intake. There’s nothing wrong with blockbuster games, but it’s really lovely to discover brand new – and sometimes incredibly weird – experiences. Aside from the Guardian’s regular indie recs, of course, the front page of digital video game store Itch.io is a good starting point – a lot of smaller developers put their new projects on there and it’s quite well curated. Steam also runs regular indie promotions, including an annual indie festival, and it’s worth watching the annual Indie Game awards, IndieCade and Games for Change for interesting titles. There are lots of review sites specialising in indie titles, too – for example, Indie Game Reviewer and John Walker’s Buried Treasure. Elsewhere, Bluesky is great for following indie developers – there are lots of lists and starter packs to join, which will give you instant access to indie communities. You can search Bluesky’s directory for suggestions. The good thing is, the more indie games you play, the more you get to know the developers and community, and the more new ones you discover.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "fullText": "Research finds no evidence heavier social media use or more gaming increases symptoms of anxiety or depression\n\nScreen time spent gaming or on social media does not cause mental health problems in teenagers, according to a large-scale study.\n\nWith ministers in the UK considering whether to follow Australia’s example by banning social media use for under-16s, the findings challenge concerns that long periods spent gaming or scrolling TikTok or Instagram are driving an increase in teenagers’ depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions.\n\nResearchers at the University of Manchester followed 25,000 11- to 14-year-olds over three school years, tracking their self-reported social media habits, gaming frequency and emotional difficulties to find out whether technology use genuinely predicted later mental health difficulties.\n\nParticipants were asked how much time on a normal weekday in term time they spent on TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and other social media, or gaming. They were also asked questions about their feelings, mood and wider mental health.\n\nThe study found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression over the following year.\n\nIncreases in girls’ and boys’ social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had zero detrimental impact on their mental health the following year, the authors found. More time spent gaming also had a zero negative effect on pupils’ mental health.\n\n“We know families are worried, but our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems – the story is far more complex than that,” said the lead author Dr Qiqi Cheng.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Public Health, also examined whether how pupils use social media makes a difference, with participants asked how much time spent chatting with others, posting stories, pictures and videos, browsing feeds, profiles or scrolling through photos and stories. The scientists found that actively chatting on social media or passive scrolling feeds did not appear to drive mental health difficulties.\n\nThe authors stressed that the findings did not mean online experiences were harmless. Hurtful messages, online pressures and extreme content could have detrimental effects on wellbeing, but focusing on screen time alone was not helpful, they said.\n\n“Our findings tell us that young people’s choices around social media and gaming may be shaped by how they’re feeling but not necessarily the other way around,” said Prof Neil Humphrey, a co-author. “Rather than blaming technology itself, we need to pay attention to what young people are doing online, who they’re connecting with and how supported they feel in their daily lives.”",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — Mark Brnovich, Arizona's top law enforcement officer when the state became the epicenter of efforts by President Donald Trump and his allies to find proof that the 2020 election was marred by fraud, has died. He was 59.\n\nBrnovich died after having a heart attack Monday, Katie Conner, a representative of the family, said Tuesday.\n\nColleagues and friends of Brnovich praised him for his work in public service that included stints as a judge, a prosecutor, lawyer and the director of the Arizona Department of Gaming. Former Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Brnovich's passion for the law, justice and victims were hallmarks of his career.\n\n“For those of us blessed to call him a friend, his humor, positivity, and happy warrior spirit were infectious. May he rest in peace,” Ducey said on the social platform X.\n\nBrnovich, a Republican, was in his second term as attorney general in Arizona when his office investigated the 2020 election. Arizona was among the states Joe Biden won that year to deny Trump reelection to the presidency.\n\nBrnovich released an interim report in April 2022 that outlined his concerns with some election procedures but did not provide any proof of major issues despite six months of investigation.\n\nAt the time, Brnovich was seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat and facing fierce criticism from Trump, who claimed he wasn’t doing enough to prosecute election fraud. Brnovich wanted an endorsement from Trump but didn't get it.\n\nWhen current Attorney General Kris Mayes took office, she revealed that Brnovich suppressed findings from his investigators. Mayes said the records showed the 2020 election “was conducted fairly and accurately by election officials.”\n\nThe documents she released also showed Brnovich withheld a separate memo that systematically refuted election conspiracies that took root on the right, including allegations of dead or duplicate voters, pre-marked ballots flown in from Asia, election servers connected to the internet and even manipulation by satellites controlled by the Italian military.\n\nMayes posted on X that she was saddened to hear of Brnovich's sudden passing and said he dedicated many years to public service. She offered condolences to his wife Susan and their family.\n\nBrnovich lost the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in 2021. In a video launching his campaign, Brnovich described himself as the son of immigrants who fled communism in Yugoslavia. He said he used his post as attorney general to take on “crony capitalists” and government overreach, while promoting religious liberty, border security and election integrity.\n\nIn April, Trump nominated Brnovich to be ambassador to Serbia but withdrew his nomination in October.",

    "description": "Developer Sandfall's RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of 2025's breakout hits, and with a budget of reportedly less than $10 million, a relatively small development staff, and a price point below $70, some have said the game could be representative of a \"AA\"-style project that can break through. It may have worked for Expedition 33, and it could work for other titles, but Hazelight boss Josef Fares wants to see the AAA space continue and hopes that decision-makers in gaming don't go all-in on smaller-scale games with lower budgets.\n\"You do hear, after the success of things like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that the AA games are taking over. But I would not be able to live without a AAA title,\" he told The Game Business. \"I really want to play the blockbuster games.",

Taking several design cues from the red armor of EVA Unit 02--the mech piloted by Asuka Langley--fans of the anime can grab a Razer mouse, keyboard, mouse pad, headset, and even a slick gaming chair that looks like it was pulled straight out of the Evangelion universe. Pricing and an exact release date for these items have not yet been revealed, but we'll update the post as soon as Razer confirms them.",

    "title": "Creatine, ADHD video games: The quest for a better brain is turning into a gold rush",
    "description": "Americans love trying to upgrade their brains — one scoop, zap, or gaming session at a time",
    "fullText": "At this point, you've probably at least thought about dropping a few scoops of creatine into your morning smoothie. An amino acid compound that promotes energy production in brain and muscle cells, it's been a gym staple for building muscle for decades. In recent years, researchers have started to unpack creatine's potential cognition-boosting benefits, including promising early studies for sleep-deprived people and Alzheimer's patients.\n\nAt the Vitamin Shoppe, sales of creatine are up 320% since 2019, the company said in its 2025 trend report. Searches for \"creatine gummies\" spiked 1,300% last year, while the powder remains a \"mainstay.\"\n\nIf supplements aren't your thing, but gaining a neuro edge is, you might have considered a brain-training headset, which promises to combat brain aging and cognitive decline, as well as improve sleep. Or a game that promises help with the symptoms of adult ADHD.\n\nConsumer products that promise sharper thinking, calmer moods, and a cognitive edge are suddenly everywhere.\n\nMeta and Apple are developing, patenting, or acquiring devices we could soon wear around our wrists, on the collars of our shirts, or inside our nostrils to improve our mood — and maybe even \"boost\" intelligence by providing a kind of IQ-enhancing adrenaline boost for the brain. Much of the new brain tech is being driven by AI, which enables more real-time feedback.\n\nBrain hacking is also becoming a high-end perk at some workplaces.\n\nIn 2014, there were just 41 consumer neurotech companies, according to a recent report from the Centre for Future Generations. By 2024, that number had soared to 153, outpacing medical device manufacturing for the brain.\n\nAnd who wouldn't want a little brain enhancement?\n\nA rapidly aging population that's increasingly extending working lives well into the golden years, longevity-focused biohackers, and women looking for treatments for menopause-related brain fog all add up to a potentially massive consumer base.\n\n\"People want to find that one magic thing: one magic game or app or something that makes you better at a whole suite of things in a super short time,\" UCSD cognitive neuroscientist Bradley Voytek, who studies how brain communication changes as we age, told Business Insider.\n\nIt all sounds great, right? But what does science have to say about any of this?\n\nThe trouble with optimizing our brains is that no two brains work the same way. The question worth asking is not so much what the human brain needs, but rather what your brain needs.\n\nDepending on the answer, you might be better off pursuing something that's tailored to your specific needs or goals, rather than a mass-marketed brain booster.\n\nTake creatine. An emerging body of research focused on older adults suggests that it can improve sleep and potentially help stave off cognitive decline. Large, well-controlled studies are scarce, especially for younger, generally healthy individuals. That's not to say that creatine is bad; it's just that it may help you build muscle but not meaningfully improve cognition.\n\nDoctors generally suggest blood testing for nutritional deficiencies before you start taking supplements. That same advice holds for fancy, brain-boosting tech.\n\nSimilarly, a lot of neuro-edge devices might offer some benefit. They may not address your precise concerns or your very specific, long-term cognitive vulnerabilities.\n\n\"The way you improve cognition is to work around the areas of weakness,\" says neuroscientist Dean Sherzai, the executive director of clinical research at Charles R. Drew University and best-selling author of \"The Alzheimer's Solution.\" \"You build it back up.\"\n\nThere are some things, of course, that are good for everyone. Quality sleep. Regular, moderate-to-intense exercise. A healthy, nutrient-rich diet. Meaningful social interaction. Virtually every neuroscientist agrees on this foundational, grandma-approved advice.\n\nThere is also promising research around the power of brain games.\n\nBrainHQ, which sells a mind-training program, released a study in partnership with McGill University in Canada that found that adults aged 65 and up, who did the exercises for 30 minutes a day for 10 weeks, experienced a roughly 2% increase in their acetylcholine levels — a key brain chemical that aids in movement, memory, and learning.\n\nBrain-body training can also offer clear benefits for various aspects of cognition, including visual perception, balance, coordination, focus, relaxation, and working memory.\n\nThat can be great for anyone hoping to promote a performance edge, whether they're a professional athlete or a stock trader.\n\nSome companies are taking note, and offering such training as a high-end perk.\n\nLast year, JLL, the commercial real estate giant, set up a \"brain gym\" in its Singapore office that was outfitted with the same kind of gear that high-performance athletes use to train their brains, like lighted pods and vision training boards.\n\n\"Wouldn't you want those people to be 1% more high performing or more focused or more productive?\" said Ben Hamley, JLL's global head of research and development. He said employees who participated saw improvements to their focus, including being better able to resist distractions.\n\nFor all the options, experts say that consumers are left to figure out what they, personally, need most and filter through what's bogus versus what could be good for them — and do it all on their own.\n\nNone of the neuroscientists I interviewed for this story said they personally use brain games or pulsating devices regularly — at least, not yet.\n\nExperts agree that one of the most important things you can do is to continuously challenge yourself in the real world. This might include discovering new places, engaging in deep conversations with other people, and picking up a new skill, such as a foreign language or a musical instrument.\n\n\"If you're not getting in nature and walking and interacting with other people, you are missing core ingredients of keeping a healthy brain,\" says Dr. Adam Gazzaley, founder and executive director of the University of California San Francisco's Neuroscape center.\n\nGazzaley believes in the power of technology to help train our brains — he spent 15 years developing what became EndeavorOTC, the first video game approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult ADHD.\n\nHe also sees its limits. \"No amount of hacks are going to help,\" he said, if you haven't built that healthy foundation. \"Watching TV all day would be the opposite example of that, where you just passively, like a fire hose, have information flood into your brain as opposed to interactively pushing yourself and thinking and interpreting information that's outside of your normal inputs,\" he said.\n\nFor all the exciting promise of neurotech products, what we'll most benefit from is the right device, the right technique, the right prescription, and all at the right time.\n\nFor now, we don't quite understand how to exercise each person's brain in the most effective way every day.\n\nVoytek, the neuroscience professor, says when students come to him struggling with focus or are unable to complete assignments, he never suggests brain training.\n\n\"I would recommend sleep,\" he said.",

Nintendo in particular has a lot to celebrate this year, with big anniversaries for The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Kid Icarus, and Animal Crossing coming in addition to the games I mentioned previously. That said, both Sony and Xbox have reason to celebrate as well, as Tomb Raider turns 30 and Halo--and Xbox as a brand overall--hit 25.\n\nBut perhaps the most exciting thing to consider in light of all these anniversaries are the announcements that could be lingering just around the corner. Though we've already received confirmation that a remake of the original Tomb Raider is in the works, and other series such as Donkey Kong, Pokemon, and Resident Evil all have new or upcoming entries, there are a few games on this list that have been dormant for some time. Could 2026 be the year we get a new Kid Icarus or Castlevania? No clue, but a girl can hope, right?\n\nSo without further ado, is a round up of all the series with milestone anniversaries in 2026:",

In case you couldn't make it to Las Vegas this year, here's a quick look at the technology that caught our eyes.\n\nAsus and XReal have teamed up for a new set of extended reality glasses, and on paper, these have some seriously impressive tech inside. Scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses and a dock that lets you connect them to a console or PC via HDMI and DisplayPort.\n\nWhat's better than one 3K 16-inch OLED screen on a gaming laptop? Two 3K 16-inch OLED screens, of course. While this isn't the first time Asus has experimented with a multi-monitor display on one of its ROG laptops, this new take on the Zephyrus Duo looks like a wild approach to dual-screen gaming.\n\nHolograms make everything cooler, and Asus is leveraging this technology to create a seriously cool PC gaming case. The Asus ROG GM1000 can use its case fans to project holographic images, and users can upload their own GIFs and short MP4s to create custom effects.\n\nGameSir might be onto something, as the idea of a gaming controller with a dedicated steering wheel right in the center sounds like a fun idea. You've got all the inputs you'd require from modern gaming, a direct drive motor, and up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering, the company claims (via The Verge). Pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed.\n\nGameSir's other big controller reveal was the X5 Alteron, a Swiss Army knife of a peripheral designed for iPad, iPhone, Android, and Nintendo Switch. HyperX is helping develop it, and the modular system lets you customize the controller with various modules. This means that you can customize it extensively with different D-pads, thumbsticks, and buttons to create your dream controller.\n\nA gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port, the 8BitDo FlipPad borrows heavily from the design of the classic Nintendo Game Boy. The company says it'll reveal more details on the Android and iOS controller ahead of its launch in Summer 2026.\n\nIt might look visually inspired by Nespresso coffee machines, but the new mid-tower case unveiled by CyberPowerPC at CES has an elegant quality. It has everything you'd expect--tempered glass panels, mesh ventilation, and ports--but the real showstopper here is a selection of knobs for controlling the LEDs on this sleek case.\n\n8BitDo makes some of the best controllers, and at CES 2026, it unveiled the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E wireless modular controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple devices, and Android. Just don't expect this to be a budget-friendly option, as the Ultimate 3E will retail for $150 at launch in Q2 2026.\n\nIf you're a fan of Kojima Productions--the studio headed by famed game developer Hideo Kojima--then you'll want to check out these new peripherals from Asus. This special-edition hardware features hand-drawn illustrations by Yoji Shinkawa--the art director for the Death Stranding games--and it'll launch on February 4.\n\nThe newly revealed Corsair Galleon 100 SD mechanical keyboard doesn't have a numpad, but it does have a built-in Elgato Stream Deck Plus. This part of the keyboard features 12 customizable buttons, a five-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and rotary dials. It launches on January 29 and it's priced at $350.\n\nRazer's Project Ava is aiming to be a holographic AI desktop companion that can fulfill several roles. From lifestyle reminders to gaming wingman, the device will come with several AI personalities and is expected to launch within the first half of 2026.\n\nWe're skeptical about this concept for a \"non-invasive\" gaming headset that supposedly improves your skills in competitive games, but at least Neurable and HyperX's protoype looks like a comfy set of brain-scanning cans.\n\nUltrawide monitors have become a popular option over the years, but laptop users can't enjoy them on the go--unless they want to lug a spare monitor around. That's where this concept for a rollable screen comes in: Lenovo is courting \"athletes who need pro-level performance\" with its gaming laptop. The screen can unfurl to 16, 21.5, and 24 inches.\n\nHyperX isn't the only company with AI-powered headphones at CES 2026, as Razer also showed off its Project Motoko concept. The idea behind this wireless headset is that it uses a ton of tech--including two 4K cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, near and far field microphones, and built-in AI--to serve a similar function to other AI wearables, like taking photos, translating foreign text, or conversing with an AI assistant.\n\nIt's not gaming tech, but this $399 ultrasonic chef's knife from Seattle Ultrasonics is the closest thing we have to owning a high-frequency blade in real life. Can it effortlessly cut through a Metal Gear mech? Probably not, but the vibrating piezoelectric ceramic crystals will let you slice through fruit and vegetables easily.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't have a new GPU to show off this year, the company did reveal its DLSS 4.5 upscaling technology. The company claims it can dynamically boost performance in compatible games, enabling up to 240+ frames per second with path tracing on 50-series GPU cards.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Gaming Controllers Are Going Modular This Year",
    "description": "One controller to rule them all!",
    "fullText": "Gaming controllers are just one of those things that I love to collect, but living in a small New York apartment, eventually enough is enough. At CES this year, I saw three new controllers that are all trying to be the last ones I'll ever need to buy (for specific systems, at least). It seems like modularity is in, and all three of these devices want to meet all of your needs. However, they're not settled on what the best approach is.\n\nThe GameSir x Hyperkin X5 Alteron is probably the cutest controller on this list, especially if you grew up playing GameCube or Nintendo 64. Essentially, it's a telescopic mobile controller that stretches to fit around your phone or small tablet, but the gimmick is that all of the face buttons and sticks come in hot swappable modules, and can be freely mixed-and-matched for multiple configurations.\n\nYou could do a standard Xbox style layout. You could opt for a layout with symmetrical, PlayStation style thumbsticks instead. You could use GameCube or Nintendo 64 style face button configurations, which is a unique touch. There are even options for a six-button arcade style layout or a Steam Deck style trackpad.\n\nEssentially, play your cards right, and this thing could fit any need you might possibly have, so long as you're playing on mobile. You could even get weird and slot in a GameCube layout for your left hand and a Nintendo 64 layout for your right hand.\n\nThe different configurations all pop in and out easily, but don't feel loose when you're using the controller. And there are also bells and whistles like back paddles and trigger stops, for extra buttons and quicker reaction times. The sticks are also capacitive, which essentially means they shouldn't drift, but also won't cause magnetic interference like Hall Effect or TMR sticks (other popular anti-drift technology) can.\n\nThe catch? While this isn't a concept, pricing and availability aren't set in stone yet. GameSir also told me it's still figuring out distribution, so it's unclear how many control modules will come with the controller, if you'll be able to buy them separately, and how much they'll cost if you do. The company did say it's targeting a $100 release, but that could change, and it's still figuring out how to make that a reality.\n\nThe other issue, of course, is that this is mobile only, although GameSir said it might make a more traditional version in the future. This isn't the first controller with hot swappable modules, but others are usually pro-level and don't have nearly as many options as the X5 Alteron does.\n\n8BitDo is one of my favorite controller companies, especially for retro style controllers. Last year, it already dipped its toes into modularity with the 8BitDo Pro 3. That was a PlayStation-style controller that allowed you to individually swap out any of the main four face buttons to place them in whatever order you wanted, which made it easier to swap between Xbox (ABXY) and Nintendo (BAYX) style layouts. Now, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3e is taking that concept and really running with it.\n\nOfficially licensed by Xbox but also compatible with PC and mobile devices, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3e looks like a standard Xbox controller at first, but has a removable face plate that gives you access to a bunch of options. Take it off, and you can lift out the sticks, D-Pad, or face buttons to swap them for ones with a different feel.\n\nYour overall control layout will still be the same—there's no mimicking the GameCube, swapping the order of the ABXY buttons, or changing your stick position here. But you could opt for either a four-way or circular D-Pad or sticks with different lengths or grips, for instance. The ABXY button modules also come in both quiet silicone versions or clicky, micro-switch versions.\n\nThat's a lot of control, and it comes on top of 8BitDo's standard Ultimate controller features, like the included charging dock, extra macro buttons, trigger stops, a gyroscope, and 1,000hz polling.\n\n8BitDo says the Ultimate 3e controller will cost $150 and will come with all your control options. It's set to ship later this year.\n\nWhen I reviewed the MCON magnetic gaming controller late last year, I wanted to love it. It was my favorite product from last CES, but when it came to market, I had a few issues with it that made me feel like it wasn't quite complete. Well, they're still in the prototype phase, but MCON makers OhSnap are now working on two new MCON models that are looking to fix pretty much all of my problems with the original device.\n\nCalled the MCON Slim and the MCON Lite, these versions of the device are much smaller and should be much cheaper than the version that's on the market now, but retain almost all of its features. There are a few compromises to make that happen, but ultimately, they look like moves in the right direction.\n\nFirst, both the MCON Slim and the MCON Lite have manual sliding mechanisms for their controls. That means the controls normally slip tucked away behind your phone, but can be pulled out like an old-school Android keyboard. I actually prefer this. The original MCON instead uses a spring-loaded sliding mechanism, and it's pretty violent, and can send your phone flying if you're not careful.\n\nSecond, when I say these are smaller, I mean it. If the original MCON felt like attaching a MagSafe battery bank to your phone, these feel a lot more like using a MagSafe wallet. I didn't mind the size of the original too much, but it really is impressive how much the new models have slimmed down.\n\nFinally, while pricing isn't finalized yet, MCON told me to expect the new models to be somewhere between 1/3rd to half the price of the current one. That's a huge markdown on the pricey $150 original, even as these fix some of my problems with it.\n\nTo be fair, you do lose out on a little bit here, but not much. The MCON Slim and MCON Lite still have a kickstand mode, and still feature a full set of buttons, but they handle their shoulder buttons and thumbsticks differently. Both the Slim and Lite have \"inline\" shoulder buttons, which means the L1/R1 and L2/R2 buttons are next to each other horizontally rather than stacked. Not a big deal for me, but some people may prefer a console-like layout. The bigger differences come in the thumbsticks.\n\nThe MCON Slim uses 3DS-style circle pads instead of Switch-style thumbsticks, which is how it's able to save so much space. They aren't my favorite, but I've never had any problems making them work. The MCON Lite, then, uses dual-trackpads instead of thumbsticks. That makes it even smaller than the Slim, but I've never had great luck using trackpads for analog style inputs. It could be useful for games that need a mouse, though.\n\nSo, what makes these modular? Well, aside from giving you more model options and carrying forward the removable kickstand mode from the original MCON, part of what allows these models to be so thin is that they use custom backplates designed for certain phones, whereas the original model used a bulkier solution that fits all phones.\n\nThe MCON Slim and MCON Lite are the most conceptual of the devices on this list, but OhSnap assured me that at least one will make its way to market, hopefully this year. Apparently, there are still internal debates about whether the model with trackpads is worth releasing or not.",

    "fullText": "In this week’s newsletter: Stranger Things’ climactic showdown is the latest pop culture spectacle to feel like its been ported straight from a console. The industries’ reciprocally influential relationship can be to everyone’s gain\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nIt had begun to feel like an endurance test by the end, but nonetheless, like the sucker I am, I watched the Stranger Things finale last week. And spoiler warning: I’m going to talk about it in general terms in this newsletter. Because approximately 80% of the final season comprised twentysomething “teenagers” explaining things to each other while using random 1980s objects to illustrate convoluted plans and plot points, my expectations were not high. After an interminable hour, finally, something fun happens, as the not-kids arm themselves with machine guns and molotovs and face off against a monstrously gigantic demon-crab. Aha, I thought – the final boss battle!\n\nThe fight was like something out of Monster Hunter, all scale and spectacle with a touch of desperation. For a very long time, video games sought to imitate cinema. Now cinema (and TV) often feels like a video game. The structure of Stranger Things’ final season reminded me a lot of Resident Evil: long periods of walking slowly through corridors, with characters exchanging plot information aloud on their way to the action, and occasional explosions of gunfire, screeching monsters or car chases. Those long periods of relative inaction are much more tolerable when you’ve got a controller in your hands. I am all for TV and film embracing the excitement, spectacle and dynamism of video games, but do they have to embrace the unnecessary side-quests and open-world bloat, too?\n\nThe reciprocally influential relationship between games, TV and film has developed a lot in the last few years. A generation of gen X and elder-millennial gamers have recently aged into creative and commissioning power in these industries. That’s why we’re getting people such as Jonathan Nolan heading up an excellent Fallout TV show, and indeed why all video-game-to-screen adaptations have become dramatically less terrible in the past five years or so. It also inevitably means that the boundaries between interactive and non-interactive entertainment are becoming more porous: where previously game-makers were heavily influenced by film (primarily but not exclusively Alien/s and Star Wars), now that relationship works both ways. Most Marvel movies look and feel like a video game to me, and not just because they’re all full of computer-generated graphics. It’s the mood and pace of them.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow remains the most video-game-ish movie I’ve ever seen: its premise revolves around dying and respawning, trying out different things on each run. It’s a sci-fi roguelike of a film. I wanted to play Mad Max: Fury Road the entire time I was watching it, and John Wick 4 was literally a fighting-game boss rush. When film critics say that a film feels like a video game, they often mean it disparagingly; a lot of cinephiles still see games as the lower form. When I say a movie feels like a video game, it’s a compliment – unless it feels like a boring video game.\n\nThis was the problem, for me, with Stranger Things: every episode felt like loading up an open-world game that I hadn’t played for a few months. More and more characters kept appearing, and I didn’t remember or care who most of them were. Between the Upside Down, Vecna’s mindscape, real-world Hawkins and an entirely new dimension introduced in the last couple of episodes, there were too many locations to keep track of. Every episode brought on the mild despair I feel when I think I’m near the end of an overlong game, only to discover yet another entirely new area to explore. The painfully long epilogue, meanwhile, was rivalled only by Red Dead Redemption 2’s interminable post-game hours. Please, just let it end already!\n\nOf course, in modern pop culture, nothing is ever allowed to end properly, not if it’s still making money. I’m surprised there’s been no word of an official Stranger Things video game tie-in (outside of a retro-style smartphone beat-em-up from 2019). Come to think of it, we don’t see many of these kinds of licensed games any more: back in the 00s and 2010s, most major movies and TV shows launched with an interactive accompaniment. Presumably this is because of the spiralling cost of game development – you can’t knock out a mediocre PlayStation 2 game in nine months any more – but also, when TV shows feel so much like games, do we really need an adaptation anyway?\n\nThe first game I’ve finished in 2026 is Indika, a surreal and mildly horrible game about a young nun questioning her faith and having conversations with the devil as she goes on an extremely strange journey through bleak, snow-covered villages and abandoned factories with an escaped convict. There are much-needed flashes of humour in here, but also stuff about religion, control and sexuality that I haven’t seen in a video game before. It’s also part of a small wave of games (see Baby Steps) that mocks gamer mentality: there are points, but they are pointless; explore off the beaten path and you will find something useless and inconsequential rather than a secret or something fun. And that’s if you find anything at all.\n\nAvailable on: PC, PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch\n\n Estimated playtime: five hours\n\nDavid Rosen, the co-founder of Sega and an influential figure in the history of arcade video games, died on Christmas Day at 95. Keith Stuart writes about his very interesting life.\n\nHollow Knight: Silksong has picked up a game-of-the-year trophy in PC games storefront Steam’s publicly voted awards. The Sit Back and Relax award was won by something I’ve never heard of: RV There Yet. I have bought it out of curiosity.\n\nMy book about Nintendo is out next month! It’s called Super Nintendo and it’s a lively cultural history of the most beloved company in games, based on 20 years of interviews (and 30 years as a player). You can support the Guardian by ordering it through the Guardian Bookshop, and I’ll also be doing launch events around the UK throughout February.\n\nThe 15 best PS5 games to play in 2026\n\n‘I wanted that Raiders of the Lost Ark excitement – you could die any minute’\n\nFrom K-pop and The Traitors to Grand Theft Auto VI: your A-Z of the biggest culture of 2026\n\nIn a recent Pushing Buttons, Keza mentioned that games have consolidated into five established mega-franchises and I was trying to work out which franchises these are? I guessed GTA, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft and EA FC, but don’t have huge confidence in that!\n\nYou’re not far off. According to data from Circana, the top five most played games on PlayStation 5 this year were exactly the same as last year: Fortnite, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto 5 (including Online), Roblox and Minecraft. All of these games are five to 10-plus years old. This stagnation at the top is why every big publisher has spent millions in the last decade trying to create live-service games, and why most of them have flopped. Last year on Steam, meanwhile, only 14% of all playtime was spent on new games released in 2025. Any developer releasing something new, be they blockbuster or indie, is competing for a sliver of a sliver of players’ time and money. These stats explain a lot about why the games industry is where it is right now, and why there’s such a bleak mood among many developers.",

    "fullText": "The Fallout episode this week also depicted an important event from a beloved DLC.\n\n on January 7, 2026 at 12:00AM PST\n\nSpoilers for this week's episode of Fallout to follow.\n\nThis week’s episode of Fallout was an explosive one. Between Lucy (Ella Purnell) and Cooper (Walton Goggins) finally arriving in New Vegas, Maximus (Aaron Moten) causing conflict within the Brotherhood of Steel, and Vault 31 struggling to survive without their waterchip, there was no shortage of exciting events. With exciting events come easter eggs and deeper ties to the Fallout video games that are a treat for new and returning fans. Let's take a look at some of this week’s easter eggs as the show arrives in the City of Sin.\n\nThis week’s episode began with a pre-war flashback depicting Cooper fighting on the Alaskan front. In Fallout lore, Alaska was occupied by Communist Chinese forces and fought the United States over control of Anchorage. The liberation of Anchorage was most famously depicted in the Operation: Anchorage DLC for Fallout 3, which saw the player character entering a simulation to relive the historical battle.\n\nThe Alaska flashback also depicts the first time the United States deployed the T-45 power armor, which helped to aid their victory against the Chinese forces. Power armor ends up becoming the main tool of the Brotherhood of Steel after Roger Maxson left the United States army to form the organization, but longtime fans will also recognize the T-45 model of the armor as the centerpiece on the cover of the original 1997 Fallout game.\n\nWhen Lucy recovers we learn that she was being pumped up with Buffout, a chem from the video games that provides a boost to strength stats and is essentially a powerful, in-world steroid. Like many other chems in the games, Buffout becomes addictive after prolonged use and leads to negative stat effects unless the player keeps using it regularly or goes many in-game days without use. With no time on her side, Lucy has to keep using Buffout or face negative repercussions from her addiction.\n\nThroughout the episode--particularly whenever they run into trouble on The Strip--Cooper suggests that they take a detour to Freeside to either avoid combat or learn information. Players of Fallout: New Vegas will recognize Freeside as one of the last locations they can visit before they reach their destination of The Strip. Overrun by gangs such as The Kings (who appear in this episode as ghouls), Freeside is inspired by the real-life location of Fremont Street. The real world location is disconnected from the Las Vegas Strip and offers cheaper (and sometimes more rambunctious) entertainment options for travelers and tourists.\n\nWhile Lucy is high on Buffout and gets into a shootout with The Kings, her final kill is showcased with a slow motion gory headshot that is very cinematically pleasing. This shot replicates a critical headshot in V.A.T.S. from the Fallout video games. The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System allows players to slow down or freeze time to line up gory head and body shots and was introduced in Fallout 3 as a way of replicating the turn-based combat of the first two entries.\n\nThe credits of the episode depict an abandoned Camp McCarran inside a derelict Las Vegas International Airport. In Fallout: New Vegas Camp McCarran was the largest active military base of the New California Republic and served as the NCR’s stronghold in their activities against Caesar’s Legion. With the NCR all but non-existent in the Mojave Wasteland as of late, it’s not surprising to see Camp McCarran has met the fate it has.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Lenovo's new concept for CES, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable, aims to give you the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen the laptop is closed, or when you first open it up, the Legion Pro Rollable looks like any other gaming laptop. It's a little thick, with RGB keys and a full numpad, but otherwise isn't notable. It's also got a bog standard, 16:9 aspect ratio. But with the press of a button, it can extend to a 21:9 ultrawide screen. And while it's not quite as fancy as the 32:9 screens the most spoiled gamers use, you can actually extend it further to a 24:9 screen if you want.\n\nThat trick is possible thanks to a rollable OLED panel, something Lenovo's shown off and even released before, but for laptops that extend vertically, and aren't meant for gamers. The transformation is quick and quiet, and Windows doesn't even need time to adjust to match your new aspect ratio. It kind of feels like you're unfurling a scroll.\n\nIn total, the screen space can extend from 16-inches in 16:9 (or \"Focus\") mode to 21-inches in 21:9 (or \"Tactical\") mode to 24-inches in 24:9 (or \"Arena\" mode). Aspect ratio numbers don't always match screen space measurements that neatly, but hey, they're easy to keep track of here.\n\nHaving up to 24 inches of screen space on-the-go could be a life changer, and not just for gamers. Currently, I'm writing this article while traveling, which means I'm stuck with just my laptop screen. I'm sorely missing the second monitor I have at home, and being able to swap my screen into an ultrawide mode could easily fix that issue. Plus, I could just shrink it back down to a more standard form factor when it comes time to pack it away.\n\nThe only real catches would be weight and price. I don't have specific numbers for how heavy this is, but it didn't feel too different from any other gaming laptop in my hands. Beefy, but not back-breaking.\n\nAs for price, here's the kicker. Because this is just a concept, there's no pricing or availability info, since it's not guaranteed to come out. Lenovo does say the unit I saw is based on a top-specced Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, though, which currently goes for around $3,000.\n\nThat would be a lot to pay, especially because the extending screen would probably add a couple hundred dollars to the price tag. I wouldn't put too much stock into the demo unit right now, though—if this does make it to market, you'll probably be able to configure it to better match your needs.\n\nPersonally, though, I might be willing to pay that $3,000. Not only is this truly unique in the space, but it also conveniently solves one of my biggest pain points when I have to use my laptop, which is the lack of a two-screen setup. It could even be useful for desktop gamers looking to make the transition to portable gaming—no more having to choose which type of monitor you want.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Lenovo's New 'AI Frame' Gaming Monitor Might Actually Just Be Cheating",
    "description": "Is it OK to use AI to zoom in on your reticle in a shooter?",
    "fullText": "It's easy to take this for granted, but not everyone is able to immediately look at a shooting or strategy game and find the reticle or map. Gaming UIs can get complicated, and for less-seasoned gamers, they can be pretty intimidating, too. Lenovo's new concept \"AI Frame\" monitor, shown off at CES 2026, aims to make some games a bit more approachable, although experts might consider it cheating.\n\nHardware-wise, this is a normal 21:9 ultrawide gaming monitor, but it's not actually meant to be used like that. Instead, you play your game in a left-justified 16:9 rectangle that takes up most of the screen, and in the remaining space, the AI will automatically zoom in on part of your gameplay and show a blown-up version of it. For instance, it might show you a zoomed-in map in a MOBA, so you don't have to look at the tiny mini-map in your main gameplay to know where you or your team are. Or, it might zoom in on your reticle in a shooter, letting you better see your targets. There's even enough space left over for you to pull up an internet browser and look up some help.\n\nIt worked pretty well for me in-person. Again, it doesn't actually generate any visuals, but instead just blows up the most important parts of your game screen so you can more easily glance at them or see them in more detail. That does mean resolution can suffer a little, but that's what your main gameplay screen is for. For getting across information, it's a good option.\n\nPlus, while some games will automatically know what to zoom in on, there's also a generic zoom mode that will just blow up whatever your mouse is hovering over, so it can work with any content. The AI Frame is being pitched for games, but you could also use it like a digital magnifying glass on an article in your browser, for instance.\n\nThe catch? It's maybe not exactly \"fair\" to play this way. While a bigger map in a MOBA might just save you some eyestrain, an AI-assisted zoom on a shooting reticle basically lets anyone act like a sniper, regardless of what character you're playing or gun you have equipped. For me, characters in the distance that were basically ants became immediately visible on the AI Frame, which made gunfights much easier to handle.\n\nI suppose we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The AI Frame is just a proof-of-concept for now, so there's no hard specs sheet or pricing or release date as of yet. But if this does ever actually make it to market, Lenovo might have to contend with companies like Valve. The developer has banned similar \"this is arguably cheating\" peripherals from its games before, and the AI Frame could be the next battlefront in an ongoing war between peripheral makers (who want to sell you on the idea that buying their products can make you a better player) and developers (who, at least theoretically, want all of their players to be on an even playing field).",

    "title": "CES 2026: I Tried a Gaming Headset That Can Read Your Mind",
    "description": "Lock in before you drop in.",
    "fullText": "Before this CES, I thought gaming headsets had gotten about as complex as they ever would. How many improvements can you possibly make on speakers and microphones? Well, forget all that. Apparently, the future of gaming headsets is mind reading.\n\nIn a private demo with a colleague from IGN, I tested out a collaboration between HP's HyperX gaming brand and brain-computer interface company Neurable. Neurable's been at CES before, but most of its work has been in the defense and enterprise sectors. The brand is specifically aimed at helping you nail down your focus, and now, Neurable thinks it can use that to help gamers.\n\nBefore trying on the Neurable x HyperX headset, I did a quick run-through in a target shooting game, where I shot down 30 targets with a 547ms response time. Then, I was guided through a focus program called Prime. This showed a cloud of dots on the screen, and I was told to do whatever I needed to do to focus up. I decided to stare into the distance and count, and in about 90 seconds, the dots had shrunken down into a small orb and I was \"primed.\" Neurable also suggested focusing techniques like repeating a word in your head over and over, or following one of the dots as it moved about the screen, but these didn't work for me.\n\nThen, I did the shooting test again. Theoretically, I should have been better, but I actually scored slightly worse this time—a 559ms response time. Still, that response time isn't terrible, and your mileage may vary. I might have already been locked in before priming. In contrast, my colleague actually reduced her response time by about 40ms after priming. If all of that optimization sounds really nitty-gritty, it is. This is aimed at esports players and streamers, where every millisecond counts.\n\nThat's probably where the headset's coolest feature comes in for me. Alongside Prime, Neurable and HyperX are also working on an overlay plugin for streamers that can show their focus levels on screen. You can display this as a speedometer, or as that cloud of dots, or even as a progress bar that shows whether you're \"on tilt\" or not. It should make for some pretty fun interactions with viewers, and play well with existing plug-ins, like eye trackers that show where a streamer is looking.\n\nPlus, my slightly worse response time after priming wasn't totally useless. Neurable said the headset could be used to help you \"practice choking,\" where you psych yourself up shortly after locking in and end up worse off. I thought that sounded like marketing spin, but my colleague, a high-level raider in World of Warcraft, said it would have real use for her.\n\nIt's still just a concept for now, but it's exciting to see this kind of tech getting ready to hit the mass market. What also sets Neurable apart is how portable it is. Unlike other brain-computer interfaces, this just looks like a normal headset, and all the contacts are just stored in the ear cups. There's no need for a giant helmet with discs and wires attached to it, thanks to Neurable's expertise in AI. The company says that using such a compact form factor does result in getting a small amount of data (and a lot of junk data, at that), but thanks to an on-device AI model, it's easily able to detect trends in your focus and translate them into something usable.\n\nThat seemed to be true in my demo, which at the end of the day, kind of felt like a guided meditation with real-time feedback. You could use this for more than gaming, but it's a clever use case for digital mind-reading, and the streaming plugins really take the cake, helping solidify the concept into a clear product with a concrete goal and target audience.\n\nIt'll take a while for the gaming version of Neurable's tech to be ready, although the company said it hopes to get it out this year. In the meantime, you can buy an ultra-luxury headset with Neurable's mind-reading built in, although it's currently on pre-order and will set you back $500. It also won't come with Prime or that streaming plugin, although because those are based in software, that could change in the future.",

    "title": "CES 2026: XREAL's New Gaming Glasses Put a Huge, Fast Gaming Monitor Right on Your Face",
    "description": "Asus and XREAL are working together to make the big screen better for gaming, and smaller than ever before.",
    "fullText": "I've been a fan of XREAL for a while, but outside of people who are really into AR, it's still a lesser-known company. Lifehacker has given XREAL's glasses stellar reviews before, but in the company's new collaboration with Asus, it's aiming to expand its market. The new ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses are the first XREAL glasses aimed specifically at gaming (though its other models aren't exactly bad for gaming), and they basically put the best gaming monitor you could ever want right in front of your face.\n\nYou wear these like a normal pair of sunglasses, and you get a massive 171-inch virtual TV floating in a black void right in front of you. It's an OLED, so there are crisp colors and high contrast, and the resolution is a respectable 1080p. Most importantly, the glasses max out at a 240Hz refresh rate, meaning they can display up to 240 frames per second.\n\nTaken all together, that's better than pretty much all of the full-size desktop monitors I have at home, but these are portable. They're barely heavier than my reading glasses, too, and you can set your virtual screen to either be anchored in one spot (meaning it won't follow your head) or stay in front of your eyes at all times. I prefer the former, since it shakes around less.\n\nI also didn't get any of the usual problems I have with AR or VR, like light bleed or fuzzy graphics. Aside from the black void, this really did feel like looking at a real-life screen. And you don't even have to use the full 171 inches, if you prefer something smaller.\n\nAside from the glasses, Asus is also shipping these with a dock, to help you better use them with your various devices. It has two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort connection, so you can have up to three devices ready to go at one time. It's probably the most realistic way to simulate gaming on a movie theater screen, and it's only set to improve down the line. Asus told me these glasses will eventually support XREAL's 2D-to-3D conversion tech, which just came out on the new XREAL 1S glasses and automatically converts any image to 3D. The effect uses AI to determine how to split the image between your eyes, but it was so convincing to me when I tried it with Mario Kart World that it felt like it was officially developed by Nintendo.\n\nAnd on that end, I have confirmation from XREAL that the ROG XREAL R1 glasses are compatible with the XREAL Neo mobile dock and battery pack. This is much more compact than the dock that comes with the headset, and, if you plug the glasses and the Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 into it at the same time, it will allow you to play your Nintendo console in AR. Even Asus' dock can't do that without another Switch dock acting as an intermediary first. Plus, this will charge whatever device you're playing at the same time.\n\nThe ROG XREAL R1 AR glasses will release later this year, although pricing isn't available quite yet. They're expected to release in the first half of this year.",

That similarity could come in the form of one specific gameplay feature or an all-encompassing experience that gives you the same thrills as you had when walking the halls of Hogwarts. If you haven't had a chance to pick up Hogwarts Legacy yet, it is available on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nHogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she was not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success. For more, read our in-depth article on how Rowling's comments have impacted the trans community.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was one of the more important RPGs ever made due to its revolutionary open world map and quest design, two core pillars of Hogwarts Legacy. While you can still play the original, Oblivion Remastered is a better product in almost every single way. The 2006 masterpiece has been completely remastered, featuring overhauled graphics, character models, dialogue, and mechanics. The core game is still intact, though, as you start your adventure on an epic quest to uncover the mystery of why your emperor was murdered.\n\nAlong the way, you'll encounter five distinct guilds, each with its own questlines, several sprawling cities teeming with life, and an open world that features dozens of unique locations. Also, if you're a fan of the magical combat in Hogwarts Legacy, Oblivion Remastered lets you become a full-blown mage who can use a variety of different magic attacks. It doesn't officially support them, but a collection of Oblivion Remastered mods have also begun to pop up that can further improve the experience.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nImmortals Fenyx Rising is an action-adventure game in the mold of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that places a large emphasis on combat, but still has many qualities that appeal to Hogwarts Legacy fans. You'll get to explore the world right from the start of the game, and when you're not fighting enemies, you can solve a number of challenging puzzles that lead to rewards or other areas within the world. As for combat, you'll get to challenge mythological beasts such as Medusa as well as a plethora of other smaller enemies. The combat in Immortals Fenyx Rising is quite faster than in Hogwarts Legacy, but it's easy to pick up once you understand the controls.\n\nIf the lore and story were your favorite parts about Hogwarts Legacy, then why not hop over to another beloved pop culture franchise? Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an original story in the Star Wars universe that takes place between the events of the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy movies. It's a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but you don't need to play that game to understand what's happening in Survivor.\n\nThe game continues to follow protagonist Cal Kestis as he attempts to lead a rebellion against the Empire with a band of outlaws. Survivor sees you visit several planets that are somewhat open world and all have different enemies to face, puzzles to solve, and collectibles to find. As you progress, you'll unlock more attack types, including additional Force abilities and lightsaber forms. The combat in Survivor can be fairly difficult, especially against the late-game bosses, but you have plenty of tools at your disposal to take down enemies. For newer video game players, you can simply set the difficulty level to its lowest setting and take in one of the best Star Wars tales told in recent memory.\n\nLA Noire might not be the first game you think of when you think of Hogwarts Legacy. However, the two games have \n\nIf you enjoyed the outskirt areas of Hogwarts Legacy that extended beyond the castle grounds, then Ghost of Tsushima might be right up your alley. This open-world RPG is set in 13th-century Japan during the Mongol invasion and features extremely detailed and beautiful landscapes outside of the war-torn towns and fields. Ghost of Tsushima sees you play as a samurai who's trying to navigate the invasion and protect their island from the Mongols. When you're not actively doing story missions, you can explore a huge world filled with real-life locations that are still standing in Japan today. You'll come across your fair share of enemies while exploring, but the combat in Ghosts of Tsushima is beginner-friendly while still being difficult to master as you unlock more weapons and skills. A sequel, Ghost of Yotei, is on the way in 2025.\n\nThe Horizon series features perhaps the closest games to Hogwarts Legacy. The first game in the series is Horizon Zero Dawn, but you can also play its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, for an equally thrilling adventure. We recommend playing Zero Dawn first, though, as there's so much lore you need to understand before you can fully appreciate Forbidden West.\n\nIn Horizon Zero Dawn, you play as Aloy, an orphan born in the midst of a post-apocalyptic period in an alternate version of the United States in the 31st century. In this version of the US, man-made machines have taken over the planet, and tribes of hunter-gatherers and warriors try to survive without antagonizing them. Throughout Zero Dawn, you'll uncover the origins of Aloy's story, which is deeply entangled with how this future came to be and what happened to the humans before the machines took over. It's an epic adventure with a huge open world, combat centered around a bow and arrow, and plenty of secrets to discover.\n\nThe Dragon Age franchise is one that Hogwarts Legacy fans should find enjoyable. They're RPGs with an emphasis on narrative elements and exploration through a large, open world. There's also plenty of magic at play, both in combat and with basic mechanics. In The Veilguard, you play as Rook, who's tasked with stopping a pair of corrupt gods who have escaped their imprisonment. At the beginning of the game, you'll be by yourself, but over time, you can recruit a number of companions to join your party and fight alongside you for the duration of the adventure. Magic, an open world, and a mysterious story all make Dragon Age: The Veilguard an enticing option for any Hogwarts fan. You also don't have to play any of the original Dragon Age games to understand the story, so feel free to hop right in regardless of your experience.\n\nSpeaking of a franchise with some deep lore, the Marvel universe is a natural stepping stone for any Hogwarts Legacy player to dive into. While some fantastic Marvel games have been released in the past several years, Spider-Man was the game that marked Marvel's revival in the video game industry. This is an original story for the webbed hero that follows Peter Parker trying to navigate a day job while also being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The story starts off relatively slow, but develops into a thriller with all sorts of twists and turns.\n\nThe setting for Marvel's Spider-Man is an open-world New York City, and swinging through its skyscrapers or Central Park is one of the best feelings you can experience in a video game. The swinging mechanics along with the Arkham-style combat are thoroughly crisp, leading you to feel like you really are Spider-Man.\n\nIf puzzles were one of your favorite parts of Hogwarts Legacy, but you still want some exploration, then look no further than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Breath of the Wild is one of the most celebrated video games of all time, combining a staggeringly massive open world with fantastic puzzles that actually require you to use different parts of your console to solve. Some puzzles can simply be solved using the joysticks on your Switch, while others use the console's gyro controls and both Joy-Cons. The puzzles can be surprisingly difficult to get through, but they might not even be the hardest part of the game.\n\nInstead, the combat and gear degradation systems in Breath of the Wild will likely have you more challenged than the puzzles. Combat can be difficult if you run into a boss or enemy that outlevels you, but even easy fights have the potential to turn difficult if your favorite sword breaks from too much use. While all of this sounds overly challenging, Breath of the Wild allows you to play at your own pace, and players of all skill levels can pick it up and immediately enjoy what it has to offer. An enhanced Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild and its excellent sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, are out now and boast some very nice upgrades.\n\nNow, your first thought when you see a game like Baldur's Gate 3 might be that you're not a fan of turn-based combat. After all, if you liked Hogwarts Legacy, going from fast-paced wand fights to slow, turn-based moves in every encounter could be jarring. However, if you can get past the shift to turn-based combat and really sink your teeth into Baldur's Gate 3, you'll discover why it's considered one of the best RPGs ever made.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 is an epic tale of your character, who can either be a preset character or completely your design, trying to stop an alien force from taking over an entire continent's minds. The game isn't necessarily open world, as it features distinct zones that are a part of the different story acts, but the zones themselves are very large. Within these zones, you'll be able to pick up new party members, who you can completely control, go on winding side quests that feel like their own mini-story, and explore the beautiful and dangerous landscapes that make up each one of the maps. Baldur's Gate 3 also features cross-play and is fully co-op, so you can partake in the adventure with a friend or two.\n\nThe Assassin's Creed franchise is somewhat divisive, as many fans seem to either love or hate the different styles of games in the series. If you were to pick one to play to scratch your Hogwarts Legacy itch, though, make it Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in 400 BC Greece, Odyssey sees you take control of either a male or female protagonist who comes from humble beginnings. However, over the course of the game, you'll take part in a war between Athens and Sparta, command a ship across high seas, and explore perhaps the biggest open-world map on this list. The story in Odyssey has a few different branches that all clash by the end of the 50-hour-plus campaign, and it's one of the most memorable in the Assassin's Creed franchise. Hogwarts Legacy fans should find the combat easy to pick up, and exploration on a much larger scale than they find in the Wizarding World.\n\nFable III is one of the few games on this list that's somewhat difficult to play in 2025. However, if you're subscribed to Game Pass, then you shouldn't have any trouble on Xbox or PC. Fable III is the most recent game in the Fable series, but the next entry, currently known simply as Fable, is coming sometime in 2026. The Fable series is widely beloved in the gaming community thanks to the charm of its characters and gameplay. Fable III specifically sees you embark on a quest to take down an unruly leader and manage the kingdom for the people of your country.\n\nWhile the story in Fable III isn't especially long, it does offer you a plethora of choices to make that drastically impact how the narrative plays out. During your adventure in the main story, you'll come across a slew of combat engagements, which play out in real time and feature melee, ranged, and magic attacks. The combat can be a little clunky in Fable III, but the world and characters will keep you enthralled throughout the entire game.\n\nIf we're recommending games like Hogwarts Legacy, let's go with one of the only other Wizarding World titles on the market that's easily playable in 2025. Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4 allows you to play through the first four years of the Harry Potter series as Harry himself. You'll get to explore a slimmed-down version of Hogwarts Castle and meet the cast of characters that you know and love. The game doesn't play out exactly like the movies or books, so there will be some different events that take place. Of course, you'll still get to partake in the classic Harry Potter events, such as playing Quidditch, sneaking around after dark, and even battling the Basilisk. Given the Lego nature of these games, they're meant to appeal to a more casual gaming audience, but any Harry Potter fan should find something to enjoy in Years 1-4.\n\nLife is Strange is strictly a game for Hogwarts Legacy players who value the story above anything else. Life is Strange doesn't feature any sort of combat or an open-world map to explore. Instead, the game takes place over a series of episodes that follow Max Caulfield, a high school senior who discovers that she can rewind time. Using this ability, Max tries to save her best friend, but altering the past can come with severe consequences. Your job is to find a way to navigate the pitfalls of time travel to try and get as happy an ending as possible. The story is gripping throughout every episode of Life is Strange, and there is some puzzle-solving along the way.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most well-reviewed games ever and easily a top 10 RPG of all time. If the lore and world of Hogwarts Legacy are something that appeals to you, there's arguably no better game to turn to than The Witcher 3. Don't be intimidated by the \"3\" in the title, as it helps to know the lore of the first two games, but it's not imperative whatsoever.\n\nThe Witcher 3 sees you take control of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter who possesses unnatural abilities and strengths. Geralt begins the game on the hunt for his adopted daughter, Ciri, as he's having dreams of an undead army called \"The Wild Hunt\" coming for him and Ciri. While this is the premise of the game, The Witcher 3 is so much more than its initial plotline. The game takes you across an incredibly detailed and large open world where quests and new locations are waiting around every corner. The Witcher 3 even features its own card-based minigame, Gwent, which is now a full-fledged game in its own right.\n\nThe Tomb Raider reboot in 2013 kicked off one of the best gaming trilogies of the modern era. Consisting of Tomb Raider, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, these games are extremely well-done and provide you with a very similar experience to that of Hogwarts Legacy. You play as Lara Croft, a world explorer who comes from a wealthy family but finds herself constantly embroiled in some controversies with rival explorers. The Tomb Raider games offer fast-paced and stealthy combat, where you can use a variety of weapons, but you'll also be tasked with solving puzzles, or \"tombs,\" as you progress through the story. With a solid mix of combat, storytelling, and puzzles, you should find yourself right at home as a Hogwarts Legacy fan.\n\nIf you want to step into another established franchise with a cast of iconic characters and villains, then look no further than the Batman Arkham trilogy. Consisting of Batman Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight, these games revolutionized an entire generation of action-adventure and RPG titles with their \"Arkham-style\" combat. Naturally, you play as Batman in these games, and each title offers a new story for the Caped Crusader. The stories often revolve around the villains of the game, and the second and third titles allow you to explore an open-world Gotham City. While there's crime around every corner in Gotham, there are also puzzles you can solve that are doled out by none other than The Riddler. There's a slice of gameplay for all Hogwarts Legacy fans, but the Arkham games lean more on the side of combat than puzzles.",

    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 3:02AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nThe MOBA genre is one of the most extensive and daunting in gaming, due to the high complexity of the strategic, competitive experiences. That said, if you want to know the best MOBA games worth playing right now, you are in the right place. MOBA games traditionally follow a lane structure with little minions that fight alongside the core heroes with unique powers, controlled by online players.\n\nThere is a little bit of something for everyone among the best MOBA games below. Even if you are a diehard existing MOBA fan with hundreds of hours in the top games in the genre like League of Legends, there’s likely something new to check out. And if you are a newcomer looking to get your feet wet, these best MOBA games are worth a try.\n\nWhen it comes to the premier MOBA experience for fans of both the casual and competitive levels, League of Legends is the go-to game. Free-to-play, like most of the games on this list, you have access to years and years of content, new characters, maps, changes, and balancing adjustments.\n\nThere is so much to League of Legends that it feels like a game you can play forever. Riot Games has fine tuned every aspect of the experience to a T, allowing every character to fill a distinct role in each of the five core roles. You won’t find a higher budget, more grandiose MOBA game out there. That said, this does mean it is quite daunting to get into for newcomers.\n\nDefense of the Ancients (DOTA) was the progenitor of the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena genre, and DOTA 2 is its successor. Still going strong since its release in 2013, this is some of Valve’s finest work. You are blessed with choice in DOTA 2, with more than 120 heroes and counting available to play as.\n\nYou won’t find that level of freedom and content in almost any other MOBA available. While considerably older than a lot of the games on this list, like most Valve experiences, it still holds up as well, if not better, than every other game in the MOBA genre. Better yet, competitive events like The International are massive celebratory events that are a blast to experience even for people that don’t play the game.\n\nTencent’s Honor of Kings (also known as Arena of Valor on some platforms like Nintendo Switch) is a solid attempt at a League of Legends-level game that works on a variety of platforms, including mobile phones. The intuitive controls ensure no platform feels bad to play on and that even includes controllers.\n\nIt is impressive how Honor of Kings is one of the most widely available MOBA games that has the traditional top-down, three-lane approach to the genre. Players who want something like LoL or DOTA 2 but in a more simplified manner should check out this experience. After all, each character, while unique, has only a handful of skills to use in combat.\n\nHonor of Kings is quite easy to get into and learn, but it has intense depth available for those who want to go beyond the casual unranked matches. Plus it has some surprising crossover characters like Batman and Superman.\n\nAn element of MOBAs that might be unappealing to some players is the top-down, more isometric-style perspective. If you are turned off by that viewpoint, Smite 2 is the game for you. The original Smite pulled the camera back behind the character for a more traditional third-person action-style experience.\n\nSmite 2, fully released for everyone in 2025, is essentially the original Smite but looking much better and being available on every modern console and PC. The best part is how approachable the experience is beyond just the more action-packed controls and perspective.\n\nYou can play with anyone on Smite 2 no matter the system via crossplay. In addition, you don’t have to worry about the sometimes terrifying MOBA elements like creating your character’s unique build and skill upgrades as you level up during a match, as there are automatic versions available. Smite 2 is simply one of the best ways to get into the MOBA genre.\n\nThe Pokemon Company’s own take on the MOBA genre is unlike anything else on this list. While it may look at a glance similar to other top-down titles, the gameplay is vastly different and takes full advantage of the Pokemon franchise. You pick between different Pokemon, each with their own role to play on the battlefield, and many of them even evolve as they level up in the match.\n\nA slow, tanky Defender like Snorlax feels radically different to a fast-moving Speedster like Zeraora. There are other parts of the franchise that find neat ways to implement themselves into the game, such as Trainer customization and the signature held items.\n\nThen there are the matches themselves. In most MOBAs, the objective is to advance across the map across various lanes to help your minions take over or destroy towers and eventually the enemy base. However, in Pokemon Unite, your objective is to score points at goals. This gives a fascinating sports take worth checking out.\n\nThere are more than 130 characters to choose from in the ever-growing Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. This wide variety is helped by some intriguing twists on the MOBA genre, such as hybrid characters. Sure, you have your typical roles like Assassin and Marksman, but some characters fit into both nicely.\n\nThis lets you have some freedom in deciding what type of playstyle you want to go for. Chances are you can think of a type of character and they exist in this free-to-play mobile adventure. It is a great option for Android and iOS users, too, offering a very clean UI that is not full of clutter and can be easily viewed even with smaller screens.\n\nThe Warcraft franchise is where the entire MOBA originated via the popular Defense of the Ancients mod, so it is only fitting that Blizzard has its own official take on the genre. Heroes of the Storm feels like a celebration of nearly every Blizzard franchise and game from World of Warcraft to Starcraft to Diablo.\n\nYou can play as famous characters like Kerrigan to Tyrael to even Diablo himself. Of course, this is all within the traditional MOBA setting of 5v5 lane battles with the usual class roles. Where Heroes of the Storm really stands out is in its beautifully diverse battleground maps that look great and the Talents system that feels more natural for customizing character builds compared to the usual items.\n\nSupervive is unlike any other MOBA out there. At a glance, it looks like your traditional colorful fantasy game in the veins of a standard top-down MOBA, but the gameplay is anything but that. It takes the ideas of MOBA gameplay and smashes them into the engaging battle royale cycle.\n\nTeams of three players compete using more than 20 varied characters to survive and take out the competition before it happens to them. This is quite different from the usual conquer-style objective and it works better than it should. Of course, if you want to play the usual arena-style MOBA experience with your favorite character, that is also available.\n\nRiot Games finally answered the requests of players to release League of Legends for other platforms with Wild Rift. Available on Android, iOS, and eventually consoles, this is the LoL experience but streamlined entirely for mobile and controller support.\n\nWhile Wild Rift is still behind its parent game in terms of content and characters, there are still more than 130 characters and counting to enjoy. Better yet, it doesn’t hold back from the unmatched depth of the PC version, instead tailoring the control scheme and performance to work on a multitude of devices and platforms.\n\nFor those who look at the original 2009 game and want to try it but don’t know where to start, the Wild Rift experience is a great way to get into LoL.\n\nDragon Ball has its own take on the MOBA genre with Gekishin Squadra. The name sure is a mouthful, but this is one of the most welcoming experiences for newer MOBA players, even if you aren’t too familiar with the Dragon Ball universe. But if you are an existing fan of the late Akira Toriyama’s masterful manga and anime series, you’ll be pleased with the wide selection of characters and abilities.\n\nThe likes of heroes like Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta are all here alongside the infamous villains of the series like Frieza and Cell. You make your way across a map from a top-down perspective to take down the enemy team’s God of Destruction and win the match.\n\nThe way Dragon Ball: Gekishin Squadra implements the iconic abilities like the Kamehameha is as flashy and exciting to use as it should be. This Dragon Ball MOBA is one of the funnest to play on this list, but there are some kinks in terms of performance and progression that hold it back some and will, hopefully, be resolved in time.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Intel's New Chips Are Coming For Your Gaming Handhelds",
    "description": "Intel's got a new integrated GPU, and is promising better battery life.",
    "fullText": "Every year at CES, Intel and AMD announce their newest processors. This year, Intel debuted its first line of chips made with its 18a process, which stands for 18 angstroms, or under 2nm. To make that a little less nerdy, that means these chips can fit a lot of tech into a small area, which means big gains in performance.\n\nColloquially called Panther Lake, the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips are focused on laptops and mini-PCs. But that doesn't mean they don't put out impressive numbers. During its keynote, Intel promised \"77% faster gaming performance,\" and for everyone actually using their PCs to do work, \"60% better multithread performance.\" Impressively, it also said its new chips would also enable \"up to 27 hours of battery life,\" rivaling Apple's M-series chips and other ARM chips from manufacturers like Qualcomm. Battery life has been a sore spot for both Intel and AMD for a while, and I'm excited to get my hands on machines that use Panther Lake processors.\n\nAnd then there's the AI. Intel says its top Intel Core Ultra Series 3 models have 50 NPU TOPs and 180 TOPS in total when you combine the NPU and GPU numbers. To translate, that basically means faster AI performance for developers who don't want to bother with the cloud, and would prefer the speed and privacy of a locally downloaded AI model.\n\nSpeaking of that GPU, Intel's upgraded its integrated graphics this generation to the Intel Arc B390, which has twice the cache of its prior GPU and 50% more cores. I already mentioned that 77% increase in gaming performance, but AI developers will also see a 53% increase in performance over Intel Core Ultra Series 2, and a two times performance increase over Intel Core Ultra Series 1.\n\nSo, better computers. That's pretty par for the course for CES, but there is a \"one more thing\" here. Intel is coming for AMD's dominance in handheld gaming PCs.\n\nUntil now, most handheld gaming PCs have used AMD chips, with those that have opted for Intel getting hit in reviews for buggy or poorly optimized performance. The Steam Deck uses an AMD chip, and so does the Xbox handheld. Intel says it's going to change that.\n\nAfter announcing the new integrated GPU and walking through features like frame generation and ray tracing, the company said it \"will be launching an entire handheld gaming platform with Panther Lake.\"\n\nThat means big moves, and soon—Panther Lake won't last long before getting replaced. The company didn't say much more, but it did show a slide with partners set to use Intel chips in their handhelds, including Acer, MSI, and hey, Microsoft. I guess we'll see another Xbox handheld model soon.\n\nAnd that's about it for Intel this year. The new chips are smaller, stronger, and more efficient, but smartly, the company is also planning to use them to shore up its weaknesses, specifically in gaming and battery life. That makes sense. With developers like Apple having famously ditched Intel throughout the decade, the company has been on the backfoot.\n\nAccording to Intel, the earliest machines powered by Intel Core Ultra Series 3 will start accepting pre-orders on January 6, with availability beginning on January 27.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Hisense Just Announced the RGB MiniLED Evo",
    "description": "The company also revealed that Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming to its TVs.",
    "fullText": "Hisense is all about TVs at this year's CES—specifically, how those TVs display color. If the company's keynote is any indication, Hisense is extremely invested in leading the charge in color reproduction. Though its tagline this year is \"Innovating a Brighter Life,\" the pitch is less on how bright their TVs are, and more on how true to life their colors are, especially when it comes to accurately displaying the filmmakers' original intent. Will consumers buy a TV because their favorite movie looks a bit more how the director intended it to be? I'm not sure. But that's largely the idea behind Hisense's new RGB MiniLED Evo.\n\nHisense's biggest announcement of the day is its RGB MiniLED Evo. This iteration of the company's RGB MiniLED technology comes with three key upgrades: First, there's the \"Chromagic\" precision backlight. The company says this technology helps avoid color bleeding and tint shifting when watching content. It also boosts the colors offered by existing RGB MiniLED technology: Hisense says this new standard can display 110% of the BT.2020 color gamut with four-primary colors (red, green, blue, and sky blue, or cyan), while RGB MiniLED can achieve 100% BT.2020 with the standard three primary colors. The company says Evo also comes with AI-powered RGB color dimming with \"134 bit precision.\"\n\nSecond, RGB MiniLED Evo has a \"Hi-View AI engine,\" to sync color across the TV's backlight. This engine comes with a three-core RISC CPU and a 2TOPS NPU for AI processing. Hisense claims the chip provides a 40% boost in computing performance, a 70% improvement in scenario recognition computing power, and 100% upgrade in scenario adaption computing capability. The company says the RGB MiniLED Evo can help display shows and movies as the original creators intended them to look. Hisense compared it to OLED, which it says displays content with too little brightness, and QD MiniLED, which it says compromises the color by being too bright.\n\nHisense's RGB MiniLED—not necessarily just Evo—also supposedly cuts down on blue light. Hisense says its new display tech emits 60% \"less harmful\" blue light than QD OLED, though the science doesn't necessarily support the claims that blue light is any worse for you than other light colors. The company also says RGB MiniLED is 30% more energy-efficient than QD OLED, though it didn't include any references to back up those claims in the keynote. Finally, Evo comes with an AI calibration feature, which Hisense touts as a way for users to turn their TVs into professional reference monitors.\n\nThe company says RGB MiniLED evo is coming to its product lineup, including the U8, UX, U9, and U7 series, this year.\n\nWhile the RGB MiniLED Evo was undoubtedly Hisense's biggest announcement this year, the company also ran through some other news at the keynote. First, there's the XR10, a new projector that can reach up to 300 inches. It comes with liquid cooling, lens shift supporting a 4K projection, and 6,000 lumens of brightness.\n\nThe company also announced the MXS MicroLED TV, which can scale up to 163 inches. Despite devoting only a moment to the TV, company says the MXS won an CES 2026 Innovation Award. Hisense also made some announcements about its TV OS, including features like weather, calendar, and integrations with other smart home devices. But perhaps most notably, Hisense announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring both Copilot and Xbox Cloud Gaming to its TVs. That's pretty big news.\n\nFinally, if you're both a Hisense and a FIFA fan, you can buy products from the \"Hisense Elite Collection,\" which are designed specifically for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. I'm not sure how big that crossover is, nor do I think I'd buy a TV because it was made for one soccer event, but it was part of Hisense's announcement.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Asus' New Gaming Laptop Looks Like a Gigantic Nintendo DS",
    "description": "The ROG Zephyrus Duo is back for 2026, with two full-sized screens.",
    "fullText": "CES is the time of year for weird computers, and Asus is bringing back an old fan favorite to help fill its unusual form factor quota. Gamers who miss the days of dual screens, get excited: the ROG Zephyrus Duo is returning for 2026, and it's bigger than ever.\n\nLooking a bit like a gigantic Nintendo DS, the new ROG Zephyrus Duo stacks two full-sized 3K OLED screens on top of each other, with a standard laptop hinge in between. It's a lot like the company's existing Zenbook Duo, but that one's geared more for productivity users—the Zephyrus Duo is fully specced out for gamers, with a 120Hz refresh rate on both screens, the latest Intel Core Ultra chips, up to an RTX 5090 laptop GPU, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. Plus, it supports 250W fast charging and can play games using up to 125W of power.\n\nThat's plenty for even the most demanding games, although its price is still an unknown for now. What we do know is how different this is from the last Zephyrus Duo, which came out in 2023. That laptop's lower screen was a simple small angled panel above the keyboard, instead of a full-sized display matching the upper one. It was great for displaying stats at a glance while playing, but not much else.\n\nInstead, the new Zephyrus Duo can display the same game across both screens, mirror them, or pull up reference material on one screen while you play on the other. It's also got a bunch of new ways you can use it: It comes with a detachable wireless keyboard, and you can either use it like a normal laptop with that keyboard covering one of the screens, or get creative.\n\nAn example photo from Asus show the laptop with one screen above the other, both screens in a side-to-side portrait mode, the whole laptop laid flat on a table (perhaps for head-to-head play), and tent mode. Tent mode is especially interesting—an Asus representative told journalists that gamers could play the same game against each other while sitting across from each other in tent mode, with each display acting as a private screen. He did acknowledge that this might impact performance and compatibility might differ based on game, but I could see it being an especially great option for, say, fighting games.\n\nAgain, this format has been used for non-gaming laptops before, but it's seemingly got a lot of potential for gamers, too. There's a reason one of Nintendo's most popular handhelds opted for a dual-screen setup. And hey, maybe you could even play some DS games made on this, too.\n\nThe new ROG Zephyrus Duo is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

    "description": "Help me, ROG. You're my only hope.",
    "fullText": "With the rise of streaming culture, a lot of gamers have started investing in computers that don't just play games well, but that look good while doing it. Asus's newest pre-built gaming desktop, the ROG G1000, is pretty by-the-book when it comes to high-end performance, but it's got one major selling point when it comes to those all-important gamer aesthetics: holograms.\n\nBuilt into this computer's front panel and one of its side panels, safely tucked into inaccessible glass windows, are rapidly rotating LED strips that, when in motion, create convincing full-color images that appear to have depth. The \"frame rate\" can be a little low, but it's a known technology that's all over the show floor at every CES now, and you can actually buy generic standalone hologram fans on Amazon for around $60-$100. It's just rare to see it integrated into something like a PC.\n\nThis hologram tech, called AniMe Holo, should make for a great way to show off on camera (or to your buddies in a college dorm) and Asus is promising some pretty expansive customizability. You can put still images and gifs on it, sure, but Asus also told journalists it can support full videos or mp4 files, without any limit on length. I think I'd try to use it to watch Shrek.\n\nThe effect comes across a bit better in-person, but it's still unusual enough to look enticing over video, even if you lose some of the depth. Unfortunately, still photos aren't really a great way to show this thing off, since they can't depict the rotating motion.\n\nAesthetics aside, the G1000 is also at the top of the power game, coming with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X 3D CPU, an RTX 5090 GPU, up to 128GB of RAM, and a 2TB storage. It's got bite to back up its bark, and will be able to play the latest games at max settings with no issue.\n\nOf course, specs like that are likely to cost you a pretty penny, especially with the hologram gimmick tossed on top of them. Asus hasn't tipped its hand on pricing yet, but the ROG G1000 is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",

    "fullText": "Fallout Season 2 Episode 3 brought back a familiar face.\n\n on January 2, 2026 at 7:17AM PST\n\nThis week’s Fallout episode traded in personal stories for status updates on fan-favorite factions from Fallout: New Vegas. While we briefly saw the Khans and primary followed the Brotherhood of Steel storyline, we finally got caught up with the NCR and Caesar’s Legion. With this expansion of the Mojave Wasteland, this episode had a healthy dose of easter eggs and callbacks for fans of the video games. Let’s take a look at what this week had to offer.\n\nThis week’s episode revealed the fate of Squire Thaddeus (Johnny Pemberton) and his new life as a ghoul. Instead of exploring the wasteland as part of the Brotherhood of Steel, he’s running a bottling plant that employs an army of abandoned children. The drink they’re bottling? Sunset Sarsaparilla, the most popular drink on the west coast in the Fallout games and a common consumable item in Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nWhen the Brotherhood of Steel are discussing their potential alliance to stand against The Commonwealth, Elder Cleric Quintus mentions a “an ordinary captain was sent to a research center in California” named Roger Maxson, a character Fallout fans should be extremely familiar with. While Maxson is never featured in a Fallout game, his story is told through holotapes that appear throughout Fallout, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 76.\n\nPaladin Xander (Kumail Nanjiani) suggests to Maximus (Aaron Moten) that a conflict could send the entire Brotherhood of Steel into chaos. He tells of a time when the Brotherhood was nearly destroyed because of internal strife in the Capital Wasteland. Fans of Fallout 3 will be familiar with this conflict as the time a group of BoS members formed a splinter faction called the Brotherhood Outcasts when they opposed Elder Lyons’ views. This was one of the central conflicts of that game, and we could potentially see a repeat event happen in the Mojave.\n\nThough set in the same universe as the video games, Fallout has had very little crossover when it comes to characters (Mr. House not withstanding). This week’s episode bucked this trend by bringing back a familiar face in the form of Victor the sheriff securitron. Those who played Fallout: New Vegas will recognize him as the friendly face that saved the courier and served as sheriff of Goodsprings (though he had other motives as revealed later on).\n\nThough Fallout is no stranger to including the artillery from the video games, this week’s episode featured one of the more iconic weapons. When Xander and Maximus are surveying the Mojave they decide to go after hunt rogue securitrons in the area. Though they have the standard issue rifles, Xander brings along a Super Sledge, a powered up melee weapon that's the first choice of super mutants everywhere.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Now, though, fresh leaks suggest that things are only going to get worse in 2026. According to Korean publication, Newsis, both AMD and NVIDIA are planning to gradually and permanently increase GPU prices \"over the next several months.\" This is expected to start as early as January 2026, when AMD is expected to increase prices. NVIDIA will allegedly follow suit in February. \n\nIf the publication's insider sources are correct, the NVIDIA RTX 5090, which launched at $1,999, will reach as high as $5,000 before the end of the year. No prediction has been made for AMD's RX 9000 series, but memory has already been said to take up as much as 80% of the average GPU BOM cost, and memory prices are expected to increase by as much as 40% by Q2 2026. We've already reported on the fact that instability and price increases in the DRAM market will likely affect launch windows for upcoming hardware, potentially reaching as far as next-gen console launches, and ASUS recently announced that it would be increasing hardware prices starting in early January 2026, despite also increasing DDR4 motherboard production in response to the changing market.",

    "description": "NVIDIA is showcasing robotics, simulation, gaming and more at CES 2026.",
    "fullText": "At CES 2025, NVIDIA spent the bulk of its presentation touting (what else) its leading position in the artificial intelligence arena. But it also spent time talking up new hardware, including its RTX 5000-series GPUs and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed Spark). This year, the company's website says it's \"lighting up CES 2026 with the power of AI.\" To that end, NVIDIA is pulling out all the stops at its Vegas installation, promising hands-on demos in its booth at the Fontainebleau, replete with the \"latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.\"\n\nBut don't worry if you're not on the ground in Vegas. Here's how you can watch the livestream of the company's January 5 press conference, and what to expect from NVIDIA at CES this year.\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on January 5 at 4PM ET via NVIDIA's website (and likely on YouTube as well). We'll embed the link here once it's available.\n\nNVIDIA's game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including \"cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.\" It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we're unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.\n\nGiven NVIDIA's sky-high valuation and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers – largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang's remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company's Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA's partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang's presentation.",

    "fullText": "on December 30, 2025 at 12:00PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nNew Year’s Eve doesn’t have to be limited to champagne and confetti in the real world. Video games offer their own ways to celebrate, from dazzling fireworks to high-speed races and creative parties with friends. Sometimes, getting together virtually is the only way everyone can be together.\n\nIn Animal Crossing, you can ring in the new year with a sky full of fireworks over your island. Fortnite Creative lets you throw your own custom parties with friends, complete with music, games, and chaos. Mario Kart brings the celebration to the tracks, where fireworks light up the sky as you race across Rainbow Road as the clock towards the new year ticks down.\n\nNo matter your style, these games turn the countdown into an interactive, unforgettable experience that's perfect for friends and families who can't be together to ring in the new year.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is one of the few games that fully commits to New Year’s Eve as an in-game event. On December 31, the plaza transforms with decorations, party favors, sparklers, and a real-time countdown that syncs with the player’s system clock. Isabelle and villagers gather in the square, music ramps up as midnight approaches, and fireworks cap off the celebration.\n\nBecause islands are persistent social spaces, players can invite friends over to experience the countdown together. Everyone can dress for the occasion, emote, exchange gifts, and wander the island after midnight. It feels less like a mini game and more like a shared holiday ritual, which is why it remains the gold standard for virtual New Year’s parties.\n\nWe have Mario Kart World listed here, but nearly any Mario Kart game will work. The series is known for gorgeous tracks that feature stunning visual effects, many of which are fireworks that would fit in on any New Year's Eve parade or celebration.\n\nHop online, hit up a few tracks, and if you're up for it--setup a race along one of those courses that feature fireworks just as the countdown triggers. We're talking Crown City or several iterations of Rainbow Road, among others.\n\nMario Kart World does offer custom lobbies that make it easy to connect with friends, but you can also tout Mario Kart out as part of any in-person New Year's Eve party too!\n\nWhile Epic Games has been known to feature fireworks in live battle royale lobbies near the end of the year, the real party kicks off in Fortnite Creative. Here you can find player-made game modes that let you play your own way--including custom trivia night mods, prop hunt, and party royale-like modes.\n\nOf course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with hopping from the battle bus together as the remaining hours in the year grow fewer and fewer. WinterFest takes place in Fortnite around the end of December each year, giving the island a snowy backdrop as you fight for your life.\n\nWarzone doesn't have the flexibility of something like Fortnite Creative, but its high-octane action makes for some scenes that feel like a New Year's Eve fireworks show. Blowing up helicopters out of the sky or sending trucks off the ground with explosives are little milestones on the way to battle royale victory.\n\nWarzone has become more popular than traditional Call of Duty--and for good reason. Battle royale brings the survival element of war that no other Call of Duty has before. Doing so, with friends, at the end of the year is a blast.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV excels at player-driven celebrations. Housing districts, Free Company estates, and public hubs often host New Year’s countdowns organized by the community. Players dress up, set off fireworks, and gather around stages while DJs stream music externally.\n\nThe game’s strength is how social it feels even without official events. Emotes, glamour, and roleplay-friendly systems allow players to turn the night into a true virtual party. It feels communal, intentional, and uniquely festive.\n\nGTA Online offers endless locations for hosting a New Year’s party, from penthouses and yachts to nightclubs and rooftops. Fireworks launchers, champagne animations, and curated music help sell the celebration without much effort.\n\nPrivate sessions make it easy to turn chaos into a controlled party environment. Friends can dress up, take screenshots, and roam Los Santos together at midnight, blending sandbox freedom with a party atmosphere.\n\nMinecraft is a blank canvas for New Year’s parties. Players can build stages, countdown clocks, and massive firework rigs, then invite friends to explore and celebrate together. Redstone allows for surprisingly elaborate countdown mechanics.\n\nBecause it is player-driven, each party feels personal. Whether it is a cozy survival world or a creative server spectacle, Minecraft lets groups define what celebration looks like.\n\nRoblox thrives on social experiences, many of which are designed specifically for events. Player-creators and professionals regularly create countdown rooms, concert spaces, and dance clubs perfect for New Year’s Eve gatherings.\n\nIts accessibility makes it easy to invite large groups, even casual players. Jumping between games keeps the party moving, while social hubs provide a place to gather at midnight.\n\nFall Guys feels like a party game by design, with colorful characters and short, high-energy rounds. Friends can queue together and treat matches as playful chaos while chatting through the countdown. The lack of downtime makes it ideal for New Year’s Eve. It keeps energy high without demanding focus, letting players celebrate and laugh together.\n\nSome minigames offer the perfect backdrop for a New Year's Eve gathering, including Short Circuit and Hex-A-Terrestrial, complete with a night sky and bright lights to get you in the festive mood.\n\nNo Man’s Sky offers a surprisingly calm party atmosphere. The Nexus serves as a shared social hub, while player-built bases can become private celebration spaces complete with fireworks and emotes. The game works well for laid-back New Year’s parties. Players can explore, take group photos, and ring in the new year against alien skies.\n\nSea of Thieves turns New Year’s Eve into a pirate celebration. Crews can sail together, play shanties, drink grog, and fire cannons into the sky at midnight. The trick shots people have been able to pull off by launching themselves out of cannons, across the sea, and onto other ships are nothing short of incredible. Drunken-madness induced incredible, though.\n\nSea of Thieves adventures are less about competition or loot and more about the shared memorable moments created. Even just sailing under the stars can make for a wonderful way to ring in the new year.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic leans into rowdy celebration through its Space Rig hub. Players can dance, drink at the bar, and trigger music before or after missions, making it a natural gathering spot. Honestly, the Overwatch-like mining adventure is a blast, but sometimes you don't even need to jump into the action to have a good time.\n\nA New Year’s party here feels communal and silly. It is perfect for smaller groups that want something social without leaving co-op gameplay behind.",

You must carefully place climber Aava’s hands and feet to make your way up a forbidding mountain, camping on ledges and bandaging her fingers as you go. Like real climbing, it is challenging and somewhat brutal. \n\n PC, PlayStation 5; 29 January\n\nA two-player animated horror game in the Tim Burton mode, minus all the whimsy. In a setup reminiscent of the famously discomfiting games Limbo and Inside, a brother and sister must escape a twisted mockery of their home town, finding their friends as they go. They are stalked by horrible spike-limbed monsters and grotesquely reanimated creatures. Genuinely frightening and artistically impressive. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation5, Xbox; 13 February\n\nCapcom’s horror series is very old, but it still comes up with new ways to make your skin crawl. In Requiem we play as bookish Grace, whom the game’s director calls “the biggest scaredy-cat in Resident Evil history”, and the confidently combat-proficient cop Leon S Kennedy, pursued by monsters through the iconic Raccoon City. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; 27 February\n\nImagine dropping Pokémon into the world of Animal Crossing, with a hint of Minecraft’s blocky aesthetic. This family-friendly Nintendo game has you building and tending habitats for Nintendo’s beloved creatures. You play as a Ditto, the shape-shifting pink blob, which can helpfully transform into other Pokémon, using those other critters’ abilities to bring a barren landscape back to life and build a vibrant town. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, 5 March\n\nThe most anticipated James Bond game since the Nintendo 64’s GoldenEye 007. Made by IO Interactive, famous for Hitman, it stars a younger, twentysomething Bond who has not yet earned his 007 status, and hopes to blend the expected car chases, shootouts and gadgets with some genuine spycraft, as Bond infiltrates parties and digs for information. \n\n Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; 27 May\n\nFrom the Finnish developer behind Returnal, the exceptional, intelligent time-loop sci-fi shooter, this mysterious action game stars another stranded astronaut on a different hostile planet, one where a dying sun is sending its creatures and colonists mad. Long-time gamers will recognise the lineage of arcade bullet-hell shooters in this very modern action game. \n\n PlayStation 5; 30 April\n\nIt has been in development for more than a decade and, despite several delays (GTA VI was on this very list last year), expectations have never been higher for the biggest game in the world. It’s a crime story and a love story, featuring the series’ first female protagonist, Lucia, and her boyfriend, Jason, and set in Rockstar’s fictional Floridian state of Leonida. There has been so much to satirise about contemporary America since 2013’s GTA V that Rockstar’s writers will surely have been spoilt for choice. \n\n PlayStation 5, Xbox; 19 November\n\nThe modern Spider-Man games have gone down a storm, so it’s no surprise that developer Insomniac is now turning its attention to a different Marvel hero. This new game features an ensemble X-Men cast and a whole lot of gratuitous comic-book violence, as Wolverine sticks those adamantium claws through a succession of foes trying to chase him down. \n\n PlayStation 5; date TBC\n\nLooking for an alternative to established wizarding-school fiction? Witchbrook is a charming pixel-art slice-of-life game about a witches’ college. In school you learn spells and broom flight; outside school you involve yourself in the life of the whimsical town outside. It supports four players at once, too. \n\n PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; TBC",

    "description": "Xu Bo, the founder of one of China’s largest mobile gaming companies, is looking to have “50 high-quality sons” in the U.S. to take over his billion-dollar empire.",
    "fullText": "Billionaires like Telegram founder Pavel Durov and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have fathered legions of children who are slated to inherit their empires. Now, an ultra-wealthy Chinese businessman is doing the same in the U.S., in hopes of producing around 20 U.S.-born children to inherit his video game fortune.\n\nXu Bo is the founder and chairman of Guangzhou Duoyi Network: one of China’s largest mobile gaming companies. Despite the 48-year-old entrepreneur growing his company in Guangzhou, he’s not looking to pass down his $1.1 billion fortune to a child born in his home country. A Wall Street Journal investigation into Xu’s surrogacy history in the U.S. found that the Chinese billionaire was seeking parental rights to at least four unborn children, and had previously fathered and was actively fathering at least eight more surrogacy kids. There could be dozens more.\n\nThe billionaire’s video game company had also reportedly stated that Xu has more than 100 children born through surrogates based in the U.S., according to WSJ reporting. He was allegedly seeking “50 high-quality sons,” according to accounts linked to Xu on Chinese microblogging website Weibo, and said that “having more children can solve all problems.” During a 2023 court hearing, Xu also said he hoped to have around 20 U.S.-born children to one day take over his business, according to WSJ. He also fantasized about his American kids marrying Musk’s children in the future. Last month, Xu’s ex-girlfriend also alleged that he had 300 children living around the world—a claim his company denied.\n\nXu’s Duoyi Network has since made a statement against the Journal, stating the publication had “deliberately confused the facts and fabricated false information,” and that only 12 of the alleged 100-plus children were born in the U.S.\n\nXu is among a growing number of ultra-rich men parenting dozens of children to shepherd their companies and expand their legacies. And just like Xu, the video game billionaire, Telegram founder Pavel Durvo has helped conceive over 100 babies across 12 countries.\n\nOfficially, the entrepreneur worth $14.2 billion has six “official” children with three different partners. In addition to this parentage, Durov has also been donating to a sperm clinic for the past 15 years, which told him has led to more than 100 pregnancies.\n\n“I wrote my will very recently,” Durov told French publication Le Point in an interview this June. “I make no difference between my children: There are those who were conceived naturally and those who come from my sperm donations. They are all my children and will all have the same rights! I don’t want them to tear each other apart after my death.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Let the ceremony begin …\n• The 20 best video games of 2025\nSo, how was 2025 for your household? Was it really all as good as you pretended it was on Facebook?",
    "fullText": "There was no shortage of fun and video games in the Diamond household in the last 12 months. Which ones did we play so much our thumbs hurt? And which one saved my soul? Let the ceremony begin …\n\n The 20 best video games of 2025\n\nSo, how was 2025 for your household? Was it really all as good as you pretended it was on Facebook? Full of A-grades for the kids and riotous themed fancy dress birthday parties for the grownups? Or was it a sea of disappointment with only occasional fun flotsam? And was any of it actually real, or are we all now seven-fingered AI slop beings with Sydney Sweeney’s teeth?\n\nI have gathered my thoughts (and the Diamond household) together, whether they wanted to or not, to reflect on the most important thing in any given year: which video games we enjoyed the most. Without further ado:\n\nGame eldest daughter played the most: Just Dance 2024/Horizon Zero Dawn/Pikmin\n\nOn her phone, meanwhile, she’s been playing Cityscapes and “trying to find decent healthcare”.\n\nGame middle son played the most: Overwatch\n“I don’t play games on my phone.” He was offended that I even asked him that question. I respect that.\n\nGame youngest daughter played the most: Resident Evil Biohazard\nShe is trying to get into theatre school, but when she wasn’t singing, she was playing Resident Evil. She also went on in great detail about her achievements on The Sims, where the Shark has a thriving utopia with infinitely better healthcare than her big sister has in real life.\n\nGame the wife played the most: Crash Bandicoot: It’s About Time\nShe started the year at 60% completion and ended it at 82%. It’s a marathon not a sprint for her. On her phone: something called Woodle, where you have to unscrew pins.\n\nGame I laughed at my kids for still playing: Minecraft\nAny time I see my 21-year-old son playing Minecraft, I set about him like a cross between Steve Martin with that guy in the pub in Roxanne, and Joe Pesci with Spider in Goodfellas. When he complains, I reply that I am doing this to toughen him up so he can be a man and play games for grownups. It’s a very Scottish father/son relationship.\n\nMost impressive gaming family member 2025: Eldest daughter on Just Dance 2024\nThere was no contest for this one. She is a machine. Even better than I was at the Cure’s Lovecats on Dancing Stage MegaMix in my prime.\n\nGame I played the most: Marvel Snap\nNothing came close to the hours I spent on this insanely well-crafted deck building wizard’s poker, with its constantly evolving range of cards and game variations.\n\nGame I wish I had played less: Marvel Snap\nThe worst thing about games that constantly evolve their range of cards and variations is you wake up one day and realise it is all just an attempt to suck you into fomo-fuelled microtransactions. So love turned to hate halfway through the year and it went into the bin.\n\nGame I wish I had played more: Doom: The Dark Ages\nGlorious reinvention of a classic. Immersive atmosphere from the off. I wish I could eviscerate my demons so effectively in real life.\n\nGame I wish I had played more (cerebral edition): Blue Prince\nI refuse to rush this beautiful, unique game and I just didn’t have the time or headspace to give it what it deserved earlier this year. My mother is staying with us over Christmas and the New Year, so I will be playing this in the wee small hours after I have prosecco’d her into oblivion.\n\nGame that saved my soul when I needed It: Balatro\nI know Balatro was 2024’s breakout game, but I was late to it. And it is remarkable. It just gets every single thing right. Crazy Poker is a wonderful concept, but the powers behind the different joker cards are so imaginative it has become a game I literally would play any time of the day or night. Throw in the wittiness of the card design, and this is an absolute high-water mark of gaming. I dream of being stuck in a broken-down lift for hours just so I have nothing to do but play it.\n\nGame I got the most criticism for criticising: Outer Worlds 2\nI experienced a minor pile-on when I wrote about how the Paintress boss battle bug in Clair Obscur ruined the whole game for me, but it’s still a gargantuan gaming achievement in terms of art, sound, acting, battle gameplay and ambition – which I appreciated even more after slogging through Outer Worlds 2. So thank you to the reader who took the time to email me personally, through my website, to say that my Outer Worlds 2 review was “bitter, confused resentment because YOU DON’T GET THE GAME OLD MAN and your son is an idiot as well sorry to inform you.” I present that in the exact way it was written, because I appreciate the effort, and he is obviously an excellent judge of character where my son is concerned.\n\nGame everybody loved that I just didn’t get: Hollow Knight: Silksong\nSure. Give me a bastard-hard Metroidvania-esque thing and don’t tell me what I am supposed to be doing, except “explore”. Great fun. I get that it looks ace and is perfection if you are into this kind of thing, but I cannot think of a gaming experience I want less of in my mid-fifties. I was around back when all games were like this, and I’ve had enough. It was fine when I was a kid, but so was polyester.\n\nBiggest gaming scandal of 2025: Toss-up between EA getting in bed with Jared Kushner and the Saudis, and Outer Worlds 2 costing £70. Both morally indefensible and repugnant.\n\nGames I would name my children after, if I was ever stupid enough to have more: Clair Obscur, Despelote and Bananza would all sound good bellowed from the doorstep at tea time.\n\nPart of my body that aches most from gaming: Right thumb joint. Seriously. I don’t know if it’s because of video games or doomscrolling on my phone, but it burns like the mines of sulphur in the mornings now. I knew I should have got my thumbs insured back in the 90s.\n\nGame I am looking forward to the most in 2026: GTA 6. \n\n And it will come out in 2026, even if we have to make 2026 last until the heat death of the universe.\n\nGame I am looking forward to the most in 2036: The Witcher 4.",

Fight demons, fend off unwanted admirers and survive work shifts in this queer, neon homage to 1990s PlayStation-era horror. ME\n\nWeb browser\nThe trick of this daily logic puzzle is that you can’t guess, or make wrong answers. Presented with a grid of characters, you must identify the “innocent” and the “criminal” based on clues revealed with each correct answer. But the game will only accept an answer if it’s sure you know it for a fact. An idealistic vision of a criminal justice system. Duncan Fyfe\n\nSwitch, Playdate, PC\nBlippo+ is a channel surfing simulator that rides the line between video game and absurd cable subscription service. Experienced entirely by trawling through the interface of a virtual TV guide, you can tune into intergalactic music videos, curious cooking shows, and psychic weather reports, learning an alien culture through charming live-action skits that evoke the sketch comedy of Tim and Eric. Sarah Thwaites\n\nSwitch, PC\nA sequel in all but name to Love-de-Lic’s 1997 role-playing game satire Moon, Stray Children is a monster-taming adventure where you whisper away the worries of troubled “Olders” that have come to dominate the inhabitants of an unfinished video game. Finessed by a crunchy pixel art style and a combat system inspired by Undertale, this nostalgic odyssey will pull on your heartstrings while testing your reflexes at the same time. ST\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nA fiendish, almost cruelly addictive mashup of Vampire Survivors-esque monster horde control and Breakout-style ball-bouncing. Descend into a pit full of demons and shoot a continuous stream of richocheting, burning, poisonous and otherwise deadly balls at them until the screen is just a brain-melting confusion of visual effects. Keza MacDonald\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nYou are a cheerful pubescent boy with a unique problem: your arms are stuck out in a T-pose. How do you navigate school, family, friendships and brushing your teeth when you can’t bend your arms? A sweet, family friendly slice-of-life physical comedy game with an unexpectedly affecting message, and excellent songs sung by a gourmand giraffe. KM\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nJust a chill bike-racing game where your ride is possessed by an ancient speed spirit. Wheel around a soothingly minimalist island of cycling obsessives, picking up new swappable bike parts and blasting past local gangs of racers on downhill courses. Uncomplicated, good looking and thoughtfully put together. KM\n\nPC\nPowerhoof’s excellent pixelated point-and-click game teases its dystopian plot throughout, mixing influences such as The Thing, Michael Crichton’s Coma and Total Recall. It’s an intriguing mix: combined with a heartfelt story full of painful human emotions and some fantastic audio, it’s a tense yet warming tale, guaranteed to coil its way around your heart. Graeme Mason\n\nXbox, PC\nWhile the combat mechanics are familiar, it’s South of Midnight’s evocative backdrop that marks it apart. Set in an overgrown and misty American deep south, it stars Hazel, a young woman thrust into the aftermath of a hurricane and forced to battle the evil manifestations of deep-rooted sorrows. Beautiful and engaging, its soundtrack is also wonderful, perfectly complementing the uncanny scenery. GM\n\nPC\nYour task is simple in the brilliantly silly Skin Deep: save a bunch of talking cats from marauding space pirates. The execution is anything but as you crouch in vents, pull glass from your feet, and deploy sneezing powder and slippery soap bars to incapacitate your foes. Like Metal Gear Solid meets a Looney Tunes cartoon, the pleasure here lies in pushing the game’s miniature sandboxes to their slapstick limit. Lewis Gordon\n\nPS5, PC\nCasting you as a knight with a hoverboard, Sword of the Sea is a mystical journey through a desert which roils like an ocean. You pull grab tricks and get big air on cresting dunes, but the greater enjoyment stems from simply soaking up the game’s breathtaking, nature-infused landscapes at high speed. A gorgeously dreamy, new age take on extreme sport. LG\n\nPC\nIf ancestry.com has yet to reveal your hidden royal lineage, try digging into the Roottree clan instead. Armed with a 1998 web browser, you have to deduce the loves, losses and lies of a sprawling candy dynasty (no relation to Rowntree). A compelling blend of Her Story and Who Do You Think You Are? Matthew Castle\n\nPS4/5, Xbox, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nShakespearean dialogue, bruising boss battles and a tale steeped in class struggle make this a refreshingly different Final Fantasy. As you command a troupe of society’s most downtrodden, excellent voice acting lends this once silent PlayStation 1 game new life. As rewarding to play as it is affecting, in 2025, Yasumi Matsuno’s tale of inequality and division has never felt more relevant. Tom Regan\n\nPS4/5, Switch, PC\nCombining the best parts of Hades with the immediacy of Streets of Rage, this colourful co-operative caper is an endless delight. As you roam Talamh’s lived-in fantasy world, this roguelike rewards you with satisfying new powers and beguiling side quests. With precise combat and varied movesets, Absolum adds some much-needed depth to the oft shallow beat ’em up genre. A co-op classic. TR\n\nPS5, Xbox, Switch, PC\nIf the prospect of a disgraced mobster tooling around small-town Japan accompanied by a giant depraved thumb doesn’t intrigue you, keep moving. But give Promise Mascot Agency some time and you’ll discover this compact open-world adventure is filled with chaotic charm. At its heart it’s a story of redemption, as you manage a gang of weirdo mascots and restore a dilapidated community, all while driving the best pickup truck in any video game. Christian Donlan\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nHere’s a fantasy role-playing game that’s happy to embrace elemental powers, even if it leads to pinwheeling chaos. In a world where fire attacks can spread uncontrollably and ice can lead to giant dragons dropping out of the sky as their wings freeze up, this colourful piece of whimsy offers fun that genuinely scales to your own imagination. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nMatt Newell’s hymn to photography is also a gorgeous investigation into the creative power of solitude and of paying attention to your surroundings. Learn your way around a beautifully simulated digital camera, but also explore the visual potential of a range of exquisitely crafted 3D landscapes. There are no puzzles and not much in the way of scoring, just you and your ever-developing eye. CD\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nA football game that’s closer to the likes of Rocket League than it is Fifa, Rematch has you feeling as if you’re playing an actual match of five-a-side: developer Sloclap have utterly mastered the sensation and pace of charging up a field and passing between your mates before knocking the ball into the back of the net. Daniella Lucas\n\nPS5, PC\nProof that love and hate can be two sides of the same coin, this ridiculous adventure has you taking control of a grown man in a onesie trying to remember how to walk. You have to separately control each of your legs over a series of obstacles that lead to some absurdly funny moments, but equally has you kneeling in despair as you fall, yet again, off a wooden plank while trying to get a stupid hat. Worth it though. DL\n\nSwitch, PC\nA game all about slowing life down, While Waiting takes mundane situations – from breaking down in your car to waiting for a delayed train – and gives you multiple choices on how to handle them. Due to the way it rewards experimentation, and squeezing the fun out of everyday moments, While Waiting has taught me how to be more patient – and that wasting time by fiddling around with things is the key to a healthy life-balance. Thomas Hobbs\n\nSwitch, PC\nOne for the Halloween-loving girlies and ghoulies, this companion to Strange Horticulture has you dealing in occult objects rather than plants. Explore gothic Cumbrian locales to find artefacts, identify them via vague tomes, solve puzzles and occasionally divert the plot by giving a customer something other than what they wanted. Jordan Erica Webber\n\nSwitch, PC\nDeveloper Wadjet Eye keeps the point-and-click adventure genre alive in an apt tale of time-travelling tourism. As punters pay to revisit lost loves and settle scores, it’s your job to protect the timeline. From a timeloop farce to an urgent visit to pre-9/11 New York, Old Skies unfolds like a short story anthology. A surprise on every page. MC\n\nSwitch, PC, iOS, Android\nSudoku meets speed dating. This charming puzzle game sees you play matchmaker via seating plans, seating cute little characters together based on their hilarious pet peeves and preferences in a host of fun settings. Its puzzles are cosy, relaxing and never frustrating. Bex April May\n\nPC\nWhat if your friendly neighbourhood turned into a waking nightmare? That’s the premise of this RPG-style survival horror set in an apartment complex where unspeakable horrors are going on right outside your window – but whatever you do, you mustn’t look at them, or you risk mutating like your poor, revolting neighbours. Best enjoyed with the curtains drawn. BAM\n\nPS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, PC\nFrom its tongue-in-cheek writing to its ridiculous creatures, Toby Fox’s episodic role-playing game is charming and witty. Like Undertale before it, Deltarune flips the genre on its head with humour and heart, leaving you itching for more. (The game’s next chapter isn’t until the second half of 2026 at the earliest.) We dare you not to crack a smile at this one. Vic Hood\n\nPS5, Xbox, PC\nThis psychological horror immediately tells you what to expect: “This is a story about death.” As Sam, you attempt to escape your home, an increasingly twisted labyrinth of puzzles and memories. Channelling the unsettling atmosphere of Hideo Kojima’s PT, Luto delivers a powerful message about grief and life after loss. VH\n\nPS5, Switch, PC\nYou play as a fly in Time Flies, buzzing around different environments – a home or a museum, for instance – doing fly things, such as tickling people’s feet or avoiding lightbulbs. The time you have to complete the fly’s bucket list depends on your actual location, leaving just minutes or seconds to get everything done. Who knew speedrunning a fly’s life could be so delightful? Nicole Carpenter\n\nSwitch, PC\nAnd Roger is disorienting, devastating and one of the most emotional games to be released this year. From developer TearyHand Studio, And Roger’s evocative story and simple-yet-distinct art is reminiscent of Mountains’ 2018 release Florence. Within three chapters, a mystery unfolds: Who is this man in the house? Where’s my father? The answers reveal a tragic, beautiful story of love and family. NC\n\nXbox, PC\nSoft Not Weak’s Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To is a visual novel, dating simulator, and match-three game all in one. While it’s driven by its classic puzzle gameplay,this is a masterclass in characters and character design: Each individual you meetis just as interesting and well-developed as the last. It’s a must-play for both puzzle fanatics and visual novel lovers. NC",

    "fullText": "In this week’s newsletter: Pushing Buttons readers on their favourite games of the year, from Death Stranding 2 and Arc Raiders to Ghost of Yōtei and more\n\nHappy holidays, Pushing Buttons readers! Once again, we are approaching the cherished time of year between Christmas and New Year when we might actually have the time to play some video games. I hope Santa brought you something new to play, instead of taking one look at all the unplayed games in your Steam library and putting you straight on the naughty list.\n\nOver the past few weeks you have been sending in your favourite games of the year. I maintain that you readers have excellent taste: there’s crossover with our own Guardian games of the year list, but also plenty here that I haven’t played myself. Thank you to everyone who sent in a recommendation, and I hope you find yet another game to add to your pile of shame among the following suggestions. I’ll be back next week with a year-in-review issue – in the meantime, go enjoy yourselves!\n\n“Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I absolutely devoured this gem of a game; the story, setting, music, characters and visuals are all on point. I was itching to get back to playing it, while simultaneously never wanting it to end. Fantastic work from a debuting Sandfall Interactive [game] – I can’t wait to see what they do next!” Jen Baker\n\n“Death Stranding 2 is a true masterpiece of a game. Absurd at times, deeply emotional, scary, all with an absolutely amazing score. The characters are superb. In particular, Rainy was absolutely wonderful and Higgs, the guitar-shredding Paul Gilbert look-alike villain, was insanely brilliant. And blimey ... the graphics. Just sensational stuff.” Simon White\n\n“Avowed. I’ve started but never finished Skyrim (or any of the Elder Scrolls games), Starfield, any of the Fallouts or Outer Worlds that I think fall into the same category. But Avowed got its hooks into me with a great script and voice acting, seeing the difference my choices made and possibly the best first person, non-shooter combat I’ve tried.” Matt Froggatt\n\n“Split Fiction is the most fun co-op I have played for ages, they have ripped off every genre going and all for the greater co-op good! Plus, it’s not an expensive game and you don’t have to buy two copies. PS: The pigs and hotdog section was beyond funny!” Simon Watson\n\n“My favourite game this year has to be a triumphant return to the Lies of P universe and the DLC, Overture. It was so brilliantly done, the storyline was so sad and thoughtful. I just loved the way the prequel developed the main game lore and explained the characters backstories so well. The boss fights were so epic and I loved how stupidly hard some of them were. Oh, and the new music was great too. Big fan.” Tara Cooper\n\n“My favourite game of the year has been my favourite for years: Ghost of Yōtei. It looks incredible, the gameplay is fluid and the story is good. There are loads of side missions but they never feel like a chore or repetitive because of the quality of the action. In short, it’s everything that Assassin’s Creed wishes it could be.” Gareth Jones\n\n“Mechabellum. This game was catapulted into my online friend group seemingly out of nowhere, but we all love it. It’s a round-based 1v1 or 2v2 autobattler with lots of layers of skill and strategy. A match is about 20 mins 1v1. It’s also not an RTS which is great for me and my late-30s lads who mostly can’t put in the hours to stay good at Dota (our old go-to for Friday night games).” Thomas Jones\n\n“The top VR game of 2025 has to be Ghost Town by Fireproof Games. It has an incredible narrative with a strong female lead that is set in the 1980s. Fireproof Games is known for The Room series, so it’s no surprise that the visuals are stunning, the puzzles challenging and creative and the characters brilliant. An absolute joy to play.” Martina Stender\n\n“For me, it has to be Monster Train 2! The perfect rogue-like card battler that has learned and applied everything it can from other greats. It’s a mix of chance and strategy that never feels like it leaves you too high and dry, and challenge modes that help you find new ways to play in the main game. A wonderful, addictive and fun way to while away an afternoon, or a late night!” Nell Guy\n\n“Maybe it’s recency bias, but Arc Raiders has come out of nowhere and completely taken over my gaming life. The sound design, the significant risk of death, but also the surprisingly kind community – I’m using public voice chat for the first time since the 360 days – have combined for an immersive experience unlike anything I’ve ever played. We’ll see how the community evolves over time, especially as the game increases in popularity, but for now, it stands as a tremendous accomplishment that deserves to be recognised.” Brett Bates\n\n“One game I played this year will stay with me for life: Chicory: A Colorful Tale, an old-Zelda-like where the gameplay is based on painting every stage and interacting with colours. It’s fun to play, never tiring, an amazingly well-written story dealing with depression in a constructive and original way, incredible music by Lena Raine ... [I] cried multiple times, had fun from start to finish, and I left no screen in black and white.” Silvano Cardin\n\n“Absolum. I was quite excited for this one since playing the demo, so not entirely unexpected that this is my favourite release of the year. A rogue-like beat-’em up where style and substance are dealt out in massive quantities; the tight mechanics and setting are so striking that even after 100%-ing the game, I’m still coming back for more. I really look forward to hearing what the developers have next for this, as they have promised more, and I am waiting with bated breath!” Asher Alexander\n\n“There were many great games this year and I’ve spent a lot of time on Silksong and Clair Obscur Expedition 33. Nothing had me obsessed like Blue Prince, though … it got to the point where I was constantly thinking about it, even when I was not playing. I’m thoroughly done, and it makes me really sad.” Marie-Jill Landry\n\n“Kaizen Game Works’ Promise Mascot Agency is a weirdly wholesome game about a Yakuza hitman rebuilding a small Japanese town through the use of incredibly odd store brand mascots. Just unique, and a perfect follow-up to the equally weird Paradise Killer.” Paul Jones\n\n“My favourite game of the year is, very much, Dispatch – and I can’t wait for the final episodes to drop tonight. It’s unique, as far as I’ve seen, with a great blend of story and game, with a compelling narrative that keeps you going with interesting decision points. The animation is great, and I’m sure I’ll replay it as soon as I’ve finished to see what differences the other choices make. And it was cheap – no need to pay £70-80 for this!” Chris Cunliffe\n\n“Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is outstanding in all respects. It’s my game of the year – all-time favourite.” Bob Watkins\n\nKarts, cakes and karaoke: the eight best party games to play with family this Christmas\n\nTerminator 2D: No Fate – the least bad Terminator game in a long while | ★★★☆☆\n\nCall of Duty’s Vince Zampella was a video games visionary\n\n‘I plugged in Zelda and everything changed’: developers share their fondest Christmas gaming memories\n\nWe’ll skip the reader question this week – instead, why not get in touch to let us know what you’ve enjoyed about Pushing Buttons this year, what we could do better, and any games, themes or stories you want us to look into in 2026?\n\nYou know what to do: email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.\n\nRead our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here\n\nIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.\n\nRead our review of Ball X Pit here\n\nIf you are \n\nRead our review of Blue Prince here\n\nWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.\n\nCheck out a bit of the history behind Peak here\n\nWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!\n\nRead our review of Super Smash Bros.

Though best known for that series of blockbuster military shooters, Zampella touched a huge number of lives – not only the hundreds of people who worked at the game development studios he led under Activision and EA, but the millions of people who played the games that bore his imprint.\nA lifelong gamer, Zampella had a Pong console as a child, then an Atari 2600 and a Commodore 64.

Though best known for that series of blockbuster military shooters, Zampella touched a huge number of lives – not only the hundreds of people who worked at the game development studios he led under Activision and EA, but the millions of people who played the games that bore his imprint.\n\nA lifelong gamer, Zampella had a Pong console as a child, then an Atari 2600 and a Commodore 64. He told IGN in 2016 that his favourite game from childhood was Donkey Kong: “I would spend hours at the arcade playing it.” Zampella’s first job in the industry was at GameTek in Miami, which specialised in video-game versions of popular US quizshows. He described his role on the small team as: “producer slash customer services slash tester – whatever needed to be done.”\n\nIt was at a developer called 2015, Inc in Tulsa that Zampella had his first smash hit as lead designer. Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was the third title in the acclaimed series of second world war shooters, which had been inspired by Saving Private Ryan and written in conjunction with Steven Spielberg. Zampella had envisioned a new type of shooter with an epic, cinematic sense of immersion. The game was a bestseller, acclaimed for its globetrotting narrative and taut, tense action – especially during its thrilling depiction of the Omaha beach landing.\n\nWhen publisher Electronic Arts made the decision to take the development of Medal of Honour in-house, Zampella and his colleague Jason West left, together with Grant Collier, and set up Infinity Ward in Los Angeles. There they created Call of Duty, a second world war shooter designed to exceed Medal of Honor’s sense of epic drama – indeed, its original development title had been Medal of Honor Killer. Critically, the game featured a range of lead characters including US, British and Russian fighters rather than giving players control of a single “super soldier”. “It’s meant to show you that no one side won the war – it was an allied effort,” Zampella said at the time.\n\nOnce again, the emphasis was on dramatic set-piece battles on a vast scale, with the player surrounded by computer-controlled allies giving the impression of being a small part of a wider campaign. “We’re all about authenticity and intensity,” Zampella said. “We’ve strived to put as many guys on screen as possible. It’s about your squad, not you as a lone gunman.”\n\nThis emphasis on teamwork and cinematic intensity would become emblematic of Call of Duty. While two sequels remained in the theatre of the second world war, for the fourth title, released in 2007, Zampella and West decided to move into the modern era. The result, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is one of the most important and influential first-person shooters ever made.\n\nIts campaign features a group of special forces operatives, including newcomer John “Soap” MacTavish and grizzled SAS captain John Price, taking on Russian ultra-nationalists and a Middle Eastern warlord. It had imaginative and exciting missions, including All Ghillied Up, a sniper mission in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster, and the eerie Death From Above, in which players control the various weapons of a C-130 aircraft, taking out enemies on the ground who appear merely as dots on an infrared screen. Meanwhile, the game’s online multiplayer mode brought new innovations including kill-streaks, which allowed players on a winning run to call in special attacks such as airstrikes. Infinity Ward created the template for multiplayer shooters that is still used today. Call of Duty’s DNA is present in every modern hit of the genre.\n\nIn 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Infinity Ward by publisher Activision, and went on to form Respawn Entertainment, taking more than 30 Call of Duty staff with them. Under new publisher Electronic Arts, the company released Titanfall in 2014, a multiplayer-focused sci-fi shooter intended to innovate within the genre. The game emphasised the player’s freedom of movement, allowing for smooth, parkour-style navigation of obstacles and structures. Players were also able to call in and pilot giant, heavily armed mechs. As Zampella explained at the time: “It’s taking the old paradigm of these shooter games being very grounded and two-dimensional and now adding this verticality to it and making it something that’s a new experience; something that people haven’t seen before.”\n\nAfter splitting with Activision, Zampella advised several other game creatives who found themselves at odds with their publishers and were considering striking out on their own. One of them was Hideo Kojima, creator of Metal Gear Solid and, at his own studio Kojima Productions, the Death Stranding series. “When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways,” wrote a “heartbroken” Kojima on X after Zampella’s death. “He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures”\n\nTitanfall’s sequel added an extraordinary single-player story to the original’s fluid online play – it is still one of the best shooter campaigns around. That series’ emphasis on smooth, seamless movement would also characterise Respawn’s entry into the battle royale genre: Apex Legends. Released with almost no pre-publicity in 2019, it would attract 10m players in its opening 72 hours and still maintains a place in the pantheon alongside Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone.\n\nRespawn next made two excellent single-player Star Wars games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Zampella’s peers have noted that working on the Star Wars franchise brought him and his colleagues at Respawn great joy.\n\nIn 2020, Electronic Arts put Zampella in charge of the Battlefield franchise, with a remit to recharge the series after the disappointing performance of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Released in October, Battlefield 6 was widely praised as a return to form, especially the online multiplayer modes. It sold 7m copies in three days, the best ever opening for the series.\n\nZampella will be remembered as one of the most influential game designers of his era and a ceaseless innovator in the first-person shooter genre – and with the Star Wars Jedi series, outside it. He was someone whom you always looked forward to encountering or interviewing at games industry events, an outspoken creative who cared deeply about video games and the player’s experience.\n\n“Vince was an extraordinary person – a gamer at heart, but also a visionary executive with a rare ability to recognise talent and give people the freedom and confidence to create something truly great,” wrote Geoff Keighley on X, who runs the Game Awards and, as a former games journalist, worked on a documentary about Titanfall with Zampella. “Even when it was difficult or uncomfortable, Vince never wavered in his commitment to honesty and transparency. He believed that the truth mattered, and he was willing to share it with the world. Vince cared deeply about doing the right thing. And even while working inside large organisations, he consistently pushed to put players first – to prioritise the experience, the craft and the people who played the games. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of work … I always felt he still had his greatest one ahead of him. It’s heartbreaking that we’ll never get to play it.”",

    "fullText": "This year has brought us many brilliant video games – but as wealth continues to concentrate, and games are used to exert economic and political influence, we need to keep an eye on the top players\n\nI love playing video games, but what interests me most as a journalist are the ways in which games intersect with real life. One of the joys of spending 20 years on this beat has been meeting hundreds of people whose lives have been meaningfully enhanced by games, and as their cultural influence has grown, these stories have become more and more plentiful.\n\nThere is another side to this, however. A couple of decades ago, video games were mostly either ignored or vilified by governments and mainstream culture, leading to an underdog mentality that has persisted even as games have become a nearly $200bn industry. As their popularity has grown, so have their political and cultural relevance. And the ways in which games intersect with real life are now coloured by the economic and political realities of our times.\n\nWhen I look back on this year’s happenings in the world of games, I see a lot of positives. A theme of the past few years has been comparatively small-scale games outperforming expensive blockbusters: the best examples this year have been the now multi-award-winning Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and Hollow Knight: Silksong, which has sold seven million copies. Despite year-long discussions over the finer points of what counts as “indie” and how many people really contribute to games made by “tiny” teams – a lot of them use contractors, who deserve to be acknowledged – the point remains that it is very possible to make brilliant and creative games to extremely high standards without a $100m budget, and that is something to be celebrated.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 was also (finally) announced and released this year, and has been very well received despite Trump’s best efforts to scupper its launch with tariff drama. Having a new console to enjoy tends to revive one’s enthusiasm for games, and though the Switch 2 didn’t feel enormously different from the original Switch, when I go back to my old machine now I really feel the difference.\n\nBut the broader story of 2025 is of a games industry reckoning with the same late-capitalist, techno-feudalistic forces that are threatening every creative industry. Wealth continues to concentrate at the top, while workers continue to face huge instability: more than 5,000 games industry jobs have been lost this year, and have several studios, including Monolith Productions. AI disruption is everywhere, meanwhile, as companies try to force their workforces to justify immense investments in the as-yet-unprofitable technology. AI-generated artwork and voiceovers have made their way into some of this year’s more successful games, and the pushback has been vociferous.\n\nAll this has led to much greater visibility for video game workers’ unions. In March, United Videogame Workers formed in the US and Canada, part of the Communications Workers of America. (They could be found protesting outside the Game Awards earlier this month.) In the UK, the firing of 30 staff from Rockstar Games pushed the UK’s IWGB Game Workers Union into the spotlight. Unionisation is slowly becoming more common even in the US, where there is not a strong culture of workplace organisation.\n\nAnother theme of the past few years has been consolidation: when Microsoft acquired Activision in 2023, it made me feel very uneasy about the concentration of economic power. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying its way into the games industry for years via esports partnerships and companies such as Savvy Games Group and Scopely, but this year it was kicked into high gear by a $55bn deal for EA. The Saudis also bought Niantic, makers of Pokémon Go, in March. (If you are wondering why the PIF is quite so ethically troubling, and how these video game investments form part of a strategy to whitewash the country’s image and that of its royal family, Eurogamer’s interview with Human Rights Watch from earlier this year is an essential read.)\n\nWhat we see here is money and power concentrating in the video game world in the same way as in the wider world. And games have immense power to influence people’s thoughts and attitudes: the most powerful people in the world have started to realise this. (Even Elon Musk sees the value of appropriating game credibility: he was discovered to be a fake gamer in January after boasting about his Path of Exile 2 character online.) Why else would the Trump administration be tweeting AI-generated images of the president as Halo’s Master Chief? Or using Pokémon and Halo memes to recruit for ICE? Why else would rightwing agitators continue to feed culture war spats over a black samurai in Assassin’s Creed, or a non-binary actor in a PlayStation game?\n\nI don’t pretend to be neutral on any of these things. Earlier this year, after I wrote about the Saudi acquisition of EA, I got an email from a reader asking if “some of this stuff is more editorial opinion rather than fact/news”. The answer to that is: it’s both. I will never report anything here that isn’t true, but I also won’t shy away from delivering my informed opinion on the things that go on in the gaming world. Unsurprisingly for a Guardian journalist, my values are inclusive, left-leaning and somewhat sceptical of corporate power, and of course that informs what I write in Pushing Buttons. I think that those values are vital context in these times.\n\nPlaying games is something a lot of us do for escapism, and a lot of people still react defensively if you talk about their relevance to real-world politics. Don’t we play games to get away from this stuff? Can’t we just concentrate on the hundreds of fantastic games that come out every single year, from creatively fired-up developers and artists all over the world? But games are inextricable from what’s happening in the real world. All art is. As if to symbolise this, this year’s Summer Game Fest – a showcase of forthcoming games held in LA in June – was interrupted by city-wide LA protests against ICE.\n\nIt matters, who has power. Games feel so exciting because they often give so much power to their players, to carve their own paths though their worlds. As players we leave an impression on games, and they leave an impression on us. In an ideal world, players and developers would be the people who held the power in the video games industry, too. If we enjoy video games, it is worth keeping an eye on the biggest players.",

Repeated runs bring gradual mastery of Melinoë’s spells and weapons, tipping the scales of fate ever so slightly in your favour.\n\nSokpop Collectiv, PC\n\n A gardening sim that’s also a horror adventure, Grunn is a weird, often unsettling experiment in game design, set in a Dutch village inhabited by ghostly figures and intriguing secrets. Trim the lawn, collect photos, but be extremely careful when visiting the church or exploring that weird bunker beyond the hedgerow.\n\nMegagon Industries, PC, Xbox\n\n All is well with the world as you carve beautiful lines down pristine mountain snowscapes – until you smack into a rock or fly off a cliff, that is. Minimalist in both its aesthetic and its simple, stripped-back play, this is one of the best games ever made about skiing. Playing with other people adds a little enjoyable chaos to the experience, but Snow Riders is best when it’s just you and the mountain, and you’re testing your perseverance against a particularly challenging trail.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n Nintendo’s favourite ape returns in a wild take on the classic platform adventure, accompanied by series regular Pauline, who is able to attain shapeshifting magical powers. Instead of pixel-perfect jumps, you punch, crunch and blast your way through exotic locations, collecting power-ups and pulverising bosses, tearing up the Super Mario level design book as you go. Smashing.\n\nCapcom, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n Capcom’s spectacular monsters, from fluffy pink snarling apes to elder dragons that command lightning, have long been waiting for a world big enough to contain them. Wilds is that world: an expanse of desert, volcanic plains, jungle and icy peaks that provides the perfect habitats for an extraordinary, dangerous menagerie – and perfect arenas in which to fight them. The story is a thrill ride of escalatingly epic face-offs, but afterwards it opens up a vast menu of more challenging hunts.\n\nHazlelight Studios/Electronic Arts, PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Two aspiring writers become trapped in each others’ stories in this eminently likable interactive take on buddy comedy. Except they’re not buddies: they’re polar opposites. Standoffish sci-fi writer Mio and happy-go-lucky fantasy writer Zoe come to understand each other better as they are forced to cooperate their way through the bizarre realms of their imagination Play transforms unpredictably every 20 minutes - one level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns. You’ll be brought closer to your player two as well, as navigating these collaborative scenarios requires communication, patience, and a sense of humour.\n\n11Bit Studios, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n After crash-landing on a planet supposedly rich in a valuable mineral, Jan Dolski finds himself all alone. The rest of the crew died on impact. So to keep the mission going, and escape an imminent sunrise that will fry him out of existence, he must clone himself to create a crew. After twenty-ish hours split between exploring a hostile planet, managing the base’s resources and managing the squabbles between all the alternate Jans, you will be left with a lot to ponder about how our life choices shape who we are.\n\nPanic, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox\n\n Set at the time of Ecuador’s journey to the 2002 World Cup finals, Despelote is a beautifully designed semi-autobiographical adventure about a young boy and his obsession with the beautiful game. Focusing on families, childhood and the uniting power of fandom, it’s a unique take on the idea of a sports sim.\n\nTwo Point Studios/Sega, PC, PS5, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n The Two Point series of management sims has consistently combined humour and deep strategy to compelling effect, and the latest is no exception. Your role as museum manager is to gather exhibits from around the world then display them in an attractive setting to pull in visitors. Meanwhile there are staffing issues to contend with, and is your cafe serving nice enough snacks? It’s an engrossing challenge and the cartoon-style visuals provide plenty of amusing asides.\n\nSucker Punch/Sony, PS5\n\n A deliciously easy to enjoy and arrestingly beautiful samurai action game about a female warrior, Atsu, on a revenge quest, which unselfconsciously reproduces every possible trope of the genre, with panache. We have tense sword stand-offs under falling leaves. We have enemies eyeing each other menacingly from either side of a burning bridge. We have hot springs, shrines and quiet moments playing the shamisen or wielding a sumi-e ink brush. We have wolves and foxes leading us to secret spots in nature. And we have a selection of delightfully fun weapons and a seemingly endless horde of bandits and villains to use them on. Uncomplicated, beautifully made entertainment.\n\nKojima Productions/Sony, PS5\n\n Troubled delivery man and resistance hero Sam Bridges returns in Hideo Kojima’s visually astonishing, eccentric and engrossing sci-fi sequel. Moving the action to an apocalyptic Australia provides landscapes of stark beauty – and the odd kangaroo. And while the story is often indecipherable, the realisation of Kojima’s ghostly universe is incredible. This is a wasteland you can wallow in for months.\n\nSandfall/Keplar, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n An extravagantly French role-playing game in which a band of depressed people from a ravaged Paris set out to kill a supernatural painter, who wipes out a generation of people with a few strokes of her brush each year. It is surreal, exciting, melodramatic, sometimes self-indulgent, and strangely hopeful – a breath of fresh air even in a genre that’s hardly starved of stylish, thematically ambitious games.\n\nHexecutable, PC \n\n A satirical slice-of-life game about life as a dieting-obsessed teen in the 00s, Consume Me is extremely funny and has a point to make. Juggling studies with social time and walking the dog, Tetris-ing food on to your plate and and enduring excruciating conversations with your parents, all makes you properly relive the overwhelm and pressure of adolescent life. The presentation, meanwhile, is exuberantly, lovably absurd.\n\nNintendo, Switch 2\n\n The showcase title for the Switch 2 is another glorious addition to the Mario Kart universe, boasting a delightful cast of characters and 30 varied circuits joined by a network of highways that provide the chance to explore a wide open landscape for the first time in the series. Add in the wonderful soundtrack of electronic lounge jazz pop bangers and you have another family gaming staple that will remain on rotation for years.\n\nSpooky Doorway/Raw Fury, PC\n\n It’s the late 19th century and you’ve just arrived at a remote hotel in the west of Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. But as you dig for clues, the dead emerge from their graves – and they’re really not happy. Part Agatha Christie detective sim, part folk-horror opus, this is a fascinating and engrossing experience that has things to say about class, belief and colonialism.\n\nNeoBards/Konami, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n In 1960s Japan, a young girl’s fury at her bullying father becomes a spectral nightmare that consumes a whole town. Written by acclaimed visual novel author Ryukishi07, the game puts you in familiar Silent Hill territory, which means foggy streets, fiendish puzzles and truly horrible monsters. But by infusing the uncanny, mythology and superstition with feminist themes, it is an intriguing slant on a much loved (and feared) series.\n\nTeam Cherry, PC, PS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox\n\n Even the most tenacious player will feel like giving up at some point while trapped in Pharloom, a decaying realm full of desperate little bugs that was once a gleaming religious capital. Here lie some truly wretched places: former farms now fetid swamps, dank underground caverns overgrown with moss and misery, grand halls now dust-covered and reverberating with foreboding. And of course there are the guardians of these places, from mind-rotted beast-tamers to corrupted pilgrims and bug-automatons, silk-poisoned creatures and the realm’s former rulers, who stand in the way of your progress. Silksong’s most forbidding foes take hours to overcome. Its worst places will entrap you in despair. But it is worth it, because of the awe-inspiring moments that you will experience along the way: the hard-won victories, those first steps into previously locked-off realms, the secret revelations that seem so personal it’s hard to believe that any of the game’s millions of other players could discover them the same way. An extraordinary game whose sometimes extreme difficulty is both a strength and a weakness.\n\nDogubomb/Raw Fury, PC, PS5, Xbox\n\n A young man inherits a mysterious mansion from his uncle: a sprawling pile whose layout changes every day. He needs only to find the secret 46th room, and the place is his for ever. The mansion turns out to be an education: on the personal history of the family that owned it, the mysterious forces that shaped it and the political climate of the wider world in which it is situated. But before you get anywhere near Blue Prince’s deeper mysteries, you must master its blueprints. Behind every door is a choice: do you draft a library? A hallway with several exits? A security room, a laboratory, a pool, a bedroom, a nursery, a drawing room? Each will have its own secrets to discover, a useful item or a key or a new piece of information that gets you ever closer to that elusive 46th room. And each might offer you a new path to the rest of the mansion, or locked doors that you haven’t the means to pass. Every day, with every new route that you carve through these rooms, every dead end you meet, your knowledge accumulates. By the time you do reach that final destination, you’ll have so many unanswered questions, you won’t be able to resist continuing. Blue Prince turns out to be an almost bottomless mystery, leaving you with pads full of notes, theories, numbers and names, lines from books that you want to remember and drawings of strange mechanisms. It is among the best puzzle games ever made: atmospheric and understated and unforgettably clever; still somehow able to show you something new even after tens of hours of patient exploration.",

There was also the relative newcomer Dan Da Dan, which saw its second theatrical adaptation with Evil Eye.\n\nThe rankings also show a shift away from single launch moments toward steady output. According to Fandom's study, Roblox's top placement reflects how fans now prefer platforms with constant updates and community-created content. Smaller Roblox games, such as Dandy’s World and Grow a Garden, ranked higher than well-established worlds like Minecraft and Disney by focusing on frequent events and active, niche communities.\n\nThe same pattern appeared elsewhere with franchises such as Dungeons and Dragons and Cookie Run Kingdom performed well by releasing content regularly, showing that consistency mattered more than occasional peaks in attention.",

    "fullText": "SCOR, the interactive sports ecosystem, launched Fun.SCOR.io – a mobile and Web ecosystem.\n\nThe gaming firm has launched its much-awaited unified ecosystem across two chains for improved accessibility.\n\nThe native token SCOR is now live on OKX, Gate, and Bybit.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of blockchain gaming, SCOR is making some notable moves that could shake up the landscape for sports fans and crypto enthusiasts alike.\n\nThey’ve just rolled out Fun.SCOR.io, a new web and mobile platform that serves as a one-stop shop for their extensive ecosystem of sports-themed mini-games.\n\nThe on-chain sports giant debuts its central web and mobile platform, empowering its massive player base with true wallet freedom via a simultaneous deployment on two major blockchains. The native token, SCOR, is now available on Bybit, OKX, and Gate.\n\nWith over 2 million active users already on board, it’s building on existing integrations in messaging apps and now providing players with a dedicated space to participate in tournaments, collect athlete characters, and prepare for PvP battles in the future.\n\nThe new web and mobile platform enables fans to play a variety of minigames with a pro sports theme, collect on-chain professional athlete characters, compete in tournaments, and soon participate in skill-based PvP challenges.\n\nTom Mizzone, Founder/CEO of Sweet, the developer of the SCOR ecosystem, said;\n\n“With the launch of Fun.SCOR.io, we are effectively opening the stadium doors to the broader Web3 world. A platform this size requires robust infrastructure, that is why we are going multichain on day one. By deploying on both Base and Mantle, we are ensuring our 2 million users enjoy a seamless, low-cost experience with true asset portability, regardless of which wallet or network they prefer.”\n\nThe real game-changer here is SCOR’s move to go multichain from day one, rolling out simultaneously on Base and Mantle.\n\nBase, the Ethereum Layer 2 from Coinbase, offers extremely low fees and lightning-fast transactions, making it ideal for high-volume trading. Mantle, with its modular design, adds another layer of scalability and efficiency.\n\nThe Fun.SCOR.io ecosystem launch provides gamers with a plethora of options, including the ability to connect any self-custody wallet on either chain. Thanks to the SCOR-ID system, gamers’ progress and assets flow seamlessly across both chains.\n\nFun.SCOR.io is now live, serving as the central hub destination for the ecosystem’s skill-based sports gaming.\n\nUsers can connect via their preferred self-custody wallets on either Base or Mantle, enjoying the specific benefits of each network.\n\nSCOR’s multi-chain play feels like a practical evolution toward more open and user-friendly Web3 sports experiences.\n\nWith such a strong user base already engaged, it could push the whole sector away from single-chain limitations and toward something truly interconnected. Exciting times are ahead for sports fans who are dipping into blockchain.\n\nThe post SCOR Launches Fun.SCOR.io as 2M-User Sports Ecosystem Goes Multichain on Base and Mantle appeared first on ccn.com.",

    "fullText": "With ​a blend of retro-futurism, moral ambiguity and monster-filled wastelands, Fallout became an unlikely prestige television favourite. Now there is something a bigger, stranger and funnier journey ahead\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nThe Fallout TV series returns to Prime Video today, and it’s fair to say that everyone was pleasantly surprised by how good the first season was. By portraying Fallout’s retro-futuristic, post-apocalyptic US through three different characters, it managed to capture different aspects of the game player’s experience, too. There was vault-dweller Lucy, trying to do the right thing and finding that the wasteland made that very difficult; Max, the Brotherhood of Steel rookie, who starts to question his cult’s authority and causes a lot of havoc in robotic power armour; and the Ghoul, Walton Goggins’s breakout character, who has long since lost any sense of morality out in the irradiated wilderness.\n\nThe show’s first season ended with a revelation about who helped cause the nuclear war that trapped a group of people in underground vaults for a couple of centuries. It also left plenty of questions open for the second season – and, this time, expectations are higher. Even being “not terrible” was a win for a video game adaptation until quite recently. How are the Fallout TV show’s creators feeling now that the first season has been a success?\n\n“We’ll take ‘not terrible’ – let’s get that on a poster,” says Jonah Nolan, the director who co-created the series with Geneva Robertson-Dworet. I’m speaking to them alongside Bethesda’s Todd Howard, director of the most recent Fallout video games. I last met with Nolan and Howard in 2024, before the first season premiered. Howard had been holding out a long time to make a Fallout adaptation, waiting for someone who seemed to really understand the series. Nolan, a lifelong player, was that person. Howard was poised with a red pen when he received the first script, but was relieved to find it was “fabulous”.\n\n“Going into the first season everyone’s like, ‘Just get it right’,” says Howard. “We’re over the moon with the reception to the show, so this time people are coming in with more excitement and different expectations.”\n\nThe second season is set in New Vegas, the site of 2010’s Fallout: New Vegas, which had the best writing and characters of any game in the series, even if it was a bit broken. The post-nuclear Strip was a kind of decaying criminal paradise full of warring factions and down-and-out inhabitants having as good a time as they can, given the bleak circumstances. It was shot in the real-world Nevada desert, and all over California. “It’s more of a desert vibe, a Mohave vibe, that’s so essential to that game,” says Nolan. “That dusty, blasted-out Route 66 vibe of the game is so much fun to bring into the show.”\n\nIn the show, a long time has passed since the events of the New Vegas game by the time Lucy and the Ghoul arrive in the city, but Howard says that it does reference the player’s journey. “When you’re doing a location that gamers know so well … honouring everyone’s journey through that game was a trick,” he says. “Time has moved on. What is New Vegas like now?… if you’re a fan of that game there’s so much to love in season two, visually and also with the factions and what’s going on with them.”\n\nThe Fallout TV series has a tactile feel – its creators ensured real props and sets were built, echoing the cobbled-together nature of the settlements in the games, where everyone is building stuff out of trash and every town is shoved together from whatever anyone can find. “As a sci-fi fan, so many shows I watch, I’m aware that they’re all standing in front of a blue screen,” says Robertson-Dworet. “The whole point of an adaptation, especially of a video game, is to feel like it’s real … of course, we still augment with VFX but, wherever possible, actors are actually standing in front of locations I loved seeing in the game.”\n\nIn fact, pretty much everything you see on-screen is real, even the infamously terrifying irradiated monsters, the Deathclaws. They were scary even as blobs of pixels in the original 90s Fallout games. In the show, they’re puppets, and apparently pretty frightening up close. “It was the closest look I’d ever gotten at a Deathclaw. In Fallout 4, whenever I saw one, it would instantly kill me,” laughs Nolan. “It was quite peculiar being able to stand there and stare at it.”\n\n“Even the radscorpion puppet was amazingly scary,” adds Robertson-Dworet. “It was so big – the mama scorp, that is. The little ones were fine, they were like overgrown lobsters, but it was genuinely very scary when the puppeteer was charging the big one at me.”\n\nThe Fallout series works because it’s made by talented film-makers who are also players and with the help of the people who created the actual games. Howard is replaying Red Dead Redemption 2 at the moment and resuming a long-dormant obsession with EA’s college (American) football games; Nolan has spent the summer playing Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with his entire family; Robertson-Dworet is still working on scripts for the show, so she’s playing a lot of New Vegas (as is her husband).\n\n(Not everyone involved with the show is a gamer, though. In an interview with PC Gamer, Goggins the Ghoul said he had never played a Fallout game and had no intention of doing so. “No, I haven’t sat down to play the games. And I won’t. I won’t,” he said. “I won’t play the games. I’m not interested.” It’s OK, Walton, nobody is judging your gamer cred.)\n\nThe second season is coming out weekly rather than in one binge-able batch of episodes, so we will all be experiencing it differently from last season – including Howard, Nolan and Robertson-Dworet, who will now be looking out for people’s reactions every week.\n\n“It has more depth, it’s bigger, it’s funnier, it has a lot of surprises,” says Howard. “I’m looking forward to seeing what people think.”\n\nSwedish developer Simogo made some of the most interesting iPhone and iPad games of the 2010s, from the unforgettable puzzle game Device 6 to the eerie Year Walk. It recently released a compilation of these games, an attempt to preserve them before they are either removed from mobile storefronts or become unplayable thanks to iOS updates.\n\nAvailable on: Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 5-plus hours\n\nThe Game awards took place last week, a typically brisk affair at just under four hours. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won nine awards, including Game of the Year, kicking off a predictable online discussion about whether it is even that good. See the full list of winners here, a rundown of the most notable trailers and announcements here, and look out for the Guardian’s games of the year list on Friday.\n\nLara Croft is back for two new Tomb Raider games, starring the self-assured version of the tank-topped action heroine from the 1990s. The first game, Catalyst, is a new adventure set in northern India, out 2027; next year we’ll see Legacy of Atlantis, a ground-up remake of the very first Tomb Raider game.\n\nGood news for our young and sprightly readers: the Quickshot II, the legendary joystick beloved of many Amiga and C64 players, is making a comeback in January. It will work with anything with a USB slot, including all the recent modern reissues of Amiga, Commodore and Spectrum home computers.\n\n‘Our industry has been strip-mined’: video game workers protest at the Game awards\n\nRockstar co-founder Dan Houser on life after Grand Theft Auto\n\nBluey’s Quest for the Gold Pen: after some misfires, we finally have the first good Bluey video game\n\n‘If we build it, they will come’: Skövde, the tiny town powering up Sweden’s video game boom\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 – how a tiny studio developed the Belle Époque-set gaming blockbuster\n\nFallout season two – this post-apocalyptic thriller is absolutely hilarious | ★★★★☆\n\nOmniscient Reader: The Prophecy – life gets gamified in one-note Korean sci-fi | ★★☆☆☆\n\n“We love games we can play as a pair, whether they are designed as single-player (eg Blue Prince) or multiplayer (eg For the King, Gloomhaven, Sunderfolk). Puzzle games and turn-based games seem to work particularly well. Do you have any suggestions for something to try next?”\n\nWe’ve answered a few variations of this question before, but as it’s Christmas, I suspect that plenty of people will be looking for something to play while cosied up on the sofa – so here are some fresh recommendations for local multiplayer and pad-passing games. If you like a challenge, Absolum is a punishing but stylish fusion of beat-em-up and adventure game. Powerwash Simulator 2 lets you soothingly scrub down filthy objects together. For nominally single-player games, narrative games often make good pad-passers; Lost Records: Bloom and Rage and Dispatch are two of the year’s best. You might want to try trading attempts at Baby Steps, the year’s most infuriating game. And my partner enjoyed taking turns at Ball x Pit, the fiendishly compelling game where you defeat demonic hordes with magic ping-pong balls.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

    "fullText": "If I could use only one word to encapsulate Terminator 2D: No Fate, it would be \"authentic\": Both in the way it faithfully recreates James Cameron's seminal 1991 action movie and its nostalgic love affair with the 16-bit era of video games. Movie tie-ins were mostly awful in the early '90s, but I could easily see myself renting No Fate from my local Blockbuster and blasting through its sidescrolling run-'n'-gun action in between episodes of Dragon Ball Z and WWF Smackdown.\n\nIt's a brief experience, with the credits arriving in less time than it takes to watch the entirety of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, but No Fate is a licensed video game done right, created with palpable reverence for both its source material and the era of video games it emulates.\n\nNo Fate's story mode opens with a shot of rolling tarmac, as the painted yellow lines in the middle of the road scroll past at regular intervals. If you're a fan of Terminator 2, this shot will be a familiar sight, albeit one now rendered in gorgeous pixel art, with chiptune music and Sarah Connor's monologue presented as blocks of text rather than through Linda Hamilton's hushed tones. It's also in a different place--on a desert road instead of a Los Angeles freeway--and opens the game as opposed to bookending the movie.\n\nWhere it once wrapped up two hours of pure movie-making excellence with a hopeful glimpse of an undetermined and hopefully better future, No Fate warns of the horrors to come--of Judgment Day and the rise of the machines. It's a scene that wonderfully captures the vibe of Terminator 2 while also putting developer Bitmap Bureau's own spin on things, remaining authentic and faithful to the source material with an additional sprinkling of unique flavor on top.\n\nThis is a common theme throughout No Fate's story mode. When it's not a beat-by-beat 16-bit recreation of one of the greatest movies ever made, it's filling in the blanks and professing its love for '90s gaming, fluidly shifting gameplay styles to suit the adaptation's needs.\n\nTake the opening level as a prime example: In a new scene set shortly before the film's events, Sarah is teaching John Connor how to fight so he can become the soldier he may need to be in the future. This moment of atypical bonding is interrupted when a musclebound thug pays homage to Double Dragon by punching John in the gut and flinging him over his shoulder before walking off. What follows is a side-scrolling action platformer with more than a few similarities to the console and early arcade games of the '90s.\n\nAs you move Sarah from left to right, mowing down bad guys by shooting vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, games like Metal Slug, Super Star Wars, and RoboCop Versus The Terminator come to mind. Movement is responsive, and human enemies go down in a couple of shots, making for some satisfyingly fast-paced action.\n\nAfter rescuing John, Sarah heads to a Cyberdyne research lab to destroy it, only to be shot, arrested, and sent to the Pescadero mental hospital: a moment mentioned briefly in the film but afforded more prominence here. With Sarah's plans to prevent Judgment Day foiled, No Fate takes inspiration from Terminator 2's explosive opening scene, putting you in control of a grizzled John Connor as he leads the resistance in the Future War of 2029.\n\nThese levels resemble Konami's Contra series more than anything, right down to a familiar defensive wall boss fight and temporary weapon pickups that grant homing plasma rounds and split shot fire. Bitmap Bureau introduces a few modern wrinkles as well, such as the ability to take cover and an evasive roll for avoiding enemy fire, though the game gets more interesting once you're done destroying the various T-800s, Centurions, and Hunter-Killers of Los Angeles' future.\n\nOnce John reaches the time-travel device and sends a T-800 back to 1995, No Fate transitions to Arnold Schwarzenegger's first appearance in Terminator 2 as he emerges in the parking lot of The Corral biker bar--though it's worth noting that Arnie's likeness isn't included, despite Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, and Robert Patrick all starring. From here, the game begins taking scenes from the film and transforming them into playable levels, nailing every memorable moment while adapting gameplay styles to fit each scene.\n\nAfter a naked Arnie asks for a biker's clothes, boots, and motorcycle, No Fate momentarily turns into a beat-em-up as you clobber The Corral's patrons, throwing one onto a steaming hot grill and culminating in a boss fight set to George Thorogood's \"Bad to the Bone.\"\n\nLater on, the iconic motorcycle/truck pursuit through Los Angeles' flood-control channel draws inspiration from Battletoads' Turbo Tunnel and the bike level from Contra 3: The Alien Wars, challenging you to avoid static hazards while keeping Robert Patrick's T-1000 at bay--complete with one-handed shotgun reloads that are still the coolest. The freeway chase from later on in the film functions similarly but differs slightly, as you alternate between weaving in and out of traffic and taking control of Sarah as she fires upon the pursuing T-1000-manned helicopter.\n\nSarah's escape from the Pescadero Hospital is another highlight, briefly turning No Fate into a stealth game. With the T-1000 hot on your tail, passing through metal bars and melting into the floor, there's a sudden injection of tension since you have no way of fighting back. Instead, you need to duck into doorways and various alcoves to avoid the T-1000 and bide your time before taking out the hospital's abusive orderlies. There isn't an instant fail state if you alert any of the human enemies; it's just easier to take them out with a swift blow to the back of the head, so being spotted is never frustrating.\n\nThis level fits the era, too, even if you might not necessarily think of stealth mechanics when recalling 16-bit games. 1990's Bonanza Bros was the primary inspiration behind No Fate's stealth mechanics, but games like Rolling Thunder and Elevator Action Returns were also influential, showcasing the depth of Bitmap Bureau's love for the era.\n\nWhile your first venture through No Fate's story mode covers the rest of Terminator 2, from blowing up Cyberdyne HQ to fighting off the T-1000 in the steel mill finale, subsequent playthroughs allow you to change the future. After all, the game's title comes from the famous line \"there's no fate but what we make for ourselves.\" The future isn't predetermined, and so the game leans into this ethos, letting you make a couple of different choices to alter events and unlock three alternative endings.\n\nIn practice, however, this sounds more interesting than it actually is. The branching paths introduce a few new levels, including an escape from a police station that feels like an ode to the original 1984 Terminator, but the other endings are brief and, much like the ending in the film's extended cut, can't compare to the original.\n\nAlong with a ranking system, global leaderboards, multiple difficulty settings, and other unlockable modes, seeking out the other three endings adds some replayability to what is otherwise a remarkably short game. My first playthrough took 42 minutes, with that number decreasing with each subsequent completion. The other modes include a Boss Rush, where you try to defeat all of the game's bosses as quickly as possible, and an Infinite mode that tasks you with walking down an endless corridor, killing as many enemies as you can to achieve the highest score. If you're interested in leaderboards, you might get some longevity out of these modes, but otherwise, you'll likely play each of them once just to unlock the rest of the modes.\n\nArcade mode adds an extra challenge by removing continues, while Mother of the Future condenses the story mode to only Sarah Connor's levels, with completion unlocking the hardest difficulty setting. The options are nice, but still just offer different ways to replay the same game. No Fate's brevity is fitting for a time period where most games had to be finished in a single sitting, but if you have no intention of elongating the experience by unlocking every mode, it's unlikely you'll be completely fulfilled.\n\nThose with few qualms about duration will find a game made with evident love and affection for both the source material and the moment in time it was released. Its music is excellent--with perhaps the best rendition of the Terminator 2 theme to date--aiding the game's visuals in its mission to transport you back to a time when blowing into cartridges and inserting coins were the norm. Whether it's the T-1000's haunting fluidity of movement, Sarah Connor's one-armed reloading of a pump action shotgun, or the way the T-800 clambers onto the hood of a semi-truck to unload an entire magazine into its windshield, Terminator 2D: No Fate recreates the movie's most memorable moments with pitch-perfect authenticity. It's a shame it ends far too soon, but this is still the definitive Terminator 2 video game.",
