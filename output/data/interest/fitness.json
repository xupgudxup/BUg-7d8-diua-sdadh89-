    "title": "The Biggest Fitness Trends at CES 2026 (and What I Think About Them)",
    "description": "Exoskeletons, rings, and smart bands were popular, but a lot of big name companies seem to be running out of ideas.",
    "fullText": "I just got back from CES 2026, and you can see my real-time reports on some of the best and weirdest things I saw in our CES 2026 live blog. I tried on six(!) different exoskeletons, perked up my ears whenever I heard about a new smart strap, and looked in vain for new models of familiar fitness tech like watches. Here are the biggest trends I noticed and some notes on what was conspicuously missing. I've included prices where possible; anything without a price is likely too far from market to have one yet.\n\nThis is a continuation of a trend that really got going in 2025. Whoop is no longer the only player in the screenless fitness strap space. Last year we saw straps from Amazfit ($99) and Polar ($199), plus a sleep band from Garmin ($169). At CES I learned about two more.\n\nThe Luna Band is likely to be the next one to market—the company’s reps said to expect it to ship sometime in the next month or two. (I plan to review it once units are available.) It will be $149, won't require a subscription, and it will use the same app as the Luna Ring, which I’m currently reviewing. Its maker, Noise, is new to the U.S. wearables market but is one of the leading smartwatch makers in India.\n\nBesides the new hardware, Noise also announced that the Luna app will soon have a system to take voice notes to give context to your health data. (This is coming to the app in the next few weeks.) For example, if you tell the app that you had a few glasses of wine, it will remember this when it sees your poor sleep the next morning, and it will adjust its recommendations accordingly—say, reminding you to hydrate, rather than telling you to take a nap.\n\nSpeediance also announced the Speediance Strap, although it doesn’t seem to be as close to market. No price has been announced, and the units at the show were clearly prototypes. The Strap will collect sleep and recovery data, without requiring a subscription to view it, although some more advanced metrics will require a premium subscription.\n\nOura has had competitors for years (and has taken up suing them to stop sales), but it seems like the number of smart rings out there is just exploding—though not all of them are fitness or health oriented. Besides Pebble’s Index 01 ($75), which is charmingly simple, there are plenty of rings that pack in more functions—NFC payments, AI voice processing, haptic alerts, and more. There are so many I can’t give a full list, but to name a few: there’s the Muse Ring One ($323), the Dreame Ring, and the Vocci AI ring.\n\nRingConn announced its third-generation ring, with blood pressure insights (I’m skeptical) and haptic alerts, including the ability to buzz for a smart alarm (I’m intrigued). This one isn’t on the market yet, and a rep at the booth asked me what price I thought it should go for. In the meantime, RingConn gave me a gen 2 ring to compare to Oura and others—watch for my review soon.\n\nThe companies that make smartwatches and fitness watches tend to be on their own release cycles, not necessarily tied to CES. Apple certainly wasn’t going to announce a new Apple Watch; Google and Fitbit didn’t show up, either. Amazfit had a new watch, the Active Max ($169) in its lineup, but it was more of a refinement to the product line than a new exciting announcement.\n\nThe only real exception I can think of is Pebble, but you’ve heard from me already on why it bucks the trend. I got to go hands-on with the Time 2 (announced last year) and the Round 2 (announced last week), which was so thin and sleek it made the Coros on my wrist feel like a big ol’ hunk of plastic. As a reminder, the Round 2 doesn’t have a heart rate monitor and Pebble is trying not to be a fitness watch brand. (I’m still looking forward to reviewing its watches anyway.)\n\nI think the main reason for the stagnation here is that watches already have everything they need to have for fitness and health tracking. There's not a lot of room left to innovate; either you give a device slightly better battery life (nice, but yawn) or you stick something else into it just to say you did—like a flashlight or a microphone. That's nothing against flashlights or microphones, which are both great in context, but we're hardly in game-changing territory anymore. Companies like Oura and Whoop are pivoting to services like blood tests that take the focus off their hardware. My colleague Stephen Johnson said it best: tech launches don't feel magical anymore, partly because we don't have many problems left that consumer tech can easily solve, and partly because every new advice adds a hassle to your life.\n\nAnd so Garmin’s main announcement this weekend was a nutrition tracking feature in its Connect+ subscription. I thought at least there was a good chance of a new watch from Garmin—nope. Garmin announced the Instinct 3 at last year’s CES, but no new hardware this year besides a camera system for truckers (I’m happy for them).\n\nA few other companies used the buzz around CES to announce non-hardware developments as well: Oura is finally shipping the charging case it promised last fall, and Ultrahuman announced a limited-time free tier of its blood testing service with 20+ markers. Its other tiers give you 50+ markers for $99, or a 100+ marker test followed by a 60+ marker follow-up test for $365. (Ultrahuman told me that the exact blood tests it's able to offer vary slightly by state, hence the vague numbers.)\n\nThere were, of course, plenty of mentions that “AI” is baked into this or that fitness app. But the companies mostly seemed to understand that while AI might help to create features their users want, users don’t buy devices for the AI. (See also: Dell executives commenting that its customers don’t seem to want AI, and that it has adjusted the marketing for its computers to de-emphasize it.)\n\nI heard at CES that apps are using AI to identify foods from photos (Garmin and Amazfit) or that AI is helping to find patterns in data (basically everybody). Merach did say it would let me try an AI-powered treadmill, but a rep apologetically told me the device wasn’t available in time to ship the prototype to CES.\n\nExoskeletons were the biggest new-to-me trend at CES. These are devices that you strap on to your body, and their motors give an added boost to what your muscles are doing. Several of the companies described them as being like an e-bike for walking.\n\nI gave myself a side quest of trying every exoskeleton that was available to demo. That ended up being a total of six: four that assisted you at the hip, one at the knee, and one at the ankle. One device made by Ascentiz ($1,299-$1,848) can be configured with combined hip and knee action, but the knee module wasn’t available for me to test.\n\nAll six devices really did give me a boost while walking (or climbing stairs—several of the companies wisely included a mini staircase in their booths to try out). But I have to wonder who the exoskeletons are really for. If you’re not a serious hiker, an exoskeleton might help you hike up a mountain and keep up with your friends. But I’d think that only a serious hiker would have $1,000+ to spend on hiking gear like an exoskeleton—and that they would probably prefer to train harder and spend the money on something else.\n\nIf I had to predict where this tech is going, I think the rental market makes the most sense. Imagine if you could borrow the Ascentiz for a scenic hike on vacation without having to train for months ahead of time, or strap on Dephy’s “powered footwear” ($4,500) to get you through a day at Disneyworld.",

    "fullText": "Our fitness expert clocked up his indoor miles to put the best exercise bikes, including simple spin machines and gym-quality models, to the test\n\nThe best treadmills for your home, tested\n\nCycling has the potential to benefit your health in myriad ways, whether it’s the mood-boosting properties of inhaling fresh air, the social element of riding with friends or the simple act of improving cardiovascular fitness with every pedal stroke.\n\nThe UK weather doesn’t always play ball, though, so for those who don’t want a dire forecast to result in a missed workout, indoor training replicates the exercise (if not the fresh air).\n\nThe best exercise bikes are not only fantastic for burning a few calories without donning all the outdoor gear, but they can also help you nail training goals if you’re a more serious rider. With many letting you connect your phone or laptop to make the most of online training tools, it’s never been easier or more enjoyable to work out from your home.\n\nI tested 12 exercise bikes, including the sort you might find in a commercial gym, along with more dedicated riding simulators and recumbent models for those who find it tricky to sit hunched forward for any length of time. The resulting list features those that I think performed best.\n\nWhile I’ve tried to appeal to a wide range of budgets, it’s difficult to recommend much under the £500 mark because the build quality of these cheaper models is often not worth the investment.\n\nBest exercise bike overall:\n\n Peloton Bike+\n\nBest budget exercise bike for beginners:\n\n Horizon 3.0SC indoor cycle\n\nBest compact exercise bike:\n\n Wattbike Proton\n\nBest gym-quality exercise bike: \n\n Technogym bike\n\nBest recumbent exercise bike:\n\n LifeFitness RS3 LifeCycle\n\nWhile I no longer compete in official cycling events, I still consider myself a keen cyclist, often heading out with friends on a gravel bike, even if those rides now end in a warm pub, rather than a timed finish line. But when the weather isn’t playing ball, I’ll get stuck into a home- or gym-based exercise bike session to keep fit and stay in shape for when cycling season comes back around again.\n\nHaving tested exercise equipment for numerous publications, I’m always one to get stuck in and test a product for as long as possible. With exercise bikes, this meant getting plenty of hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.\n\nExercise bikes are bulky items that typically require an element of setup or construction. To make testing so many of them viable, I either borrowed a pre-assembled machine for one or two weeks or tested the bikes in a dedicated boutique or workout space.\n\nDuring each test, I used any workout modes that were available, syncing a smartphone or laptop to take advantage of third-party software or online classes, if these were offered. The machines were judged on their build quality, features, ease of setup and storage (some companies offer premium white glove deliveries), as well as the overall adjustability or suitability for numerous members of the household.\n\nAfter slipping into a pair of fetching cycling shoes, I assessed noise levels with a smartphone-based decibel meter, and made more subjective assessments on the general ride feel, comfort and the overall quality of the workout experience.\n\nMany rivals have attempted to imitate Peloton, but few have managed to nail its overall experience. Above all, the brand is unmatched when it comes to live and on-demand classes, offering so many options – from a quick 15-minute spin class to hardcore sportive training, and all led by motivating instructors and accompanied by thumping soundtracks.\n\nThe Bike+ is the premium one of the brand’s two exercise bikes and has a 23.8in (huge!) high-definition display, which can be rotated for workouts that involve movements off the machine. There’s also an automatic resistance knob that adjusts to match the levels recommended by instructors during classes.\n\nIt’s expensive, with a £45-a-month “all access” membership fee on top, but for engaging, interactive workouts pitched at a wide range of users, nothing else comes close.\n\nWhy we love it\nAlthough the Bike+ isn’t as aesthetically pleasing as some of its rivals, it’s comfortable, easy to adjust and not too imposing in any room. It also has wheels, so it is relatively easy to tip on its end and move around.\n\nThe touchscreen on the Bike+ is of excellent quality and the sound from its built-in speakers is impressive, but it’s the array of classes that makes Peloton so alluring. Unlike many rivals, which can feel prescribed, mundane and overly technical, Peloton somehow makes a gruelling 45-minute spin session feel enjoyable.\n\nThe weighted flywheel and belt-drive system are quiet enough to not disturb others in the household, although hardcore road cyclists will probably balk at the Bike+ for its lack of cycling realism and the bouncy, frenetic spin-class nature of many of its workouts.\n\nIt doesn’t play nicely with third-party cycling apps – such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad – either, so, if that’s important to you, look at the Wattbike Proton below instead.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t feel as realistic as some rivals, and there’s a monthly fee to access the classes and features\n\nDimensions: 56 x 137 x 152cm (WLH) \nWeight: 65kg \nDrivetrain: belt-drive with magnetic, digital resistance adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5, ANT+, wifi (2.4GHz and 5GHz)\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg \nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, 23.8in rotating HD touchscreen with Peloton classes, Netflix, Disney+ and more\n\nAt the time of writing, the Horizon 3.0SC Indoor Cycle cost £569.99, making it one of the cheapest exercise bikes I tested. But it certainly doesn’t feel cheap or any less capable than many of the other exercise bikes I poured sweat upon.\n\nThe 3.0SC has an ultra-smooth, front-mounted flywheel that uses electronically adjustable magnetic resistance to provide 32 effort levels. All of this is controlled via a funky and futuristic-looking digital dial that responds quickly to inputs – great for jumping out of the saddle during high-intensity efforts.\n\nAlthough this is predominantly designed for use in spin classes, its ergonomically cushioned seat and easy-adjust handlebars make it a comfortable spot to pedal away the hours. Oh, and it’s whisper-quiet too, registering just 32dB during my testing.\n\nIt may not be the sort of thing I’d use to train for an upcoming cycling sportive, but it’s a well-priced tool for hitting daily fitness goals.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe 3.0SC looks great. It even blasts out eight vibrant colours from its flywheel, depending on the RPM and amount of effort you are putting in, adding a bit of Tron-like sci-fi to any room.\n\nAnd aside from its relatively compact proportions and lightweight build, the bike is also well connected, playing nicely with Zwift, Kinomap and other third-party fitness apps. There are more realistic-feeling bikes out there, but if you swap out the pedals for a dedicated clipless system, it’s a fairly convincing road bike. Space between the cranks, for example, is as narrow as possible, making it ride like a genuine road machine.\n\nIf you’re looking for on-demand fitness classes, you can find these via Horizon’s free atZone workout app. Pair your phone or tablet with the bike, mount it to the secure plastic holder at the front of the bars, and you’re good to go. For a free service, there’s an impressive amount of content, and it’ll track your progress over time.\n\nIt’s a shame that … there isn’t an integrated display, meaning you’ll have to bring a tablet or smartphone for any instructor-led workouts.\n\nDimensions: 52 x 107 x 120cm (WLH) \nWeight: 36kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with ECB (eddy current) magnetic, electronic resistance (32 levels)\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5 (FTMS compatible for app integration) \nFolding: no (but features transport wheels)\nNoise level: about 32dB\nMaximum user weight: 100kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder and syncs with training apps\n\nWattbike is probably best known for its original red, white and black Air bike machines, which can be found in gyms and health clubs up and down the country. The company has since ventured into home-workout territory, and the Proton sits somewhere in the middle of its range, offering a lightweight, compact footprint and support for popular third-party training apps, including Zwift and TrainingPeaks.\n\nRacy looks and confusing workout programmes may risk putting off more casual users, but the Proton is designed to appeal to all of the family – comfortably adjusting for those between 4ft 6in and 6ft 6in tall. It’s not as quiet as some of its rivals, but the Proton feels realistic to ride and even has an auto-adjusting ergometer mode (ERG), so it can simulate gradients and gear changes without you having to lift a finger.\n\nWhy we love it\nWattbike has done an admirable job in retaining a realistic bike feel on such a lightweight and compact machine, with a fully adjustable seat post, saddle and handlebars that make it easy to set up to your requirements. I was able to quickly swap the standard toe-cage pedals for some Shimano clipless ones, which improved my performance and gave me greater control over pedal stroke. Most exercise bikes will allow you to swap the pedals, which takes about five minutes if you have the correct spanner or hex key. Adding cleats and pedals allows you to don a dedicated cycling shoe, which provides better power transfer between the legs and pedals compared with basic adjustable toe cages.\n\nWattbike’s background in working with pro athletes is evident from the Wattbike Hub app, which offers real-time feedback on pedal stroke and efficiency, among other nerdy data fields. The app has been tweaked to appeal to the more casual fitness fanatic, but it’s far from friendly to beginners, and you won’t find the same interactivity you would with a Peloton class. It’s more a case of following graphs and on-screen warnings about form than watching live demos from a bubbly personal trainer.\n\nHowever, there are still plenty of workouts aimed at improving overall health rather than targeting highly trained athletes. And, if you like, you can always mount your iPad in the dedicated holder and binge television or complete a virtual workout session of your choice: the Proton’s Bluetooth FTMS technology means it will work with most third-party apps, such as Zwift, TrainerRoad and Rouvy.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the app isn’t slicker and with more to entice and retain a novice.\n\nDimensions: 57 x 102 x 127cm (WLH)\nWeight: 48kg\nDrivetrain: chain drive with electromagnetic resistance\nMaximum power output: 1,800W\nSimulated grade: up to +25% incline\nConnectivity: ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration)\nFolding: no; includes front transport wheels for ease of movement\nNoise level: about 40dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder\n\nTechnogym has been steadily raising the bar when it comes to smart fitness equipment, with a growing line of connected kit that aims to bring the personal trainer experience to your own home.\n\nClearly designed to take on the likes of Peloton, the Technogym Bike is a stylish machine with a 22in high-definition touchscreen that allows access to a raft of Technogym’s live and on-demand content.\n\nIts compact, svelte frame looks and feels as if it’s aimed at more serious cyclists than Peloton’s offering, and the ride experience is smoother and slightly more natural than its rival. There’s plenty of adjustability for different-size riders, while the included double-sided pedals allow for use with trainers or SPD cycling shoes (a clipless shoe system).\n\nThe built-in screen is crisp and easy to navigate, granting access to entertainment apps, including YouTube and Netflix. It rotates to allow for off-bike sessions, too. However, it’s among the most expensive models I tested, and there’s a further membership fee, starting at £8.99 a month. Ouch.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe riding experience is comfortable without straying too far from a realistic simulation, while the powerful flywheel offers punishing levels of resistance. Technogym has live classes, as with Peloton, but it also appeals to the more hardcore athlete with dedicated training programmes geared towards those with ambitions of tackling the Col de Turini.\n\nIf you’re seeking the best in terms of design and build quality – and your bank balance permits the luxury – you’ll be happy with this bike. It’s a handsome, well-built machine that straddles the line between a dedicated cycling trainer and a spin bike well.\n\nIt also works with most third-party training apps and syncs up neatly with Apple Fitness and Apple Watch via a quick-tap NFC panel. For those totally dedicated to Lycra, Technogym offers an even more expensive Ride model, which feels built to compete with Wattbike and Wahoo’s most serious offerings.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it costs so much, and then Technogym charges yet more for a monthly membership.\n\nDimensions: 59 x 121 x 138cm (WLH)\nWeight: 67kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with magnetic resistance (20 levels)\nSimulated grade: not specified\nConnectivity: supports streaming via external device (eg Chromecast, Fire TV Stick); Apple Watch pairing; Technogym Live integration and third-party apps\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 160kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, rotating display with ability to stream apps (TV shows, movies, games, etc) via smartphone, tablet or laptop\n\nRecumbent bikes are great for those who experience back pain, struggle with past injuries or simply find it daunting or uncomfortable to be perched atop a traditional exercise bike for any length of time. You can achieve the same, low-impact cardio workout while enjoying a more relaxed seating position that takes the pressure off the lower back, leg joints and neck.\n\nLifeFitness is a reputable brand that supplies commercial gym equipment and kit more suited for use at home, with the RS3 sitting between the two. For the money, you get a comfortable, ergonomically fitted seat with backrest, 20 levels of resistance and a step-through design that makes it easy to get on and off. There’s also plenty of adjustment in the seat to get the perfect workout position.\n\nAlthough larger than many more traditional exercise bikes, it can be lifted and moved because of its transport wheels.\n\nWhy we love it\nMore seasoned riders will probably find a recumbent bike a little too laidback, since it’s difficult to transfer maximum power through the cranks from the more relaxed seating position. That said, it’s not really designed for smashing PBs – it’s best placed for longer, low-intensity steady-state cardio sessions.\n\nIt links to Rouvy, Zwift and a bunch of other third-party fitness apps, but the digital offering is otherwise basic, with a handful of built-in and customisable workouts direct from the console. Users can also pair an Apple or Samsung Galaxy Watch for heart-rate tracking and more.\n\nSome recumbent bikes can feel decidedly budget, but that’s not the case here. With excellent build quality and a smooth and quiet ride experience, the RS3 is a comfortable place to work up a sweat without the associated aches and pains.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the Track Connect 2.0 Console is fiddly to use, and there’s no built-in multimedia.\n\nDimensions: 68 x 164 x 131cm (WLH)\nWeight: 69.8kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive magnetic resistance, manual adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth FTMS and NFC for syncing with apps, wireless HR receiver\nFolding: no\nNoise level: under 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 181kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no, 7in LCD display with Track Connect Console allowing external tablet/smartphone streaming and app integration\n\nIf you’re mad for virtual cycling apps such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad, or simply want to replicate that road cycling feel at home, Wahoo’s Kickr Shift is among the best indoor training tools for enthusiasts.\n\nThe saddle, stem height and reach can all easily be adjusted on the fly, and users can even select their desired crank length. Heck, the bike even simulates several electronically assisted gearing group sets from Shimano and Campagnolo, mimicking the way the cogs feel when shifting under load.\n\nIt’s a wonderfully quiet, smooth and powerful machine that works perfectly with dedicated cycling training apps. For those who like to reach for the chamois cream at the weekend, this is the perfect indoor companion.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the Wattbike Proton feels like a slightly more rounded machine for all the family.\n\nDimensions: 78 x 140 x 110cm (WLH); weight: 36kg; drivetrain: belt drive with electromagnetic resistance; maximum power output: 2,200W; simulated grade: +20% incline, -15% decline; connectivity: ANT+, ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth, wifi, Direct Connect; folding: no; noise level: under 30dB; maximum user weight: 113kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen; requires external device for app/display\n\nBest for: a studio spin bike feel at home\n\nAnother Peloton Bike+ rival, NordicTrack’s indoor trainer is an excellent spinning machine for a smooth yet powerful ride, with a solid dose of realistic-feeling resistance that will feel tough even for seasoned cyclists. It also comes with a whopping 24in touchscreen for immersive online sessions.\n\nGranted, the iFit virtual training environment doesn’t quite compete with the Hollywood sheen of a Peloton class, but it gets mightily close, and the physical bike feels accomplished and more modern than Peloton’s slightly frumpy-looking machine.\n\nIts 20% incline to -10% simulated decline means it also doubles up as an excellent and quite realistic road or mountain biking training tool, with interactive videos that allow you to virtually cycle around some of the most beautiful places on Earth.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … iFit just isn’t up to Peloton’s offering, and the multimedia setup isn’t quite as slick.\n\nDimensions: 55 x 143 x 159cm (WLH); weight: 81kg; drivetrain: silent magnetic resistance, 24 digital levels; simulated grade: +20% incline/-10% decline; connectivity: Bluetooth (headphone & HR monitor), wifi (for iFit), USB-C port, app integration via iFit (syncs with Strava, Garmin, Google Fit, Apple Health); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 24in pivoting HD touchscreen with built-in speakers, iFit streaming of workouts, classes, and entertainment apps\n\nBest for: a recumbent bike on a budget\n\nOffering a cheaper alternative to the LifeFitness recumbent above, Schwinn’s more basic model majors in comfort and adjustability but wraps it up in a slightly lighter and cheaper-feeling frame.\n\nThe 5.5in segmented LCD screen takes care of the basics, with several built-in workouts to get you going. And there’s always the option to pair a tablet or smartphone and make use of Zwift and other digital training apps.\n\nIt represents excellent value for money, but don’t expect the same sort of build quality as pricier rivals; the handle-mounted heart-rate monitor was hugely inaccurate during my testing, and there are some cheap plastic covers masking some of the fastening bolts. On that subject, don’t expect a white glove delivery service with something at this price.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s not quite as robust as rivals, and the built-in heart-rate monitor was way out during tests.\n\nDimensions: 69 x 163 x 113cm (WLH); weight: 37kg; drivetrain: belt-driven flywheel with 16 levels of manual magnetic resistance; simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration); wireless heart-rate compatibility (strap not included); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 136kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen for media; includes a 5.5in LCD console (for metrics and programmes) and a media shelf for tablets\n\nBest for: a gym-quality upright bike\n\nThis model treads the line between a serious studio bike, such as the Peloton Bike+ or NordicTrack X24, and something more relaxed. It has a comfy padded seat, oversized self-balancing pedals and a unique handlebar design that allows for multiple hand positions. Despite the upright positioning, the ride feel is realistic, and there are 30 levels of resistance to contend with.\n\nIt’s expensive, given that the XUR digital console isn’t as good as those from Technogym, Peloton and NordicTrack, but this is a solid, reliable and comfortable bit of kit from one of the biggest names in commercial gym equipment.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s an expensive bike with a less impressive digital offering than cheaper rivals.\n\nDimensions: 63 x 122 x 143cm (WLH); weight: 60kg; drivetrain: Exact Force induction brake (electronically adjustable resistance); simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: wifi (entertainment apps, software updates), Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration, HR monitor, headphones), HDMI port, USB (media and charging); folding: no, includes transport wheels; noise level: about 28dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 22in HD touchscreen with apps including Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, web browser, social media, plus tablet/HDMI mirroring\n\nExercise bikes vary wildly in price, with the cheapest models often taking the form of basic upright or spin bikes that focus purely on pedalling, and the most expensive offering large HD touchscreens, automatic resistance adjustments and fully integrated training platforms.\n\nBudget models typically start at £250-£400, but often lack the build quality and adjustability needed for long-term use. At the other end of the spectrum, premium connected bikes – such as those from Peloton, Technogym and NordicTrack – can set you back £2,000 or more, and often require monthly subscriptions on top for interactive classes.\n\nFor most riders, a budget of between £600 and £1,200 is a good place to start for solid build quality, smooth resistance and decent connectivity features without straying into commercial-gym territory.\n\nEven the most compact exercise bikes take up space, with the smallest options measuring about 55 x 120 x 130cm (WLH). While that’s less floor space than a treadmill or cross trainer, you’ll still need clearance around the bike for safe mounting and dismounting, as well as enough ceiling height to remain comfortable when standing on the pedals.\n\nRecumbent bikes, which offer a chair-like riding position, often require more floor space, while upright and indoor cycles are more compact. It might be tempting to look at folding exercise bikes, but they can often be flimsy and offer weak pedal resistance.\n\nThe most important thing is the resistance system: magnetic resistance is smoother, quieter and requires less maintenance than older friction-based systems found on traditional studio spin bikes. Belt-drive systems are also preferable to chain-driven units for their silent, low-maintenance operation.\n\nAdjustability is another key factor – a bike with multiple saddle and handlebar positions will ensure better ergonomics and comfort over long sessions, and it will also fit more members of the household.\n\nFor those who want to stay entertained, connected bikes with integrated screens and app compatibility (Zwift, Peloton, iFit, etc) can make training more engaging. Heart-rate monitoring and Bluetooth/ANT+ connectivity are also useful for tracking progress.\n\nFinally, noise levels are worth considering, especially if you live in a flat or plan to exercise when everyone else is sleeping. Modern magnetic systems are whisper-quiet, making them perfect for shared living spaces.\n\nLeon Poultney has been a consumer technology and automotive journalist for longer than he cares to divulge.

    "title": "The Best Apps for Tracking Any New Year's Resolution",
    "description": "Use one of these whether you want to spend more time in the gym or quality time with your family.",
    "fullText": "What kind of New Year’s resolution you make depends on your unique goals—which means you need a way to track your progress that is just as unique. If your resolution is to cut back on social media use and your friend’s is to run a faster mile, you won’t measure success the same way. Even if you swear 2026 is the year you spend less time on your phone (which I've sworn every year), tap into the power of handheld tech and use these apps to keep yourself on track.\n\nI like all the best general progress tracking apps, but when it comes to resolutions, you are looking at something time-bound and specific by its very nature, so you should try apps that are tailored more to what you're doing.\n\nPer Statista, the top New Year’s resolutions among people who have made one or several for 2026 are as follows:\n\nTo spend more time with family/friends (42%)\n\nTo improve job performance (24%)\n\nTo do more for the environment (24%)\n\nThis year's list was interesting to me when I compared it to last year's, where \"save more money\" led the way with a measly 21%. It was followed by eat healthier, exercise more, lose weight, spend time with family/friends, quit smoking, and spend less on living expenses. Obviously, health and fitness continue to rank high, but it's notable that this year's least-popular resolution—reduce job stress—outranked even last year's most popular. It seems, at least according to this source, that 2026 is the year for making resolutions. I'm fresh off a year of actually nailing all my resolutions for the first time ever and I'm looking forward to replicating my success. In addition to a few personal tricks, here are the apps I think you should use.\n\nIf you want to work out more, it will help you to see your progress with each trip to the gym (or at-home session, or whatever). For that, try Strong, an app that lets you input the exercises you do and creates graphs showing your gradual improvement in weight, sets, body fat percentage, and more. In the past, I've only recommended this one, and it's great on its own, as it includes instructions on how to do a variety of exercises, which is nice if you aren’t really a fitness person (yet) and feeling nervous about trying new moves in front of other people keeps you away from the gym. The free version will save unlimited workouts, but you can only add three custom routines. For everything else, it’s $4.99 per month or $29.99 per year. For my full review, read more here.\n\nThis year, I have come around to recommending something else: The Peloton app, which I review here (but talk about here and here and here...). I can confidently say that for me, 2025 was the year of Peloton because I got so into working out on my Bike, using the brand's other class offerings, and even tracking my non-Peloton workouts through the app that I'm now on a 290-day in-app streak. And that's important, especially when we're talking about resolutions, because not only does this show you that all-important daily (or weekly or monthly) streak, but it offers so much variety, which will keep you going back.\n\nBefore, I used to recommend MyFitnessPal, which I used pretty consistently from sophomore year of college well into my 30s, but this year, I found (and reviewed) Lifesum, which changed the game for me. With its brighter colors, simpler interface, and updating \"life scores,\" it's an all-around more positive experience than using MFP—plus you don't have to pay for an upgrade to access nutrient tracking. It just does all that with the regular subscription, which costs $99.99 per year, $29.99 every three months, or $7.49 per month. It has a helpful series of widgets you can put anywhere on your phone, so you're always reminded to stick with it, and it's never shame-y, which I think is crucial for actually sticking with a healthier eating plan. It even suggests meals and foods you should consider based on how often you do (well, don't) eat them and what nutrients you might be lacking.\n\nMy favorite part is that it's so easy to use that I don't skip it, even on my laziest day. Instead of manually inputting every ingredient into the tracker, I can describe or even photograph my meal and let its AI do the work of figuring out approximately how many calories and grams of protein are in it. It's not perfect, of course, but I appreciate that, too; when I've gotten too gung-ho about tracking every morsel and getting every gram accounted for, I've counterbalanced a little too hard and lost all motivation, which kept me swinging back and forth between obsession and complete disinterest. Lifesum turns tracking into a less stressful, more positive experience you can actually stick with.\n\nIf you want to spend more time with your loved ones, try Cozi, a simple organizer that gives you a clear visual representation of your whole family’s schedule. Not only can you see when everyone is free, but you can see how much time you devote (or don’t devote) to the people with whom you share the app—which can motivate you to schedule more time together. It’s also free, which is a plus. Use the money you saved to pay for a nice night out with the people you set a resolution to spend more time with.\n\nI've mentioned this app as a meal planner in the past and think it works great for that, too. Use it to loop together a series of your resolutions, from eating better to spending more time with loved ones. While you're at it, brush up on how important stacking your resolutions and habits is for their longevity.\n\nNormally, I'd suggest FocusPomo as the best productivity-boosting app, but I love Flora, too—and this one has the dual function of helping the environment while improving your work, which means it addresses two of the most popular resolutions for 2026.\n\nAs I explained in my review earlier this year, Flora is a focus timer that locks down your phone while you work and, if you don't mess with your device and instead settle into deep work, you grow a virtual tree to display in your virtual forest. Right there, you can see the value prop if you're trying to track your progress: You can see all the trees you \"grow,\" which helps you visualize how you're doing. There's also an option to bet actual money on your ability to complete focus sessions, which works well for some people. (I am personally a big believer in forcing penalties on myself for failing to carry out a resolution, and though I don't usually bet money, I see the appeal of having financial stakes involved.)\n\nWondering what the app uses that money for? Great question! It's to fund the planting of real trees around the world. Your bet money or subscription fee (should you choose to pay between $2 and $12 per month, though it works fine in its free version) go toward paying for making the environment better, which is a win-win.\n\nHere's another one where I used to recommend a different app (in this case, One Sec) but now firmly recommend another that I've gotten more familiar with. To spend less time on social media (or any distracting apps, really) try Steppin, which I've reviewed and used for about a year now. Like other app-blocking apps, it locks down whichever applications you blacklist. Unlike those, you can earn time to access your blocklist by walking around in the real world. You can customize your settings so a certain number of steps unlocks a certain amount of minutes. I have mine set to 25 steps to earn a minute right now, which usually leaves me with 19 or so banked hours by the time my time resets at the end of the week. Since using Steppin, I've found that not only am I more willing to walk when I might otherwise Uber or take a bus, but I'm less interested in my blocked apps altogether. I just got used to not having unfettered access to them and found I don't need them as much as I thought I did. Who knew?\n\nSteppin also uses \"streaks\" so you can see your progress over time, plus shows a graph every day of your walking time vs. your time on the blocked apps. Both of these visual elements are useful in keeping track of where you're at. You break your streak by resetting your customizations or overriding a Steppin block when you don't have any minutes banked.",

    "fullText": "New year fitness goals? An elliptical will put you through your paces without the joint strain – our reviewer worked up a sweat testing the best\n\nA quick admission: I absolutely love an elliptical or cross trainer. They don’t always get the plaudits they deserve, but these low-impact cardio machines not only put less strain on your joints than a treadmill but also help you get an impressive, full-body workout. Whether you hop on one to warm up before an intense strength-training session or use it to gently burn calories while listening to your favourite podcast, the elliptical or cross trainer can strengthen muscle, reduce fat and improve cardiovascular fitness.\n\nHowever, there is a catch in that these machines vary wildly in their design – and therefore the emphasis they place on different muscles. Traditional elliptical machines eschew moving handles, instead opting for static poles, while cross trainers usually have dynamic handles that recruit the muscles in your back, shoulders and arms. On top of this, stride length, the shape of the handles and the positioning of the footplates can make a big difference to the type of workout you’ll have.\n\nThey can vary considerably in their weight and size, but are usually bulkier and more cumbersome than, say, a compact treadmill. Home gym aficionados beware: you’ll likely need a fair amount of room for one of these. If you have enough space, though, an elliptical or cross trainer can be a valuable addition to your home training setup.\n\nBest cross trainer overall:\nBowFlex Max Trainer M6\n\nBest value elliptical trainer:\nHorizon EX-59\n\nBest premium elliptical trainer:\nTechnogym elliptical\n\nBest compact cross trainer:\nJTX Strider-X8\n\nBest full-body trainer:\nSchwinn 590 Elliptical\n\nI’m a keen fitness fan who does gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes, as well as outdoor trail runs, cold-water surfing, and more. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for magazines, newspapers and websites. I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.\n\nI’m also a strong believer that you have to use new tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the correct environment. With exercise ellipticals and cross trainers, that meant getting hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.\n\nAs with any modern piece of fitness equipment, the only way to ascertain whether it’s any good is to don your gym kit and get stuck in. So, after researching the newest and most popular models on the market, I set about trialling all eight of them.\n\nMost of my testing was carried out in purpose-built boutiques or customer experience centres because accommodating so many examples of such gym equipment in my home is not easy. I did manage to squeeze a couple into my garage via short-term loans, though.\n\nDuring workouts, I used a smartphone-based decibel reader to get a sense of how loud they were in use, and I also tested any connected or online features, which often meant downloading relevant apps and trialling their workout content.\n\nWhere trainers had displays, I used these to log in to apps, such as Spotify and YouTube, and I also used any built-in Bluetooth speakers (if this function was offered). For each model, I made notes on ease of use, build quality and any features, as well as the overall size of the machine. If it had transport wheels, I used these to move the trainer around, simulating how easy it would be to manoeuvre in a domestic environment.\n\nBeing a petrolhead, I have to confess I was initially drawn to the BowFlex Max Trainer M6 because its LCD console reminds me of the dials found in a Mk3 Golf GTI. However, that’s not all that’s special about this cross trainer.\n\nBlending the motion of a stair-stepper with that of an elliptical machine, it has relatively compact dimensions and provides 16 resistance levels, enabling it to offer punishing, connected workouts.\n\nThose looking for powerful upper-body workouts or large, adjustable stride lengths may want to look elsewhere, but if you’re searching for a cross trainer that’ll have your glutes and quads burning in rapid time, look no further.\n\nWhy we love it\nMost elliptical machines offer a gentle, calorie-burning workout, but the Max Trainer M6 is among the few that have left me fully gassed, with slightly weak legs at the end of a workout.\n\nThis is because of its combination of elliptical and stepping motion, favouring shorter strides and an emphasis on downward pressure instead of the large strides of traditional machines. The handles are also intriguing as they offer a plethora of grip options, opening up the possibility of training multiple sections of the upper body (back, biceps, triceps and so on). But they’re fairly short, not offering a great range of motion to really work the upper body.\n\nThe machine instantly connects with the BowFlex Jrny app, which is the company’s answer to Peloton, offering video-based workouts to make the experience more interactive. You’ll need an internet-connected smartphone or tablet, but the sessions are good, if limited, providing guided workouts that span all manner of fitness goals.\n\nSmall(ish), quiet and relatively easy to move around, this is one of the few ellipticals that can be put away in the corner of a garage or living room without too much impact on living space.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t offer an adjustable stride length, and it will feel too much like a stepper for true elliptical fans.\n\nDimensions: 66 x 117 x 163cm (WLH)\n\n Weight: 61.7kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive with magnetic resistance (16 levels)\nStride length: 38cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth (for Jrny app access and HR tracking); USB charging port; media shelf for device placement\nFolding? No\nNoise level: about 45dB\nMaximum user weight: 136kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no; burn rate dial and basic LCD, supports third-party workouts including Jrny via smartphone, tablet or laptop\n\nAlthough it’s not the cheapest elliptical trainer on this list, the Horizon EX-59 is still my top value pick thanks to its array of features, robust build quality and a relatively low price.\n\nWhy we love it \nA smooth, front-mounted flywheel provides 10 levels of quiet resistance, and oversize pedals accommodate a variety of different-sized users. With a stride length of 46cm, it’s not dissimilar to the larger elliptical machines you might find at a gym – meaning it feels more natural and less intense than a stepper or cross trainer.\n\nThe EX-59 connects to third-party apps via Bluetooth, but it won’t automatically adjust the resistance like some rivals do. As with most Horizon fitness equipment, this model works with the brand’s @Zone app, which provides several high-quality on-demand workouts and training plans for free. There’s not a huge amount of content geared towards elliptical training, but most treadmill and exercise bike high-intensity interval training sessions work just as well.\n\nTo me, it’s not the prettiest fitness machine, though it certainly does the job, offering drinks holders, a place to stash your smartphone or tablet, and a built-in heart-rate monitor on the static handles.\n\nThe build quality is great, especially considering the price, although that doesn’t extend to the LCD display and console, which are basic. During testing, I found the changes to resistance inputs slow to react: not great if you’re indulging in a Hiit session and you need to spike the heart rate quickly. Similarly, the built-in Bluetooth speakers aren’t really worth the hassle of tethering a device – you’d get better sound quality out of a tin can. Instead, bring a pair of headphones, fire up the @Zone workout app and make the most of those free on-demand classes.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the Bluetooth speakers are tinny, and ECB magnetic brake resistance is slow to react to inputs.\n\nDimensions: 61 x 186 x 167cm (WLH)\nWeight: 74.5kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (10 levels)\nStride length: 46cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth speakers, device rack, USB rapid-charge port; compatible with popular fitness apps via Bluetooth FTMS\nFolding? No\nNoise level: about 42dB\nMaximum user weight: 136kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no touchscreen; has Bluetooth-enabled speakers and a tablet holder for external content\n\nIf money’s no object, it’s worth a visit to Technogym’s London Mayfair store, which is packed with drool-inducing fitness equipment that will make any home workout space feel like a five-star hotel.\n\nThis elliptical trainer is part of the brand’s focus on the home and, as such, it folds upright to minimise its footprint in your living room, home gym or – in my case at least – cobweb-strewn garage.\n\nAs a result, it shuns the traditional front- or rear-mounted flywheel for a suspended set of footplates and a resistance system that’s in its upright body. This helps save space but still offers a comparable, almost anti-gravity upper- and lower-body workout to other premium elliptical machines.\n\nWith 25 difficulty levels and up to 600W of electrically adjustable resistance (up to 160 strides a minute: good luck with that), the elliptical packs a mean punch – and it works perfectly with the brand’s digital workout portfolio. Having said that, although there’s a basic screen to show all the usual important data, you’ll need to bring your own device if you want any sort of guided workout.\n\nWhy we love it\nTechnogym’s “sessions” are up there with some of Peloton’s interactive classes, although you’ll need to provide your own tablet, smartphone or laptop. Unlike other fitness apps, there are plenty of elliptical-based classes to enjoy, which makes the experience feel much more enjoyable.\n\nIndeed, where some elliptical trainers can send me to sleep, the instructor in Technogym’s interactive classes will have you hanging off the unit, torching your glutes and pummelling your quads. It will keep you coming back for more.\n\nThe movement itself takes a bit of getting used to: the stride isn’t quite as obvious as the larger units found in commercial gyms. I had to adapt my approach to get the most out of it, and I found it lacked the multiple grip positions and range of motion for effective upper-body focus training.\n\nRegardless, this trainer has Technogym quality baked into its core. It offers a huge spread of resistance levels, is virtually silent, and is all wrapped up in one of the most compact, storable and classy units on test.\n\nIt’s a shame that … you have to bring a device to enjoy a workout, and Technogym’s monthly subscription fees are, predictably, expensive.\n\nDimensions: 65 x 162 x 160cm (WLH)\nWeight: 100kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive electronically adjustable magnetic resistance\nStride length: not specified\nConnectivity: tablet-compatible console for use with Technogym’s apps\nFolding? Yes (folds to 75cm length for compact storage)\nNoise level: about 36dB\nMaximum user weight: 130kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; designed for tablet use via console\n\nThe JTX Strider-X8 was one of the most compact true ellipticals I got my hands on: it’s just 130cm long. The BowFlex Max Trainer M6 will fit better into tight spaces, but it doesn’t offer the same kind of traditional elliptical stride.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe Strider-X8 provides 41cm of glorious gliding, corralled by a 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel at the rear. It’s quiet, although perhaps not as whisper-quiet as some rivals, and offers 16 levels of easily adjustable resistance.\n\nHowever, there are a few compromises. The compact proportions restrict the maximum user height to 5ft 9in, which means even a vertically challenged individual like myself is butting up against the limits. The build quality isn’t a strong point: the console, complete with basic display, looks and feels a bit like an oversized school calculator. However, this trainer is very much at the budget end of the budget spectrum. JTX offers a two-year at-home warranty, which should give some peace of mind for those worried it may not go the distance.\n\nWeighing 51kg, the Strider-X8 isn’t something you will want to pick up and heft around, but it’s easy to tip it on to its transport wheels and stash it somewhere convenient. Without going for a foldable, there are few cross trainers that can compete with it in terms of space-saving – and I managed to cram it into the corner of my busy garage with little stress.\n\nThe workout experience is largely fine, although the smaller footplates will be a problem for users with larger feet. It connects seamlessly with third-party apps and can even be used with virtual training software, such as Zwift.\n\nThe digital console is basic, but it all works, with a simple dial adjusting the levels of resistance. There are even 18 built-in programs for those who simply want to hop on and work out.\n\nIt’s a shame that … parts of the machine feel cheap, and the built-in heart-rate monitoring is useless.\n\nDimensions: 70 x 130 x 169cm (WLH)\nWeight: 51kg\nDrivetrain: 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel and electromagnetic resistance\nStride length: 41cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth to fitness apps (such as Kinomap, iConsole+), built-in Polar heart-rate receiver (chest strap), hand pulse sensors\nFolding? No; includes transport wheels\nNoise level: about 38dB \n\n Maximum user weight: 120kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no; LCD console with 18 workouts\n\nSchwinn packs a lot into its relatively compact 590 Elliptical, including the ability to electronically adjust the platforms to simulate gradients of -5% to 15%. Along with the multitude of upper-body handles, this sees it bundled into the cross-trainer category (despite its name). I found it offered one of the best full-body workouts on test.\n\nThere are built-in speakers that are of mediocre quality (they’re better than those found on the Horizon EX-59 but still not brilliant) and a 7in digital display that allows for rapid leaps in resistance.\n\nWhy we love it\n\n There are handle-mounted controls for both the incline/decline and resistance settings, which is a welcome premium touch, and the unit is compatible with a multitude of virtual training software, including Zwift and Schwinn’s recommended Jrny app.\n\nThe 25 levels of resistance, the ability to adjust the incline and decline, and the multiple grip locations ensure the Schwinn provides one of the best and all-encompassing full-body workouts on test. With a pronated grip on the horizontal handles, I found it possible to work the big muscles of the back and the lats, while a supinated grip on the inner-most handles would place more emphasis on the shoulders and rear deltoid muscles.\n\nIt’s a similar case for the lower body, as adjusting the decline and incline places a focus on muscles in the legs that I rarely use. Start playing around with body positioning, and it offers all of the benefits of a static hold with dynamic movement.\n\nOf course, you can adjust the intensity as you want, but I found the unit to be one of the best for working up a sweat. It all comes in one of the most compact and easy-to-store packages on this list, too.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the built-in speakers aren’t really worth the effort, and it’s an expensive machine.\n\nDimensions: 86 x 148 x 173cm (WLH)\nWeight: 96kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive with magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (25 levels)\nStride length: 51cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth (heart-rate enabled and built-in speakers), USB charging port, tablet/media holder, Jrny and app compatibility\nFolding? No; includes transport wheels\nNoise level: about 32dB\nMaximum user weight: 147kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no; a 7in full-colour LCD with workout programs and connectivity\n\nWith a generous 50.8cm stride length and oversized footplates, the Sole E35 is designed for taller and larger users, offering multiple handles and grip positions for a full-body workout.\n\nTo me, it’s also one of the better-looking elliptical machines on this list, with modern styling and a sleek 10.1in touchscreen to use for a number of built-in workout sessions and longer-term fitness plans, as well as popular streaming apps, such as YouTube, Disney+ and more.\n\nThere’s a built-in fan for keeping users cool, although it’s not hugely effective, as well as a set of speakers for streaming music. These are perfectly adequate, but don’t expect room-filling sounds.\n\nThe 9kg flywheel provides plenty of resistance though, and with the FTMS protocol, it syncs up with Zwift and the brand’s own Sole+ app, offering a huge array of virtual workouts.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s a large and heavy machine that requires plenty of storage space.\n\nDimensions: 60 x 177 x 177cm (WLH); weight: 110.8kg; drivetrain: front-drive with computer-controlled magnetic ECB resistance (20 levels); stride length: 50.8cm; connectivity: Bluetooth audio speakers, USB charging port, wifi, Sole+ and Kinomap app compatibility, tablet holder, wireless charging pad; folding? No; includes front transport wheels; noise level: about 35db; maximum user weight: 158kg; built-in entertainment: 10.1in touchscreen with built-in apps (YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and so on), wifi and screen mirroring\n\nIt’s a little tricky to get your head around how the Matrix E30 works. On paper, it’s one of the more compact elliptical trainers I tested, yet it still manages to offer a 51cm stride length. This is all down to the clever, and quite complex, suspension system that houses the oversized footplates and traditional elliptical handles.\n\nMatrix kit is often found in commercial gyms and that’s pretty obvious here, as the build quality is excellent. It also sports a 10.5kg flywheel, which is one of the heaviest on test. It allows for 20 levels of resistance and is capable of a pretty hardcore workout.\n\nAn updated XER console has a crisp 10in touchscreen that takes care of most of the functionality, as well as allowing access to a handful of streaming apps and virtual training programs.\n\nIf you don’t want to pay for yet another monthly membership (Matrix suggests iFIT), it can also play nicely with whatever third-party apps you like to use and features 11 built-in workout programs.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s expensive, and the screen isn’t overly impressive.\n\nDimensions: 73x 166 x 148cm (WLH); weight: 126kg; drivetrain: suspension elliptical front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels); stride length: 51cm; connectivity: wifi, Bluetooth, USB port and entertainment apps (YouTube, Netflix and so on); folding? No; noise level: about 38dB; maximum user weight: 147kg; built-in entertainment: 10in touchscreen with apps, media streaming, web browser (XER console)\n\nBest for: build quality on a budget\n\nLife Fitness is another brand often selected by commercial gyms for its reliability, and this also filters down into its domestic range.\n\nConsidering how basic the E1 feels compared with some rivals, the price seems high, but this is a fuss-free elliptical with a massive fixed stride length, oversized footplates and an impressive spread of smooth and natural-feeling resistance. It’s also quiet.\n\nThe basic digital Go Console lacks the flashiness of a massive interactive touchscreen, but it has 13 workout programs that are easily accessed via large and obvious buttons, great for those not fussed about binging Netflix during a workout. During testing, I found the lack of a touchscreen quite refreshing: it was easy to hop on and work out without the faff of connecting Bluetooth-enabled devices.\n\nHeart-rate monitoring is fairly reliable via its handles and sports the FTMS protocol for third-party app integration, but it also works perfectly well without it, and its built-in programs span hill training and fat-burning sessions.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it feels expensive for what it is and looks dated.\n\nDimensions: 77 x 209 x 150cm (WLH); weight: 96kg; drivetrain: front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels); stride length: 51cm; connectivity: Go Console with LCD, Bluetooth telemetry heart-rate monitoring, 13 pre-loaded workouts; folding? No; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 182kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in media apps; simple display for workout metrics and an integrated accessory tray for external device placement\n\nThe two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences. A standard elliptical machine focuses on the forward and backward pedalling motion with fixed handles, providing a low-impact cardio workout that mimics running without the joint stress. A cross trainer typically includes moving handlebars that allow you to work your upper body as well, giving a more complete, full-body workout. In most modern home fitness equipment, “elliptical” and “cross trainer” usually describe the same type of machine.\n\nEntry-level elliptical trainers start at about £400 and offer basic stride motion and limited resistance levels. Spending more than £1,000 typically gets you a sturdier build, smoother motion, more resistance levels and better consoles with Bluetooth or app integration. At the top end (£2,000+), you’ll find commercial-grade machines with advanced consoles, streaming services, more compact footprints, greater levels of resistance and suspension technology that greatly reduces noise and wear.\n\nEllipticals tend to be large machines, with footprints ranging from about 150cm in length and 70cm in width, all the way up to 200cm in length and 80cm in width, or more. You’ll also need to consider ceiling height – especially with front-drive machines, as pedals can lift you an additional 30-40cm off the ground.\n\nStride length is a key factor: shorter strides (about 40-45cm) are suitable for smaller users, while taller users will benefit from 50cm or more. Look for adjustable resistance levels and incline options if you want to vary the intensity and muscle groups worked. Consoles with Bluetooth and app support can help track progress and keep workouts engaging, and some higher-end models include large touchscreens with streaming apps, fans, speakers and wireless charging pads. If space is a concern, compact or folding designs are worth exploring.\n\nEllipticals are generally low-maintenance compared with treadmills. Most use magnetic resistance systems that don’t require ongoing adjustment as a treadmill’s belt does. Look out for manufacturer warranties that cover any wear and tear. Suspension ellipticals – which remove the traditional track and wheel system – tend to be even quieter and need virtually no lubrication.\n\nFor more ways to get fit at home:\n The best treadmills, tested by our expert runner\n\n Personal trainers on the best home exercise kit\n\nLeon Poultney is a lifelong fitness enthusiast who can often be found trying not to kill himself on a mountain bike/surfboard/other extreme thing, often at the request of an editor.

    "description": "Paradoxically, weak rewards build strong motivation.",
    "fullText": "Rewarding yourself can backfire. If you tell yourself, “I’ll only listen to my favorite podcast while I’m at the gym,” it takes just one moment of weakness to realize you can cheat and listen to it any time you want. Instead, try this: Reward yourself with something that has no enjoyment value whatsoever. Like a checkmark on your calendar.\n\nI first heard this tip from writer Tim Clare’s podcast. If you want to stay motivated, he says, the reward has to be so crappy that you’re not actually working for the reward. He said that he puts a checkmark on his calendar every day he writes, and at the end of the week enough checkmarks earn a gold star. The same approach has worked for me and for others. I have to admit: Buying myself a pack of stickers is embarrassingly motivating.\n\nTim Clare likes the theory that this works because of cognitive dissonance: We have to change something major (our behavior) to earn something that's not valuable (a sticker), so we try to resolve that dissonance by deciding we value the behavior change. The crappy extrinsic reward strengthens our sense that the new habit is intrinsically valuable.\n\nAnd as my colleague Meredith Dietz has written, experts believe that the secret to lasting motivation lies in our intrinsic goals. Engaging in healthy behaviors like exercise only works if we're doing those behaviors for their own sake, not because we're enduring our gym time as a means to an end. Extrinsic rewards like streaks and badges can gamify this process so addictively that we lose sight of why we're actually doing it in the first place. Note that I'm not saying you should chase streaks; I'm thinking more like literal stickers on a piece of paper, or a note in your phone where you write down how many miles you ran this week.\n\nAnother type of ineffective reward is the real-life splurge: promising you'll treat yourself to something (a dessert, a clothing purchase) once you hit a certain goal. Here's the problem: If you hate exercising so much that you need a bribe to do it at all, you're quickly going to find a way to have the reward without the work. There's nothing actually stopping you from listening to that \"gym only\" podcast at home, or ordering yourself the new outfit you had earmarked as a reward for when you make it through the couch to 5K program.\n\nUsing a crappy reward works because it just reflects your existing motivation back on itself. You check off today's work, not because the checkmark is valuable in itself, but because the checkmark reminds you that you kept a promise to yourself. There's a thrill to closing that loop, and those little wins really build your self-efficacy. In self-efficacy theory, small wins boost your motivation to keep working toward bigger goals.\n\nThe best part of using stickers or checkmarks is that it’s pointless to cheat. What are you going to do—lie to yourself when you didn’t actually go to the gym? But building up that row of numbers or stickers becomes its own reward. You’re really just rewarding yourself with the satisfaction of having stuck to your habit.",

    "title": "What Is Zone 2 Cardio, and How Do I Actually Do It?",
    "description": "If you have the time for it, \"LISS cardio\" is a cheat code for fitness gains.",
    "fullText": "A healthy dose of cardio is an important part of your exercise routine, and for a lot of us, \"zone 2\" cardio is going to make up a big chunk of that. Low-intensity cardio—sometimes called LISS or “zone 2”—used to be an underrated form of exercise. It's super trendy now, after spending years on the sidelines while HIIT and lifting-only routines ran the field. But what is zone 2 cardio, exactly? How can you make sure you're doing it right? And is it really so bad if your heart rate drifts into zone 3?\n\nZone 2 training is cardio done at a steady, low intensity. It has benefits for aerobic training (so you can run faster), anaerobic training (helping you to recover faster between reps and sets, or between intervals), and it's also an efficient, low-fatigue way to burn calories.\n\n“Zone 2” is a term drawn from the five-zone system of heart rate training, and the same concept is also known by other names and metrics. To runners, it is “easy pace” or “long slow distance pace.” To cyclists, it corresponds to zones 2 and 3 of a seven-zone system of mechanical power. In other sports, like swimming and rowing, it’s often just called “easy” or “low-intensity” exercise.\n\nAll that said, there is no official definition of zone 2, and different devices won't necessarily agree with each other. The same heart rate might be \"zone 2\" on one device and \"zone 3\" on another. So please take the following with a grain of salt.\n\nThe hallmark of zone 2 training is that it’s relatively slow and that it’s done at a steady pace. You'll be aiming for a heart rate of around 70%, but that doesn’t mean doing intervals at 90% and then resting at 50%. It means holding that 70% level the whole time you’re exercising. You can do zone 2 cardio with any steady, repetitive movement. Popular methods are running, cycling, swimming, rowing, brisk walking, fast hiking, or churning away on the elliptical. (Walking can count if you're new to exercise; as you get fitter, you'll probably need to choose a slightly harder form of exercise.)\n\nTo be clear, it’s still work—it’s not the same as sitting around resting—but it should feel like you could keep going forever if you wanted to. You don’t stop a zone 2 session when you get tired, you stop it because you set out for a 30- or 45- or 60-minute session, and your time is up.\n\nZone 2 work builds your aerobic base. When you do cardio at this kind of easy pace, your body adapts to get more efficient at it. These adaptations are great for your health as well as your cardio fitness. You grow more capillaries (tiny blood vessels) to get oxygen and nutrients to your muscles more efficiently. You get more mitochondria in each muscle cell (you have thousands of mitochondria powering each cell) and you produce more of the enzymes that turn fuel from food into usable energy. Your heart and your lungs get more efficient at taking in oxygen and moving blood to your muscles, and your muscles become able to store more carbohydrates (in a form called glycogen) so that more of the carbs you eat are at the ready when you start a run or ride.\n\nFor runners, your zone 2 work, often called \"easy pace,\" should make up most (some say 80%) of your weekly mileage. The fitness you build doing easy running is what allows you to benefit from, and recover from, harder efforts like interval training.\n\nFor people whose main sport is more strength oriented (meatheads like myself), zone 2 cardio strengthens the same body systems that help us recover between sets, and even between reps. It increases our work capacity, letting us get more work done in total. As long as you’re eating enough, adding cardio into your routine should make you able to do more work in the gym, not less. (And no, cardio does not kill your gains.)\n\nAnd for people who are just exercising for health, zone 2 cardio is the perfect “moderate” exercise we’re all supposed to get at least 150 minutes of per week. It’s heart-healthy, and even people with medical conditions that limit their ability to exercise can often do low intensity cardio safely. (Ask your doctor to be sure, of course.)\n\nImportantly, zone 2 training is very low fatigue. More time-efficient forms of cardio and conditioning like HIIT, hill sprints, or CrossFit WODs are great for your aerobic fitness, but those workouts have to be high intensity to work, and you’ll be pooped afterward. They’re great in small doses, but they kind of have to be in small doses.\n\nTechnically, zone 2 is defined in terms of heart rate, and the idea is that you glance at your watch and see whether you're in zone 2 or not. (There are five zones, with zone 5 being the hardest, so zone 2 is the second-easiest). But even though “zone 2” is defined in terms of heart rate, there are so many caveats to determining your max and deciding on the zone boundaries that I don’t recommend that beginners calculate it from heart rate percentages at first. Unless you’ve actually gotten your heart rate up to a maximum effort level, and know what that number is, you don’t really know your max heart rate.\n\nSo if you're a beginner, the best way to know if you’re in zone 2 is to ignore your watch and instead pay attention to your effort, and how it feels. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is nothing and 10 is all-out sprinting, low intensity cardio is about a 3 to 5. You’re working, but not very hard. If your breath starts to get ragged, or if you feel like you're getting pretty damn tired and you can't wait for this to end, you're probably somewhere 7+ and definitely going too hard for a zone 2 workout.\n\nA zone 2 pace is conversational, and it’s sometimes described with a “talk test.” If you could tell your friend about your day while you’re exercising, you’re probably around the right level. That doesn’t mean spitting out a few words here and there, but speaking in full sentences without feeling out of breath. If you find yourself stopping to catch your breath or if you feel like you need to take break, you’re going too hard. (That said, some of zone 3 is also within that conversational zone, but it's okay—zone 3 is still good for you.)\n\nThat said, it shouldn’t feel too easy—zone 2 is more like a brisk walk or easy jog than a leisurely stroll. If you stop, you should feel like you took a break from something. It should take a little work and focus to keep up the pace.\n\nBefore you start, there's a big caveat. Zone 2 is based on heart rate zones, and to set your zones correctly, you need an accurate max heart rate. Finding your max is a trickier task than you might expect, so you have my permission to skip this section completely, and scroll down to \"How do you know when you're in zone 2?\" which will teach you how to get into zone 2 by feel, no heart rate monitor needed.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll explain how exactly to find your zone 2, if you want to do it by the book. There are two steps: finding your max heart rate, and then setting your zones based on that heart rate.\n\nYour maximum heart rate is defined as, literally, the fastest your heart can beat. (Sometimes people assume this is a guideline, that you should keep your heart rate under this number. Nope—if your heart rate is higher than the number you thought was your max, that just tells you that number was not your max.) Here are some different ways to find your max heart rate:\n\nA max heart rate field test (best for people with healthy hearts and some pain tolerance): There are a few ways of doing this, but basically you're going to try to push your heart rate to its absolute max, and see what that number is. The most common way is to find a long, steep hill, and run up it three times, really sprinting hard on the last one. The number you see at the end is a good estimate of your max. Obviously, don't do this if you've been told you shouldn't exercise at high intensity.\n\nYour personal history (best for athletes who have experience using a HR monitor): If you've done high intensity exercise in the past, especially killer efforts that left you collapsed on the floor, the highest number you've ever seen on your watch or heart rate monitor is probably your max, or close to it. A 5K race or an FTP test will often get you close, if you really pushed yourself the whole way.\n\nEstimating based on easy exercise (best for non-athletes who have experience using a HR monitor): If you have a sense of what heart rate you see when you're exercising at a steady, conversational pace, multiply the highest number you would consider conversational by 1.25 to find a number that you can use as your max. This is my own method, but it's based on studies that have found the top of conversational pace to be around 77-79% of max. This isn't as good as a field test, but for many people it will give a better result than the formula below.\n\nA formula. I don't recommend using a formula if you have the option of using either of the first two real-world options above. Using a formula to get your max heart rate is like asking ChatGPT for your shoe size. It will give a plausible guess, but it could easily be very, very wrong. Anyway, the easiest formula is to subtract your age from 220. (There are other formulas, but honestly they all have serious inaccuracies. I wouldn't worry about whether any one of them is \"better\" than the others. They all suck.)\n\nI have more here on why max heart rate formulas are pretty much all wrong, but that's beside the point for the moment. If you know your max heart rate, you can proceed to the next step.\n\nOnce you know your max heart rate (or have an estimate you're willing to work with), multiply to get the upper and lower boundaries of zone 2. Multiply by what? Well, there's more than one opinion out there about what zone 2 should be.\n\nIf you use a smartwatch or other device, go into the settings and set a custom heart rate (all the major brands can do this—check the instructions to find out where this setting lives.) The zones will usually populate automatically.\n\nAs I've written before, every device has a different idea of what should count as zone 2. If you'd like me to be the tiebreaker, I'd go with 60% to 75% of your max heart rate. So, multiply your estimated max heart rate by 0.6 to get the lower end of that zone, and 0.75 to get the higher end. For example, if your max heart rate is 200, your zone 2 is 120 to 150 beats per minute. If your max heart rate is 175, your zone 2 would be 105 to 132.\n\nI have good news for you: zone 3 has almost all the same benefits as zone 2. Don't view the top of zone 2 as a barrier thou shalt not cross; it's just a way of dividing easier exercise (zone 2) from medium intensity (zone 3). The more exercise you do, the more of it should stay in zone 2. Otherwise you could find yourself building up fatigue. After a zone 2 cardio session, you should feel good. You should feel like you totally could have done more, but you're saving some energy for tomorrow.\n\nSo if you have a hard time staying in zone 2, don't beat yourself up about it. Just try to keep your effort level low, on average, so you're still fresh for the next workout. As you get fitter, you'll find it easier to stay in zone 2.\n\nRunners often have trouble with this, because the dividing line between walking and running is sometimes too high to maintain an easy pace while you’re running, if you’re a beginner. The next best thing is to jog as slow as you can, and when you start to feel out of breath, switch to a brisk walk. For some people, a brisk walk for the whole session is a perfect zone 2 workout. As you get more fit, easy jogging will become possible.\n\nHere’s a real world example of how to keep a zone 2 pace: if I’m heading out for an easy run, I start at a nice chill jogging pace. But I live in a hilly neighborhood, so pretty soon I’ll be chugging up a hill and notice my breathing getting heavier. At this point, if my heart rate is getting higher than I'd like for this workout, I switch to a power walk. Jogging the flats and walking the uphills is a great way to keep your effort level steady, instead of accidentally turning your easy jog into a hill sprint workout.\n\nCyclists often measure their training in a seven-zone system that is based on how much power, in a physics sense, you are putting into the gears of your bike. These are called Coggan power zones, and bike training systems like Zwift and Peloton use the same basic idea. To calibrate these zones, you’ll take an FTP (functional threshold power) test—basically, a 20-minute race against yourself. From there, you (or your training app) calculates wattage numbers for your zones.\n\nZones 2 and 3 in this system usually correspond to our “zone 2” cardio. (Your heart rate at the end of an FTP test will be pretty close to your max heart rate, by the way, if you really went all-out.) If you train with both a heart rate monitor and a bike power meter, don’t worry if they don’t match exactly. A ride in power zones 2 and 3 will meet your low-intensity cardio needs, even if your heart rate starts in zone 1 and spikes into zone 3 by the end.\n\nFor other forms of cardio, go by feel, or by heart rate if you truly know your heart rate percentages. When you’re on the elliptical or the rower or the airbike, you should feel like you could carry on a conversation easily, and stop because time is up rather than because you’re running out of gas.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be sweating on the fitness of Mason Mount as he prepares for his side’s Premier League match against Wolves on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe former Chelsea man came off at half-time on Sunday in United’s 1-0 win over Newcastle. Amorim said post-match that he was hoping the injury was nothing serious.\n\nIf Mount does make it, an unchanged XI is expected, partly on merit after Sunday but also partly because there are few other options.\n\nHarry Maguire is back on the grass but is unlikely to be ready for action. Matthijs de Ligt and Bruno Fernandes are still injured, and Kobbie Mainoo is also unlikely to have recovered in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Nouss Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are still participating for their countries in AFCON. All three of their nations – Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon (respectively) – are expected to progress to the knockout stages, so they are unlikely to be back until around 10th January or even beyond.\n\nSenne Lammens will continue in goal. Amorim is likely to persist with a back four of Diogo Dalot, Sunday’s Man of the Match Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw.\n\nCasemiro and Manuel Ugarte will once again be the twin sixes. If fit, Mount will play in front of them. Patrick Dorgu was excellent on the right wing on Sunday, so is likely to continue there, with Matheus Cunha on the left and Ben Sesko up top.\n\nIf Mount does not make it, he could be replaced directly by Jack Fletcher as he was at half-time against the Magpies. Alternatively, the boss could revert to a back three, bringing in Leny Yoro as a third centre-back and pushing the full-backs up into wing-back roles.\n\nHowever, Amorim has hinted at more than one press conference that he is reluctant to play Shaw at wing-back due to the physical exertion involved.\n\nAnother possibility would be to play 4-2-3-1 with Josh Zirkzee sitting in behind Sesko. Given the opposition’s struggles this season, it would certainly be an option.\n\nGiven all that, here is our predicted XI for Tuesday’s 8.15pm kick-off:\n\nFeatured image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Business Insider's health team share the best tips and trends we followed this year, from workout hacks to healthy eating to better morning routines.",
    "fullText": "As a health reporter, I love to tell people \"no.\"\n\nNo, you probably don't need to add protein to everything. No, you won't get swole in a month with that one-minute Instagram workout. No, a Paleo diet won't fix all your problems (and probably isn't historically accurate).\n\nThat's why, as the end of the year approaches, I wanted to change things up and ask my esteemed colleagues what simple hacks actually have made a difference for them — whether it's working out smarter, eating better, and living well.\n\nAfter a year of talking to health experts, and reading lots and lots of science, here's what helped us move the needle for a healthier mind and body in 2025.\n\nLike many of our readers, I live in a household with two working parents. Our kids are still on the younger side, 6 and 8, so life is fairly hectic. Of course, my mind is always racing, planning, organizing, scheduling, and doing all of the other things that come along with managing the mental load that we're all very aware of these days. Turning my brain off, or at least briefly pushing pause, is tricky, especially at bedtime.\n\nCommitting to taking a few deep breaths as soon as I get under the sheets has done wonders for me. Sometimes I'll follow a quick meditation track on my phone; other times, I'll do some box breathing. But more often than not, I just try to breathe in and out for a few minutes, focusing on the movement of my body and nothing else. The practice helps clear my mind and gets my body ready for bed — and the flurry I know tomorrow will bring.\n\nJennifer Beck Goldblatt, Senior Editor, Health & Parenting\n\nThis year, I've been putting a little bit of ginger in almost everything. Fresh ginger tea, grated ginger to add zip to soups and stews, and crystallized ginger as a sweet treat. I generally eat a healthy diet — lots of fiber, fruits and veggies, home-cooked meals — but the extra ginger has made a big difference for my gut health. I'm less likely to have an upset stomach even when I indulge my passion for spicy food.\n\nOne of my favorite recipes to make in big batches is fresh ginger tea with turmeric, black pepper, a bit of cayenne, and plenty of honey. It smells great, and it's warming and full of antioxidants for a perfect self-care break any time of day.\n\nMidway through the year, I bought a Brick for my phone. It's a gadget on my fridge that helps me block whichever apps I choose (in my case, my email and internet, since I already got rid of social media on my phone).\n\nI tap my phone every night before I unwind for bed and usually don't tap again until right before work starts — my peak junk-scrolling times. Something about the humiliation of having to physically walk up to my fridge because I want to Google an actor from a niche '80s movie keeps me from un-Bricking. I get to my morning workouts quicker and read more books, which has made me a much happier person.\n\nBuying an air fryer has been a game changer for quickly rustling up nutritious food. I thought they were for heating up fries and frozen treats, and that you couldn't use them to heat saucy foods, like the curries and bean stews I cook and freeze.\n\nSince realizing you can get air fryer-proof dishes, which can be DIYed with foil or baking paper, I've made dozens of protein pancakes for breakfast. I enjoy frozen veggies that are no longer soggy and sad from being defrosted in the microwave, batch-cook chicken meatballs in 10 minutes before work, and can quickly reheat my trusty frozen beans. (To make pancakes, mix up the regular ingredients, cook the batter in a single layer in the air fryer, then chop and stack once cooked.)\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor\n\nMy kids are finally all in the same school (and therefore same schedule), which means I have a bit more time in the mornings for myself before hopping online for work. I've been taking 15-30 minute walks in the morning to get some fresh air and sunlight before spending the rest of my day in front of a computer.\n\nI joke I'm like a plant and need as much sunlight as possible to have the best mood I can have, so prioritizing time outside has helped, especially with SAD now that the darker months are upon us [that's seasonal affective disorder — when your mood and energy tanks in the fall and winter.]\n\nConz Preti, Deputy Editor, Parenting & Health\n\nIn March of this year, I committed to waking up after my first alarm goes off, rather than snoozing it at least two extra times, as I had been accustomed to doing since middle school.\n\nI made this small but radical change because I was feeling exhausted all the time, and I've found that my energy level feels far more stable, and my mood tends to be better throughout the day when I manage it. It can be really difficult in the moment, but the payoff has been huge!\n\nI finally started pelvic floor physical therapy! And, reader, let me tell you: It's worth it. The pelvic floor is a \"hammock\" of muscles in your pelvis that controls your core, your breathing, your bladder, your sexual function, your digestive system, and so much more.\n\nCan you feel yours? Unless you're pregnant or have incontinence, the answer is probably \"no.\" But that doesn't mean you should leave it un-therapized. Even just one session with a pelvic floor PT showed me what I was doing wrong. I left with useful exercises I can do to improve my core control and my breathing so that my workouts are more effective, and don't put unnecessary stress on my organs. I'm a convert.\n\nMia de Graaf, Deputy Executive Editor, Health & Features\n\nI'd been in a running rut for years. I was bored with my usual routine of running a few miles at a leisurely pace, but trying to actively track and increase my speed felt daunting as well. Getting a VO2 max assessment taught me that I could run a lot faster than I thought I could — and having exact numbers to shoot for was very helpful, too. I've since joined a nearby Orangetheory, which focuses on hitting higher heart rate zones throughout class, and have slowly inched up to running paces I thought unimaginable a year ago.\n\nMy trainer gave me some advice that helped me get through a big fitness slump.\n\nEveryone's training typically falls into three phases each year: terrible, OK, and great, he said. I was in the \"terrible\" stage, where your motivation is wiped.\n\nTo my surprise, that's where my trainer was, too. Learning that even athletes like him struggle with motivation helped ease my embarrassment.\n\nIt made it easier to give myself permission not to go near a gym for three months after I got burned out by a Hyrox-esque fitness contest. I thought long-term, enjoyed leisurely walks, and the odd PS Fit YouTube dance video, knowing I'd eventually get back to regular exercise, whether that was restarting functional fitness or trying something new.\n\nI was right: I'm now doing regular Saturday morning 5K runs with my neighbor, and started using the Ladder training app this fall. The big takeaway: be kind to yourself.\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor",

Sibling comments get starved for attention, while replies always steal the spotlight, dominating the discourse.\n\nThis makes the reading experience feel meandering, scatterbrained, and unfocused. Conversations often feel like they drift into squabbling and pedantry, because that's what the platform design prioritizes and presents.\n\nAs the reader scans top-down, they are effectively led through a “depth-first” traversal into all subdiscussions. Comment replies (no matter their quality or relevance) are always given precedence to sidetrack and derail the reading experience.\n\nThe issue magnifies for larger threads, where most readers never scroll down far enough to get past the first reply, or even the first reply to the first reply. Commenters also pile on to the first comment’s replies, knowing that that is prime real estate, and thus artificially inflating the discourse there.\n\nHere's the same reply thread as above, shown a different way.\n\nThe default HN reading experience is still available, you can read down the leftmost vertical edge and recreate the depth-first comment traversal.\n\nHowever, as you’ll notice, for each level you can now easily see the sibling comments as well and jump to them.\n\nPower-user keyboard shortcuts make all this effortless:\n\nThat’s really it. The magic is in hitting Left / Right which quickly allows you to “opt out” of going down any reply thread rabbit-hole. This is my favorite feature and I call it: “thank u, next”.\n\nLeft / Right gets you breadth-first traversal, instead of depth-first traversal, as a first-class operation. You are in control.\n\nThe tool is available at hn-comments.netlify.app.\n\nOr for your convenience, modify the URL for any comment thread to load it in the tool:\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46352930\n\nhttps://hn-comments.netlify.app/item?id=46352930",

    "title": "What Is VO2max?",
    "description": "It measures your cardio fitness, but it's not as important as tech companies want you to think.",
    "fullText": "The more you work out, the fitter you'll get. Your VO2max, sometimes described on wearables as a \"cardio fitness\" score, is a number that tends to be higher among people who are more cardiovascularly fit. But it's not the only measure of fitness, and you should know what it really means.\n\nSmartwatches and fitness trackers don't actually measure VO2max; they just estimate it. To actually find your VO2max, you'd need to go to an exercise lab and do a test on a treadmill or cycle while hooked up to equipment that measures your heart rate and the air you're exhaling. I did exactly this kind of test to compare my real VO2max to the numbers reported by nine different devices. You can read about my experience, and why it matters, here.\n\nVO2max, properly rendered VO2max, is the maximal volume (V) of oxygen (O2) your body can use per minute during exercise, scaled to your body size because larger people will naturally use more oxygen. This is considered a good measure of aerobic fitness because—think back to high school biology—your body uses oxygen and food to create a usable form of chemical energy called ATP. You then use that ATP to power the movements of your muscles. The amount of oxygen directly correlates with the amount of energy produced. Or, in simpler terms, the more work you do, the more oxygen you need.\n\nSo a person who is aerobically very fit—let’s say an elite marathon runner—can do more work (run faster) than somebody who isn’t. As a result, they’ll suck in a lot more oxygen per minute during their run than, say, I would.\n\nA typical sorta-fit human being will have a VO2max somewhere in the 30s or 40s. If you exercise a lot, you can push that number higher. Elite cyclists, skiers, and ultrarunners may have numbers in the 70s or 80s, and a few people out there have scored in the 90s. I'd call myself a recreational athlete (I run a little) and my lab-tested VO2max was 43. Most of my fitness wearables reported numbers for me in the high 30's or low 40's—a good reminder that these estimates can be useful, but they aren't necessarily correct.\n\nTo be able to use a large amount of oxygen, you need more than just good lungs. You also need a strong heart and healthy circulatory system to get the oxygen to your muscles. And you need muscles that are large and can do a lot of work per minute—which means that you're strong and can do a lot of work athletically. VO2max is a way to summarize a lot of important things about cardio fitness into one simple number.\n\nBut it’s important to know that this number isn’t everything about fitness, or even aerobic fitness. First, it doesn’t make much sense to compare your VO2max to other people’s, because it’s affected by factors like blood volume and muscle mass. Men tend to have a VO2max about ten points higher than similarly fit women, for example. There are also plenty of aspects of fitness that aren't captured by VO2max. Compare two athletes with the same VO2max, and you may find that one can keep going in an endurance race longer than the other. Or one might be better at sprinting while another is better at medium-effort work. One person may be stronger than another, or have better technique, or be more resistant to injuries.\n\nThere is research correlating VO2max with longevity, but that doesn't mean that raising your VO2max a few points will add years to your life. Fitness, in general, tends to correlate with longevity and with overall health. Scientists who want to study that relationship will usually pick an easy thing or two to measure, like VO2max or grip strength. But in real life, we don't have to choose one number to maximize; we can work on multiple aspects of fitness. It's better to be well-rounded than to hyperfocus on just one metric.\n\nThe gold standard is a lab test. High-level athletes will sometimes take this test if they or their coach want to know their actual, definite VO2max number. But we can measure aerobic fitness in other ways, and there are workouts you can do to get a good estimate of VO2max. If you’re a runner, you can look up a recent race time on this chart to find your VDOT, which roughly correlates with your VO2max. (My best-ever mile time gets me a VDOT of 38, for example.)\n\nTo estimate your VO2max from a workout, you need something that will take you to your absolute maximum aerobic output. A race does this job nicely; so will a test like running as many laps of a track as you can in 12 minutes. I recall doing a test in a Phys Ed. class once where we had to step up and down from a high box as many times as possible. These tests aren’t pleasant, but their results can be a benchmark to tell you whether you’re improving your fitness over time.\n\nSmartwatches and fitness trackers typically estimate VO2max by comparing your heart rate during exercise to a measure of how much work you're doing during that exercise. Most often, this is through outdoor running or walking. The speed you run or walk is measured through GPS, and the device compares that to your heart rate. If you can run fast with a low heart rate, you must be pretty fit and your VO2max will be estimated as being pretty high. If your heart rate is high even for a slow running or walking pace, your VO2max is lower.\n\nThese estimates aren't always accurate. If your max heart rate isn't set properly in the device's settings, if it's hot out, if your running route has hills, or if you don't happen to get out for outdoor runs or walks very often, your VO2max is more likely to be wrong. That said, your VO2max estimate doesn't have to be exactly correct to be useful. If the number increases over time, you're probably getting fitter. And if it decreases, you're likely losing fitness.",

    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance posted glossy photos of his personal training session with Navy SEALs—but the beachside stunt immediately drew mockery and accusations of political tone-deafness.\n\nThe 41-year-old former Marine, who served in Iraq before entering politics, had joined the Navy’s special-operations community for an early-morning workout at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California, a longtime hub for SEAL selection and training.\n\nFrom the official @VP account, Vance shared images on Monday of himself sprinting along the surf, hauling a log with helmeted operators whose faces were blurred, scrambling up a cargo net, and riding in a small boat punching through the waves.\n\n“Vice President Vance trains with @USNavy Seals at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado,” the caption read. On his personal account, Vance gushed that he had “just finished PT with the Navy SEALs for 90 minutes.”\n\nHe added, “They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train. So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!”\n\nCritics were unimpressed. “Nice cosplay as a Navy SEAL,” one user wrote, adding: “Leadership isn’t about photo ops, it’s about fixing the mess at home.”\n\nOther critics photoshopped the infamous meme of Vance with a cartoonishly puffy face onto the soldiers he was working out with, using “GI Jello” as a punchline.\n\nAnother commenter sneered that it was a “desperate photo op for a Vice President who cares more about his military ‘aesthetic’ than actually governing.”\n\nDigital strategist Mike Nellis jabbed: “Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks.”\n\nAnd Democratic strategist Christopher Hale wrote on X, “It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL.”\n\nVance’s made-for-camera workout follows a Trumpian trend of the president’s inner circle engaging in theatrics. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, 45, marked the D-Day anniversary and his birthday in June by leading a filmed PT session with troops on Omaha Beach before delivering a speech at the Normandy American Cemetery, a spectacle that also drew scrutiny as self-promotion.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly been mocked as “ICE Barbie” for using federal law enforcement as props in a string of stylized photo ops, from tactical-gear raids to glossy fitness clips.\n\nThis is also not the first time Vance has tried to curry favor with the military. Ahead of Thanksgiving, he delivered a comedy skit to troops at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the vice president’s office for comment.",

    "description": "At 70, a woman with serious health problems joined a gym after her daughter's warning and lost 70 pounds, reversed conditions, and rebuilt her strength.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Joan MacDonald, 79, a former driving examiner of Collingwood, Ontario. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nJanuary 2017 was a New Year I'll never forget. It was one of the few times that my daughter, Michelle MacDonald, lost her cool with me.\n\nShe'd moved to Mexico the previous month and was visiting. \"I won't get to see you as often as I like,\" she said. \"And, every time I leave, I won't know whether it will be the last time I see you.\"\n\nThen she made another blunt comment that changed my life. \"Mom, why don't you go to the gym?\" she said.\n\nI had high blood pressure, kidney problems, and was at least 70 pounds overweight. Approaching my 71st birthday that March, I felt scared and miserable.\n\nMy doctor had already warned me that, if I didn't make an effort to improve my health, I would end up on dialysis before very long. I was effectively dying.\n\nGrowing up in Canada, I'd been an active child. I played ball, skated in the winter, and went bowling. I enjoyed doing them because they were fun. But I was by no means an athlete.\n\nI got married a month before my 21st birthday and settled into married life while working as a driving examiner. I juggled work with motherhood, raising Michelle and her older and younger brothers.\n\nGoing to the gym really wasn't a thing back then. None of my married friends worked out, or even thought about doing so.\n\nI believe that your body changes every seven years or so. I went through variations in terms of shape and size, and enjoyed certain foods, then went off them.\n\nI didn't have regular meals, often eating just two meals a day at irregular times. In between, I'd snack.\n\nThroughout my 60s, I was in poor health. I'd get bronchitis in the fall and spring — I had weaker lungs after contracting rheumatic fever as a child — and the kidney issues began.\n\nThe weight had grown to 200 pounds, which was far too heavy for my height of 5 feet 3 inches. And my blood pressure was high; I was put on medication.\n\nI'm lucky because Michelle is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and sports nutrition coach. She saw how unhealthy I'd become and was worried, especially because she'd moved thousands of miles away and couldn't keep an eye on me.\n\nHer recommendation struck home. It was enough to jolt me into action. My doctor also encouraged me to lose weight and reduce my blood pressure.\n\nI'd half-heartedly attended the gym before, but not consistently. This time, I went five times a week.\n\nI sought advice from Michelle and studied YouTube videos to learn how to use the machines and do strength training with free weights. At first, I couldn't believe how hard it was to pick up 20 pounds.\n\nI began with small weights and increased them by increments. I've since done a deadlift of 170 pounds and a hip thrust of 230 pounds.\n\nIt was amazing to see my body slim down and fit into clothes, like jeans, that I hadn't worn in a very long time.\n\nI lost 45 pounds in six months and a further 25 pounds during the rest of my 70s. I've gone from a size XL to a medium. I was able to quit my medications.\n\nMy current regimen involves spending two hours at the gym, with around 15 minutes of cardio, followed by using weights. I often work out with Michelle, whom I joined in Mexico for around a year after my husband died.\n\nAs for my diet, I eat five small meals a day, including oatmeal with egg whites, protein powder, and 1% coconut milk for breakfast.\n\nThen I'll have yogurt, an egg white omelette with ground beef, chicken, turkey, and ham, a protein bar, and a final, plain meal without starches. If I start my day at 7 am, I'll stop eating by 7 pm.\n\nUnfortunately, I suffered a shoulder injury while biking outside on a rough surface and needed surgery three months ago. I've had to take things a bit easier as I recover. However, I feel 100% happier and healthier than I did before going to the gym.\n\nMichelle and I established \"Train With Joan\" to help inspire people to take up exercise, regardless of their age.\n\nIt may slow you down a bit, but I've seen many seniors, even older than me, accomplish great things. They have resolved to do it for themselves. Nobody else is living in your body but you.",

    "description": "The actor and gym bro, 54, eats two types of eggs, salmon, and turkey each morning.",
    "fullText": "Mark Wahlberg eats a high-protein breakfast every morning that would likely get a big thumbs-up from longevity researchers.\n\nIn an Instagram post last week, the 54-year-old said he always starts the day with three hard-boiled eggs, scrambled eggs with turkey pieces, a side of salmon drizzled with lemon and what looks like olive oil, and a bowl of blueberries.\n\n\"Same old, same old, every day,\" the \"Ted\" star, who is known for his strict wellness routine and daily 4 a.m. workouts, said.\n\n\"I eat the same breakfast every day, but I feel better every day!!\" the caption reads.\n\nIn 2018, Wahlberg's daily routine included waking up at 2:30 a.m., two workouts, and cryotherapy.\n\nBut as he's gotten older, he's dialed it down a little (he now wakes up around 3:30 a.m.) as he focuses on healthy aging.\n\n\"Getting a little bit older, I'm always now thinking about longevity, mobility, flexibility, lung capacity. Rest is equally important,\" he told Business Insider in 2023.\n\nHis breakfast reflects his health goals.\n\nThe meal contains healthy fats and polyphenols — molecules that are believed to help reduce inflammation — from the olive oil, salmon, and blueberries. These foods are thought to be great for brain health and preventing cognitive decline.\n\nHis breakfast also chimes with the Mediterranean diet, which consists mainly of unprocessed whole foods like lean proteins, fresh produce, legumes, and whole grains, and is considered to be one of the healthiest ways to eat for a long life.\n\nAlthough, notably, Wahlberg's breakfast is missing complex carbs.\n\nThe dish is also high in protein, which is essential for building and maintaining muscle as well as supporting metabolic health.\n\nAs the \"The Family Plan 2\" star strength trains daily, extra protein is key. To build muscle, a person needs to eat around 0.75 grams of protein per pound of body weight, sports nutritionist Rob Hobson told Business Insider.\n\n\"If you are pushing weights and you're trying to get this hypertrophy, so the muscle is tearing, then you do need to support that with a bit more protein,\" he said.",

    "title": "Do This Quick (and Quiet) Circuit Workout When You Need a Break From Holiday Family Gatherings",
    "description": "The time may come when you need to tap into the power of passive-aggressive mountain climbers.",
    "fullText": "The holidays are for rest, relaxation, and eating your weight in cookies shaped like reindeer. Your fitness goals can absolutely wait until the new year. But if you find yourself trapped in a house where someone just said, \"well, actually\" for the third time in ten minutes, and you need to escape to your old bedroom before you say something you'll regret—here's a quick (and quiet) bodyweight circuit you can do surrounded by your high school participation trophies.\n\nThese are my favorite beginner-friendly exercises to efficiently blow off some steam. Hopefully you have some floor space next to your twin bed.\n\nThese are classic push-ups, but you're listening intently for footsteps. Is someone coming to ask why you fled the living room? This adds an element of anxious anticipation that really engages your core. Modify on your knees if needed.\n\nDo some deep squats while internally composing the perfect rebuttal you'll never actually say. Feel the burn in your quads and your self-restraint. Make sure you're pushing your hips back until your thighs are parallel with the floor, looking to keep your knees bent at 90 degrees and in line with your toes. Bonus points if you can do these silently enough that no one downstairs hears the floorboards creaking.\n\nLunge from your bed to your old dresser (the one still covered in stickers, right?). Consider each lunge as representing a point in the argument you're nobly choosing not to make. You're not avoiding conflict; you're being the bigger person. And getting stronger glutes!\n\nRemember, when you lunge, keep your front knee over your ankle, not your toes. Keep your torso upright and your core engaged.\n\nHold a plank while contemplating how you've become the most emotionally mature person in your family. This is harder than it sounds, both physically and existentially. If you need to drop to your knees after 20 seconds, that's fine—you're still doing better than the conversation downstairs. My top tip for keeping your body in a straight line is to engage your glutes more than you might think.\n\nQuick, quiet mountain climbers that let you burn off steam without making enough noise to alert anyone that you've rage-quit the family gathering. Imagine you're running away from the discussion, but in place, silently, on your childhood floor.\n\nLie on your back (hey, you're already thinking about taking a nap anyway), feet flat, and lift those hips. Each bridge is you rising above the drama. You're literally elevating yourself. Metaphorically and gluteally.\n\nFinish with bicycle crunches while pretending you're pedaling away from this entire situation. Alternate elbow to opposite knee and find your center.\n\nSit on the edge of your too-small bed, breathing deeply, feeling virtuously exercised and only slightly guilty for abandoning your family. Check your phone. Consider going back downstairs. Hear a raised voice mention \"fake news\" or \"snowflake\" or whatever the discourse is today. Do another round.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Manchester City at the City Ground (kick-off 12:30 GMT).\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\nOla Aina is \"progressing well\" in his recovery from a hamstring injury but is still rebuilding his fitness. He played for the B team on Monday night and came through the match \"fine and injury-free\". It is \"another step forward\" for the defender.\n\nOn the lack of intensity and urgency shown in the defeat to Fulham, Dyche said: \"You have to park these things pretty quickly. We did well overall, we weren't a million miles off. It wasn't the intensity we showed in the Tottenham game or out in Utrecht though.\"\n\nHe added: \"The game was a bit flat in general. Our fans were terrific, they were trying to get the team going, as was I. Sometimes the hardest thing is when everyone is having a bit of a down day.\"\n\nIt is \"unlikely\" that he will be weighing his players, like Pep Guardiola, before the Manchester City game. He joked: \"Is he weighing himself, do you think? One rule for one - come on, Pep!\"\n\nHe explained his philosophy around the festive period: \"I just look for my players to have a bit of common sense. I don't mind them having a Christmas dinner, why not?\" He believes \"psychology is important as anything with athletes\" and Christmas Day is \"a big part\" of life.\n\nFitness is \"very important\" but he isn't \"obsessed over weights\". He will \"encourage\" his players to \"enjoy\" the festivities, especially because they don't play until 27 December.\n\nOn opposition manager Guardiola, Dyche said: \"It is fantastic what he has achieved, there's no two ways about it. Only Sir Alex Ferguson probably tops him. He has done massive things for himself, his players and football in general.\"\n\nThe Reds will be hoping Manchester City are \"having a quiet day\" when they visit the City Ground. However, Forest will still need to play \"very well\" because they are facing a team who are \"always prepared\".\n\nDyche added: \"It's unlikely we are going to dominate the ball, so we have to be defensively sound and do all the hard yards.\"\n\nNottingham Forest's Premier League win-loss-win-loss-win-loss form \"will do\" this season, \"if it keeps going\". He explained: \"If you do the stats, if that carried on for the whole season then it would equal a pretty good situation.\"\n\nHowever, the biggest thing for Dyche is the team \"finding consistency\" - whether that be in terms of their \"training schedule or performances\" - but he recognises that will take time.\n\nHe is predicting a \"slow\" January transfer window because of the club's investment in the summer. On the other hand, he added: \"The club have shown that if players become available at the right times, they can make things happen - so you never know.\"\n\nFollow all of Tuesday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news",

    "description": "The \"future\" of fitness just can't beat more affordable solutions.",
    "fullText": "I've been getting relentless Instagram ads for AI-powered home gyms lately. You've probably seen them, too—sleek wall-mounted screens with impossibly toned instructors, testimonials promising \"the future of fitness,\" and before-and-after transformations that make it all look effortless.\n\nThe smart home gym equipment market is booming. According to Business Wire, the industry was valued at $3.2 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $4 billion by 2030. The numbers show plenty of people are investing in fitness technology that offers personalized, convenient, and effective home workouts. Fitness is yet another way to feed the AI beast, transforming boring old equipment into highly sophisticated systems capable of delivering real-time feedback, tracking performance, and adjusting workouts to each user's needs. It all sounds impressive—revolutionary, even. But here's the thing about fitness trends: It takes a lot more than the latest technology to make them stick.\n\nAfter months of watching these ads follow me around the internet, I got curious enough to actually dig into what these things are and whether they're worth the hype, and if the math really adds up for most people.\n\nWhatever your fitness goal is, the way to get it done is going to be time-tested and probably not too glamorous. Look at Tae Bo, Zumba, shake weights, even the world of Crossfit—most fitness fads don't have staying power once the novelty wears off.\n\nSure, exercise science evolves, but not nearly as fast as whatever trendy gadget cycles through the cultural zeitgeist. In this way, we see “fitness” get reduced to a consumer product—something to be purchased, used briefly, and then tossed aside when something shinier comes along. In 2025, spin classes are out, while Pilates and strength training are in, and that Bowflex is probably collecting dust in your mom’s basement.\n\nIn fact, in 2024 both Bowflex and American Home Fitness, two companies that bet big on the home fitness boom, filed for bankruptcy. In more recent history, Peloton once seemed unstoppable. Now, Peloton's revenue declined 2.8% in 2024 to $2.71 billion, marking its third consecutive year of declining revenue. What was once a cultural phenomenon now struggles to retain members and justify its premium pricing.\n\nFor something to stick in fitness, three questions matter: Is it affordable? Does it work? Will you personally keep coming back to it?\n\nAI home gyms might work, and you might keep coming back, but that first question is where things get complicated.\n\nAI home gyms are digital fitness systems that combine hardware with software to create a personalized workout experience at home. The most well-known is probably Tonal, but there's also Tempo, Speediance, Amp, and others.\n\nHere's how they typically work: Tonal, for instance, is a wall-mounted unit about the size of a large TV that uses electromagnetic resistance instead of traditional weights. You pull cables attached to adjustable arms, and the system can provide up to 200 pounds of resistance digitally. Built-in cameras and sensors track your movements, and the AI adjusts the weight in real-time based on your form and performance. A screen displays instructors leading classes, tracks your reps and sets, and the system learns your strength patterns over time to suggest when you should increase weight or modify exercises.\n\nOther systems work differently—Tempo uses free weights with 3D sensors that watch your form, while some use smart cables or connected dumbbells—but the core promise is the same: sophisticated technology that monitors your workout, corrects your form, tracks your progress, and adapts to your fitness level, all from your living room.\n\nSmart home gyms do offer legitimate benefits, including compact convenience, personalization, time savings, structured workouts, and potentially better injury prevention through form monitoring. And for many, devices like Tonal, Amp, and others are here to stay. “As a professional home gym equipment tester,” says Jose Guevara of ShreddedDad, “I've seen more of these continue to pop up not only in full training stations, but also in specific equipment, like cable machines, dumbbells, and sometimes a combination of both. They'll never have the longevity of weight plates or barbells, but there is an audience for them.\"\n\nAccording to Guevera, these systems appeal to \"those people who need guidance and want a done-for-you system where they can choose on-demand workouts where they can just follow along and not have to think about what to do for their workout.”\n\nThere is an audience for these products, just as there's an audience for Peloton bikes and high-end boutique fitness studios. But to me, the relevant question isn't whether they work for some people—it's whether they're the revolutionary solution to home fitness they're marketed as, or just another expensive piece of equipment that most people will use enthusiastically for a few months before the novelty wears off.\n\nStill, another Tonal user told me that comparing these AI systems to a Bowflex machine from the 1990s is like comparing a surgical robot to using a rusty scalpel. But this analogy assumes your body is a machine where the logic of “endless innovation” holds up. A smart gym isn’t exactly a medical solution. It's an accessory, a luxury good that depends on who can afford it. I don’t think the problem with working out at home has never been that we lacked sophisticated enough technology. The problem is that working out is hard, consistency is harder, and no amount of AI can fundamentally change that human reality. There are some things you just can’t hack.\n\nThere are hefty upfront costs for these products. Take Tonal, one of the leading AI home gym systems. It's around $4,300 for the unit itself, $295+ for mandatory professional installation, plus bundled smart accessories. Then comes the recurring monthly membership fee of around $60 for full access to classes and features. All told, you're looking at roughly $5,300 in the first year, followed by $720 annually for the subscription.\n\nCompare that to traditional gym memberships. According to a 2023 report, the average monthly cost of a gym membership is $58, which works out to about $696 per year. Budget options like Planet Fitness run as low as $15 to $23 per month, or $180 to $276 annually. Even mid-tier gyms like LA Fitness typically cost $40 to 56 per month.\n\nSo, to break even on a Tonal, compared to a mid-range gym membership at $50/month:\n\nYear 1: Tonal costs $5,300. A gym membership costs $600. You're already $4,700 in the hole.\n\nYear 2: You pay $720 for Tonal's subscription. The gym still costs $600. You're now $4,820 behind.\n\nYear 3: Another $720 vs. $600. Now you're $4,940 in deficit.\n\nIt would take roughly eight years of consistent use before Tonal becomes cost-competitive with a traditional gym membership. Eight years. That's assuming the hardware doesn't malfunction, the company doesn't go under (remember, Bowflex and Peloton couldn't sustain their models), and you actually use it consistently for nearly a decade.\n\nAnd the subscription costs are real. Unlike traditional weights that work whether or not you're paying a monthly fee, many digital fitness products require a subscription as long as you want to access workouts. \"I've seen some of these companies also go out of business,\" Guevara says, \"so if that happens, you're stuck with a product that doesn't function if their software is not kept up with.\" We've watched other companies’ subscription traps effectively brick your hardware.\n\nNow, proponents will argue that you save on commute time and costs. Fair enough. But for the Tonal investment to be \"worth it\" financially, you'd need to use it at least three to four times per week for those eight years straight. If you weren’t driving to a gym you pay $50/month for, are you sure you’ll consistently use your smart gym for years and years once the novelty wears off?\n\nThere’s another unspoken cost to at-home convenience, akin to people who struggle with WFH setups: the absence of gym culture. Don’t underestimate the power of casual human interaction, personal trainers who can physically adjust your form, accountability from workout buddies, the ritual of leaving your house to exercise, or maybe even the silent camaraderie of shared suffering. If you’re like me, that separation between home and workout space is a major psychological boost.\n\nThe best exercise is the one you'll actually keep doing. If you run the numbers and a Tonal makes sense for your budget and workout habits, great. Personally, as AI creeps into every other corner of my life, I find a lot of comfort in my workouts as a rare screen-free activity.\n\nMy gripe with AI home gyms is when they’re marketed as must-have solutions, instead of what they are: luxury goods, something available only to those with disposable income and spare square footage. On a grand scale, given their current costs, AI home gyms look like a passing trend to me. And two years from now, when the next fitness innovation promises to finally solve at-home workouts, I bet someone will write this same article all over again.",

    "description": "Isak Injury Raises January Signings Questions for LiverpoolLiverpool are facing an uncomfortable period of uncertainty after concerns emerged over the fitness of Alexander Isak, with early indications...",
    "fullText": "Liverpool are facing an uncomfortable period of uncertainty after concerns emerged over the fitness of Alexander Isak, with early indications suggesting the striker could be sidelined for a significant period. While the full extent of the injury is still being assessed, the situation has already sharpened internal discussions around January signings and squad depth during a decisive phase of the season.\n\nIsak’s injury arrives at an awkward moment. Liverpool have invested heavily in attacking options over the past year, yet circumstances have shifted quickly. Injuries, suspensions and international commitments are converging, leaving the club exposed in areas that were expected to be well covered. The coming days, particularly the results of further medical examinations, will play a critical role in shaping Liverpool’s strategy for the winter transfer window.\n\nThere is a deliberate sense of caution around Isak’s condition. Liverpool are waiting for comprehensive scan results before forming a definitive prognosis, but early concern within the club suggests the issue may not be short-term. The striker was visibly distressed when leaving the pitch, and staff were immediately aware that the injury could carry broader implications beyond one match or even one month.\n\nSince his arrival, Isak’s time on Merseyside has already been disrupted by physical setbacks. Another prolonged absence would not only slow his own adaptation but also place additional strain on a forward line that is already being reshaped week by week. Liverpool’s medical team are understood to be taking a conservative approach, prioritising long-term recovery over any rushed return.\n\nLiverpool had been monitoring the January market even before Isak’s injury, but the urgency has increased according to the Telegraph. Recruitment staff are actively reviewing options who could provide immediate cover across the front line, particularly players capable of operating in multiple attacking roles. Flexibility is seen as essential, given the unpredictable nature of injuries and suspensions during the second half of the campaign.\n\nWhile no final decision has been taken, the possibility of January signings is firmly on the table. Liverpool are unlikely to make reactive or inflated deals, yet there is an acceptance internally that the squad may require reinforcement to sustain momentum domestically and in Europe. Financially, the club retains scope to act, having planned prudently despite substantial recent expenditure.\n\nThe preference would be for a player who can contribute straight away rather than a long-term project. Availability, fitness history and adaptability to the Premier League are all being weighed carefully as part of the assessment process.\n\nIsak’s injury is not an isolated issue. Liverpool are managing a growing list of absentees, with several players either unavailable or facing enforced breaks due to suspension and international duty. This congestion is placing additional responsibility on a relatively small group of attackers, increasing the risk of fatigue and further injuries.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, the coaching staff are already exploring short-term adjustments to manage workloads and maintain attacking output. However, internal belief remains that structural solutions, rather than temporary fixes, may be required if Isak is ruled out for an extended period.\n\nThe January schedule offers little margin for error. League fixtures, cup commitments and the broader demands of a title challenge mean Liverpool cannot afford a prolonged dip in attacking efficiency.\n\nMuch depends on the clarity that emerges from Isak’s medical assessment. A minor setback would likely see Liverpool hold their position and trust the depth already in place. A more serious diagnosis, however, would almost certainly accelerate plans around January signings.\n\nLiverpool’s approach remains calm and methodical. There is no appetite for panic, but there is also a recognition that inaction carries its own risks. The balance between patience and decisiveness will define their winter strategy, with Isak’s injury acting as the central variable.\n\nFor now, the club wait. Yet behind the scenes, preparations are being made to ensure Liverpool are not left short-handed should the worst-case scenario materialise.",

    "description": "Outside the gym, Martha Stewart says she tries to stay active by walking, gardening, and working.",
    "fullText": "Fitness trends come and go, but at 84, Martha Stewart remains loyal to the workout routine she has followed for years.\n\n\"I've worked out ever since I can remember,\" Stewart told Women's Health in an interview published on Friday. Even outside the gym, she makes it a point to stay active.\n\n\"I walk a whole lot. I garden a whole lot. I go to work in New York [City] pretty much five days a week or do my traveling,\" she said.\n\nStewart said her go-to exercises haven't changed much.\n\n\"I might not be as energetic as I used to be, but I'm pretty good,\" she said. \"The amount of weights and things that I use are pretty much the same as they've always been, so I'm strong. I'm very strong.\"\n\nAt 6:30 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Stewart heads into a mat and reformer Pilates session with her instructor. \"I do a very intense program, and it's nonstop for 45 minutes,\" she said.\n\nSince she regularly commutes into the city by car, Stewart says Pilates helps her stay loose and flexible. \"It also is very good for strengthening one's bones, keeping one limber, working with aches and pains, stretching out,\" she said.\n\nShe practices yoga too, though less frequently than Pilates.\n\n\"Pilates reminds me a little bit of yoga,\" she said. \"I end with yoga stretches on blocks at Pilates.\"\n\nHer Tuesday and Thursday mornings are reserved for 45 minutes of strength training with her trainer, using mostly dumbbells and machines.\n\nDespite her busy schedule, Stewart remains committed to her fitness. \"Even when I get home late at night, I still go and do my workout,\" she added.\n\nA key part of her wellness routine also involves drinking green juice every morning, made with fresh vegetables from her garden. \"That's a priority,\" she said.\n\nTo make the green juice, Stewart typically mixes spinach, cucumbers, parsley, celery, and mint, and sometimes adds ginger or half an orange, including the peel.\n\n\"I grow that [produce] year-round,\" she said. \"It's very important that they be grown in my own organic soil, and it makes delicious juice.\"\n\nIn 2023, Stewart told Business Insider that Pilates and green juice helped her prepare for her iconic Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover.\n\n\"If you have my green juice every day, you would just feel great all the time,\" she said.\n\nStewart is one of several Hollywood stars who believe wellness comes down to sticking with what works.\n\nSpeaking to People in January, Jane Fonda said her workout routine hasn't changed much over the years either.\n\n\"I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,\" Fonda, now 88, said. \"I used to be a runner, but now I love walking. I love being outdoors in the woods, especially up and down hills.\"\n\nIn April, Helen Mirren told The Times that she still considers a 12-minute military workout developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1950s to be her go-to exercise.\n\nShe also encouraged those in their 50s and 60s to incorporate low-impact physical activities into their lives.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be joining a gym. It can be small changes like taking a short walk or practicing yoga, which I still enjoy,\" she said.",

    "title": "Is there a secret to playing college sports? This boys coach says yes",
    "description": "Linda Martindale, a boys high school coach, mental fitness expert and mom to collegiate players, says college athletes have this special ingredient.",
    "fullText": "Linda Martindale wasn’t brave, at least she didn’t think she was after she had been hired as a varsity boys basketball coach.\n\n“Once the game started, I was fine,” says Martindale, now in her sixth season leading Lincoln-Sudbury (MA), “but walking into the gym and people thinking I'm the scorekeeper or whatever, I had to sort of overcome this feeling of, ‘Do I belong in the gym?’ ”\n\nShe made the three words her mantra, and she convinced herself she was brave. You need to be as an athlete, or a coach, in today’s world of youth sports.\n\n“I have fond memories of my athletic career, but I also know there was a lot of heartache and it was very difficult,” says Martindale, who played Division II basketball at Alaska-Anchorage and in the old Pac-10 at Arizona in the late 1980s and early 1990s. “But nowadays, it's totally different. Your whole career is splashed all over social media.”\n\nMartindale’s father devoted his life to coaching baseball and football, driving her and her three siblings to be punctual and polite. He was hard on them, she says, but led with love.\n\n“If I had a bad game, the people in the stands knew and my parents knew, and that was it,” Martindale tells USA TODAY Sports. “You'd come home and your parents would say, ‘How did the game go?' You could self-report that. Easy to deal with.\n\n“My oldest son would literally get DMs from strangers that say horrible things if he missed a free throw in the clutch. The landscape is very different. And it obviously trickles down to youth.”\n\nMartindale got certified as a mental fitness coach to help ease the pressure on her three sons and one daughter (all of them have played college sports) but also other young athletes.\n\nShe works with sports teams at Division I Holy Cross and D-III Curry College, as well as individual athletes. She says there’s a secret beyond the physical component to playing sports in college.\n\nWe offer 10 ways, through consultation with Martindale, for parents to help athletes get there.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nWhen Martindale walked into the gym feeling the male eyes on her, she felt she needed an inner coach.\n\nYour coach on the court or field will tell you what to do but, Martindale says, the one in your head will kick you in the butt to help get you where you need to go.\n\nJenny Levy, who has won four national titles as North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, believes so strongly in an inner coach she likes when her players form their own mantras.\n\n“Confidence looks good on you,” she heard her players say to each other in 2013, the year they broke through.\n\n“A lot of coaches will say, ‘This is our saying,’ ” Levy told Martindale on Martindale’s ‘Game Changers’ podcast. “And I think that’s fine – to each his own – but I actually let our team organically come up with their own little things. This is the team having a good time together.”\n\nThe inner voice tells you it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, only what you do.\n\nTo come up with your own mantra, Martindale says, ask yourself why you play a sport? Look for performance cues to grind that thought into you.\n\n“It's not fun to lose, but it's still really fun to compete and to play,” Martindale says. “OK, good, let's start with that. So at least you can say it's not fun to lose, but it's really fun to prepare for the game. We've now established that the majority of the time is fun. Now we can get through the parts that aren't fun.”\n\nWas that ‘fun’? How Coco Gauff’s tough US Open embodies what the word means\n\nKids respond to the truth. We don’t need to always sugarcoat it.\n\nInstead of saying, “It’s not so hard,” acknowledge that something is.\n\nMaybe you’re afraid that you might lose or you’re going to make a fool of yourself in front of everybody.\n\n“I'm happy that you can articulate a fear,” Martindale might tell an athlete. “Now, let's squash it. What are you really afraid of? Is it really embarrassing to lose, or is it embarrassing not to play at all?\n\n“It would be embarrassing if you threw yourself on the floor and screamed and cried in the middle of the game. But nobody thinks it's embarrassing that you sat on the bench, cheered on your team, and then fought another day to try to get some minutes.”\n\nA current role doesn’t mean an ultimate role. Martindale goes back to Tom Brady.\n\nHe was once buried deep on Michigan’s depth chart. But he focused on nailing reps he got in practice. He was at game speed when he found himself starting.\n\n“As parents, we say, ‘I don't think you should have to be the backup quarterback,' \" Martindale says. “ 'I think you should be the quarterback.’ This is not helping. What you need to do is crush being the backup. And then your time comes and you're ready instead of spending so much time worrying that you don't have the role that you want (and) you're not ready for it.”\n\nAnother of her podcast guests, Luke Avdalovic, a former walk-on basketball player at Northern Arizona University, told her: “I had a teammate named JoJo Anderson and he told me, ‘If you want to find a role into this team, find one thing that you’re really good at. Make sure you’re head and shoulders better than every single other person on the team. Then they can’t take you off the floor.’ ”\n\nAvdalovic became a top sharpshooter who rose to the NBA G-League.\n\nAvdalovic has shot so much over the years he feels he’s never really in a slump. Some days he shoots better than others, but that is just the law of averages.\n\n“You can't be a pitcher if you can't pitch poorly,” Martindale says. “You can't be a shooter if you can't miss. It's just not possible (to) be perfect. So what do you do when you're imperfect?”\n\nThe next time your son or daughter has a bad game, ask them, “Did you compete hard?”\n\nYou don’t want them to lose or fail but they need to know how to do both. As parents, and as coaches, our best support can come out of struggles.\n\nYou know the term if you’re a baseball fan. Suddenly, Steve Sax or Chuck Knoblauch can’t make a routine throw from second to first base, or Rick Ankiel can’t throw a strike.\n\n“Yips is not a real thing,” Martindale says.\n\nStruggles come alive, she says, when we say them out loud. Instead, if you’re a parent or a coach, tell your athlete: “I really believe in you. Just keep throwing, you'll get it back, you'll find a rhythm.”\n\nWhen kids feel deep-rooted support, they have more confidence in themselves.\n\nMartindale says today’s world for young athletes is like taking the SATs while your score is being put on a scoreboard.\n\nSometimes, it seems, we expect our kids to be good at everything. Martindale asks the ones with whom she works, “What class are you good at?”\n\nShe doesn’t necessarily mean classes in which they have an “A,” but the ones they enjoy most.\n\nSometimes it takes looking at things through a less critical lens. We have an “A” in science, but we enjoy the challenge of English Lit, in which we have a B-, which energizes us to try and bring up the grade.\n\nEugene Glisky, Martindale’s father, had his ashes buried on the field where he coached near Toronto. She suspects he changed the lives of many young men.\n\nBut she stops short of calling a team a family.\n\n“When a coach says to a parent, ‘I'm gonna treat your son or daughter like my own,' I want to say, ‘No, thank you. I don't need you to treat my son like he’s your own,’ ” Martindale says. “He has a great father. What I really want you to do is treat him like a player and a human being.\n\n“It's a team, which is amazing and I love my kid being part of a team. But it's not a family. Why? Because what happens when your family cuts you?”\n\nThere are times when we need to be Coach, and times when we need to be Mom or Dad. Martindale had to be Coach when Judson, her oldest who now plays basketball for Manchester Basketball Club in the United Kingdom, came out of a game when he was younger and looked at her like, “Why are you pulling me?\n\nHe threw his water bottle, and she turned and said: \"You can take your sneakers off. You're done.\"\n\nThe same coach, though, drove him home from a different game, criticizing him for what he didn’t do while failing to realize he was sick.\n\n\"So many examples of total failure by me,\" she says. \"What kind of mother would be talking to their kid about some offensive set when clearly they needed a mother?\"\n\nLevy, North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, does parent Zoom calls. Before the first one, she asked her players what they wanted her to tell them.\n\n“They said, ‘We don’t want to talk about the game at the tailgate after,’ ” Levy told Martindale. “ ‘We don’t want any parent to have this sad conversation after the wins because their kid didn’t play. We want the parents to sit together. We want them to be positive on the sideline.’ ”\n\nLevy says the players gave her a Letterman top 10 of parent no-no’s, which she shared on the Zoom.\n\n“I think they were pretty shocked,” says Levy, who coaches her daughter, Kate, on the team. “Our kids were like, ‘Last year was not OK. This is what we want and this is what we need this year.’\n\n“And then if we saw it, I had permission from our players to call the parent and say, ‘Hey, you’re at the tailgate and your behavior was below the line for our program.’\n\n“What if I acted like that as a parent? What if I did that in the middle of a tailgate?”\n\nLevy’s point: A kid could be completely happy but if the parent is unhappy with their role, then the kid’s unhappy. And if the parent isn’t feeling like their kid is getting a fair shake, or they’re being really negative toward coaches or teammates, the kid internalizes the feeling.\n\n“Your influence is not neutral, parents,” Levy says.\n\nDuring a clip Martindale shared of her speaking to athletes, she says, “There has to be wins in there. Otherwise, you can't go an entire season and be like, ‘If we don't win a game, this whole season is a waste.’ ”\n\nShe is not necessarily talking about checks in the “W” column as much as what we perceive as personal wins. Maybe you tell a teammate you loved the way he blocked a punt or moved into position on defense. If we don’t have wins, even within losses, you don’t learn how to win.\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nMartindale believes there are five pillars of mental fitness: 1. Staying in the moment; 2. Controlling the controllables; 3. Seeing mistakes as opportunities; 4. Not judging yourself (or others) too harshly and 5. Comparison (positively).\n\nShe says she was once a failure at all of them. Has she since learned a special ingredient we need to have to play college sports?\n\nMartindale thinks Angela Duckworth, director of the Penn-Wharton Behavior Change for Good Initiative, said it best.\n\n“It’s grit,” Martindale has said. “I'm obsessed with grit, because we know it's a single defining characteristic of successful people.\n\n“Can you get up after you get knocked down? The athletes who are successful at every level of college, I think, have this kind of dog mentality that is about grit. And of course, you have to be skilled and you have to be athletic but when we really look at who performs best when it counts, it's people who have failed. Over and over and over. And then now they succeed.”\n\nWe can’t beat our kids up over mistakes. Let them hear the voice in their head that gives them the grace to move forward from them.\n\nThen, as Martindale says: “Watch them fail and then watch what they do after they fail.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "title": "How to Use 'Progressive Overload' to Get Stronger",
    "description": "You can't just stick with the same workout forever.",
    "fullText": "As you get stronger, you become able to lift heavier and heavier weights. That's the idea at the heart of an often-misunderstood fitness concept: progressive overload. Unfortuantely, there are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about this principle, so here's how to use it to plan your own workouts or judge whether a program you're following will keep you on track.\n\nProgressive overload is the increase, over time, in the amount of work or stress you ask your body to handle. The term is used two different ways: as a principle of how the human body works, and as a description of how a workout program changes over time. If you want to know how to \"do progressive overload,\" you're thinking of the second one—how to design a workout program.\n\nThe simplest way to implement this is to just do a little more each time you're in the gym. More weight, or more reps, or making the workout harder in some other way. You can still take some easier \"deload\" workouts (or weeks) from time to time, but over the long term you want to see a trend of the workouts getting harder. They won't necessarily feel harder, because you'll be getting stronger. It's more like the workouts are keeping up with you.\n\nIn other words, progressive overload is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. As you get stronger, your workouts need to get harder to keep up. But in a sense you are also becoming stronger because you're challenging yourself with harder workouts.\n\nIf you’re bummed out by the idea of working harder and harder forever, don’t panic. You’ll work harder in absolute terms—by lifting heavier weights, let’s say—but the challenge stays about the same in relative terms. Your workouts will fall into an effort level you might call “hard, but doable,” and you’ll notice progress because your numbers are going up. (A similar approach applies to endurance sports. As cyclist Greg Lemond reportedly said: “It never gets any easier, you just go faster.”)\n\nWhen I started lifting weights many years ago, 65 pounds was a decently challenging bench press for me. I remember being proud of myself for being able to squeeze out a rep or two at 85 pounds. Now, if I’m going to do a bench workout, I don’t even bother loading those amounts onto the bar. My warmup sets start at 95 pounds, and a heavy single might be around 135. That 135 feels just as hard as 85 used to, but it’s undeniably more weight.\n\nHow did I make that progress? Well, I kept lifting the weights that felt heavy for me. Over time, the same weights that used to be challenging started to feel easy, and I needed to add more and more weight to the bar to get something that actually felt heavy. (I have a guide here to figuring out whether you’re lifting “heavy.”)\n\nMost of the time, I either followed a program that told me how many pounds to lift, increasing that amount slowly over time, or one that told me what effort level to lift at (a concept called RPE), which allowed me to choose an appropriate weight each day. Following a program will usually net you better progress than just winging it, but as long as you’re using the overload principle and the progression principle, you will get stronger.\n\nHere are some examples of workout routines that use progressive overload:\n\nDouble progression. Let's say you're aiming for three sets of eight to 12 reps of dumbbell shoulder press. You choose a weight that you can handle for 3 sets of 8 reps. The next time you do shoulder press, try to add at least one rep. If you can't, that's fine—just do your three sets of eight. One day maybe you'll get 10 reps on the first set, then only eight on the next two. Another time maybe you get 12, 10, and eight. After a few weeks you manage three full sets of 12. That means it's time to increase the weight! The next time you do the exercise, you'll use a heavier set of dumbbells and start again at three sets of eight. It's called \"double\" progression because first you increase the reps, and then you increase the weight.\n\nLinear progression. This is a common progression for barbell exercises for beginners. You do the same number of reps every time (say, five sets of five reps) but add a small amount of weight every workout. Often the program will have instructions for what to do if you can't complete the five sets of five reps at the new weight. These workouts aren't usually realistic for experienced lifters, since you can't keep increasing the weight forever, but they're great for people who are learning an exercise for the first time or returning to the gym after a break.\n\nSet progression. This may be used along with double progression, or may be its own thing. You start with just a few sets of an exercise per workout, say two or three, and then add a set each week. Once you're doing, say, five sets, you'll start over with heavier weight. If you're using it with double progression, you'll increase sets, and then reps, and then weight.\n\nDensity progression. This is commonly used in timed sets, like Crossfit WODs (\"workout of the day\") or for accessory lifts. Set a timer for several minutes and do as many reps as possible in the given time, resting as needed. The next time you do the workout, try to do more reps in the same amount of time. Once you can do the lifts with little to no rest, you'll either add weight or find another way to make the exercises harder (for example, doing dips instead of pushups).\n\nAs you can see, weight isn't the only variable that progresses. You can increase reps, or sets, or increase the amount of work you do in a given time by decreasing rest. You can increase the difficulty by choosing a harder exercise (like progressing from dips to pushups). As long as things get harder over time, you're doing progressive overload.\n\nAdding weight is part of most progressive overload schemes, but you don’t have to add weight to the bar literally every time you lift. There’s a wide range of weights and rep ranges that can be effective for building strength and muscle. For example, if I did a bench workout today, I might do sets of 10 at 100 pounds, or sets of five at 120, or some heavy singles at 140, or any combination of these. If I’m really tired or stressed, I might decide to do the sets of 10 at just 90 pounds. If I’m feeling great, I might be able to do them at 105. This is what I mean by a wide range: All of these are hard enough work to spur my muscles to adapt and get stronger. (There are reasons you might choose one of these workouts over the others, but we don’t need to get into those details at the moment.)\n\nWhat wouldn’t be progressive overload? Well, if I did sets of 10 with just the bar, that wouldn’t help me get stronger. If I had a mini barbell set, and it maxed out at 85 pounds, my strength would stagnate once I got to the point where 85 pounds isn’t a challenging weight anymore.\n\nEven as your strength improves, you don’t have to do more every single workout, as long as you’re getting stronger in the long term, and your workouts are still in the range that is challenging to you.\n\nSo let’s say you’re doing bicep curls with a 10-pound dumbbell. You can do eight or 10 reps with it. Perfect. But the only way to add weight, at your gym, might be to pick up a 15-pound dumbbell. If that weight is too heavy for you, that’s okay. Keep working with the 10-pounder, and in time you’ll be ready for the 15.\n\nWhile you’re probably itching to lift heavier weights, weight on the bar is not the only way to progress. Sometimes you can’t add weight because of equipment issues, or just because your strength is improving slowly. (Even if your beginner gains were meteoric, everybody’s progress slows down at some point.)\n\nBut if you’re smart, you probably don’t want to only get better at one specific thing. A lot of beginners start off doing squat, bench, and deadlift in sets of five reps, and trying to add weight each workout. But you’ll be a more well-rounded lifter if you also know how to lift heavy singles and sets of 10 or 15. Depending on your goals you might consider front squats in addition to back squats, and reverse hypers or kettlebell swings in addition to deadlifts. There are ways to improve at all of these things, and it’s normal for a lifter to be simultaneously increasing their reps in accessory lifts, increasing their weight on the bar for heavy singles, and increasing the amount of time they spend on conditioning workouts.\n\nNot every workout or routine will have progressive overload built in. For example, if you have a favorite workout that you do every day, but you never make it any harder (say, it's always three sets of ten pushups), you won't make progress over time. That's OK if you enjoy the workout for another reason, like if you're just trying to get the mental health benefits of a little exercise boost in the morning. But if you want to get better at pushups, you need to find a way to do more of them over time, or make them harder in some way (like elevating your feet, or doing them with a backpack on).\n\nWorkouts with progressive overload tend to be personalized to you. If the workout tells you exactly what to do, down to the exact weight of dumbbell to pick up, it's not giving you room to choose the weight that matches your current strength level. The 12-3-30 treadmill workout, for example, is the same for everyone every time. If it's one-size-fits-all, there's no way to progress.\n\nThat said, some workouts have a sneaky progression built in. If you jog for 30 minutes each day, chances are you'll get a little faster over time even if you don't realize it, and then you're doing more work within the same amount of time. Or if you do \"three sets of 10\" of an exercise, but each day you pick up whatever dumbbells feel appropriate for that level, you'll probably end up using heavier ones over time. Just make sure you don't get stuck doing the exact same thing month in and month out.\n\nOne last thing, now that we’ve discussed what progressive overload looks like. It’s important to remember that progression happens in the long term. Some competitive lifters might not test their one-rep max outside of competition, which means they’ll only find out once or twice a year how much their deadlift has gone up. That doesn’t mean they haven’t progressed in the meantime. If they’re doing an effective program, consistently challenging themselves, they’re still working.\n\nPlateaus are a fact of life when you’re a lifter. Sometimes it takes a while to get stronger. Sometimes you need to work on your technique to be able to express your newfound strength. Sometimes factors like stress or weight loss or changes in your training can make you weaker in the short term, but if you keep training in a way that challenges you, you’ll set new PRs soon enough.",
