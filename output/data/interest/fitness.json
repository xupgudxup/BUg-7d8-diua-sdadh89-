    "description": "These are the essential settings tweaks, lesser-known features, and apps you'll love for workouts.",
    "fullText": "The Apple Watch is a powerful tool for following and tracking exercise. We’ve already shown you 10 hacks for all Apple Watch users, but I’m here with a follow-up on the fitness features, specifically. With these lesser-known settings, apps, and features, you can get more out of your workouts and your health data.\n\nThe Apple Watch’s Fitness app famously includes three rings (Move, Exercise, Stand) that you can close with activity throughout the day. Not only should you change your Move and Exercise goals to numbers that work for you (raising or lowering them as appropriate), you can also schedule in different goals for each day.\n\nOriginally, your Move, Exercise, and Stand goals were the same every day, but these days you can change your ring-closing goals, including adding rest days. Go to the Fitness app and tap the Activity Rings card, and then tap the “+/-” icon next to each goal. You can create a weekly schedule so that you have lower targets on certain days. You can also change a goal temporarily just for today—for example, reducing your Stand hour goal on a day you’re taking a road trip.\n\nThe Apple Watch is meant to be worn on the wrist, but that doesn’t mean you have to wear it there. If your workout has you snatching kettlebells or bench pressing in wrist wraps, consider wearing the Watch on your upper arm. Or if you use a standing desk, your steps may not register unless you put the Watch on your ankle. Both of these locations will likely require a bigger wristband than what came with the Watch. Fortunately, you can buy an extra-long band, like this one.\n\nThis is a tiny hack, but one that makes it so much easier to operate your watch mid-workout: Press the crown, and you’ll see all your installed apps. By default, they appear as little icons clustered together. You can rearrange them if you like, but no matter the arrangement, they’re tough to accurately tap while you’re running down the street. Make life easier on yourself by scrolling to the bottom of this screen, and tap List View. This puts your apps in an alphabetical list, with the name next to each icon. It’s now far easier to tap anything you might need during your workout.\n\nThe Apple Watch collects a lot of data, but Apple doesn’t give you a convenient way to view it all in one place. The Fitness app has workout data, and the Health app stores everything else—but the Health app isn’t as user-friendly as you might wish. Third-party apps have stepped in to fill the gap. Bevel, for example, provides recovery scores and collects data in much the same way you’d see from a Whoop or Oura ring. There are other apps that do the same thing, like Athlytic, but I’m recommending Bevel because it has a free tier (and most of its functionality is on that tier). If you like the experience, consider shopping around to see if you prefer other apps.\n\nThe Workout app on Apple Watch has evolved quite a bit from its original format as a simple tracker with a start and stop button. The current version of the Fitness app has a little timer icon in the corner of each workout type, under the Workouts tab. Tap that, and you can view and edit custom workouts. Program yourself an interval workout, or a workout of a specific length. You can do this most easily from your phone—Apple has instructions here.\n\nIf you run or bike the same route often, try the Race Route feature. Routes are automatically generated after you do the same run twice. On the Watch itself, go to the Workout app and choose a Run or Cycle workout, then tap the timer icon to bring up options including race routes. You can choose to race your personal best time on that route, or just your last workout on that route. During the activity, you’ll see whether you’re keeping pace with that previous workout.\n\nOne of the best upgrades to iOS 26 is that the Fitness app can now track workouts even without the Apple Watch. If you left your watch at home but still want to get a run in, you can track it directly from your phone. Just go to the Fitness app, then Workout, and then tap whichever type of workout you’d like to do. If you choose an outdoor workout like a run, your phone will track your distance and pace with the phone’s GPS. If you choose an indoor workout, the app can still log the workout with a timer, but it won’t be able to collect any data. You’ll get a readout with the amount of time you worked out, and an estimate of your calorie burn, and you can rate your effort so the workout counts toward your training load. If you have a device that can measure your heart rate—like a chest strap or headphones like the Powerbeats Pro 2—you can pair that device directly to your iPhone, without involving the watch, and track your workout through the Fitness app with heart rate data intact.\n\nThe Apple Watch is pretty good at judging distance and speed outdoors when you run, and your iPhone can do a good job of that, too. But once you’re indoors on a treadmill, only the treadmill knows how far you’re running. The Apple Watch’s distance estimations aren’t always very good. That is, unless you’re using a treadmill that can beam data directly to your watch. The treadmills in a lot of commercial gyms have this feature through a system called GymKit. In your Settings on the watch, go to Workout and turn on Detect Gym Equipment. When you use a compatible gym machine, there will be a spot on the console to tap your watch. You’ll hear a beep, and then the data on your watch will be synced to the data on the machine.\n\nWe’ve seen that the stock Workout app has plenty of great features for running and other workouts, but many runners and hikers prefer a different option. The Apple Watch app WorkOutDoors gives Garmin-level mapping and data analytics during your run. It takes a bit of time to learn your way around all the features, but this is an incredibly powerful tool for just a small investment ($8.99 as a one-time charge).\n\nIf you use the Apple Watch to track your sleep, you don’t have the option of charging it while you sleep. But don’t worry if it’s close to bedtime and you’re low on battery—Apple Watches, especially the most recent models, are designed to charge quickly for exactly this reason. The Apple Watch Series 11 only needs five minutes of charge time for eight hours of sleep tracking.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have a Saturday lunchtime kick-off this weekend as interim manager Michael Carrick aims to make it four wins from four by beating Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford. Carrick’s 100% record in this stint as interim is all the more impressive given that two of the victories came against the two best sides in the country, Arsenal and Manchester City.\n\nA pulsating tie against Fulham last weekend also ended in victory after a superb last-minute swivel-and-shoot goal from substitute Ben Sesko.\n\nWhether that sublime bit of skill and calmness under pressure will be enough to see the Slovenian reinstated into the starting line-up is probably the biggest dilemma the boss will have to face when naming his side.\n\nAn unchanged defence is once again expected despite shipping two goals against the Cottagers. This means Senne Lammens in goal, Diogo Dalot at right-back, Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez the centre-backs and Luke Shaw at left-back.\n\nTyrell Malacia was stopped from completing a loan move this week, suggesting there may be a fitness issue with Shaw. This could be confirmed at the pre-match press conference this afternoon (available here from around 3pm).\n\nNouss Mazraoui is another defensive option, as are Ayden Heaven and Leny Yoro, but Matthijs de Ligt is unlikely to be fit after a long injury.\n\nPatrick Dorgu is also out injured.\n\nThe midfield trio of Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes is also likely to be unchanged. Casemiro put in a masterclass against Fulham and will continue to keep Manuel Ugarte on the sidelines.\n\nWithout the option of Dorgu, Carrick could also leave his forward line of Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha unchanged. However, Sesko is knocking very loudly on the door. If he were introduced, the Brazilian is the most likely to give way even though it would mean either Amad or Mbeumo playing on the left.\n\nMason Mount and Josh Zirkzee are other options but are unlikely to be in the frame for a starting berth.\n\nUnchanged side likely, with two possible exceptions.\n\nLuke Shaw’s fitness may be an issue.\n\nBen Sesko could force his way in.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Whether you’re chasing gym quality on a budget or a fancy folding model, accelerate your training with our expert’s pick of the best running machines\n\nThe best running shoes, tried and tested by runners\n\n The best running watches\n\nAlthough the treadmill has been around since the early 1800s, when it was once used to punish prisoners (sounds about right), it didn’t become a common feature in the home until the late 1960s, when William Staub unleashed his PaceMaster 600 on the US public.\n\nWhere they were once a simple rolling deck, treadmills today are often glossy pieces of interactive tech. Many now offer on-demand, real-time workouts (pioneered by Peloton) and the latest blockbuster movies via streaming services. Even if your treadmill doesn’t sport a whopping touchscreen display, it probably works nicely with heart-rate monitors, smartwatches and smartphone apps to track workouts and offer performance statistics after every session.\n\nRunning decks have become more cushioned to offer better joint protection, and motor technology is now quieter and more efficient than ever. A treadmill still takes up a fair amount of space, but there are now compact folding options to help address this.\n\nThe best treadmills on sale now are a far cry from those torturous devices designed to make the incarcerated sweat away their sins, offering ingenious ways to keep fit and, perhaps more importantly, make fitness more fun.\n\nBest treadmill overall:\n\n Peloton Tread\n\nBest budget treadmill:\nJTX Slimline\n\nBest for gym quality: \n\n JTX Sprint-9 Pro\n\nBest folding treadmill: \n\n ProForm Pro 9000\n\nAs a fitness fan partaking in gym-based strength training, outdoor trail runs, kickboxing classes and cold-water surfing, I have long been tasked with testing exercise gear for leading fitness and technology magazines.\n\nWhatever I’m testing, I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whether that’s surfing with the latest smartwatch in cold weather or feeling the burn with a set of connected kettlebells.\n\nI’m a strong believer in living with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. When it comes to treadmills, that has been to the detriment of any additional storage space my terrace house offers.\n\nWithout wanting to become a “first-world problems” meme, testing treadmills isn’t easy. They’re massive, for one, which means logistical management in having them delivered and then collected.\n\nI tested all the treadmills on this list over several months, trialling some systems for weeks, and others over a couple of arduous sessions. Where I could introduce a model to my home, I did. If it didn’t fit there, it was shoehorned into an office space I rent.\n\nFailing that, I arranged to get hands-on (or should that be feet-on?) with a model at the manufacturer’s headquarters or a dedicated showroom. One of the treadmills was handily used by my local gym.\n\nWith every treadmill, I aimed to test all the connected features, typically pairing a smartwatch (Apple and Garmin) and a chest-based heart-rate monitor, as well as trialling any on-demand video and audio services. Where relevant, I tried live and on-demand workouts on any subscription packages and any gamified content available.\n\nDuring each test, I aimed to rack up as much mileage as possible, sweating it out over longer runs and more intense sprint sessions. If an elevation feature was available, I activated it, and if there was sled or resistance training, I’d dive into that too.\n\nMost of the treadmills were tested in a space where I could assess how much noise they made when in use, rather than trialling them in a busy gym where the thump of a deck or the whine of an electric motor is typically drowned out by background noise.\n\nAll of the units were only ever offered to me on a loan basis, so they’ve made their way back to their respective suppliers. Due to this, it would be wrong of me to comment on their longevity or ability to withstand years of abuse, although I did get a good feel for build quality in the time I spent with them.\n\nPeloton arguably dragged the treadmill into the 21st century when it launched the Tread. The brand ushered in an era of on-demand classes led by real instructors, accountability in the form of live leaderboards and a plethora of engaging workouts able to be performed anywhere and at any time.\n\nWho knew that bolting a big touchscreen to a fairly standard treadmill would cause such a stir? However, Peloton sales soared during the pandemic, and it continues to be one of the best products for most people, beginners and seasoned runners alike. As a result, it has spawned several rivals.\n\nIn terms of cushioning, noise levels and deck comfort, the treadmill experience offered by the Peloton Tread is good, but it’s not the best out there. In fact, there are better for the money. But what makes Peloton worth the cost is that its fitness ecosystem of live and on-demand classes is so good. There’s very little else out there that’s as fun, engaging and supportive, helping not only those at the beginning of their fitness journey but also improving performance in more serious athletes.\n\nWhy we love it\nPeloton’s treadmill itself is a neat piece of equipment, with its compact and easy-to-live-with design slotting into most domestic settings. The unit is competitive in terms of its top speeds and max incline (20km/h and 12.5% grade), while two simple roller mechanisms control both. During some sessions, the Tread will automatically adjust, depending on the goals.\n\nAlthough neither the quietest nor the most cushioned deck to run on, this machine majors in its expansive All-Access membership. This opens up a world of on-treadmill training sessions, live classes hosted by instructors who have now gained quasi-celebrity status, and in-depth training programmes covering everything from couch to 5K up to marathon prep.\n\nShould you not feel like being instructed by a bubbly, gorgeous and irritatingly tanned personal instructor, you can always binge movies, audiobooks and live and on-demand TV shows by harnessing the Peloton Entertainment app offering, or pump a popular music playlist from the impressive 26W front-facing speakers. This is all delivered via the crisp 23.8in full colour, high-definition touchscreen.\n\nAlthough there are now rivals that offer a similar level of interactivity and technology, few have managed to nail the execution quite like Peloton. It’s fun, highly polished and motivating, all at the same time. Above all else, it’s addictive – and surely that’s all you can ask for in the quest to keep fit.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s expensive, and membership to online classes costs an additional £45 a month.\n\nDimensions: 84 x 173 x 157cm (WLH)\nWeight: 132kg\nRunning area: 50 x 150cm\nMax speed: 20km/h\nMax incline: 12.5%\nFolding: no\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, through Peloton’s dedicated Entertainment app\n\nIf you can overlook the fact that this doesn’t feel as robust as its larger, static rivals (see below), this Slimline model from JTX is perfect for those who lack the space at home for a full-size treadmill – it folds flat and can easily be moved into storage when not in use.\n\nThe company also offers an incline version (about £699), which feels surprisingly stable at maximum incline when running, but this cheaper and more basic option is perfect for those who prefer jogging, lower-impact training or simply those who want to increase their daily step count.\n\nWith a 16km/h top speed, it’s no slouch, but the narrow deck and 1.75hp motor won’t suit those hoping for a more punishing workout.\n\nWhy we love it\nUnlike so many treadmills available today, the JTX Slimline is compact and lightweight, making it relatively easy to wheel around tighter spaces. After all, not everyone is blessed with a dedicated gym at home, so we often have to make do with a temporary setup in the living room. The Slimline is perfect for this.\n\nThe machine folds flat when it’s not in use, and it can be propped against a wall or tucked away in a cupboard to keep it out of sight. It features an impressive top speed, which is great for something so compact, while the small performance motor is relatively quiet.\n\nUsers will have to bring their own entertainment in the form of a tablet or music played through headphones, but the unit does feature built-in Bluetooth so it can relay running data to accompanying apps, such as Strava or the Zwift virtual running software.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it feels too flimsy to endure serious sprint training, yet it’s too large and bulky to take the place of a simple walking deck for daily step-count enthusiasts.\n\nDimensions: 70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH)\nWeight: 43kg\nRunning area: 45 x 122cm\nMax speed: 16km/h\nMax incline: 0%\nFolding: yes\nBuilt-in entertainment: no\n\nJTX likes to pride itself on offering commercial-grade fitness equipment for those on a domestic budget. The resulting kit is built to last, comes with a generous warranty and provides a similar experience to what you might find in your local gym.\n\nThe Sprint-9 Pro may lack the bells, whistles and interactive touchscreens of more expensive rivals, but it has a generously sized running deck, a powerful 4hp brushless motor, and a whopping 22km/h top speed at an 11% max incline.\n\nWhy we love it\nWith its punchy motor and serious incline, this treadmill makes it possible to achieve a challenging workout without a fitness professional telling you what to do. You can always set up a tablet or smartphone to indulge in a Peloton-esque experience with the appropriate apps and subscriptions, of course, but JTX also offers 36 preinstalled workout programmes for those who like to keep things slightly more analogue.\n\nThe build quality is excellent, the CushionStep running deck spacious and comfortable, and the built-in Bluetooth speakers make it possible to soundtrack a run when paired with a tablet or phone – just don’t expect Ibiza club levels of sound quality.\n\nDon’t be fooled by its lack of an interactive screen: the Sprint-9 Pro still synchronises running data with services such as Zwift, Strava and Kinomap (as well as connecting to Bluetooth heart-rate monitors). You just have to provide your own technology to make the most of these features.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t have easy-to-reach adjustment dials for speed and incline, and the built-in heart-rate sensors aren’t the most comfortable to hold.\n\nDimensions: 84 x 195 x 155cm (WLH)\nWeight: 125kg\nRunning area: 55 x 152cm\nMax speed: 22km/h\nMax incline: 11%\nFolding: no\nBuilt-in entertainment: no\n\nFolding treadmills can lack the build quality and premium features of their non-collapsible counterparts, but the Pro 9000 is one of the few that aims to pack in the tech. A 3.6hp motor doesn’t want for power, offering a 22km/h top speed and a respectable 12% incline, while the deck features ReBound Pro Cushioning for a little flex underfoot to protect the joints.\n\nThere’s a compromise when it comes to running deck space, though, as it’s slightly narrower than larger, fixed treadmills. However, folding it up is a simple process and, when placed in its upright position, it can be rolled into a cupboard or stored against a wall to free up space.\n\nWhy we love it\nIt’s easy to scrimp on features when producing a folding treadmill, but ProForm packs a lot in here … not to mention an impressive running experience. The motor is plenty powerful enough, with a top speed that rivals anything here, while the Digital Quick Decline/Incline control is great for brutal hill sprint sessions. The deck is great at reaching the desired incline or decline at speed.\n\nProForm has long partnered with iFit, which provides a similar on-demand and live workout environment to Peloton and Technogym. This can be accessed via the wifi-enabled 21.5in HD colour touchscreen display. Users will have to pay a separate monthly subscription, though.\n\nProForm allows access to several streaming services with the touchscreen, as well as the ability to stream music through the twin 2in speakers mounted just below the screen. However, don’t expect mind-blowing performance from these, as it’s often best to stick a pair of headphones on instead.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s not lighter to make packing away a little easier – and the built-in cooling fan is borderline useless.\n\nDimensions: 90 x 196 x 151cm (WLH)\nWeight: 119kg\nRunning area: 51 x 152cm\nMax speed: 22km/h \nMax incline: 12%\nFolding: yes\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes\n\nBest for: running app aficionados\n\nThe T900D is one of the sports brand’s most robust units. It offers pro-grade running speeds and max inclines that can rival more expensive treadmills, and it folds for convenient storage.\n\nIt lacks the connected pizazz of some of the models I’ve tested, and the big, often difficult-to-operate buttons and basic display make it feel like a throwback to treadmills of yore. Yet it performs admirably, offering a generous deck for taller people, as well as simple connectivity with third-party apps, such as Strava and Kinomap.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the build quality isn’t as hardy, and it’s not the nicest piece of design.\n\nDimensions: 88 x 185 x 147cm (WLH); weight: 89kg; running area: 50 x 143cm; max speed: 18km/h; max incline: 10%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: withstanding everyday use\n\nLife Fitness is a common sight in UK gyms and this exact model is in place in one of the fitness facilities I use weekly. It has a basic LCD screen that provides all the running data most users demand, and sessions can be programmed, with control over incline and speeds.\n\nThe build quality is excellent – it’s able to withstand regular punishment – but that is reflected in the price, especially considering the rather basic nature of its built-in programmes and lack of connected features. This is just a good old-fashioned treadmill, which is less likely to cause reliability headaches than some cheaper rivals.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it looks great in a commercial gym, but it’s too basic and bulky for the home.\n\nDimensions: 88 x 202 x 147cm (WLH); weight: 111kg; running area: 51 x 153cm; max speed: 19km/h; max incline: 15%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: immersive training without the big screen\n\nThis is another folding option that follows the ProForm line of thinking – chiefly, a solid running experience without the additional cost of a large touchscreen display. Instead, users are encouraged to tether a smartphone or tablet and make the most of the iFit app, which requires a monthly subscription but opens up the chance to take part in live classes and on-demand workouts. Weighing 90kg, the EXP5i is, however, lighter than the ProForm Pro 9000, and I found it easier to wheel around. The build quality is also excellent.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the running deck is shorter and narrower than many competitors, while the 16km/h top speed will disappoint sprinters.\n\nDimensions: 87 x 180 x 152cm (WLH); weight: 90kg; running area: 51 x 140cm; max speed: 16km/h; max incline: 10%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: premium quality and all-encompassing workouts\n\nThis Italian manufacturer loves nothing more than taking standard gym kit and injecting it with some serious, athlete-inspired smarts. The latest Technogym Run features a slat belt deck, which is not only more cushioning on the knees and other joints but also offers the quietest indoor running experience I have ever tested.\n\nSitting at the premium end of the spectrum, many will balk at the Run’s asking price. But this machine goes beyond merely offering a platform to run on because of its ability to mimic a weighted sled with its Multidrive resistance technology. When set in this mode, users can strengthen muscles in the lower body or intersperse sled work with sprints for high-intensity interval training.\n\nIn addition, Technogym offers access to all its live and on-demand classes, scenic virtual runs and off-tread workouts, which include strength training, yoga and more. Pair it with the firm’s other intelligent fitness equipment and you’ll have one of the smartest setups around.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s priced way beyond what most mere mortals can afford.\n\nDimensions: 83 x 197 x 175cm (WLH); weight: 207kg; running area: 51 x 173cm; max speed: 25km/h; max incline: 15%; folding: no; built-in entertainment: yes, with the Technogym app store allowing access to YouTube, Disney+, Spotify and many more\n\nThere’s a treadmill to suit most budgets, but those with touchscreen displays and interactive features will cost more. The same goes for the most powerful motors, advanced running deck technology and greater connectivity features, as these all demand healthier budgets.\n\nThe most affordable treadmills generally start at about £500 – anything less than that isn’t typically worth your money. Prices then rise to £3,000 or more (see the Technogym Run) for the most technologically advanced and commercial-grade units.\n\nThe smallest treadmill on this list still measures 70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH) and you will want to factor in some wriggle room around that to ensure your arms aren’t bashing against a wall and your head isn’t hitting the ceiling. If storage space is a problem, take a look at the folding treadmills on this list. Typically, they fold flat and feature wheels so that they can be rolled into a more convenient space and stored upright to keep the floor clear.\n\nMore serious runners should look at more powerful motors because they often provide the fastest running speeds and a more natural running experience. Incline and decline features are great for mimicking runs out in the wild, and a well-cushioned deck is important for protecting the joints.\n\nMost manufacturers don’t cite figures for decibel levels emitted during operation, but it’s worth considering that some treadmills are quieter than others. Finally, connected features are fantastic for keeping track of training, ensuring runs are interesting and generally entertaining during an arduous workout. However, that doesn’t mean you necessarily need a massive display, as tethering a tablet or a smartphone can do just as good a job.\n\nIt’s always best to consult the user manual for details on how to lubricate a treadmill belt and how often to do so, as some brands produce systems that don’t need any maintenance and this could void a warranty.\n\nUse a 100% silicone lubricant that the manufacturer supplies, or buy a dedicated treadmill lubricant to avoid damaging the belt. Unplug the treadmill, lift the edges of the treadmill belt and apply lubricant in a zigzag fashion to the centre where your feet strike. Turn on the treadmill and walk slowly for about two minutes to allow the lubricant to work its way across the entirety of the running deck.\n\nWhile a treadmill can be used for walking, it’s typically more versatile than a walking pad in that it can support jogging sessions and faster training. Higher-end treadmills will also have more features than a walking pad, such as the ability to automatically adjust incline and decline, connect to on-demand workout programmes from the likes of Peloton and iFit, and offer built-in workouts. On the other hand, walking pads are usually smaller and easier to store, with some folding in half so they can be housed underneath a desk when not in use.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches\n\n The best cross trainers\n\nLeon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

    "fullText": "The most popular mom content tends to be rightwing tradwife propaganda or not political at all – pushing progressive creators out of the algorithm\n\nFor someone who doesn’t have a marble island in their kitchen I spend a disproportionate amount of time staring at marble kitchen islands, slack-jawed, brain turned half off. That’s because I consume a lot of videos from mommy bloggers, mom influencers, and the like. In kitchen “closing shift” videos, they wipe down their islands and reset by lighting luxury candles, the glow accentuating their respectable cosmetic procedures. Other times I watch them waltz through their morning routines: getting kids out the door, sweating it out in boutique fitness classes, showing off Amazon hauls, or explaining their children’s matching holiday photoshoot outfits.\n\nFor better or worse, this is how I have chosen to spend my one wild and precious life: consuming blissfully low-stakes motherhood content on my phone. It is domestically competent ASMR that also satiates my desire to peek into everyone’s bathroom cabinets. I nod in unsolicited approval as a TikTok mom I follow shares her green juice order. Fascinating. I should drink something like that. Another posts timestamps of her baby’s night-time sleep schedule. I, who lives between walls that have never heard the wail of an infant, ingurgitate the entire video.\n\nBut occasionally, when my cerebrum is not completely smoothed over by a beautiful woman beckoning me to “get ready” with her, an anxiety starts to creep in. What, I wonder, are this woman’s politics? Has she ever given us a hint? Is she registered to vote? Is there any chance she, like me, is outraged by ICE raids, book bans, our government’s comparatively dismal maternal support system or slippery slide into fascism? Does she know there are midterms this year? Mama, blink twice!\n\nIn my ideal algorithm, I would get served posts to assuage my doubts. I would watch nursery hauls of a mother whose progressiveness I did not doubt. I would know that she dreads the realities of the climate crisis. I would listen to a parent describe her weekly meal prep for a family of four and not wonder if she was politically aligned with the men in government stripping food safety regulations. Maybe tips on how to get your daily steps in with a newborn would include showing up at protests or delivering mutual aid groceries. Because in real life, I was raised by and hope to be a mother who is both fluent in the chaotic and comforting mundanity of domesticity and enraged by the systems that diminish and destroy families and livelihoods. I just don’t see that much of it in my online spheres.\n\nInstead, the most popular motherhood and lifestyle content lands somewhere on the short spectrum between conservative tradwife propaganda and extraordinarily apolitical, considering the paralyzing polycrisis we find ourselves in. I’m increasingly suspicious: was that sourdough starter “how to” video actually funded by the Church of Latter-day Saints? Hannah Neeleman AKA Ballerina Farm, one of the most-followed motherhood lifestyle content creators across platforms, has not ever explicitly divulged her political views – but do followers know she graced the cover of Evie magazine, described by one of its founders as “conservative Cosmo”?\n\n“The right in the United States has really won the family,” said content creator Kate Glavan. This past summer, Glavan posted a TikTok saying she would “happily watch ‘stay-at-home mom’ content if it emphasized the reality of being a mom in America”. More than 1,200 commenters chimed in on her video, captioned “We need leftist mommy blogger content”, in agreement. Some politely promoted their own accounts, or offered reasons they felt leftist mommy blogger content doesn’t lend itself to virality. “Leftist moms are often working,” one commenter wrote. “Every time I even HINT at my true political beliefs on here I get absolutely destroyed in my comments section,” wrote another. A number of people also expressed their unwillingness to put their children on camera due to privacy concerns and big-tech mistrust, which undoubtedly does not please the algorithmic gods.\n\nI asked Glavan, who does not have children of her own, what led her to make the video. “I don’t see enough examples of how I could do [motherhood] as someone who is left of center and advocates for certain politics,” she said. She believes that “being a mom is so political”, with the realities of motherhood in the US overwhelming even the twentysomething child-free influencer. “You are navigating through the healthcare system, you are probably not getting paid leave. You’re probably not getting any sort of benefits, the cost of diapers …” she lamented before trailing off.\n\nGlavan is pretty much right about, well, the right. The Venn diagram of anti-feminist Trump administration officials and hangers-on, and pronatalist enthusiasts – a movement concerned with women having more babies – has a worryingly chunky midsection. In an NBC poll from this past summer, women aged 18-29 who voted for Donald Trump in 2024 prioritized “having children” as a six out of 13 in their definition of personal success. Women of the same age who voted for Kamala Harris ranked it 12 of 13, prioritizing instead certain financial goals, community building and emotional stability.\n\nThe left’s skepticism or outright rejection of the traditional nuclear family – you know, white picket fence, two-and-a-half kids, general suburban phantasma – is not unique to this presidency. Throughout history, women’s domesticity has been held in tension against their autonomy. Marxist feminists in the 1970s demanded “family abolition”, arguing that the bourgeois family structure upholds the patriarchy and exploits wives as “instruments of production”. Around the same time, the grassroots campaigns Wages For Housework and Black Women for Wages for Housework aimed to raise the visibility of the economic contribution of women’s domestic labor, the latter movement asserting that welfare is a wage, not a charity.\n\nNo need to dive into complex social theory though, just visit any gift shop and pick up a magnet, greetings card or wine glass satirizing the lobotomized housewife and you will get the gist. But with motherhood content sitting at the crux of domestic life, gender politics, and consumerism (many creators aim to monetize views via sponsorships and paid product placement), it simply is not an ideal breeding ground for left-leaning thought leaders. (Though, could one argue that current-day monetization of the performance of labor in momfluencing is an extension of these mid-century feminist crusades? Perhaps!)\n\nMust I reckon with the reality that good politics and pilates arms routines might be at odds with one another? Motherhood content can and is often aesthetically aspirational, but can it also be ideologically so?\n\nIf you buck the algorithm and go searching, you will find creators whose identities fall outside the cookie cutter content farms both in makeup – queer moms, solo moms by choice, blended families – and substance. Moms who focus on gender-imbalanced workloads, like She Is A Paige Turner, or how special needs parenting is impacted by politics, like Eres_rara, or the dissonance of parenting at a time when ICE is separating children from their families and communities, like Bri motherhood. YouTuber Tiffany Ferg has a vlog titled: Why Motherhood Should Radicalize You. It’s all informative, it’s engaging, and it doesn’t quite scratch the itch because it can feel more like a lecture (albeit one I fully endorse) than the habitual mom content I tend to seek out.\n\nEarly attempts to ideologically curate my feeds and rid them of conservative-coded creators also led me to following mothers who romanticize their humble, though devotedly aesthetic, homes and natural fiber-forward lifestyles in back-to-the-earth settings like Mendocino or mid-coast Maine. But I was hoodwinked by their Democratic zip codes and unkempt curtain bangs. Handsome walnut cutting boards might have replaced antiseptic marble islands, but I was also increasingly watching haul videos not of Costco-sized tubs of Tylenol but raw milk to treat preventable illness. What did I expect? It’s Maha-mania out there, and mom influencers are all in.\n\nAround the time I watched Glavan’s video, I also watched a TikTok in which fashion and trend analyst Mandy Lee felt the need to clarify to her followers that her preconception health journey, which she chose to discuss online, was not going to lead her down the Maha or “alt-right” pipeline. Later she clarified she planned to rely on “real science, not Facebook science” in her fertility journey. She did not want to risk that wanting “a child and to have a family would make people assume that [she is] conservative”, which “could not be further from the truth”.\n\nHer disclaimers reminded me of another motherhood movement turned toxic: the forum Mumsnet, which provided moms in the UK with community and support but quickly veered into anti-trans rhetoric and Terfiness.\n\nLast year, motherhood and lifestyle content creator Lisa Miller started incorporating her political beliefs into her videos, after making the move with her family of five from eastern Tennessee to Brooklyn. “With the climate of politics now and having this major platform that I do – really it’s not a major platform compared to some creators, but to me, it is – it’s so important for me to speak out on things that I’m passionate about and that matter,” she said. That wasn’t always the case. Miller was raised by a Mexican American mom with left-leaning views in Detroit before being put in foster care in conservative parts of Virginia. “I just learned very early on to keep my opinions to myself and I didn’t want conflict.”\n\nBut the idea of conflict became less daunting as she witnessed a handful of parenthood creators, such as New York dad Jose Rolon (whose bio pitches his content as “relatable parenting to all families”), seamlessly incorporate politics into their platforms. Between family vacation vlogs and his recaps of his kids’ sports games are videos endorsing Zohran Mamdani and calling on fellow Latino creators to speak up about ICE raids.\n\nNow Miller posts videos that begin with her saying: “Get ready with me to lose a bunch of followers,” in which she discusses her thoughts on gun violence, ICE raids and raising a child on the autism spectrum in RFK Jr’s America as she does her multistep makeup routine and fixes up her hair. I find the series to be an ingenious blend of comforting daily ritual – like your typical momfluencer video – and straightforward political candor. The itch – it’s scratched!\n\nMiller’s defiant stance is common among the minority of mom creators who are vocally left-leaning – an acknowledgment of the apolitical or conservative mommy content they’re competing against. Many will use meme formats to clarify that they are not a tradwife SAHM (stay at home mom) but a “household who believes in science and equal rights”-type SAHM. (Bread and crosses emojis indicate the former, microscopes and rainbow flags the latter.) I’ve also seen a number of videos along the lines of this one, which reads: “POV you’re a progressive mom trying to figure out someone’s [presumably a new mom friend’s] vibe.” (Another way to check a TikTok creator’s politics is to peek at who they’re digitally endorsing in the “reposts” tab.) I have scrolled past many that share a sentiment along the lines of “I might not get invited back to book club, but at least they know where I stand on Palestine.” Since federal agents shot and killed VA nurse Alex Pretti and mom of three, Renee Nicole Good, and detained five-year-old Liam Ramos in Minneapolis, my feed has seen an uptick in videos of moms, some self-proclaimed “wine moms”, posting about how they are engaging with their children or shielding them from the enormity of these indignities.\n\nIt’s corny, but there is some pride that comes with being a conscious content consumer. “When you find out that someone is not a Trump supporter, you’re like, ‘OK, now I trust you, and I want to support your paid brand deals and comment on them and say, get your bag,’” Glavan said. It goes two ways. For Miller, being clear where she stands politically has helped a new and appreciative audience find her. “I found it so freeing and really healing to find like-minded people,” she said. “It certainly was empowering to connect with a community that believes in things like human rights and equality and women’s rights and Black Lives Matter.”\n\nMiller, who has worked with a number of lifestyle brands popular among moms, hasn’t seen a dip in deals with them since sharing her political views. “I’m not using my platform in a negative way and I think that would be different if I were, you know, being negative or being ugly or being hateful,” she said.\n\nI know that watching “day in my life” routines, hoping they will reflect on ways to look out for your neighbors or speak out against the current administration, is sort of like hoping the NFL might pause the Super Bowl to meaningfully address violence against women. But occasionally, you stumble upon something close. And though it might not be aspirational the way a perfectly sliced toddler snack plate is, it is aspirational in the sense it showcases my reality: not only do motherhood and left-leaning outrage coexist, the former often informs the latter.\n\nTo loosely and lazily (my favorite way to scroll) bastardize Marxist theory, there might not be any ethical consumption under motherhood content, but there are certainly some creators I’m hoping “get their bag”.",

    "title": "How to Keep Your Gym Gear From Stinking",
    "description": "You clothes don't have to reek, nor does your shaker bottle.",
    "fullText": "Does your gym bag reek? You’re not alone, but it doesn’t have to be this way. With proper care, you can keep your workout gear stink-free. The key is to do yourself a favor and start taking care of everything before it starts to smell. But even if you’ve already let things get bad, I have some tips for you.\n\nI'll get into specifics below, but first, it can help to understand why the gym stink develops on clothing and other items that contact your skin. You sweat into them, but it's not the sweat itself that is the problem. It's the bacteria that feed on your sweat. So you'll need to either get rid of the sweat before the bacteria can grow, or handle your clothes and gear in a way that the bacteria won't be able to grow. (It's the same deal with shaker bottles, except substitute food residue for sweat.) If you take nothing else away from this article, just remember this: for the love of God, rinse everything immediately, or at least air your shit out.\n\nA lot of gym clothes these days are made of synthetic fabrics because they provide stretch or sweat-wicking features to keep us comfortable. The downside is that bacteria can cling to synthetic fibers in a way that makes them nearly impossible to wash off. So it’s important that we don’t let those germ colonies grow in the first place.\n\nThe bacteria I’m talking about are the ones that digest your sweat and skin oils. I know, gross. But that means it’s not the sweat itself that causes stinking, but rather the bacteria that multiply while your sweaty shirt is sitting in the laundry basket.\n\nNip this problem in the bud by rinsing the sweat out of synthetics as soon as you take them off. I do this in the shower, squeezing out each garment and hanging it to dry. A set of extra shower curtain hooks will give you a place to hang them. I put up a basic tension rod in the back of my shower for exactly this reason. If you shower at the gym, squeeze those garments out and roll them up in your towel until you get home.\n\nIf you can't rinse your gym clothes right after wearing, or if you have a whole workday in between your shower and your access to laundry, air your clothes out. Cotton clothes don’t have these problems, by the way. If you wear cotton socks or t-shirts, they can be chucked into the laundry whenever and however you like.\n\nYou may never be able to completely remove the stink, but you’ll have the best luck with detergents that contain enzymes or that bill themselves as being good for “sport” or “performance” fabrics. I’ve had good experiences with both Hex (a detergent) and Lysol laundry sanitizer (which you add to the rinse, like a fabric softener). I use one or the other, not both. Either of these can also be used for a soak: soak your gross clothes in a bucket with the Hex or Lysol laundry sanitizer, and then wash as usual.\n\nAnd for a finishing touch, if you really want to be sure you've gotten the stink out, hang the clothes outdoors (or lay them on a surface, like your deck) on a sunny day. Fresh air helps, and sunlight really does kill some of those stench-producing bacteria.\n\nLook, you can try baking soda or vinegar (not together), but I haven't found those to help. If you want a chemical answer to your problems, just get a bottle of Hex.\n\nWhat about things that can’t be quickly rinsed and dried, like your shoes and the gym bag itself? Or, worse, your neoprene knee sleeves? These items stink up most easily when they stay damp and warm. If you wanted to make a gym bag smell as much as possible, I would tell you to fill it with sweaty gear, lock it in the trunk of your car, forget about it until the next gym day. So if that’s your habit already, stop it. You need to air those suckers out.\n\nIf your bag has a mesh compartment for sweaty gear, make use of it. And if you can tie objects to the outsides of the bag—hanging your shoes by their laces, for example—that will help, too. But ultimately what you really want to do is open up the bag as soon as you get home. I always make sure that if my knee sleeves are deep inside the bag, I bring them up to the top to make sure they can get some air. And my shoes are in a mesh compartment, but if I have an extra minute, I’ll open up that compartment and loosen up the shoes so they get as much air flow as possible.\n\nMost of the things in your gym bag can be washed, but check manufacturer’s instructions for the best methods. For example, SBD says to hand wash knee sleeves with soap or a wetsuit detergent, but not to put them in the washing machine or dry them with heat.\n\nJust as with clothes, another good option is to hang or lay out your items in the sunshine and fresh air for a few hours. Sunlight will kill some bacteria, and a good airing-out never hurts.\n\nAvoid spraying things down with vinegar (I’ve never found this to be effective), rubbing alcohol (degrades some materials, so check with the manufacturer), or vodka (unnecessarily expensive, just buy rubbing alcohol and then see above about why you might not want to use rubbing alcohol).\n\nFinally, we come to the bane of many a gym bro’s existence, the stinky shaker cup. If you leave residue from your protein shake in there—especially a milk-based one, like a shake made with whey powder—it can go rancid, and the smells can seep into the plastic where they may never really go away.\n\nTo prevent this, rinse your shaker cup immediately after you drink the shake. Don’t tell yourself you’ll do it when you get home, because we all know you won’t, and honestly, that's too late anyway. You don’t have to fully wash the cup at this point, just rinse it out in the bathroom sink. Or do what I do, and chug your shake at home, over the sink, and wash the cup while it’s still in your hand.\n\nYour Hail Mary hope is to wash it really well. Use soap and hot water. Soak it for a bit if you like. Scrub all the little nooks and crannies (like where the spout meets its cap) to make sure no residue is left. Air it out to dry for a few days; you can even try the sunlight trick above. But if that doesn’t work, buy a new shaker cup, and treat this one right.",

After a break week, Borthwick's side then travel to Italy and then France.\n\n\"That's why this competition is so good, because you have five brutal games, five tough games, three back-to-back and three away games,\" hooker Jamie George, who leads the side against Wales, told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"It's going to be really challenging but that is also exciting and hopefully can bring the best out of us.\"",

    "fullText": "Crunch Fitness is responding to backlash after an immigration-enforcement-related memo from one Texas franchise spread online.\n\nThe gym is the latest national brand caught navigating the immigration flash point — even though the internal document was only meant for a handful of locations.\n\nThe memo, which was leaked in a now-deleted Reddit post last week, was issued by Austin-based Undefeated Tribe Operating Company LLC. The franchisee operates roughly 40 of the company's 500 gyms, according to recent press releases.\n\nIn the memo, the franchise said its policy was to \"cooperate with any law enforcement officer,\" including ICE.\n\nUnder a subsection titled \"what to expect during a raid,\" the franchise told employees that some ICE raids \"can last hours\" and could include searches of \"offices, lockers, or computers\" — all searches that would require a judicial warrant. Staff were instructed to contact management, keep members calm, and tell them \"not to interfere with the agents.\" The franchisee and its owner didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe guidance quickly sparked criticism online, with dozens of users across TikTok, Instagram, X, and Reddit saying they had canceled their Crunch memberships in protest.\n\nOn Monday, a spokesperson for Crunch told Business Insider the memo \"does not represent Crunch Fitness's corporate policy.\" The spokesperson also said the gym's lobby is the only area law enforcement can access without a warrant.\n\n\"This approach is consistent with Crunch's standards and our long-standing commitment to maintaining welcoming, safe spaces for our members and employees,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Saturday, Crunch Fitness' national social media account distanced itself from the franchise's memo, saying the internal document had been \"misinterpreted.\"\n\nA post shared by Crunch Fitness (@crunchgym)\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with front-end managers and staff at eight Crunch locations across the US. All requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nTwo managers said they had discussed potential ICE scenarios directly with their franchise owners — not with Crunch's corporate office. Front-end staff said they had not received guidance from the national brand, and three employees said they were unsure of any ICE policy as of Monday.\n\nEvery employee interviewed said they had read the leaked memo from the Texas franchise.\n\nOnline reaction has been divided. While several users said they were canceling memberships, others argued that customers were unfairly blaming Crunch's corporate brand for the actions of a single franchise operator.\n\nThe controversy comes amid heightened public scrutiny of corporate relationships with federal immigration enforcement, particularly after two fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nIn early January, Hilton Hotels faced backlash after one of its Minnesota franchises denied ICE agents access. Hilton removed the location from its system shortly afterward. Rental car giant Enterprise also faced protests after social media users accused the company of providing vehicles to federal agents.\n\nActivists have been calling for a national strike on billion-dollar businesses amid the rising tensions.",

    "description": "Where do you put your stuff? How do you know how to work the machines?",
    "fullText": "Your first day in the gym can be pretty intimidating. I remember spending a whole semester in one half of my university’s gym because the other room was, I don’t know, scary. And if you haven’t been to the gym in a while—or ever—you probably have questions. So let’s talk through the very, very basics.\n\nHey, great question! There are different kinds of gyms, so there isn’t a single, universal answer. I’ll assume you’re going to what’s sometimes called a “commercial” gym, one that caters to a wide variety of people and has a selection of cardio machines, weight-training machines, and dumbbells. It may or may not have barbells. Planet Fitness, Crunch, LA Fitness, Gold’s Gym, and 24 Hour Fitness are all in this general category. If your gym is in a community center or a YMCA, it may have a few more or less features, but will probably be similar to what I describe.\n\nBefore you head in, check the gym’s website. Most will offer a free first day or week, which will let you scope the place out and do a workout or two before you commit to a membership. Some gyms may make it difficult to cancel after you sign up, so don't rush into it. Take advantage of those trial periods.\n\nWhile you're doing your research, check out the website for virtual tours and photos of facilities. Get an idea of what kind of stuff they have. Check Google Maps for photos; you may even be able to find a Street View-style tour of the interior. And finally, log on to Instagram and browse through photos tagged at that gym's location. You’ll get a sense of what equipment is there, how people train, and what kind of vibe to expect.\n\nYou can come to a gym with nothing and still get in a good workout. The only absolute requirement, in some gyms, is that you bring a pair of shoes that aren’t filthy. (Some gyms disallow street shoes, and expect you to change into a clean pair; others don’t care, or only enforce the policy in winter.)\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, people will often bring a complete change of clothes and a bunch of toiletries and supplies to take a shower and change afterward. You don’t have to do this. It’s OK to walk out the front door still sweaty, and shower at home. Some small gyms don’t even have showers.\n\nWhat’s the middle ground? I would bring these for my first time at a new gym:\n\nA small towel (for sweat), unless I know for sure that the gym provides towels\n\nA combination lock if you plan to lock your things up and aren’t sure whether the gym’s lockers have built-in locks\n\nIf you have a bunch of stuff, like a coat and a bag, you can put it in a locker. It’s also totally fine to keep a few things with you as you walk around. Most people will probably have their towel, water bottle, and phone with them.\n\nYou can usually bring a small bag around the gym with you, and just set it down next to whatever machine or bench you’re using, as long as it’s not directly in anybody’s way. (Check the gym rules, though.) Since that can be a hassle, another popular approach is to keep your water bottle in a sleeve that has pockets for your phone and small items.\n\nAnything that feels comfortable, isn’t indecent, and that you don’t mind sweating in. For your upper body, try a T-shirt or tank top. For your legs, wear shorts, sweatpants, or leggings. Again, check the gym rules to see if they have any specific requirements. Some gyms don’t want you to take your shirt off, others don’t care.\n\nFor shoes, any kind of sneakers or comfortable athletic shoes should be fine. Chucks, running shoes, that sort of thing. If you get really into this exercise business, you can get picky about shoes later. For your first day, it doesn’t really matter.\n\nThere will be some kind of check-in desk. If it’s your first time, you’ll probably need to talk to somebody about a membership trial or buy a day pass. This can be a separate visit from your first actual workout. Make sure to ask what the normal check-in procedure is. In many cases you’ll scan your phone or show a key tag or card as you enter, and then you’re free to do whatever you want.\n\nTwo options here: you can walk around the room and scope everything out; or you can ask if someone can give you a brief tour or new-member orientation. (They may offer before you ask). Be aware that they may try to upsell you on personal training or other extras in the process; it's OK to decline.\n\nIf you do get a guided tour, use this opportunity to ask any remaining questions you have. Don’t be embarrassed, the whole idea is that they know you’re new and they’re trying to help. And if you don't get a tour, it's still OK to ask basic questions at the front desk like \"which way to the locker room?\" or \"do you have squat racks?\"\n\nLook, the first day is about expanding your comfort zone. If you can walk into the gym and not run right back out, you’ve already accomplished something, and Day Two will be so much easier. A few things that tend to help:\n\nGo at one of the less busy times if that will help your nerves. Mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and late evenings tend to be slow times. Check Google Maps to see if it can show you peak hours at your particular location.\n\nBring a friend, or meet a friend there if you can. Even if both of you are new and clueless, you can be new and clueless together.\n\nRead up on what to expect. You’re already doing that, so you’re on the right track! If there’s a certain exercise or machine you want to try, look it up on YouTube.\n\nIf your gym offers classes, that can be a good way to start. The class will get you in the gym with a clear plan of where to go and what to do. You can save independent workouts for after the class or for another day.\n\nIf you’ll be on your own, try this:\n\nWalk around the whole gym. Scope everything out. Nobody will stop you or judge you. You don’t even have to pretend that you know where you’re going; if anybody asks “can I help you?” you can just reply “Oh, I’m just new here and seeing where everything is.”\n\nSit on an exercise bike (or the machine of your choice). Ideally, pick one that faces the main gym area so you can gather more information about what equipment is out there and what people do with it. Use that machine while you decide on your next steps.\n\nMaybe this is enough. A typical cardio workout is 20 to 30 minutes, so you can just use the bike for a half hour and then go home.\n\nOr maybe you find your confidence building as you pedal. After five or 10 minutes (a typical warmup time), hop off the bike and go check out the dumbbells or machines or whatever has piqued your interest.\n\nMost gyms sell personal training for an extra fee. And as an enticement to get people to sign up, they may offer a free session or a fitness test with one of their trainers. Like the tour, this is also a good time to get some questions answered.\n\nYou can do this if you like, but proceed with caution. Some gyms and trainers are great, but others will use this opportunity to make you do a lot of hard exercise so that you feel out of shape, and then you’ll feel like you need their services to get into shape. I’ve heard too many stories of people having one of these sessions and then feeling terrible about themselves afterward.\n\nSo if you decide to go ahead with a session, keep your wits about you. You do not have to be fit your first day in the gym. You also don’t have to do a really demanding workout your first day. If the trainer has you do anything you’re uncomfortable with, you don’t even have to know why you feel the way you do about it. You can just say “you know what, I don’t think I’m ready to do that right now” and ask to move on. This is also a good test of your trainer. If they try to force you to do something you’re not cool with, you probably won’t have a good time working with them.\n\nAnd, of course, never If they say you'll get a better deal if you join right now, that's a hint that they only get people to sign up when pressured, which means it's probably not a good deal at all. If you do (Overwhelmed? Better to just say no for now. You can always sign up later.)\n\nSure can! Although what makes something a routine is that you do it routinely. So I’ll give you an option for your first day’s workout, and you can even repeat it a few times, but eventually you’ll want to find yourself a program that lays out longer-term plans.\n\nTry this, which should give you a full-body workout in a reasonable length of time. If one machine or station is busy, just skip to the next while you wait.\n\nI’m recommending two sets of each exercise because that should give you a nice sampling without making you too sore the next day if this is all brand new. I’m recommending 10 reps in each set because 10 is an easy number to remember. Feel free to do more or less if you like.\n\n5-10 minutes on an exercise bike (or any cardio machine)\n\n2x10 (that means two sets of 10 reps each) dumbbell or machine shoulder press\n\n2x10 on the assisted pull-up machine or lat pulldown\n\n2x10 walking lunges with dumbbells in your hands\n\n2x10 dumbbell bench press or machine chest press\n\n2x10 seated cable row or dumbbell row\n\n2x10 goblet squats with a dumbbell or kettlebell (if you’re feeling brave, give the leg press a try instead)\n\n5-10 minutes stretching anything that feels tight (look for a stretching area with mats on the floor)\n\nIf you want an even shorter workout, split it in half. Do the shoulder press, pull-up or pulldown, and the lunges, and then skip right to stretching. Next time, go right to the dumbbell bench after you warm up, and continue the workout from there.\n\nYou don’t have to memorize everything ahead of time. Machines almost always have instructions posted on them telling you how to adjust them and how to use them. Also, it is totally fine to look up videos of exercises on your phone, or to keep notes in your phone or on paper about what you did. It is always OK to be that guy with the notebook.\n\nIf there are wipes and spray bottles around, wipe down anything you sweated on. This includes benches and the seats and handles of machines. Don’t forget to throw the wipe away afterward. You can also put your towel down on a bench or machine as a sweat barrier.\n\nWhatever you use, put it back when you’re done.\n\nIt’s OK to rest a minute, or even a few minutes between sets. (For example, you just did 10 reps of bench press, and now you’re sitting on the bench for a few minutes before you do your next 10 reps.) But don’t take up space any longer than you need to.\n\nIf somebody is using a thing you’d like to use, it’s OK to ask them “how many sets do you have left?” and if the answer is a lot, you can ask “Do you mind if I work in?” which means that you’ll take turns using the equipment. If somebody asks these questions of you, be honest about how many sets you have left (it’s OK to make them wait) and offer to let them work in if you feel comfortable doing so.\n\nIf somebody offers you advice and you don’t know how to react, just say “OK.” If the advice is about following a gym rule, follow the rule. If it’s about how to properly use equipment, like adjusting a safety setting, take their advice. On the other hand, if it’s about the proper way to do an exercise, it’s 100% up to you whether you want to give their way a try or just go back to what you were doing. (I have a guide to responding to unsolicited advice.)\n\nIt’s going to be so much easier the second day. You’ll know what’s available, where to find it, and what the routine is for checking in and finding a place for your stuff.\n\nCome in with a plan. It can be the same as your first day, or something new you’d like to try. If you did a full-body strength workout, the next day can be just plain cardio. And if you still feel nervous, don’t worry, it will get easier every day.",

    "title": "Does Walking Really Count As Cardio?",
    "description": "The answer depends on your fitness level, and on how strenuous of a walk you're doing.",
    "fullText": "Walking is an easy way to get some exercise in your day, and it delivers mental health benefits as well. I’m one of the many people who added daily walks to my routine during the pandemic, and they improved my life so much I don’t intend to stop. But does walking do enough for your body that you can count it as cardio exercise?\n\nThe answer is complicated. Walking counts as cardio in some respects: it can burn calories, it gets your heart rate up, and it counts toward the exercise we should all be getting every week. But on the other hand, it’s not going to increase your cardio fitness in the same way as a run or an intense aerobics class would. If you want to improve your endurance, you’ll have to do more than just walk.\n\nRunning burns more calories than walking per unit time, but both are similar when you consider distance.\n\nA rule of thumb is that you burn about 100 calories per mile whether you run it or walk it, but in truth calorie burn varies according to the size of your body (you burn more calories if you are larger) and how fast you run or walk. The calories per mile are slightly lower when you walk. This calculator estimates that a 150-pound person will burn 108 calories by walking a mile at 3 miles per hour, or 104 calories by running it at 6 miles per hour. Some calculators give a lower estimate for walking,\n\nThe bigger difference is in calories per hour (rather than calories per mile): for the same 150-pound person, walking burns 324 calories per hour, and running burns 627. The faster you go, the higher the calorie burn. So if you’re walking or running to burn calories, running will burn about double the calories in a given time. But if you prefer walking and you have the time to spare, both will do the job.\n\nEach intensity level of exercise offers its own benefits. Walking is what I’d consider very easy cardio, jogging is more of a medium exercise, and high-intensity cardio would be something like sprinting or racing. All of these are good for you, although depending on your goals, you may not need to do all of them.\n\nIf you want to be a fast runner, for example, you’ll need plenty of medium cardio (slow running) and some higher intensity stuff (speedwork); if you want to improve your endurance, as measured by metrics like VO2max, you’ll definitely need to put in some work at these intensities.\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re just trying to get some movement in your life and you don’t care about getting better at it, lower intensity exercise like walking may be enough.\n\nAccording to major health organizations (including the CDC, the WHO, and the AHA), we should all be getting at least 150 minutes per week of “moderate” exercise, or 75 minutes of “vigorous” exercise. You can mix and match, with the idea that each minute of vigorous exercise counts double.\n\nSo where does walking fall in that recommendation? Walking is moderate, and I have more here on how that's defined. But if you want a rule of thumb to compare it to heart rate, the American Heart Association defines moderate exercise as that in which your heart rate is between 50-70% of your max, and vigorous exercise as between 70-85% of your max. (That does assume you know your true max.) Walking will generally be in the moderate range, so you’ll have to do twice as much of it—counting in minutes—as if you chose to do more vigorous cardio. That matches up with our calorie calculations.\n\nThe distinction between walking and running is a mechanical one: if you always have at least one foot on the ground, you’re walking. If instead your gait has a little hop as you move from foot to foot, you’re running. (Jogging is simply a slow run.)\n\nIt’s often easier to keep up a higher intensity (and a higher heart rate) by running than by walking, but that’s not always true. If you’re hiking up a mountain, your heart rate can easily get into the “vigorous” zone. And if you’re an efficient enough runner, you may be able to go for a slow jog while you keep your heart rate down in the “moderate” realm.\n\nAs you’re planning your workouts, think about the intensity: Measure your heart rate if you aren’t sure where you fall; you can use a tracker like a Fitbit or an Apple Watch to do this, but you can also just put two fingers on the side of your neck and count the beats of your pulse. If your max is 200 and you count 150 beats per minute, you’re at 75% of your max heart rate.\n\nMaybe walking gets you a higher heart rate than you thought—not impossible if you’re a beginner or if your walks take you over hilly terrain. If you want a tougher cardio workout, you can walk faster, or you can choose a different type of exercise like cycling or dancing that gets your heart rate up higher. But it’s fine to go for an easy walk if that’s all you’re aiming for.",

    "fullText": "It's no secret that expensive gyms and fitness classes are filled with people who work in high-paying industries like finance and tech.\n\nBut why? Does that sauna really warrant paying an extra few hundred bucks a month in membership fees?\n\nAccording to Wall Streeters we spoke with, membership at places like Equinox or Life Time isn't about the amenities per se. Instead, members are buying two intangible benefits: the chance at networking and social status.\n\nWhile networking at the gym might sound hellish to some, it's not necessarily like you'd imagine it. Gyms will actually set up designated networking events for members, said Laz Rabanales, who works at Okada & Company, a commercial real-estate firm.\n\n\"I have a friend that works at Chelsea Piers [Fitness], and he was telling me that they throw events like ice cream social hour,\" he said.\n\nGoing hand in hand with networking is status. By paying high monthly fees, it's shorthand for other members that you're of high corporate and social status.\n\n\"I feel you can kind of signal to other people that you're paying a lot for a gym membership — so you have a good job and that kind of thing,\" said Nyla Legemah, a customer success manager for benchmarks and indices at London Stock Exchange Group in New York. \"It's like assumed you made it to the club.\"\n\nBut the expensive gym trend also simply reflects societal changes — young people increasingly care about their health and longevity, and are willing to prioritize it.\n\n\"I think that the status element of going to a nice gym is a factor for some people but it is also a generational shift that focuses on health and wellness instead of buying items,\" said Alexander Wah, the founder and chief investment officer at Prince Capital.\n\nCassie Henry, a trader at Gresham Investment Management, a hedge fund, said that workout classes have sometimes taken the place of client happy hours.\n\n\"Banks will take us out, do a workout class instead of getting a drink,\" Henry said. \"It's a good value if someone pays $50 for your pilates class.\"\n\nCaring about being fit in and of itself can also be an outward manifestation of status in the finance world, Rabanales said.\n\n\"You always want to look good because you always want to impress your clients in this industry,\" he said. \"The minute you walk into a room, they'll judge you.\"",

Russia didn’t try to counter the rebel offensive in late 2024 but gave asylum to Assad after he fled the country.\n\nDespite having been on opposite sides of the battle lines during the civil war, the new rulers in Damascus have taken a pragmatic approach to relations with Moscow. Russia has retained a presence at its air and naval bases on the Syrian coast.\n\nAl-Sharaa is expected to visit Moscow on Wednesday and meet with Putin.\n\nFighting broke out early this month between the SDF and government forces after negotiations over a deal to merge their forces together broke down. A ceasefire is now in place and has been largely holding.\n\nAfter the expiration of a four-day truce Saturday, the two sides announced the ceasefire had been extended by another 15 days.\n\nSyria's defense ministry said in a statement that the extension was in support of an operation by U.S. forces to transfer accused Islamic State militants who had been held in prisons in northeastern Syria to detention centers in Iraq.",

    "title": "‘Data is not steroids’: Why were Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz banned from wearing fitness trackers at Australian Open?",
    "description": "Sinner, Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka have been caught wearing fitness trackers during their matches at the Australian Open",
    "fullText": "An argument over banned “wearable” devices such as Whoop fitness trackers has erupted at the Australian Open after top players Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka were ordered to remove them before their matches.\n\nTennis Australia, the organiser of the Australian Open, confirmed that the wearable wrist technology is not permitted at the grand slams – although it said that the tournament is “in discussions” over allowing such devices in the future.\n\nWearable technology is permitted on the ATP and WTA tours. When the ATP Tour announced the approval of in-match wearable devices in 2024, a statement from then chief sporting officer Ross Hutchins said the technology was a “big step forward in our push to optimise player performance and prevent injury”.\n\nSinner was ordered to remove a Whoop device, which was hidden underneath his wristband, before his fourth-round match against Luciano Darderi on Monday.\n\nThe previous day, Alcaraz was also stopped from wearing a Whoop device by a tournament official after it was spotted mid-match. Sabalenka had hers removed earlier in the tournament.\n\nIn other elite high-intensity sports, such as football and rugby union, data and fitness tracking are used to identify when players are in the “red zone” and could be more susceptible to injury without sufficient recovery.\n\nWearable devices such as the screenless Whoop sensor track biometric data and motion. The technology is designed to be worn on the wrist, or other supported positions, such as around the chest, during training, competition, and recovery.\n\nAccording to a description of the product, the data it provides includes heart rate, heart rate variability, recovery, activity strain, blood oxygenation, skin temperature, respiratory rate and blood pressure, as well as sleep stages and performance. This data can then be synced via Bluetooth and read by a coach using a paired mobile device.\n\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) approved the Whoop device following a review last December as long as haptic feedback, such as vibrations on the wrist, is disabled during competition. In-match wearable technology has been approved by the WTA since 2021 and the ATP since 2024.\n\nThere are different rules at the grand slams, however, with Tennis Australia also pointing to the fact that the tournament uses high-tech cameras to provide players with data such as distance covered, changes of direction and sprints to measure load. The tournament has an existing partnership with Bolt 6, which operates the Electronic Line Calling system using ball-tracking technology.\n\n“Wearables are currently not permitted at Grand Slams,” a Tennis Australia spokesperson said. “The Australian Open is involved in ongoing discussions on how this situation could change.”\n\nThere is an argument that elite players with greater resources could have an unfair advantage if they have access to live in-match data and their opponent does not.\n\nBefore in-match coaching was approved a few years ago (coaching is now fully embraced by the Australian Open with separate coaching pods), tennis would pride itself on the players having to work out problems for themselves once they stepped onto the court.\n\nAryna Sabalenka is a Whoop ambassador and explained how she used the technology to assist her recovery during her US Open title run in 2024. In a video published by the WTA, she explained that the Whoop band monitored her stress levels between matches and the data advised her to take days off after it found she was in the “red zone”.\n\nJannik Sinner, who struggled with the extreme heat during his third-round win, said he was planning to use the technology not for in-match use but to inform his recovery before the quarter-finals.\n\n“There is certain data what we would like to track a little bit on court,” Sinner said. “It’s not for the live thing. It’s more about [what] you can see after the match. These are datas what we would like to use also in practice sessions, because from that you can practice on with the heart rate, how much calories you burn, all these kind of things.”\n\nA Whoop spokesperson said: “Whoop believes athletes have a fundamental right to understand their own performance and health – including during competition at events like the Australian Open.\n\n“Whoop is approved by the International Tennis Federation for in-match wear and poses no safety, fairness, or competitive risk. Blocking access to personal health data does not protect sport. Whoop will continue to stand with athletes and our members to defend their right to their data.”\n\nAfter Carlos Alcaraz was caught wearing the technology under his wristband on Sunday, the Whoop founder and CEO Will Ahmed posted on X (Twitter): “Ridiculous. Whoop is approved by the International Tennis Federation for in-match wear and poses no safety risk. Let the athletes measure their bodies. Data is not steroids!”\n\nThis is unclear. After his fourth-round win, the defending champion said: “The umpire asked me straightaway, if this is the tracker. I said yes. He said remove. It’s fine. There are other things we could use. The vest [with tracker inside]. But it’s a bit for me uncomfortable. You feel like you have something on the shoulders. It’s a bit different. But rules are rules. I understand. I won’t use it again.”",

    "description": "Creatine is the one fitness supplement worth your money for building muscle, burning fat, and protecting the brain from stress and aging.",
    "fullText": "Stop wasting your time and money on subpar supplements.\n\nOne ingredient should be your first priority for building muscle, burning fat, and aging gracefully, according to exercise science pros.\n\nCreatine is a combo of amino acids that provides energy to muscles and other tissues, like the brain. Our bodies produce it naturally, but growing research suggests supplementing with store-bought pills and powders is a smart idea.\n\nIt's long been the uncontested king in the fitness supplement world for fueling gains, personal trainers, dietitians, and researchers told Business Insider. Now, even more studies suggest it has benefits beyond the gym, helping bolster the brain to support mental and cognitive health.\n\nFor less than 50 cents a serving, it's the gold standard of evidence-based health hacks, with an impressive resume of potential perks.\n\nWant to start taking creatine? Here's how it works, and the best way to use it for peak performance, according to top researchers.\n\nLong a staple of the sports world and bodybuilding community alike, creatine has been extensively studied as a fitness supplement for decades. It first caught on in the '90s thanks to Olympians who swore by it for elite athletic competition.\n\nSince then, researchers have consistently found that it's safe to use and offers a small but significant boost to performance.\n\nIt works by providing extra fuel in the body's energy cycle. That translates to better gains or faster fat burning if you're working out, since you can power through more work that you might otherwise.\n\nThat makes it a standout performer in the supplement aisle. Creatine has much stronger evidence and broader benefits than products like pre-workouts, which can vary in ingredients and often don't disclose what's actually included.\n\nIt's also distinct from protein shakes and powders, which offer the same nutritional benefits as food, but in a more convenient format. There is some creatine in foods like meat and fish, but it's much harder to get than protein — you'd have to eat more than two pounds of steak to get the amount of creatine in a single scoop of supplement powder.\n\nOther supplements are less evidence-based, less reliable, and can have more risks, particularly when bought online via grey-market websites.\n\nThe only supplement that comes close to challenging creatine in terms of wide-ranging benefit and extensive research is caffeine. While caffeine can boost workouts and is relatively safe in moderate doses, it can have serious side effects in large amounts, so you're better off having a coffee than a concentrated supplement.\n\nCreatine can have side effects like digestive upset, which is typically mild, temporary, and linked to higher doses.\n\nIt's also safe for your wallet. Even with past shortages, creatine monohydrate tends to be the cheapest form, especially if you buy it pure instead of mixed into complicated pre- or post-workout blends.\n\nTo take creatine, researchers typically recommend a dose of between 3 to 5 grams a day (people with larger bodies need more). However, emerging studies suggest the brain can benefit from higher doses. Scott Forbes, a sports science researcher and professor at Brandon University, said he recommends around 10 grams a day for cognitive health.\n\nStill, despite all the potential benefits of creatine, it's not a panacea. No supplement, no matter how well-researched, can match the benefits of healthy lifestyle factors such as nutrition, sleep, and consistent exercise. Trainers recommend starting with high-value habits such as these first before trying supplements.\n\nOnce you're nailing your workouts, diet, and recovery, creatine may be just the thing to give your routine an extra edge.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jim Rowley, CEO of Crunch Fitness and United States Marine Corps. veteran. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat's interesting about my day is that it's never really routine.\n\nIt's highly dependent on where I'm working from, so if I'm in my main office in Manhattan, the day is quite different than if I'm at home in Lake Tahoe. It's fulfilling to not have the same routine over and over again.\n\nI've been doing this for 34 years, so monotony is a killer for me.\n\nWhere my job gets fun is if I'm on the road, I'm in gyms. My team and get to go to our more than 500 gyms, and I love meeting the members.\n\nLately, we've been spending a lot of time on understanding where AI is going to integrate perfectly with the member experience and the team member experience. We're testing some ideas out in the field.\n\nWhen I'm feeling like I'm in a rut from a strategy standpoint, creatively, I go to the gyms. I think all the answers are in the gyms. So I talk to my teams about what's working, what's not.\n\nPeople think I'm kind of a hard guy, but I think I'm pretty relaxed, especially on the road. There are just a few non-negotiables I have in my regular cadence to stay on track.\n\nTypically, I get up at 5:45 a.m. to 6:30 a.m., depending on the day. My morning is like an old grandpa's. I watch the business news, see how the markets are trending. I usually have my one cup of coffee for the day.\n\nRight now, my morning is special — I had a granddaughter born last June, so she's up really early, my daughter's up really early, so I usually get to chat with them via text or FaceTime before everything has started. Once that's done, I start my emails. The majority of my day is set up around Zoom rodeos, performance updates, executive leadership team meetings, or huddles.\n\nThis may be funny, but when I'm on the road, I need to have a desk or a sitting area so I have space to think and stretch my legs. I can't just be checking emails from bed.\n\nI also need to get a protein shake in the morning, especially when I'm on the road. I'm not going to sit down and have a hotel breakfast or stop anywhere.\n\nI believe fitness is medicine. I'm 58 now, and I'm chasing being happy, healthy, and mobile in my eighties and nineties, so it's really about staying active, keeping moving.\n\nWhen I was in the Marine Corps., I worked out in the morning. Prior to 2020, I worked out at the end of my day.\n\nI'm finding that the midday routine is best for me now, to block out some time.\n\nAt lunchtime, around 1 p.m., I break for exercise. So about 12:45, I wind down my meetings, and I'm either headed to Pilates or the gym.\n\nI can walk to our gym, which is great. It's about a 20-minute walk there and back, so you get 40 minutes of cardio with your weightlifting.\n\nI don't lift for ego anymore. I rarely bench. I used to bench press all the time, and I was very proud of what I could bench press. Now, I don't bench press at all because it's so hard on my shoulders. I do a lot more dumbbell workouts now, a lot more machine lifting.\n\nHaving lifted weights since I was 14, I felt like Pilates was an opportunity for me to try to lengthen, strengthen, and activate some of the smaller muscles.\n\nIt changed my life, to be honest with you. I became much more limber, a lot less tight. At first, I was the only man in the Pilates class, but I've been telling my neighbors and building a little army of Pilates guys.\n\nI've done both yoga and Pilates, and prefer Pilates because there is a little bit of strength with mobility and balance.\n\nAfter the gym, I'll have lunch, and then I'm back at the office for more calls, meetings, and so forth. It's problem-solving, it's answering questions, and then I wrap up my day.\n\nI like to get out of here by 5:30 p.m. to get a walk in, especially this time of year, because it's cold and it's just refreshing.\n\nWe eat dinner around 6:30 or 7 p.m.\n\nMy wife and I aren't big on sitcom television, but we do like series. She likes anything out of England, the BBC. I'm more into military history, US history, or westerns. We settled in the middle with dramatic crime whodunnit type of series.\n\nI do have a passion for \"Survivor\" and \"The Amazing Race.\" People laugh at me, but I just love competition.\n\nThen I read a little bit, and I'm in bed usually by 11.",

    "description": "Jerry Clark says he's transformed his tastebuds, changed his portion sizes, and made fitness a non-negotiable.",
    "fullText": "A man gained 50 pounds after he quit the army and started driving — and sitting — for a living.\n\nA fitness and nutrition program designed to reverse diabetes has helped him lose 75 pounds.\n\nHe still sits for long hours, but packs his own lunch and makes sure to exercise 6 days a week.\n\nWhen Jerry Clark decided to quit the Army, hit the road, and start driving long-haul truck routes 34 years ago, he had no idea what a dramatic impact the career change would have on his body.\n\n\"A truck driver is the worst job in the world for health,\" Clark told Business Insider.\n\nArguably, no one is required to sit more on the job than a truck driver. And we all know sitting is the new smoking.\n\nClark spent years tag-teaming across the country with his wife on trucker routes. At one point, before she retired, they were logging 8,000 miles together every workweek. The pair would drive almost three full lengths across the continent each week, eating whatever they could find to sustain them along the way.\n\n\"We eat at the greasy spoons,\" Clark said, explaining the average truck driver's meal plan. \"Everything is grease, or fried.\"\n\nAll that sitting and eating greasy food can lead to long-term health issues and body imbalances. Clark developed a stronger left leg from operating his clutch and a stronger right arm from being at the wheel for half of the day. He also gained over 50 pounds over the course of three decades.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, when he heard his employer was offering free nutrition coaching for people with diabetes through Virta Health, he wondered if he might be eligible to join the low-carb program, even though he has normal blood sugar and doesn't need to \"reverse type 2 diabetes,\" as the company promises. Sure enough, his employer allowed him to try it out.\n\nClark has lost over 75 pounds in the program and has discovered he has renewed energy for both work and hobbies, including wood carving. He says he's trimmer now than he was when he left the Army in his mid-20s. He's spent the past several months maintaining his weight and working on muscle building.\n\n\"I look pretty dang-on good right now for a 58-year-old guy,\" he said. \"Almost getting a six pack back.\"\n\nHe has also helped his son lose over 100 pounds using the nutrition techniques he's learned, which are in line with some of the recent federal nutrition guidelines, released in January.\n\nThis is no coincidence: Virta co-founder Jeff Volek helped draft the Trump Administration's new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encourage people to skip ultra-processed foods and added sugar, prioritizing animal protein and \"healthy\" fats.\n\nNow Clark eats more whole foods than he used to, including fruits, vegetables, and meat. He doesn't fuss too much about fat, especially the kind of fats in nuts, fish, and lean proteins like chicken.\n\n\"My journey's not over, but I am getting there,\" he said.\n\nMany nutrition experts say low-carb ketogenic diet plans like the one he's following are not right for everyone. Generally speaking, people without diabetes could benefit from more fiber and whole grains than this style of eating typically provides. Still, there are a few nutrition basics that just about every \"healthy\" diet plan agrees upon. Virta's low-carb strategy is no exception. Plants like fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds are good. Extra sugar and empty calories from white bread, cakes, and sodas? Not so much.\n\n\"There's this base of knowledge which is pretty translatable between different diet camps,\" nutrition scientist and ultra-processed food researcher Kevin Hall, co-author of the book \"Food Intelligence,\" previously told Business Insider. \"All of the camps can sort of agree on non-starchy vegetables and lowering added sugar.\"\n\nHall has performed studies showing that low-carb diets are not any better than low-fat diets, when it comes to how much fat people lose. Low-carb diets can be helpful for stabilizing blood sugar in patients with diabetes, but it's the quality of a person's diet that matters most.\n\n\"For the vast majority of people, it's really the processed and refined carbohydrates that they should avoid,\" Hall said. Carb-forward beans and strawberries, loaded with fiber and antioxidants, are great choices for most people.\n\nAnother big reason for the success of Virta patients like Clark, according to former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. David Kessler, is the \"built-in accountability\" that patients get from Virta's intensive, personalized coaching model, as he explains in his new book \"Diet, Drugs, and Dopamine: the New Science of Achieving a Healthy Weight.\"\n\nAs for Clark, he has a few evidence-based nutrition moves he credits with helping him make the lasting diet changes that he plans to stick to for the long haul.\n\nWhen Clark drives his 600-mile route from North Carolina to West Virginia and back overnight, he brings his own \"lunch,\" or gets a few essentials from the supermarket. No more greasy spoons. Broccoli, leafy lettuces, and cucumbers are now staple foods at his house for lunch and dinner.\n\n\"I'll pack a chicken breast and some broccoli, and then at around midnight when I get to a truck stop, I'll pull in and pop it in a microwave, and I'm pretty happy,\" he said.\n\nWith the help of his nutrition coach, Clark started meal prepping and shopping around the perimeter of the grocery store, a classic pro-nutrition move.\n\n\"Most of the crap is in the middle,\" he said.\n\nClark has found that over time, he is craving less sugar. It helps that he doesn't keep junk food in the house, since it's typically loaded with sugar, saturated fat, and refined flour. Now, he finds he wants veggies and other whole foods, including deer and rabbit for dinner, and blueberries as a sweet treat.\n\n\"Food itself tastes good as long as you change your taste buds,\" he said. \"It's going to take you a month for your taste buds to change.\"\n\nStudies suggest that most of our taste buds regenerate about every 10 days, but some take longer to turn over, around three weeks or so.\n\nClark said he still enjoys many of the same foods he used to eat, he just prepares them differently now.\n\n\"You can have the same stuff,\" he said. \"You can't have all the added crap that America puts on it.\"\n\nFor him, that means rotisserie chicken instead of fried chicken and homemade ice cream made from whipping cream and eggs, with far less sugar than store-bought tubs.\n\nThough the Clark house generally stays away from fast food and ultra-processed groceries now, there is some occasional wiggle room from time to time for a low-calorie, low-carb, ultra-processed dessert like Cool Whip with Jell-O. Even that's pretty rare these days, Clark said.\n\nClark says one of his biggest challenges in the program has been learning not to overeat. It's something he's talked over with his coach.\n\n\"I am an over eater — that's my biggest problem,\" he said. \"I like mass quantities of food.\"\n\nObesity medicine doctors say that's likely because Clark's \"enough\" point became dysregulated: as he gained weight, his brain sent signals to his body to eat more and store more fat, in protection mode against starvation.\n\nWith guidance tailored to his body size and a kitchen scale, Clark started measuring out a recommended 7 ounces of protein for lunch and dinner. But his coach also gave him a quick shortcut for thinking about his portion sizes.\n\n\"Your hand is your best tool,\" he said. \"The palm of your hand without your fingers is approximately 7 ounces, that's a portion of meat.\"\n\nWhen Clark started adding regular weightlifting into his workout routine, the number on his bathroom scale stagnated. His coach encouraged him to focus on other metrics instead.\n\n\"My muscles are getting bigger, and my waist is getting smaller,\" he said. \"My coach said, 'If you're happy with what you see in the mirror, be happy.'\"\n\nClark has been openly sharing his nutrition strategy with family and friends. His son has lost over 100 pounds using his techniques, and one of his long-haul trucking buddies has lost over 80 pounds.\n\n\"We talk every night: 'Hey man, what'd you eat today? Did you work out?'\" Clark said. It's another time-tested strategy: couples, friends, and families who lose weight together tend to have better long-term success.\n\nNow, Clark's wife is getting interested in the program.\n\n\"She sees me, and she's like, 'Man, you're doing really good. I want to try that.'\"\n\nFinally, Clark has developed a new routine of working out 6 days a week, alternating heart-healthy cardio (like a run) with weightlifting every other day. Building muscle mass is a great way to maintain the right kind of weight loss, encouraging the body to shed fat instead of muscle. If he's hungry after, he grabs a protein shake \"to fill my muscle stores up.\"\n\n\"I told my wife: one hour a day, I don't want anybody to bother me,\" Clark said. \"No phone calls, no 'honey, you got to fix the toilet, mow the grass.'\"\n\nNow, he looks forward to the dedicated, sacred time for workouts.\n\n\"An hour out of a day? Come on. That's nothing. Give it to yourself and then make it work,\" he said.",

    "description": "Jerry Clark says he's transformed his tastebuds, changed his portion sizes, and made fitness a non-negotiable.",
    "fullText": "When Jerry Clark decided to quit the Army, hit the road, and start driving long-haul truck routes 34 years ago, he had no idea what a dramatic impact the career change would have on his body.\n\n\"A truck driver is the worst job in the world for health,\" Clark told Business Insider.\n\nArguably, no one is required to sit more on the job than a truck driver. And we all know sitting is the new smoking.\n\nClark spent years tag-teaming across the country with his wife on trucker routes. At one point, before she retired, they were logging 8,000 miles together every workweek. The pair would drive almost three full lengths across the continent each week, eating whatever they could find to sustain them along the way.\n\n\"We eat at the greasy spoons,\" Clark said, explaining the average truck driver's meal plan. \"Everything is grease, or fried.\"\n\nAll that sitting and eating greasy food can lead to long-term health issues and body imbalances. Clark developed a stronger left leg from operating his clutch and a stronger right arm from being at the wheel for half of the day. He also gained over 50 pounds over the course of three decades.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, when he heard his employer was offering free nutrition coaching for people with diabetes through Virta Health, he wondered if he might be eligible to join the low-carb program, even though he has normal blood sugar and doesn't need to \"reverse type 2 diabetes,\" as the company promises. Sure enough, his employer allowed him to try it out.\n\nClark has lost over 75 pounds in the program and has discovered he has renewed energy for both work and hobbies, including wood carving. He says he's trimmer now than he was when he left the Army in his mid-20s. He's spent the past several months maintaining his weight and working on muscle building.\n\n\"I look pretty dang-on good right now for a 58-year-old guy,\" he said. \"Almost getting a six pack back.\"\n\nHe has also helped his son lose over 100 pounds using the nutrition techniques he's learned, which are in line with some of the recent federal nutrition guidelines, released in January.\n\nThis is no coincidence: Virta co-founder Jeff Volek helped draft the Trump Administration's new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encourage people to skip ultra-processed foods and added sugar, prioritizing animal protein and \"healthy\" fats.\n\nNow Clark eats more whole foods than he used to, including fruits, vegetables, and meat. He doesn't fuss too much about fat, especially the kind of fats in nuts, fish, and lean proteins like chicken.\n\n\"My journey's not over, but I am getting there,\" he said.\n\nMany nutrition experts say low-carb ketogenic diet plans like the one he's following are not right for everyone. Generally speaking, people without diabetes could benefit from more fiber and whole grains than this style of eating typically provides. Still, there are a few nutrition basics that just about every \"healthy\" diet plan agrees upon. Virta's low-carb strategy is no exception. Plants like fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds are good. Extra sugar and empty calories from white bread, cakes, and sodas? Not so much.\n\n\"There's this base of knowledge which is pretty translatable between different diet camps,\" nutrition scientist and ultra-processed food researcher Kevin Hall, co-author of the book \"Food Intelligence,\" previously told Business Insider. \"All of the camps can sort of agree on non-starchy vegetables and lowering added sugar.\"\n\nHall has performed studies showing that low-carb diets are not any better than low-fat diets, when it comes to how much fat people lose. Low-carb diets can be helpful for stabilizing blood sugar in patients with diabetes, but it's the quality of a person's diet that matters most.\n\n\"For the vast majority of people, it's really the processed and refined carbohydrates that they should avoid,\" Hall said. Carb-forward beans and strawberries, loaded with fiber and antioxidants, are great choices for most people.\n\nAnother big reason for the success of Virta patients like Clark, according to former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. David Kessler, is the \"built-in accountability\" that patients get from Virta's intensive, personalized coaching model, as he explains in his new book \"Diet, Drugs, and Dopamine: the New Science of Achieving a Healthy Weight.\"\n\nAs for Clark, he has a few evidence-based nutrition moves he credits with helping him make the lasting diet changes that he plans to stick to for the long haul.\n\nWhen Clark drives his 600-mile route from North Carolina to West Virginia and back overnight, he brings his own \"lunch,\" or gets a few essentials from the supermarket. No more greasy spoons. Broccoli, leafy lettuces, and cucumbers are now staple foods at his house for lunch and dinner.\n\n\"I'll pack a chicken breast and some broccoli, and then at around midnight when I get to a truck stop, I'll pull in and pop it in a microwave, and I'm pretty happy,\" he said.\n\nWith the help of his nutrition coach, Clark started meal prepping and shopping around the perimeter of the grocery store, a classic pro-nutrition move.\n\n\"Most of the crap is in the middle,\" he said.\n\nClark has found that over time, he is craving less sugar. It helps that he doesn't keep junk food in the house, since it's typically loaded with sugar, saturated fat, and refined flour. Now, he finds he wants veggies and other whole foods, including deer and rabbit for dinner, and blueberries as a sweet treat.\n\n\"Food itself tastes good as long as you change your taste buds,\" he said. \"It's going to take you a month for your taste buds to change.\"\n\nStudies suggest that most of our taste buds regenerate about every 10 days, but some take longer to turn over, around three weeks or so.\n\nClark said he still enjoys many of the same foods he used to eat, he just prepares them differently now.\n\n\"You can have the same stuff,\" he said. \"You can't have all the added crap that America puts on it.\"\n\nFor him, that means rotisserie chicken instead of fried chicken and homemade ice cream made from whipping cream and eggs, with far less sugar than store-bought tubs.\n\nThough the Clark house generally stays away from fast food and ultra-processed groceries now, there is some occasional wiggle room from time to time for a low-calorie, low-carb, ultra-processed dessert like Cool Whip with Jell-O. Even that's pretty rare these days, Clark said.\n\nClark says one of his biggest challenges in the program has been learning not to overeat. It's something he's talked over with his coach.\n\n\"I am an over eater — that's my biggest problem,\" he said. \"I like mass quantities of food.\"\n\nObesity medicine doctors say that's likely because Clark's \"enough\" point became dysregulated: as he gained weight, his brain sent signals to his body to eat more and store more fat, in protection mode against starvation.\n\nWith guidance tailored to his body size and a kitchen scale, Clark started measuring out a recommended 7 ounces of protein for lunch and dinner. But his coach also gave him a quick shortcut for thinking about his portion sizes.\n\n\"Your hand is your best tool,\" he said. \"The palm of your hand without your fingers is approximately 7 ounces, that's a portion of meat.\"\n\nWhen Clark started adding regular weightlifting into his workout routine, the number on his bathroom scale stagnated. His coach encouraged him to focus on other metrics instead.\n\n\"My muscles are getting bigger, and my waist is getting smaller,\" he said. \"My coach said, 'If you're happy with what you see in the mirror, be happy.'\"\n\nClark has been openly sharing his nutrition strategy with family and friends. His son has lost over 100 pounds using his techniques, and one of his long-haul trucking buddies has lost over 80 pounds.\n\n\"We talk every night: 'Hey man, what'd you eat today?

It's another time-tested strategy: couples, friends, and families who lose weight together tend to have better long-term success.\n\nNow, Clark's wife is getting interested in the program.\n\n\"She sees me, and she's like, 'Man, you're doing really good.

    "description": "Kai Havertz’s knee issue flared up again in recent weeks, and plans to give him minutes in Arsenal’s coming games will double as a chance to assess his fitness.Photo via Arsenal on TwitterIsaan Kh...",
    "fullText": "Isaan Khan reports for the Daily Mail that Arsenal have concerns over Kai Havertz’s long-term fitness after another recent flare-up of his knee injury.\n\nHavertz initially injured his knee back at the start of the season in August, and just when he was on the verge of a comeback he suffered a setback to the same knee in November.\n\nKhan claims Havertz’s knee then reacted again to his recent injury comeback, hence the decision to manage his workload by leaving him out for a couple of games earlier this month.\n\nThere are fears that if the knee continues to flare up it could have a long-term impact on Havertz’s fitness, so the club are acting very cautiously with the forward.\n\nThat being said, the report adds that Havertz is expected to be given further minutes in the coming days and weeks. Those minutes will then be used to assess whether the 26-year-old can be consistently available for starts over the remainder of the campaign.\n\nIt’s certainly a worrying update, and it goes some way to explaining why Havertz has only played 29 minutes across Arsenal’s last seven games since he first made it back into the squad.\n\nPerhaps next week’s game against Kairat Almaty could provide an opportunity for a lower-stakes test, given Arsenal only need a home draw against the Champions League’s bottom-ranked club to secure first place in the League Phase.\n\nEven a defeat and a goal difference swing to leave Arsenal in second place wouldn’t matter for any reason other than the finances involved. In sporting terms, finishing first or second makes no difference, as you will be randomly drawn against one of the same two teams either way.\n\nConsidering the rest of Arsenal’s fixture list largely contains vital Premier League matches, League Cup semi-finals, and so on, there won’t be many better chances to properly reintroduce Havertz.",

    "description": "Olympic legend Katie Ledecky loves training. Her workout tips make it easier to exercise to build muscle, strength, and speed like an elite athlete.",
    "fullText": "One of the most decorated Olympians of all time said that after decades of training, she's still excited to work out.\n\nKatie Ledecky has earned 14 Olympic medals (nine of them gold) for her prowess in the pool. In events like the 800-meter freestyle, she's her own biggest competition, breaking her own world records in the quest for her personal best.\n\n\"I do really love the training,\" she told Business Insider. \"And I think because I love the training, it makes it very easy to go to practice every day and really continue to strive toward these big goals that I've set for myself.\"\n\nLedecky's training plan involves long hours in the pool, of course. But her dry-land workouts incorporate a mix of high-intensity circuits and weightlifting to build muscle.\n\n\"Swimming is a full-body exercise. So upper body strength, lower body strength, core strength, mobility, all those things are important,\" Ledecky said.\n\nThe gold medalist's approach can help you get the most out of your gym time even if you're not headed for the Olympics, with simple strategies to level up your workouts.\n\nA typical workout for Ledecky includes movements like cleans, squats, deadlifts, and pull-ups that help build explosive athleticism to stay ahead in the pool.\n\n\"Things like that translate well to developing power and pushing off the wall,\" she said.\n\nNon-swimmers can benefit, too: full-body exercises are one of the most efficient ways to build muscle, since you're working arms, legs, core, and back all at once. They can also improve mobility if you're training in a full range of motion.\n\nLedecky also incorporates circuit training with bike sprints and sled pushes. These shorter bursts of high-intensity exercise are great for improving your cardio fitness when you're short on time, and are linked to better longevity.\n\nLedecky has been swimming since she was six, and competed at her first Olympics (London 2012) at age 15.\n\nSince then, she's been to the Olympics three more times, dominating at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, in Tokyo 2020, and Paris 2024. She's also held multiple World Championship titles.\n\nThe training doesn't stop between big events. To stay focused leading up to international competitions, she said her approach is all about showing up to put in the work, over and over again.\n\n\"I've just always had a goal of consistency and I take it one year at a time, one day at a time,\" Ledecky said.\n\nFor everyday athletes, it's a good reminder to find a sustainable exercise routine. Personal trainers recommend starting small and building up over time, since exercise only works if you can keep doing it long enough to see results.\n\nLedecky said one of her favorite aspects of swimming is the intensely supportive community, from the youngest athletes who start at age six to the most elite competitors.\n\n\"It's seen very much as an individual sport, but I think many swimmers would say they couldn't do it without their team. There's such great camaraderie,\" she said.\n\nThat team spirit, encouragement, and playful rivalry among friends is what keeps Ledecky going through early-morning sessions in a cold pool and long hours of hard training.\n\nA good fitness community can make a big difference for everyday athletes, too — research shows you're more likely to stick to a workout plan and get results if you find a gym buddy (or many).\n\n\"It makes the motivation piece really easy when you know that you're in it with someone else,\" Ledecky said.\n\nFor peak performance, training is only part of the equation. Resting is crucial to allow the body to build back stronger. Ledecky has been competing for over a decade, and at 28 said she needs more recovery time than before.\n\n\"When I was 15, I don't remember ever feeling tired,\" she said. \"I'm definitely making sure that I'm getting extra sleep at night and getting naps in when I can.\"\n\nThe Olympian said she prioritizes getting enough sleep and eating a balanced diet (she loves a veggie omelet and has a partnership with egg brand Eggland's Best). The basic habits work better than an elaborate or high-tech protocol, according to Ledecky.\n\n\"It's not anything too crazy or too out there,\" she said. \"It's really just the simple things I think are the most important things.\"",

    "title": "Fitness Culture Has a Hyper-Personalization Problem",
    "description": "More isn't always better.",
    "fullText": "The latest craze in the fitness world—from gym culture, to nutrition planning, to recovery protocols— is hyper-personalized optimization. But is there really a benefit to at-home microbiome tests that reveal the optimal diet for your gut bacteria? How about a device that tells you whether you're burning carbs or fat with each breath?\n\nPersonalized fitness advice used to be largely limited to factors like height and weight, but now you might have a Whoop, Oura, or Apple Watch wearable tracking your track heart rate variability, skin temperature, blood oxygen, and so much more. Continuous glucose monitors, once reserved for diabetics, are now worn by biohackers and CrossFit enthusiasts trying to optimize their carb timing.\n\nOn the one hand, the appeal of having unprecedented insight into your body's unique needs is understandable. On the other, there's a looming shadow behind all this data: As the metrics multiply, so does the potential for anxiety. When every workout, meal, and bedtime becomes a referendum on dozens of competing data points, decision fatigue is likely to set in. And as your algorithms suggest targeted interventions for every perceived deficiency, someone else—likely a giant corporation getting fat off of user data—is profiting. The question looms larger with each new device metric: Does more data actually lead to better health outcomes?\n\nYour wearable spits out a sleep (or stress) report every morning. How is this data serving you? \"Metabolic testing, biomechanics, and body composition are all forms of objective data that can be pretty powerful when collected in validated settings and interpreted by professionals who understand physiology and adaptation,\" says Lekshmi Kumar, a performance physiologist at Boston-based Human Powered Health. But consumer devices, while improving, exist in a different category: \"Consistent research has bolstered consumer-facing tools and significant improvements have been made over the past several years. But they're still not considered substitutes for professional-grade assessments,\" Kumar says. In other words, for a lot of bio-hacking endeavors, there’s a major gap between the numbers you see and their potential real-life applications.\n\nKumar sees three critical prerequisites for data to actually improve outcomes: data quality, proper context, and accurate interpretation. \"Absent these, we often see expensive and excessive supplementation, conflicting recommendations, and decision fatigue,\" she says. The real danger, she says, isn't the data itself—it's the illusion of expertise it creates.\n\nMany direct-to-consumer tests lack the clinical validation of their medical-grade counterparts. Interpretation of the data is frequently automated, missing nuance that a trained professional might catch. And the recommendations often trend toward more—more supplements, more tracking, more intervention—rather than identifying changes that might actually move the needle. It's a hard truth that no wellness product actually cares more about your health than its company's profits.\n\nPerhaps the most insidious cost of hyper-personalization is less financial, and more psychological: When every metric matters, decision-making becomes paralyzing. Should you work out today even though your HRV is down? Is that meal worth the glucose spike? Did last night's 6.5 hours of sleep doom today's training session?\n\nThe constant feedback loop can transform exercise from a joyful practice into an optimization problem to be solved. This isn’t the first time I’ve pointed out the trappings of wellness culture. The internal compass—how do I actually feel?—gets drowned out by all the external data streams. Ironically, the tools meant to “empower” can instead create dependency, where you can’t trust their own bodily sensations without technological confirmation.\n\nWhen implemented thoughtfully (with quality data, proper interpretation, and professional guidance), personalized approaches can obviously aid you in optimizing training, recovery, and nutrition in ways generic programs cannot. Elite athletes have long used sophisticated testing—VO2 max assessments, lactate threshold testing, motion capture analysis—to gain advantages, however marginal. As these tools become more accessible, it makes sense their benefits can extend beyond the professional realm.\n\nBut accessibility without expertise? That’s a different matter. Consider two hypothetical people concerned about their fitness: Person A tracks sleep quality, HRV, resting heart rate, blood oxygen, skin temperature, glucose levels, and workout strain—but lacks a framework to understand how these metrics interact, or what to do when they conflict. Person B follows a simple evidence-based program: strength training three times per week, 30 minutes of cardio on alternate days, eight hours of sleep, and a balanced diet with adequate protein. Even absent all that data, Person B will likely see better results and experience far less angst about their health.\n\nAgain, there are the economic incentives to consider too. Companies profit from selling more tests, more devices, more subscriptions, and more supplements. The business model depends on convincing consumers they need increasingly granular data to achieve their goals. This creates an environment where the answer to \"what should I track?\" is almost always \"more than you're tracking now,\" regardless of whether the additional data actually serves you.\n\n\"The biggest gains won't come from chasing every single flashy metric,\" says Kumar. \"They'll come from identifying the variables that matter most to the specific individual, and working with a credentialed professional who can assist in translating the information into meaningful takeaways and actions.\"\n\nWhat does smart, targeted tracking look like in practice? Here are scenarios where specific metrics can genuinely help:\n\nFor a runner struggling with fatigue: Tracking HRV and resting heart rate can reveal when you're not recovering adequately between training blocks. If these metrics trend downward over weeks, it's a signal to dial back intensity or add rest days—something that matters far more than monitoring glucose fluctuations after breakfast.\n\nFor someone with persistent digestive issues: A food diary paired with symptom tracking (not necessarily a microbiome test kit) can help identify genuine patterns. Working with a registered dietitian to systematically eliminate or reintroduce foods provides actionable insights, unlike a $200 test suggesting you eat more fermented foods.\n\nFor someone desperate to improve sleep: Use your gadgets to track total sleep time and sleep consistency. That matters more than obsessing over REM percentages. Focus on establishing a regular pre-sleep routine and measuring whether you feel rested, rather than achieving some algorithm's \"optimal\" sleep score.\n\nFor the lifter hitting a plateau: Remember that linear gains are for beginners. Instead of stressing over daily scale readings, focus on your training log tracking progressive overload and consider following these tips.\n\nYou'll notice a patter here: Each tracking approach is targeted, time-bound, and directly connected to a specific goal or problem—not a fruitless pursuit to optimize every single thing all the time.\n\nIn a culture obsessed with optimization, it’s getting harder and harder to cut through the noise. But maybe your goal shouldn’t be to track everything. As hyper-personalization continues its ascent, think about how you’re engaging with every new tool. The wisest approach may be a picky one: choosing one or two key metrics that align with specific goals. Because more information isn't automatically better, and consumer tools have real limitations, and that the human body is beautifully, frustratingly complex—not exactly reducible to a dashboard of numbers.",

    "description": "Including how to substitute easier exercises, and what to do when you just can't keep up.",
    "fullText": "A workout habit has a way of building momentum: Once you’re doing something, anything, it’s easy to build on that. Video workouts are a simple way to get started, but if you're having trouble following along, I'm here to help. Below are some ways to make common exercises more accessible, and what to do if you can't get through a whole video yet.\n\nLots of “easy” bodyweight programs ask you to perform a squatting motion without any added weight. But if that’s already more than you can do, try one of these instead:\n\nSit in a chair, and stand back up.\n\nLean your back against a wall and slide down until you’re in a sitting position (this is called a wall squat).\n\nHold onto a countertop or the back of a chair while you do a squat.\n\nFor any of these, it’s okay to squat as low as you can, even if that’s not all the way to parallel. You can work on going lower over time.\n\nPushups are another move you’ll find in simple beginner workouts, but not everyone can do a pushup on their first day. Pushups get easier the higher your hands are, and harder the higher your feet are. So for the easiest beginner version, put your hands on a wall around shoulder height. Lean into the wall, then push yourself back to a standing position.\n\nOnce those become easy, choose a lower surface, like a table or countertop. Then move to a chair, and so on. This progression is arguably better than doing pushups on your knees, because no matter which level you’re on, you are practicing holding your entire body straight in a plank position.\n\nDumbbells come in all sizes—and fortunately for beginners, the smallest ones are also the cheapest. If your gym doesn’t have dumbbells small enough, any store with a sporting goods section will likely have some one- and two-pound dumbbells you can pick up and add to your gym bag.\n\nBut if you’re not even ready for dumbbells, that’s okay. A half-liter water bottle weighs about a pound. Same with a can of soup. Larger water bottles, wine bottles, and milk jugs can take you up a bit further in weight; we did the math for you here. You can also hold books, roller skates, or tote bags full of literally anything. (Two water bottles in a grocery bag? That’s a two-pound weight.)\n\nNeed to start even lighter? It’s okay to do weight workouts using literally nothing. Make your hands into fists and go through the motions. If you’re following a video that does a million reps of bicep curls or tricep extensions, your arms will get tired even if they’re empty. Just move up to the water bottles as soon as you’re ready.\n\nWith these substitutions, you may feel ready to start following along with beginner level workout videos. But what if you can’t handle exactly what’s on the screen? Remember, your goal should be to do a workout at your current level of fitness, not to complete a certain number of reps that you theoretically could do if you were in better shape. So if the video asks for 30 seconds of pushups but you can only manage a few reps, do as many as you can and rest for the remainder of the time.\n\nIt’s fine to bounce from video to video until you find something at your level. Keep an eye out for one that seems like fun but is just out of your reach. Do it anyway, modifying it or resting as needed, and then bookmark it and come back to it next week. Chances are good you’ll be able to keep up a little bit better—and if you keep coming back to that same workout week after week, you’ll eventually master it. Consistency breeds momentum.\n\nLet’s say you want to do a workout from a Peloton-like cycling instructor. You’ve got your bike, you can pedal, but pretty quickly you’re out of breath and feel like you can’t keep going.\n\nThese workouts are easy to adjust: All you have to do is pay attention to the instructor’s voice and facial expressions and ignore any specific numbers. It doesn’t matter if she’s asking you for a “20” or a “50.” If the instructor looks and talks like she’s on an easy bike ride, adjust your resistance so you are on an easy bike ride. If she looks like she’s working hard but not dying, adjust your resistance so you are working hard but not dying.\n\nStart literally anywhere. There isn’t a wrong answer. Maybe you start doing cardio dance videos, but it turns out you hate dancing. Well, you’re already moving your body a couple times a week, so you can swap out the dancing for something else.\n\nOr maybe you start doing pushups every day, but after a while your wrists are aching. You can choose to address that problem and continue your pushups, or you can look back on how far you’ve come, congratulate yourself, and pick a different thing to try for the next chapter of your fitness journey. After all, you’ve already started, so why not keep going?",

    "fullText": "CNN medical analyst Jonathan Reiner has called on Congress to launch an investigation into Donald Trump‘s “fitness” to serve as President, following his ongoing attempts to own Greenland.\n\nReiner, who previously served as cardiologist to the late Vice President Dick Cheney, took to X on Monday (January 19) to share his thoughts on Trump’s letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre. In the letter, the president appears to link his threats to acquire Greenland to his not having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote in the letter, which he also asked to be distributed to other European countries.\n\nIn his post, Reiner wrote, “This letter, and the fact that the president directed that it be distributed to other European countries, should trigger a bipartisan congressional inquiry into presidential fitness.”\n\nThis letter, and the fact that the president directed that it be distributed to other European countries, should trigger a bipartisan congressional inquiry into presidential fitness. https://t.co/HkHzsiTau4\n\n— Jonathan Reiner (@JReinerMD) January 19, 2026\n\nReiner’s comments come just days after he said Trump needed to be evaluated, following a recent Oval Office meeting that appeared to show the President falling asleep while surrounded by officials and guests.\n\n“The president seems to be struggling with excessive daytime somnolence,” Reiner wrote, referring to the condition Hypersomnia, which makes a person feel extremely sleepy during the day. “Repeatedly falling asleep with a dozen people surrounding your desk is not normal. It needs to be evaluated.”\n\nReiner has spoken frequently about his concerns for Trump’s health in recent months. Last month, the medical expert talked to CNN’s Jake Tapper about Trump’s December 17 White House address, which he said “was delivered with a manic cadence, almost a frantic cadence… And that kind of manic delivery was very, very disturbing.”\n\nHe also touched on Trump’s apparent sleepiness, adding, “It’s jarring to see the president go from basically asleep in the Oval Office to, you know, really this rapid-fire pace during basically a 30 minute speech that he gave in 18 minutes.”\n\nEarlier this month, Reiner responded to Trump’s comments about his high-dose aspirin regimen, calling it “nonsense” and medically unnecessary.\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "title": "Both Walking And Cycling Can Help You Lose Weight—But One Is More Effective for Strength and Weight Loss",
    "description": "Walking and cycling are both great workouts for different goals. Trainers explain which workout is better for endurance, strength, and weight loss.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nWalking has had quite a year, between the rise of the viral hot girl walking trend on social media and walking accessories like bala bangles and weighted vests becoming trendy. It’s a solid form of cardio, but that doesn’t mean you should sleep on other heart-healthy workouts, like the oldie-but-goodie activity of cycling.\n\nWalking and cycling are two of the most popular types of aerobic workouts—and there’s a reason. For starters, they’re both low-impact, meaning, they’re “easier on the joints than, say, running or HIIT training,” says Olivia Amato, CPT, a bike, tread, boot camp, and strength instructor for Peloton based in New York City.\n\nWhen it comes to walking vs. cycling, both activities are great for beginners and can be made more difficult—either by walking with wrist or ankle weights, or cranking up the resistance on your bike. Both forms of exercise have perks when it comes to improving endurance, building strength, and losing weight, but one *may* reign supreme.\n\nWondering which form of exercise to make a mainstay in your workout routine? Ahead, trainers reveal the benefits of both—and how to integrate walking and cycling into your schedule.\n\nWalking is low-impact, so it’s easy on the joints, and it’s accessible—all you need is a pair of walking shoes—and you can get your steps in either outdoors or inside on a treadmill, says Claudette Sariya, CPT, a NASM-certified personal trainer and alum of the Women’s Health/Men’s Health Strength in Diversity initiative based in New York City.\n\nWalking is also easy to intensify. If you’re used to walking on flat ground (or the treadmill), you can level up your walks by going uphill or increasing the incline, Sariya adds. You can also walk faster, or wear a weighted vest or ankle or wrist weights.\n\nWalking is also a weight-bearing exercise, as “you're holding up your entire body as you're moving,” says Amato. This can strengthen your lower body and improve your posture, back pain, and bone density, adds Melissa Darlow, RDN, CPT, a New York City-based registered dietitian and certified trainer. And walking can definitely improve your endurance and stamina, depending on the type of walking you’re doing and for how long. For instance, power walking is a great way to build your stamina, Amato says.\n\nCycling is even lower-impact than walking, Amato says, adding that it’s gentler on your knees and hips since pedaling provides support, so you don’t have to hold your body up as much. You can pedal as slow or fast as you want and easily increase the resistance, so it’s easy to control the intensity of the workout. The fact that you can add more resistance while cycling versus walking leads to bigger strength gains and more calories burned, Sariya says.\n\nGenerally, walking is “definitely one of the forms of working out that's going to build lower body strength,” Amato says. It’s a better core workout than cycling because you’re standing up and you have to maintain your balance while moving, Sariya adds. (Walking up an incline works your core even harder because you have to brace it to protect your lower back, Amato adds.) Plus, if you’re wearing a weighted vest, you’ll work all of your lower body muscles, especially your outer quads and calves.\n\nHowever, you won’t get a true strength workout from walking because you’re not bearing as much weight as you would if you’re lifting dumbbells, for example, Darlow says. You can really only build muscle while cycling if you’re walking up an incline, but even then, it’s not a lot, says Sariya. But “in combination with other weightbearing exercises, absolutely, [walking] can lead to an increased level of strength,” Darlow says.\n\nWhen it comes to cycling, because there’s an ability to add resistance, it builds more strength and muscle in your full body, especially your lower body muscles like the inner thighs, quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves, and ankles, Sariya says. You’re also using your core and arms to hold yourself up. The resistance also helps build strength faster than you would if you were just walking, Amato adds. So, you can spend less time cycling than walking, and become stronger.\n\nIf you want to burn body fat, you’ll want to get your heart rate into Zone 2 or 3—the threshold states where your body burns fat as fuel—either while walking or biking. You can do this by walking on an incline or increasing resistance on your bike—you just need to see that your heart rate hits that threshold.\n\nFYI, you’ll know if you’re doing Zone 2 cardio if your heart rate is at 60 to 70 percent of your max (multiply your age by 0.7, then subtract that number from 208). Or, if you don’t own a tracker, you might feel like your rate of perceived exertion (RPE), i.e., the effort it takes you to do the workout, is at a three to five out of 10. For Zone 3 cardio, your heart rate will be at 70 to 80 percent of your heart rate max, and your RPE will be at a six out of ten.\n\nIt’s easier to burn calories faster on a bike because you can up the resistance. In order to burn the same amount of calories walking, you need to add weights and increase your speed, Sariya says. So, if you only have 20 minutes and you don’t have a weighted vest or ankle weights, it’s more efficient to hop on a bike if weight loss is your goal, Amato says.\n\nThe most effective way to lose weight is by picking an activity you’ll stay consistent with, Darlow says. So, if you \n\nSince you can tap into different cardio zones in both workouts, they’re both good for heart health. But if you only have a few minutes for a workout, “cycling is going to be your best bet because it's easy and quick for you to change your resistance and be able to switch from your Zone 2 into your Zone 4 and then back down,” Sariya says. But with walking, you might not have an incline or hills nearby to walk on, or there might be people in your way on the sidewalk, which makes it harder to change your speed to reach a higher zone.\n\nHowever, “as long as someone is finding a regular movement routine and challenging themselves to an extent,” your heart will see benefits, regardless of whether you’re walking or cycling, Darlow adds.\n\nWhether your goals are improving endurance, building strength, or losing weight, cycling is a better workout, especially if you only have a few minutes to exercise, Sariya says. But adding both walking and cycling into your routine is also beneficial for working the full body, Amato adds.\n\nHere’s how to fit walking and/or cycling into your routine, based on your goals.\n\nIf your goal is building endurance: Cycle or walk three to four times a week for 35 minutes, making sure that for 80 percent of the workout, your heart rate is in Zone 2 cardio. The other time should be spent cycling between Zone 3 and 4 cardio, Sariya says. This interval training will help build your endurance.\n\nIf your goal is improving strength: Cycle two to three times a week for 35 to 45 minutes, cranking up your resistance so it feels like you’re going uphill. On a scale of one to 10, you should feel like you’re giving 70 or 80 percent in terms of how hard you’re pushing, but also give yourself a few breaks during the workout. Supplement your cycling sessions with two to three days of strength training.\n\nIf your goal is losing weight: Get at least 30 to 45 minutes of cardio in four to five days a week, whether you’re walking on an incline or cycling with your resistance up. Make sure your heart is in Zone 2 or 3 for the entire workout so you burn fat.\n\nAt the end of the day, both walking and cycling are great, and you’ll see gains from both. “What's right for you really depends on your personal goals and what makes you happy,” Amato says. “Finding any way to move that you enjoy is really the goal.” So, whether you’re walking or cycling, make sure to push yourself, and you’ll see the best gains.\n\nMeet The Experts: Olivia Amato, CPT, is a bike, tread, boot camp, and strength instructor for Peloton based in New York City.

    "description": "I tried on leggings at Lululemon, Alo, and Athleta to see which would be best for a workout. They were all nice, but one had the best fabric.",
    "fullText": "One of my major goals for 2026 is to increase my movement and establish a consistent exercise routine. I've committed to working out at least four days a week, so I was due for an athletic wardrobe upgrade.\n\nFrom yoga classes to weightlifting and daily walks, I needed something durable and fashionable — because there's nothing like a cute gym outfit to give me a boost of confidence during my workout.\n\nSo, I turned to a few of the most raved about retailers, including Alo, Lululemon, and Athleta to find a great pair.\n\nHere's how my day of shopping went.\n\nAlo Yoga is a high-end athleisure brand that was originally known for creating sleek, performance-driven activewear designed to suit yogis in the studio and in everyday life. Nowadays, the brand sells everything from leggings and athleisure to casual dresses and trousers.\n\nI used to visit my nearby Alo store regularly just to window shop, so I figured it would be a good place to start in my search for a great pair of leggings.\n\nAlthough the brand's line of trendy clothing is impressive (I wish I could buy it all, honestly), there were only a few true athletic options in-store. Between cargo jackets, matching sweatsuits, and accessories, it was a challenge just to find a single pair of workout-appropriate leggings.\n\nEventually, I spotted the high-waist Airlift leggings in the limited edition \"clover green\" color. At first glance, I was drawn to the soft and shiny material, made from the brand's high-compression performance fabric (82% polyester and 18% elastane).\n\nWhen I tried these leggings on, I could immediately tell they were flattering and well constructed. I loved the thick waistband and the fact that there were no side seams.\n\nHowever, they seemed to run a bit small. Plus, the compression element eliminated some of the stretchiness, comfort, and breathability, which are priorities for me during workouts.\n\nIf I were to buy these, I'd most likely wear them for athleisure looks during casual outings, like running errands or going on coffee dates, rather than for exercising. For that reason, I couldn't justify the $134 price tag.\n\nLululemon is a premium athletic brand known for its soft fabrics and flattering designs.\n\nI own a few pairs of Lululemon leggings that I bought at least five years ago, and I still wear them semi-regularly even after countless hot yoga classes, hikes, and gym sessions. So, I wanted to see if the quality was still up to par.\n\nLuckily, there were tons of options available in-store, including a full wall of leggings. I grabbed a sage-green pair of the Wunder Train no-line high-rise tight leggings to try on.\n\nWhen I put these on, I could tell immediately how soft the material (made from 77% nylon and 23% Lycra elastane) was.\n\nThe material was pretty thick, similar to the version from Alo, but it was still flexible. These felt more suitable for various kinds of workouts.\n\nI loved the actual design, too, especially because there was no center seam down the middle and an extra-thick waistband. They looked flattering on me, and I would feel confident wearing these at the gym or for casual outings.\n\nThese leggings cost $108, which is definitely an investment. But considering that my other pairs have stood the test of time, I debated purchasing these as well.\n\nBefore choosing a favorite, I wanted to try one more store with a strong reputation. Even though I don't own anything from Athleta, I've admired the brand for a while because of its many modern and colorful styles.\n\nThe store I visited had tons of options available and was solely dedicated to activewear and athleisure. It was well organized by style and easy to find what I was looking for.\n\nI picked up the Elation ultra-high-rise leggings in the shadow-gray shade and brought them to the fitting room.\n\nMy first impression after putting these on was that they look and feel almost exactly like a pair of $30 leggings I own from Amazon.\n\nThat said, the material was incredibly soft and comfortable. Made from 75% nylon and 25% Lycra elastane, it was stretchy and would work well for most workouts.\n\nHowever, the fit wasn't as flattering as the other pairs I tried on. It did have a thick waistband, but there was a thin band of elastic around the top of it, which emphasized and dug into my midsection.\n\nAt $89, these were the most affordable of the three pairs I tried on. Plus, I later saw them on sale for $70 online. I'd be interested to try on some other Athleta styles, but honestly, this pair didn't win me over.\n\nOverall, my favorite pair was from Lululemon, and I can understand how the brand has maintained its popularity over time.\n\nIn addition to the comfortable material and flattering silhouette, I know from experience that this pair of leggings would likely hold up well over time.",

    "title": "Heart Rate Variability",
    "description": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful metric of your overall health. HRV measures the difference in time between each heartbeat, which fluctuates slightly. High HRV is generally considered better. Low HRV can be caused by medical conditions, stress, or intense fitness training.",
    "fullText": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful—if complex—metric of your overall health. Your Apple Watch automatically measures HRV, including while sleeping. We’ll try to give an overview here, but you could really write a whole book on what HRV means.\n\nA healthy heart is not a metronome: as your heart beats, the timing between each beat shifts slightly. For example, one heart beat may come 900 millseconds after another, and then the next one 950 millseconds after that. That’s healthy and good.\n\nYour HRV measures the variation in time between these heart beats. The unit of HRV is millseconds, and a normal HRV is 18-76ms.\n\nWhile HRV is derived from heart rate, it’s actually a broader window into your overall health.\n\nThe main influence on HRV is your autonomic nervous system (ANS). Since your ANS is connected to your liver, kidney, stomach, brain, and more, HRV is actually a really powerful metric of many different organ systems in your body. We’ll cover the autonomic nervous system more below, including the how HRV sometimes reflects medical conditions like anxiety, depression, dysautonomia, digestive tract problems, and more.\n\nAnything between 18 to 76 ms is a normal heart rate variability. Within 18-76ms, higher HRVs are usually better.\n\nDepending on age and sex, below 18 ms is a low HRV. This is around the bottom 10%. An HRV above 76 ms would put you in the 90th percentile of Apple Watch users.\n\nThe Apple Watch measures the time of each heart beat using its optical heart rate sensor. Apple Watch calculates HRV using SDNN: the standard deviation between normal-to-normal heart beat intevals.\n\nSDNN is defined mathematically as:\n\nSDNN = sqrt(Σ(NN_i - mean(NN))² / (N - 1))\n\nHere’s an example. Let’s say your heart is beating around 60bpm. The spacing between heart beats isn’t going to be exactly 1 second—it will vary a little bit, beat to beat. Let’s say the first heart beat comes, then a second one 1040 ms later, then a third heart beat 960 ms later, then a final heart beat exactly 1000ms later. Your NN intervals are then 1040ms, 960ms, and 1000ms.\n\nYour average N-N (normal to normal) interval is 1000ms. The standard deviation is 32.6 ms. That means your HRV\nis 32.6 ms, using the SDNN method. Other wearables like Whoop use different formulas for HRV, such as RMSSD, which we’ll explain now.\n\nThere are several formulas to calculate HRV. The two most common are SDNN (used by Apple Watch) and RMSSD:\n\nHRV is influenced by your autonomic nervous system, which has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (your “fight or flight” response) and the parasympathetic nervous system (your “rest and digest” response, which is controlled by the vagus nerve). When the sympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is lower. When the parasympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is higher.\n\nA low or high HRV can have many meanings and causes, including mental health, dysautonomia, diabetes, or simply stress. Let’s go\nthrough each potential cause.\n\nA common cause of temporary low HRV on your Apple Watch is stress or intense fitness training. However, medical conditions\ncan also cause low HRVs (or high HRVs). The most common conditions that affect HRV are dysautonomia, anxiety, depression, nerve damage, abnormal heart rhythms, and some gut health conditions.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of dysautonomia is imbalance between the sympathetic nervous system (often overactive) and the parasympathetic nervous system (often withdrawn). People with dysautonomia, POTS, and Long Covid often haver low HRV. While HRV itself is not used in diagnosis of POTS, the pattern of heart rate and blood pressure when going from laying to standing is. You can book an appointment with an Empirical Health doctor\nto get POTS testing and treatment.\n\nLow HRV can sometimes be a sign of depression or anxiety. Improving HRV through practices like mindfulness, physical activity, stress management, and medication can support better emotional regulation and mental health.\n\nNerve damage (for example, from diabetes) can cause low HRV. Nerve damage affects HRV by disrupting the balance and communication between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. When nerves responsible for these regulatory pathways are damaged, the body’s ability to adjust heart rate in response to stressors and environmental changes becomes impaired. This leads to a decrease in HRV.\n\nFinally, very low or high HRV can also be caused by an electrical problem in the heart (for example, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or supraventricular tachycardia). In these cases, an ECG can give more diagnostic information on exactly what is happening in the heart’s electrical system.\n\nThe image above shows two common abnormal heart rhythms, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, on an ECG. Atrial fibrillation is highly irregular, leading to high HRV. Atrial flutter is very regular, leading to no or low HRV. Either of these rhythms require attention from a medical professional.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 and above include an FDA-cleared ECG sensor that can help distinguish whether low or high HRV is caused by an abnormal heart rhythm. The current Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 9 (released in 2025) both include the ECG sensor, but not\nthe Apple Watch SE3.\n\nSince the vagus nerve is connected with your stomach, intenstines, liver, and so on, low HRV can sometimes be correlated with problems in the digestive tract.\n\nBecause HRV correlates with so much in the body, it’s a powerful metric but doesn’t give specific diagnostic information on exactly what’s wrong. If you have concerns or questions about HRV, it’s best to talk with a doctor about your specific medical situation. You can book an appointment through the Empirical Health app.\n\nWhat is HRV and what does it have to do with health?\n\nRaquel Rodriguez Martinez, MD, MPP\n\nYour guide to Apple Watch's heart rate monitor",

    "fullText": "Manchester United boss Marc Skinner says Ella Toone has \"a chance\" of being available for February's Champions League ties against Atletico Madrid.\n\nEngland attacking midfielder Toone sustained a hip injury in late December that ruled her out of Saturday's goalless draw with Arsenal in the Women's Super League.\n\nSkinner said the problem was likely to keep Toone, 26, sidelined for \"six to eight weeks\" in total.\n\nAbout half that time has now elapsed, with United travelling to play Atletico in the Champions League last 16 on Thursday, 12 February and hosting the second leg seven days later.\n\nIn Toone's absence, United have bolstered their attack with the signing of Sweden striker Ellen Wangerheim, 21, from Hammarby on a three-year deal.\n\nPrior to last Saturday, Toone had featured in every WSL match for United this season, scoring three times and providing five assists.\n\nWith United still in contention for the three domestic competitions as well as in the hunt for European silverware, Skinner has to balance the desire to have Toone in his team with the risk of potentially accelerating her recovery too quickly.\n\n\"There is a chance she could be back going into those windows, but it moves every day,\" he said. \"It is what is best for Ella as well.\n\n\"We can't rush her back. She will be ready for football before the end of the season for sure.\"\n\nTalented Sweden striker Wangerheim is the latest addition to a United attack that has also been reinforced with Germany star Lea Schuller this window.\n\nWangerheim arrives in Manchester after scoring 17 goals for Hammarby to help them finish second in the Swedish league in November.\n\nShe was an unused substitute for Sweden when England beat them on penalties in the European Championship quarter-finals last summer.\n\nSkinner said the new signing will allow his side to be \"more unpredictable\" in their quest to win titles this season.\n\n\"I thought we were becoming too predictable,\" he said. \"The Manchester United spirit is about attacking with speed and invasion - and she brings that in abundance.\n\n\"She is a lovely quiet character off the field. On it, she gets alive. She wants to take people on and run behind and I felt we had lost that a little bit.\n\n\"She is 21 but has so much experience already. She had 3,000 minutes in 2025 but still sits in the category of us being able to add lots of quality to her football too.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "And laying off 1,500 people as it pivots from VR to AI wearables.",
    "fullText": "Users of Supernatural got an unpleasant surprise this week: Meta has pulled the plug on its flagship virtual reality fitness app. Citing \"organizational changes,\" Meta says it will no longer release new content or update features for Supernatural.\n\nThe app is not shutting down completely however. Subscribers can still access Supernatural's existing library of Beat Saber-workouts, and Meta says it will maintain the platform and Facebook page, but no new workouts, features, or other content is planned.\n\nBoth users and critics have nearly universally praised Supernatural—CNet scored it 9 out of 10, it won both Fast Company's Best App award in 2020 and a Webby in 2023, and boasted celebrity tie-ins with Jane Fonda and Bon Jovi. Meta doesn't publish subscriber numbers for Supernatural, but there are over 110,000 members of Supernatural's Facebook community. Not enough, apparently, to warrant keeping the app going.\n\nIn 2021, Meta spent an estimated $400 million to purchase Within, Supernatural's developer, even battling the FTC to make the deal, and the app was a heavily promoted part of the company's overall \"Metaverse\" strategy.\n\nThe shuttering of Supernatural is part of a larger shift at Meta. This week, the company laid off 1,500 people—about 10% of the staff—from Reality Labs, Meta's hardware and virtual reality division. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables. This is part of that effort,” a Meta spokesman told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlong with cuts at Supernatural, Meta is closing three studios behind some of the most prominent, high-end VR games: Armature, who brought Resident Evil 4 to VR, Sanzaru, the studio behind Asgard’s Wrath, and Twisted Pixel, creators of Deadpool VR.",

    "fullText": "When I talk to Senada Greca, she's gearing up to hit the gym with Kim Kardashian: household name, noted entrepreneur — and, apparently, an absolute beast at strength training.\n\nKardashian hits the weights for hours a week, said Greca, her personal trainer, on the phone with me just minutes before her session with the celeb.\n\n\"I love working with Kim. She is an incredibly dedicated woman in all aspects of her life, including strength training,\" she told me.\n\nOn this particular day, Kardashian's workout was going to focus on upper body and core, featuring moves like assisted pull-ups and hollow-body holds. The exercises are paired one after another in a time-saving workout technique called a superset that works the whole body to up the intensity and burn fat.\n\n\"We keep it moving. We don't take too many breaks,\" said Greca, who's been working with her since 2023.\n\nThe sessions are about 90 minutes each, including a warm-up and stretching. They train four to six days a week. Kardashian likes to push herself, and would hit the gym every single day, if not for her trainer urging her to \"take a chill pill\" and rest.\n\nBut you don't have to spend that long in the gym to get major benefits from strength training, according to Greca.\n\nThe trainer said her own personal routine is all about consistency, even if that means working out just five or 10 minutes at a time.\n\nAs a result, Greca is in the best shape of her life at 43.\n\n\"It's about showing up for yourself every single day till it becomes a non-negotiable,\" she said.\n\nShe shared why regular strength training should be a part of your routine for a longer, healthier life, and how to get results starting with just minutes a day.\n\nThe past few years have seen a massive spike of interest in strength training, particularly among women.\n\nThat's for good reasons: lifting weights can boost longevity, improve mood and energy, and sculpt an athletic physique all at once.\n\nGreca, who immigrated to the US as a teen and earned an MBA, said strength training changed her life. She initially pursued a career in finance, but struggled with low self-esteem and an eating disorder. About a decade ago, her doctor helped her reframe exercise as a form of self-care and empowerment.\n\n\"That's when everything kind of changed. I was utilizing workouts to not punish myself, but to nourish myself, to work on my health, my longevity, and my mental state, and everything has been a lot more stable since,\" Greca said.\n\nFrom there, she pivoted to building a fitness empire, attracting more than 6 million Instagram followers with her daily workouts and meal ideas. In recent years, she's launched a strength training app, WeRise, and co-founded supplement company Aonic.\n\nHer passion is helping clients feel strong and capable, making fitness more accessible to everyone from CEOs to stay-at-home moms.\n\n\"I think of strength training as a standard that every woman should embrace,\" she said.\n\nIf you want to start building lean muscle on a busy schedule, a bodyweight circuit is a great option, Greca said.\n\nHer go-to plan takes just five minutes with minimal or no equipment, and hits every major muscle group.\n\nTo try it, perform the following exercises for 45 seconds at a time, resting for 15 seconds between movements:\n\nRepeat for five rounds. If you're feeling motivated or want to increase the challenge, add weights.\n\nRemember, it takes time and consistency to see results. Five minutes alone may not transform your body or health, especially overnight, but it adds up over time as it becomes a habit you can build upon.\n\nGreca said it's important to continue challenging yourself gradually, stay moving outside the gym by walking regularly (especially in nature), and listen to your body.\n\n\"I don't push beyond what my body finds necessary,\" she said. \"I always tell people, listen to the expert within.",

    "fullText": "Also: advice to reduce screen time, how to maximize your toaster oven, the best gloves and at-home fitness staples\n\nThis piece was originally published in the Filter US newsletter on buying fewer, better things. \nEach week we cut through the noise to bring you smart, practical recommendations on how to live better – from what is worth buying to the tools, habits and ideas that actually last.\n\nAt this time last year, I was a full-time student, throwing on the requisite leggings and an oversized sweatshirt for evening classes and late-night library sessions. This year, I’ve joined countless others in office life, zipping in and out of conference rooms and hopping on video calls for interviews and meetings. I love any excuse to shop, but many office-friendly pieces, including pricey blazers and crisp button-downs, are far outside my price range.\n\nBut perhaps my work wardrobe doesn’t have to break the bank.\n\nRecently, we wrote about how the New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, pulled off the budget-friendly suits he sported throughout his campaign. And that inspired me to search for affordable ways to build my office wardrobe.\n\nRead the full story here: How Mamdani makes affordable suits look expensive – and you can too\n\nSo I asked wardrobe stylist Samantha Elise how we can get dressed for the office without racking up a hefty credit card bill, sending us back to the 80s or sacrificing personal style.\n\nThe 27 best fashion gifts in the US – curated by our favorite stylists and creators\n\nEight winter clothing essentials Scandinavians swear by – from heated socks to ‘allværsjakke’\n\nI don’t have a full-length mirror in my apartment, so I put Elise’s advice to the test in a dressing room near the Guardian’s New York City office (as you can see in the image above).\n\nWe’ve all been tempted by a cheap pair of pants or a T-shirt that costs less than a cup of coffee – even as we know the devastating environmental costs of fast fashion. Elise says we should spend a bit more on wardrobe basics, such as a black pair of pants or a trenchcoat.\n\n“Pieces that you can pare everything back to are what I would invest in, because that’s what’s creating that reliable foundation in your closet,” Elise said.\n\nShe says the best way to identify high-quality pieces is to touch the items. “Nine times out 10, the feeling alone lets you know the quality. I know I’ve come across good denim when it feels thick and sturdy.”\n\nBrands like Aritzia and Madewell are a few of Elise’s go-tos for well-made basics. (We checked, and they both have straightforward return policies if you’re planning to do the touch test at home.) For those of us lucky enough to be able to wear jeans to work, she recommended Citizens of Humanity and Agolde for higher-quality denim.\n\nWhen I think of office attire, I can’t help but picture drab pencil skirts and plenty of beige. But even on a budget, there are strategies that can elevate your ensemble while remaining professional.\n\n“Find elements that feel true to yourself, like a pattern or a pop of color,” Elise said. She also advised experimenting with different silhouettes, such as white tees that hit below your elbow or a pair of balloon pants.\n\nBuy statement pieces second-hand\n\n“Go on Depop and find something for $20 versus spending $400 on a designer [striped shirt]. All stripes look the same. Let’s not waste money there, because then you have the striped shirt and no pants to wear it with,” Elise said.\n\nShop your closet with fresh eyes\n\nElise advised finding inspiration to breathe new life into what you already own. She uses Pinterest as a starting point to build her outfits.\n\n“There’s a lot of second-guessing when it comes to [putting together outfits]. You have more answers than you think you do. So trust yourself and be creative,” she said.\n\nAnd for a wallet-friendly way to spice up an office outfit, Elise recommended playing with layering, such as tying a sweater over your shoulders or a blazer around your waist.\n\nAre you trying to put an end to your nightly doom scroll? We’ve shared a few unique tips for cutting down on the amount of time you spend staring at a screen, brought to you by experts.\n\nFrom going analog to writing a breakup letter to your phone, we gathered some unconventional tips that go beyond setting time limits or silencing your device.\n\nRead the full story here: ‘Put a rubber band on your phone’: I asked experts how to reduce screen time – here’s what they said\n\nGorpcore is having a moment. And winter gloves are very much a part of it.\n\nFilter US editor Nick Mokey shared the military surplus-style glove combination that he swears by for everything from camping to biking. The best part? They’re far more affordable (and probably warmer) than the fancy designer pair you’ve been eyeing.\n\nRead the full story here: The best winter gloves are two pairs, actually (and one is hiding at Home Depot)\n\nPro chef Kiki Aranita wants you to use your toaster oven for more than making toast.\n\nBreville Joule Oven Air Fryer Pro\n\nFrom cooking up an impressive batch of air-fried crispy noodles for your next dinner party to pretending it’s summer and making s’mores from the comfort of your kitchen, the toaster oven is a true kitchen multitasker.\n\nRead her tips here: From eggs to s’mores: 10 foods you didn’t know your toaster oven could make\n\nIf you’re put off by burpees on your hardwood floor or sun salutations in your garage, we’re here to tell you there’s a better way to get an at-home workout.\n\nTo help find the best products to revamp your 2026 fitness routine (without leaving the comfort of your house), we asked personal trainer Marissa Miller to outline a few of her favorites, including a durable Lululemon yoga mat and a lower-intensity alternative to weight lifting.\n\nRead the full story here: A personal trainer’s starter pack: 10 US workout products to reboot for 2026",

    "title": "The Biggest Fitness Trends at CES 2026 (and What I Think About Them)",
    "description": "Exoskeletons, rings, and smart bands were popular, but a lot of big name companies seem to be running out of ideas.",
    "fullText": "I just got back from CES 2026, and you can see my real-time reports on some of the best and weirdest things I saw in our CES 2026 live blog. I tried on six(!) different exoskeletons, perked up my ears whenever I heard about a new smart strap, and looked in vain for new models of familiar fitness tech like watches. Here are the biggest trends I noticed and some notes on what was conspicuously missing. I've included prices where possible; anything without a price is likely too far from market to have one yet.\n\nThis is a continuation of a trend that really got going in 2025. Whoop is no longer the only player in the screenless fitness strap space. Last year we saw straps from Amazfit ($99) and Polar ($199), plus a sleep band from Garmin ($169). At CES I learned about two more.\n\nThe Luna Band is likely to be the next one to market—the company’s reps said to expect it to ship sometime in the next month or two. (I plan to review it once units are available.) It will be $149, won't require a subscription, and it will use the same app as the Luna Ring, which I’m currently reviewing. Its maker, Noise, is new to the U.S. wearables market but is one of the leading smartwatch makers in India.\n\nBesides the new hardware, Noise also announced that the Luna app will soon have a system to take voice notes to give context to your health data. (This is coming to the app in the next few weeks.) For example, if you tell the app that you had a few glasses of wine, it will remember this when it sees your poor sleep the next morning, and it will adjust its recommendations accordingly—say, reminding you to hydrate, rather than telling you to take a nap.\n\nSpeediance also announced the Speediance Strap, although it doesn’t seem to be as close to market. No price has been announced, and the units at the show were clearly prototypes. The Strap will collect sleep and recovery data, without requiring a subscription to view it, although some more advanced metrics will require a premium subscription.\n\nOura has had competitors for years (and has taken up suing them to stop sales), but it seems like the number of smart rings out there is just exploding—though not all of them are fitness or health oriented. Besides Pebble’s Index 01 ($75), which is charmingly simple, there are plenty of rings that pack in more functions—NFC payments, AI voice processing, haptic alerts, and more. There are so many I can’t give a full list, but to name a few: there’s the Muse Ring One ($323), the Dreame Ring, and the Vocci AI ring.\n\nRingConn announced its third-generation ring, with blood pressure insights (I’m skeptical) and haptic alerts, including the ability to buzz for a smart alarm (I’m intrigued). This one isn’t on the market yet, and a rep at the booth asked me what price I thought it should go for. In the meantime, RingConn gave me a gen 2 ring to compare to Oura and others—watch for my review soon.\n\nThe companies that make smartwatches and fitness watches tend to be on their own release cycles, not necessarily tied to CES. Apple certainly wasn’t going to announce a new Apple Watch; Google and Fitbit didn’t show up, either. Amazfit had a new watch, the Active Max ($169) in its lineup, but it was more of a refinement to the product line than a new exciting announcement.\n\nThe only real exception I can think of is Pebble, but you’ve heard from me already on why it bucks the trend. I got to go hands-on with the Time 2 (announced last year) and the Round 2 (announced last week), which was so thin and sleek it made the Coros on my wrist feel like a big ol’ hunk of plastic. As a reminder, the Round 2 doesn’t have a heart rate monitor and Pebble is trying not to be a fitness watch brand. (I’m still looking forward to reviewing its watches anyway.)\n\nI think the main reason for the stagnation here is that watches already have everything they need to have for fitness and health tracking. There's not a lot of room left to innovate; either you give a device slightly better battery life (nice, but yawn) or you stick something else into it just to say you did—like a flashlight or a microphone. That's nothing against flashlights or microphones, which are both great in context, but we're hardly in game-changing territory anymore. Companies like Oura and Whoop are pivoting to services like blood tests that take the focus off their hardware. My colleague Stephen Johnson said it best: tech launches don't feel magical anymore, partly because we don't have many problems left that consumer tech can easily solve, and partly because every new advice adds a hassle to your life.\n\nAnd so Garmin’s main announcement this weekend was a nutrition tracking feature in its Connect+ subscription. I thought at least there was a good chance of a new watch from Garmin—nope. Garmin announced the Instinct 3 at last year’s CES, but no new hardware this year besides a camera system for truckers (I’m happy for them).\n\nA few other companies used the buzz around CES to announce non-hardware developments as well: Oura is finally shipping the charging case it promised last fall, and Ultrahuman announced a limited-time free tier of its blood testing service with 20+ markers. Its other tiers give you 50+ markers for $99, or a 100+ marker test followed by a 60+ marker follow-up test for $365. (Ultrahuman told me that the exact blood tests it's able to offer vary slightly by state, hence the vague numbers.)\n\nThere were, of course, plenty of mentions that “AI” is baked into this or that fitness app. But the companies mostly seemed to understand that while AI might help to create features their users want, users don’t buy devices for the AI. (See also: Dell executives commenting that its customers don’t seem to want AI, and that it has adjusted the marketing for its computers to de-emphasize it.)\n\nI heard at CES that apps are using AI to identify foods from photos (Garmin and Amazfit) or that AI is helping to find patterns in data (basically everybody). Merach did say it would let me try an AI-powered treadmill, but a rep apologetically told me the device wasn’t available in time to ship the prototype to CES.\n\nExoskeletons were the biggest new-to-me trend at CES. These are devices that you strap on to your body, and their motors give an added boost to what your muscles are doing. Several of the companies described them as being like an e-bike for walking.\n\nI gave myself a side quest of trying every exoskeleton that was available to demo. That ended up being a total of six: four that assisted you at the hip, one at the knee, and one at the ankle. One device made by Ascentiz ($1,299-$1,848) can be configured with combined hip and knee action, but the knee module wasn’t available for me to test.\n\nAll six devices really did give me a boost while walking (or climbing stairs—several of the companies wisely included a mini staircase in their booths to try out). But I have to wonder who the exoskeletons are really for. If you’re not a serious hiker, an exoskeleton might help you hike up a mountain and keep up with your friends. But I’d think that only a serious hiker would have $1,000+ to spend on hiking gear like an exoskeleton—and that they would probably prefer to train harder and spend the money on something else.\n\nIf I had to predict where this tech is going, I think the rental market makes the most sense. Imagine if you could borrow the Ascentiz for a scenic hike on vacation without having to train for months ahead of time, or strap on Dephy’s “powered footwear” ($4,500) to get you through a day at Disneyworld.",

    "fullText": "Our fitness expert clocked up his indoor miles to put the best exercise bikes, including simple spin machines and gym-quality models, to the test\n\nThe best treadmills for your home, tested\n\nCycling has the potential to benefit your health in myriad ways, whether it’s the mood-boosting properties of inhaling fresh air, the social element of riding with friends or the simple act of improving cardiovascular fitness with every pedal stroke.\n\nThe UK weather doesn’t always play ball, though, so for those who don’t want a dire forecast to result in a missed workout, indoor training replicates the exercise (if not the fresh air).\n\nThe best exercise bikes are not only fantastic for burning a few calories without donning all the outdoor gear, but they can also help you nail training goals if you’re a more serious rider. With many letting you connect your phone or laptop to make the most of online training tools, it’s never been easier or more enjoyable to work out from your home.\n\nI tested 12 exercise bikes, including the sort you might find in a commercial gym, along with more dedicated riding simulators and recumbent models for those who find it tricky to sit hunched forward for any length of time. The resulting list features those that I think performed best.\n\nWhile I’ve tried to appeal to a wide range of budgets, it’s difficult to recommend much under the £500 mark because the build quality of these cheaper models is often not worth the investment.\n\nBest exercise bike overall:\n\n Peloton Bike+\n\nBest budget exercise bike for beginners:\n\n Horizon 3.0SC indoor cycle\n\nBest compact exercise bike:\n\n Wattbike Proton\n\nBest gym-quality exercise bike: \n\n Technogym bike\n\nBest recumbent exercise bike:\n\n LifeFitness RS3 LifeCycle\n\nWhile I no longer compete in official cycling events, I still consider myself a keen cyclist, often heading out with friends on a gravel bike, even if those rides now end in a warm pub, rather than a timed finish line. But when the weather isn’t playing ball, I’ll get stuck into a home- or gym-based exercise bike session to keep fit and stay in shape for when cycling season comes back around again.\n\nHaving tested exercise equipment for numerous publications, I’m always one to get stuck in and test a product for as long as possible. With exercise bikes, this meant getting plenty of hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.\n\nExercise bikes are bulky items that typically require an element of setup or construction. To make testing so many of them viable, I either borrowed a pre-assembled machine for one or two weeks or tested the bikes in a dedicated boutique or workout space.\n\nDuring each test, I used any workout modes that were available, syncing a smartphone or laptop to take advantage of third-party software or online classes, if these were offered. The machines were judged on their build quality, features, ease of setup and storage (some companies offer premium white glove deliveries), as well as the overall adjustability or suitability for numerous members of the household.\n\nAfter slipping into a pair of fetching cycling shoes, I assessed noise levels with a smartphone-based decibel meter, and made more subjective assessments on the general ride feel, comfort and the overall quality of the workout experience.\n\nMany rivals have attempted to imitate Peloton, but few have managed to nail its overall experience. Above all, the brand is unmatched when it comes to live and on-demand classes, offering so many options – from a quick 15-minute spin class to hardcore sportive training, and all led by motivating instructors and accompanied by thumping soundtracks.\n\nThe Bike+ is the premium one of the brand’s two exercise bikes and has a 23.8in (huge!) high-definition display, which can be rotated for workouts that involve movements off the machine. There’s also an automatic resistance knob that adjusts to match the levels recommended by instructors during classes.\n\nIt’s expensive, with a £45-a-month “all access” membership fee on top, but for engaging, interactive workouts pitched at a wide range of users, nothing else comes close.\n\nWhy we love it\nAlthough the Bike+ isn’t as aesthetically pleasing as some of its rivals, it’s comfortable, easy to adjust and not too imposing in any room. It also has wheels, so it is relatively easy to tip on its end and move around.\n\nThe touchscreen on the Bike+ is of excellent quality and the sound from its built-in speakers is impressive, but it’s the array of classes that makes Peloton so alluring. Unlike many rivals, which can feel prescribed, mundane and overly technical, Peloton somehow makes a gruelling 45-minute spin session feel enjoyable.\n\nThe weighted flywheel and belt-drive system are quiet enough to not disturb others in the household, although hardcore road cyclists will probably balk at the Bike+ for its lack of cycling realism and the bouncy, frenetic spin-class nature of many of its workouts.\n\nIt doesn’t play nicely with third-party cycling apps – such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad – either, so, if that’s important to you, look at the Wattbike Proton below instead.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t feel as realistic as some rivals, and there’s a monthly fee to access the classes and features\n\nDimensions: 56 x 137 x 152cm (WLH) \nWeight: 65kg \nDrivetrain: belt-drive with magnetic, digital resistance adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5, ANT+, wifi (2.4GHz and 5GHz)\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg \nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, 23.8in rotating HD touchscreen with Peloton classes, Netflix, Disney+ and more\n\nAt the time of writing, the Horizon 3.0SC Indoor Cycle cost £569.99, making it one of the cheapest exercise bikes I tested. But it certainly doesn’t feel cheap or any less capable than many of the other exercise bikes I poured sweat upon.\n\nThe 3.0SC has an ultra-smooth, front-mounted flywheel that uses electronically adjustable magnetic resistance to provide 32 effort levels. All of this is controlled via a funky and futuristic-looking digital dial that responds quickly to inputs – great for jumping out of the saddle during high-intensity efforts.\n\nAlthough this is predominantly designed for use in spin classes, its ergonomically cushioned seat and easy-adjust handlebars make it a comfortable spot to pedal away the hours. Oh, and it’s whisper-quiet too, registering just 32dB during my testing.\n\nIt may not be the sort of thing I’d use to train for an upcoming cycling sportive, but it’s a well-priced tool for hitting daily fitness goals.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe 3.0SC looks great. It even blasts out eight vibrant colours from its flywheel, depending on the RPM and amount of effort you are putting in, adding a bit of Tron-like sci-fi to any room.\n\nAnd aside from its relatively compact proportions and lightweight build, the bike is also well connected, playing nicely with Zwift, Kinomap and other third-party fitness apps. There are more realistic-feeling bikes out there, but if you swap out the pedals for a dedicated clipless system, it’s a fairly convincing road bike. Space between the cranks, for example, is as narrow as possible, making it ride like a genuine road machine.\n\nIf you’re looking for on-demand fitness classes, you can find these via Horizon’s free atZone workout app. Pair your phone or tablet with the bike, mount it to the secure plastic holder at the front of the bars, and you’re good to go. For a free service, there’s an impressive amount of content, and it’ll track your progress over time.\n\nIt’s a shame that … there isn’t an integrated display, meaning you’ll have to bring a tablet or smartphone for any instructor-led workouts.\n\nDimensions: 52 x 107 x 120cm (WLH) \nWeight: 36kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with ECB (eddy current) magnetic, electronic resistance (32 levels)\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5 (FTMS compatible for app integration) \nFolding: no (but features transport wheels)\nNoise level: about 32dB\nMaximum user weight: 100kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder and syncs with training apps\n\nWattbike is probably best known for its original red, white and black Air bike machines, which can be found in gyms and health clubs up and down the country. The company has since ventured into home-workout territory, and the Proton sits somewhere in the middle of its range, offering a lightweight, compact footprint and support for popular third-party training apps, including Zwift and TrainingPeaks.\n\nRacy looks and confusing workout programmes may risk putting off more casual users, but the Proton is designed to appeal to all of the family – comfortably adjusting for those between 4ft 6in and 6ft 6in tall. It’s not as quiet as some of its rivals, but the Proton feels realistic to ride and even has an auto-adjusting ergometer mode (ERG), so it can simulate gradients and gear changes without you having to lift a finger.\n\nWhy we love it\nWattbike has done an admirable job in retaining a realistic bike feel on such a lightweight and compact machine, with a fully adjustable seat post, saddle and handlebars that make it easy to set up to your requirements. I was able to quickly swap the standard toe-cage pedals for some Shimano clipless ones, which improved my performance and gave me greater control over pedal stroke. Most exercise bikes will allow you to swap the pedals, which takes about five minutes if you have the correct spanner or hex key. Adding cleats and pedals allows you to don a dedicated cycling shoe, which provides better power transfer between the legs and pedals compared with basic adjustable toe cages.\n\nWattbike’s background in working with pro athletes is evident from the Wattbike Hub app, which offers real-time feedback on pedal stroke and efficiency, among other nerdy data fields. The app has been tweaked to appeal to the more casual fitness fanatic, but it’s far from friendly to beginners, and you won’t find the same interactivity you would with a Peloton class. It’s more a case of following graphs and on-screen warnings about form than watching live demos from a bubbly personal trainer.\n\nHowever, there are still plenty of workouts aimed at improving overall health rather than targeting highly trained athletes. And, if you like, you can always mount your iPad in the dedicated holder and binge television or complete a virtual workout session of your choice: the Proton’s Bluetooth FTMS technology means it will work with most third-party apps, such as Zwift, TrainerRoad and Rouvy.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the app isn’t slicker and with more to entice and retain a novice.\n\nDimensions: 57 x 102 x 127cm (WLH)\nWeight: 48kg\nDrivetrain: chain drive with electromagnetic resistance\nMaximum power output: 1,800W\nSimulated grade: up to +25% incline\nConnectivity: ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration)\nFolding: no; includes front transport wheels for ease of movement\nNoise level: about 40dB\nMaximum user weight: 135kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holder\n\nTechnogym has been steadily raising the bar when it comes to smart fitness equipment, with a growing line of connected kit that aims to bring the personal trainer experience to your own home.\n\nClearly designed to take on the likes of Peloton, the Technogym Bike is a stylish machine with a 22in high-definition touchscreen that allows access to a raft of Technogym’s live and on-demand content.\n\nIts compact, svelte frame looks and feels as if it’s aimed at more serious cyclists than Peloton’s offering, and the ride experience is smoother and slightly more natural than its rival. There’s plenty of adjustability for different-size riders, while the included double-sided pedals allow for use with trainers or SPD cycling shoes (a clipless shoe system).\n\nThe built-in screen is crisp and easy to navigate, granting access to entertainment apps, including YouTube and Netflix. It rotates to allow for off-bike sessions, too. However, it’s among the most expensive models I tested, and there’s a further membership fee, starting at £8.99 a month. Ouch.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe riding experience is comfortable without straying too far from a realistic simulation, while the powerful flywheel offers punishing levels of resistance. Technogym has live classes, as with Peloton, but it also appeals to the more hardcore athlete with dedicated training programmes geared towards those with ambitions of tackling the Col de Turini.\n\nIf you’re seeking the best in terms of design and build quality – and your bank balance permits the luxury – you’ll be happy with this bike. It’s a handsome, well-built machine that straddles the line between a dedicated cycling trainer and a spin bike well.\n\nIt also works with most third-party training apps and syncs up neatly with Apple Fitness and Apple Watch via a quick-tap NFC panel. For those totally dedicated to Lycra, Technogym offers an even more expensive Ride model, which feels built to compete with Wattbike and Wahoo’s most serious offerings.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it costs so much, and then Technogym charges yet more for a monthly membership.\n\nDimensions: 59 x 121 x 138cm (WLH)\nWeight: 67kg\nDrivetrain: belt drive with magnetic resistance (20 levels)\nSimulated grade: not specified\nConnectivity: supports streaming via external device (eg Chromecast, Fire TV Stick); Apple Watch pairing; Technogym Live integration and third-party apps\nFolding: no\nNoise level: about 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 160kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, rotating display with ability to stream apps (TV shows, movies, games, etc) via smartphone, tablet or laptop\n\nRecumbent bikes are great for those who experience back pain, struggle with past injuries or simply find it daunting or uncomfortable to be perched atop a traditional exercise bike for any length of time. You can achieve the same, low-impact cardio workout while enjoying a more relaxed seating position that takes the pressure off the lower back, leg joints and neck.\n\nLifeFitness is a reputable brand that supplies commercial gym equipment and kit more suited for use at home, with the RS3 sitting between the two. For the money, you get a comfortable, ergonomically fitted seat with backrest, 20 levels of resistance and a step-through design that makes it easy to get on and off. There’s also plenty of adjustment in the seat to get the perfect workout position.\n\nAlthough larger than many more traditional exercise bikes, it can be lifted and moved because of its transport wheels.\n\nWhy we love it\nMore seasoned riders will probably find a recumbent bike a little too laidback, since it’s difficult to transfer maximum power through the cranks from the more relaxed seating position. That said, it’s not really designed for smashing PBs – it’s best placed for longer, low-intensity steady-state cardio sessions.\n\nIt links to Rouvy, Zwift and a bunch of other third-party fitness apps, but the digital offering is otherwise basic, with a handful of built-in and customisable workouts direct from the console. Users can also pair an Apple or Samsung Galaxy Watch for heart-rate tracking and more.\n\nSome recumbent bikes can feel decidedly budget, but that’s not the case here. With excellent build quality and a smooth and quiet ride experience, the RS3 is a comfortable place to work up a sweat without the associated aches and pains.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the Track Connect 2.0 Console is fiddly to use, and there’s no built-in multimedia.\n\nDimensions: 68 x 164 x 131cm (WLH)\nWeight: 69.8kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive magnetic resistance, manual adjustment\nSimulated grade: N/A\nConnectivity: Bluetooth FTMS and NFC for syncing with apps, wireless HR receiver\nFolding: no\nNoise level: under 30dB\nMaximum user weight: 181kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no, 7in LCD display with Track Connect Console allowing external tablet/smartphone streaming and app integration\n\nIf you’re mad for virtual cycling apps such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad, or simply want to replicate that road cycling feel at home, Wahoo’s Kickr Shift is among the best indoor training tools for enthusiasts.\n\nThe saddle, stem height and reach can all easily be adjusted on the fly, and users can even select their desired crank length. Heck, the bike even simulates several electronically assisted gearing group sets from Shimano and Campagnolo, mimicking the way the cogs feel when shifting under load.\n\nIt’s a wonderfully quiet, smooth and powerful machine that works perfectly with dedicated cycling training apps. For those who like to reach for the chamois cream at the weekend, this is the perfect indoor companion.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the Wattbike Proton feels like a slightly more rounded machine for all the family.\n\nDimensions: 78 x 140 x 110cm (WLH); weight: 36kg; drivetrain: belt drive with electromagnetic resistance; maximum power output: 2,200W; simulated grade: +20% incline, -15% decline; connectivity: ANT+, ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth, wifi, Direct Connect; folding: no; noise level: under 30dB; maximum user weight: 113kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen; requires external device for app/display\n\nBest for: a studio spin bike feel at home\n\nAnother Peloton Bike+ rival, NordicTrack’s indoor trainer is an excellent spinning machine for a smooth yet powerful ride, with a solid dose of realistic-feeling resistance that will feel tough even for seasoned cyclists. It also comes with a whopping 24in touchscreen for immersive online sessions.\n\nGranted, the iFit virtual training environment doesn’t quite compete with the Hollywood sheen of a Peloton class, but it gets mightily close, and the physical bike feels accomplished and more modern than Peloton’s slightly frumpy-looking machine.\n\nIts 20% incline to -10% simulated decline means it also doubles up as an excellent and quite realistic road or mountain biking training tool, with interactive videos that allow you to virtually cycle around some of the most beautiful places on Earth.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … iFit just isn’t up to Peloton’s offering, and the multimedia setup isn’t quite as slick.\n\nDimensions: 55 x 143 x 159cm (WLH); weight: 81kg; drivetrain: silent magnetic resistance, 24 digital levels; simulated grade: +20% incline/-10% decline; connectivity: Bluetooth (headphone & HR monitor), wifi (for iFit), USB-C port, app integration via iFit (syncs with Strava, Garmin, Google Fit, Apple Health); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 24in pivoting HD touchscreen with built-in speakers, iFit streaming of workouts, classes, and entertainment apps\n\nBest for: a recumbent bike on a budget\n\nOffering a cheaper alternative to the LifeFitness recumbent above, Schwinn’s more basic model majors in comfort and adjustability but wraps it up in a slightly lighter and cheaper-feeling frame.\n\nThe 5.5in segmented LCD screen takes care of the basics, with several built-in workouts to get you going. And there’s always the option to pair a tablet or smartphone and make use of Zwift and other digital training apps.\n\nIt represents excellent value for money, but don’t expect the same sort of build quality as pricier rivals; the handle-mounted heart-rate monitor was hugely inaccurate during my testing, and there are some cheap plastic covers masking some of the fastening bolts. On that subject, don’t expect a white glove delivery service with something at this price.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s not quite as robust as rivals, and the built-in heart-rate monitor was way out during tests.\n\nDimensions: 69 x 163 x 113cm (WLH); weight: 37kg; drivetrain: belt-driven flywheel with 16 levels of manual magnetic resistance; simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration); wireless heart-rate compatibility (strap not included); folding: no; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 136kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in screen for media; includes a 5.5in LCD console (for metrics and programmes) and a media shelf for tablets\n\nBest for: a gym-quality upright bike\n\nThis model treads the line between a serious studio bike, such as the Peloton Bike+ or NordicTrack X24, and something more relaxed. It has a comfy padded seat, oversized self-balancing pedals and a unique handlebar design that allows for multiple hand positions. Despite the upright positioning, the ride feel is realistic, and there are 30 levels of resistance to contend with.\n\nIt’s expensive, given that the XUR digital console isn’t as good as those from Technogym, Peloton and NordicTrack, but this is a solid, reliable and comfortable bit of kit from one of the biggest names in commercial gym equipment.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s an expensive bike with a less impressive digital offering than cheaper rivals.\n\nDimensions: 63 x 122 x 143cm (WLH); weight: 60kg; drivetrain: Exact Force induction brake (electronically adjustable resistance); simulated grade: N/A; connectivity: wifi (entertainment apps, software updates), Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration, HR monitor, headphones), HDMI port, USB (media and charging); folding: no, includes transport wheels; noise level: about 28dB; maximum user weight: 159kg; built-in entertainment: yes, 22in HD touchscreen with apps including Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, web browser, social media, plus tablet/HDMI mirroring\n\nExercise bikes vary wildly in price, with the cheapest models often taking the form of basic upright or spin bikes that focus purely on pedalling, and the most expensive offering large HD touchscreens, automatic resistance adjustments and fully integrated training platforms.\n\nBudget models typically start at £250-£400, but often lack the build quality and adjustability needed for long-term use. At the other end of the spectrum, premium connected bikes – such as those from Peloton, Technogym and NordicTrack – can set you back £2,000 or more, and often require monthly subscriptions on top for interactive classes.\n\nFor most riders, a budget of between £600 and £1,200 is a good place to start for solid build quality, smooth resistance and decent connectivity features without straying into commercial-gym territory.\n\nEven the most compact exercise bikes take up space, with the smallest options measuring about 55 x 120 x 130cm (WLH). While that’s less floor space than a treadmill or cross trainer, you’ll still need clearance around the bike for safe mounting and dismounting, as well as enough ceiling height to remain comfortable when standing on the pedals.\n\nRecumbent bikes, which offer a chair-like riding position, often require more floor space, while upright and indoor cycles are more compact. It might be tempting to look at folding exercise bikes, but they can often be flimsy and offer weak pedal resistance.\n\nThe most important thing is the resistance system: magnetic resistance is smoother, quieter and requires less maintenance than older friction-based systems found on traditional studio spin bikes. Belt-drive systems are also preferable to chain-driven units for their silent, low-maintenance operation.\n\nAdjustability is another key factor – a bike with multiple saddle and handlebar positions will ensure better ergonomics and comfort over long sessions, and it will also fit more members of the household.\n\nFor those who want to stay entertained, connected bikes with integrated screens and app compatibility (Zwift, Peloton, iFit, etc) can make training more engaging. Heart-rate monitoring and Bluetooth/ANT+ connectivity are also useful for tracking progress.\n\nFinally, noise levels are worth considering, especially if you live in a flat or plan to exercise when everyone else is sleeping. Modern magnetic systems are whisper-quiet, making them perfect for shared living spaces.\n\nLeon Poultney has been a consumer technology and automotive journalist for longer than he cares to divulge.

    "title": "The Best Apps for Tracking Any New Year's Resolution",
    "description": "Use one of these whether you want to spend more time in the gym or quality time with your family.",
    "fullText": "What kind of New Year’s resolution you make depends on your unique goals—which means you need a way to track your progress that is just as unique. If your resolution is to cut back on social media use and your friend’s is to run a faster mile, you won’t measure success the same way. Even if you swear 2026 is the year you spend less time on your phone (which I've sworn every year), tap into the power of handheld tech and use these apps to keep yourself on track.\n\nI like all the best general progress tracking apps, but when it comes to resolutions, you are looking at something time-bound and specific by its very nature, so you should try apps that are tailored more to what you're doing.\n\nPer Statista, the top New Year’s resolutions among people who have made one or several for 2026 are as follows:\n\nTo spend more time with family/friends (42%)\n\nTo improve job performance (24%)\n\nTo do more for the environment (24%)\n\nThis year's list was interesting to me when I compared it to last year's, where \"save more money\" led the way with a measly 21%. It was followed by eat healthier, exercise more, lose weight, spend time with family/friends, quit smoking, and spend less on living expenses. Obviously, health and fitness continue to rank high, but it's notable that this year's least-popular resolution—reduce job stress—outranked even last year's most popular. It seems, at least according to this source, that 2026 is the year for making resolutions. I'm fresh off a year of actually nailing all my resolutions for the first time ever and I'm looking forward to replicating my success. In addition to a few personal tricks, here are the apps I think you should use.\n\nIf you want to work out more, it will help you to see your progress with each trip to the gym (or at-home session, or whatever). For that, try Strong, an app that lets you input the exercises you do and creates graphs showing your gradual improvement in weight, sets, body fat percentage, and more. In the past, I've only recommended this one, and it's great on its own, as it includes instructions on how to do a variety of exercises, which is nice if you aren’t really a fitness person (yet) and feeling nervous about trying new moves in front of other people keeps you away from the gym. The free version will save unlimited workouts, but you can only add three custom routines. For everything else, it’s $4.99 per month or $29.99 per year. For my full review, read more here.\n\nThis year, I have come around to recommending something else: The Peloton app, which I review here (but talk about here and here and here...). I can confidently say that for me, 2025 was the year of Peloton because I got so into working out on my Bike, using the brand's other class offerings, and even tracking my non-Peloton workouts through the app that I'm now on a 290-day in-app streak. And that's important, especially when we're talking about resolutions, because not only does this show you that all-important daily (or weekly or monthly) streak, but it offers so much variety, which will keep you going back.\n\nBefore, I used to recommend MyFitnessPal, which I used pretty consistently from sophomore year of college well into my 30s, but this year, I found (and reviewed) Lifesum, which changed the game for me. With its brighter colors, simpler interface, and updating \"life scores,\" it's an all-around more positive experience than using MFP—plus you don't have to pay for an upgrade to access nutrient tracking. It just does all that with the regular subscription, which costs $99.99 per year, $29.99 every three months, or $7.49 per month. It has a helpful series of widgets you can put anywhere on your phone, so you're always reminded to stick with it, and it's never shame-y, which I think is crucial for actually sticking with a healthier eating plan. It even suggests meals and foods you should consider based on how often you do (well, don't) eat them and what nutrients you might be lacking.\n\nMy favorite part is that it's so easy to use that I don't skip it, even on my laziest day. Instead of manually inputting every ingredient into the tracker, I can describe or even photograph my meal and let its AI do the work of figuring out approximately how many calories and grams of protein are in it. It's not perfect, of course, but I appreciate that, too; when I've gotten too gung-ho about tracking every morsel and getting every gram accounted for, I've counterbalanced a little too hard and lost all motivation, which kept me swinging back and forth between obsession and complete disinterest. Lifesum turns tracking into a less stressful, more positive experience you can actually stick with.\n\nIf you want to spend more time with your loved ones, try Cozi, a simple organizer that gives you a clear visual representation of your whole family’s schedule. Not only can you see when everyone is free, but you can see how much time you devote (or don’t devote) to the people with whom you share the app—which can motivate you to schedule more time together. It’s also free, which is a plus. Use the money you saved to pay for a nice night out with the people you set a resolution to spend more time with.\n\nI've mentioned this app as a meal planner in the past and think it works great for that, too. Use it to loop together a series of your resolutions, from eating better to spending more time with loved ones. While you're at it, brush up on how important stacking your resolutions and habits is for their longevity.\n\nNormally, I'd suggest FocusPomo as the best productivity-boosting app, but I love Flora, too—and this one has the dual function of helping the environment while improving your work, which means it addresses two of the most popular resolutions for 2026.\n\nAs I explained in my review earlier this year, Flora is a focus timer that locks down your phone while you work and, if you don't mess with your device and instead settle into deep work, you grow a virtual tree to display in your virtual forest. Right there, you can see the value prop if you're trying to track your progress: You can see all the trees you \"grow,\" which helps you visualize how you're doing. There's also an option to bet actual money on your ability to complete focus sessions, which works well for some people. (I am personally a big believer in forcing penalties on myself for failing to carry out a resolution, and though I don't usually bet money, I see the appeal of having financial stakes involved.)\n\nWondering what the app uses that money for? Great question! It's to fund the planting of real trees around the world. Your bet money or subscription fee (should you choose to pay between $2 and $12 per month, though it works fine in its free version) go toward paying for making the environment better, which is a win-win.\n\nHere's another one where I used to recommend a different app (in this case, One Sec) but now firmly recommend another that I've gotten more familiar with. To spend less time on social media (or any distracting apps, really) try Steppin, which I've reviewed and used for about a year now. Like other app-blocking apps, it locks down whichever applications you blacklist. Unlike those, you can earn time to access your blocklist by walking around in the real world. You can customize your settings so a certain number of steps unlocks a certain amount of minutes. I have mine set to 25 steps to earn a minute right now, which usually leaves me with 19 or so banked hours by the time my time resets at the end of the week. Since using Steppin, I've found that not only am I more willing to walk when I might otherwise Uber or take a bus, but I'm less interested in my blocked apps altogether. I just got used to not having unfettered access to them and found I don't need them as much as I thought I did. Who knew?\n\nSteppin also uses \"streaks\" so you can see your progress over time, plus shows a graph every day of your walking time vs. your time on the blocked apps. Both of these visual elements are useful in keeping track of where you're at. You break your streak by resetting your customizations or overriding a Steppin block when you don't have any minutes banked.",

    "description": "Apple Fitness+ teased a major 2026 update with trainers hinting at new features and programs in an Instagram video announcement.",
    "fullText": "Apple is soft-launching big plans for its fitness platform in 2026.\n\nOn Wednesday, the tech giant teased an update to its Apple Fitness+ service on Instagram coming in the new year. The changes could arrive as soon as January, according to the video.\n\n\"Word on the street is that Apple Fitness+ has big plans for 2026... stay tuned!\" the caption reads.\n\nA post shared by Apple Fitness+ (@applefitnessplus)\n\nThe ad featured Apple Fitness+ trainers Bakari Williams, Molly Fox, and Dice Iida-Klein holding newspapers with headlines that suggested major changes. Although Apple didn't share details of what's to come in 2026, some commenters shared what they want to see and speculated on what could be coming.\n\nSome Instagram users commented asking Apple to make small updates, such as reducing the music in workout videos or adding the ability to skip back and forth between workouts. Others asked for more programs to choose from.\n\nApple Fitness+ is a subscription-based digital fitness platform that includes instructor-led classes, on-demand workout videos, and health and fitness metrics. It competes with similar offerings from companies like Peloton. Apple Fitness+ launched in 2020, and Apple expanded it into 28 new markets in December. It costs $9.99 a month or $79.99 annually in the US.\n\nAlthough Apple doesn't report how many users pay for Apple Fitness+, its Services division, which includes those subscribers, hit an all-time high in revenue during its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nApple has also teased other major product reveals coming in 2026, including an upgrade to its virtual assistant Siri.\n\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "New year fitness goals? An elliptical will put you through your paces without the joint strain – our reviewer worked up a sweat testing the best\n\nA quick admission: I absolutely love an elliptical or cross trainer. They don’t always get the plaudits they deserve, but these low-impact cardio machines not only put less strain on your joints than a treadmill but also help you get an impressive, full-body workout. Whether you hop on one to warm up before an intense strength-training session or use it to gently burn calories while listening to your favourite podcast, the elliptical or cross trainer can strengthen muscle, reduce fat and improve cardiovascular fitness.\n\nHowever, there is a catch in that these machines vary wildly in their design – and therefore the emphasis they place on different muscles. Traditional elliptical machines eschew moving handles, instead opting for static poles, while cross trainers usually have dynamic handles that recruit the muscles in your back, shoulders and arms. On top of this, stride length, the shape of the handles and the positioning of the footplates can make a big difference to the type of workout you’ll have.\n\nThey can vary considerably in their weight and size, but are usually bulkier and more cumbersome than, say, a compact treadmill. Home gym aficionados beware: you’ll likely need a fair amount of room for one of these. If you have enough space, though, an elliptical or cross trainer can be a valuable addition to your home training setup.\n\nBest cross trainer overall:\nBowFlex Max Trainer M6\n\nBest value elliptical trainer:\nHorizon EX-59\n\nBest premium elliptical trainer:\nTechnogym elliptical\n\nBest compact cross trainer:\nJTX Strider-X8\n\nBest full-body trainer:\nSchwinn 590 Elliptical\n\nI’m a keen fitness fan who does gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes, as well as outdoor trail runs, cold-water surfing, and more. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for magazines, newspapers and websites. I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.\n\nI’m also a strong believer that you have to use new tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the correct environment. With exercise ellipticals and cross trainers, that meant getting hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.\n\nAs with any modern piece of fitness equipment, the only way to ascertain whether it’s any good is to don your gym kit and get stuck in. So, after researching the newest and most popular models on the market, I set about trialling all eight of them.\n\nMost of my testing was carried out in purpose-built boutiques or customer experience centres because accommodating so many examples of such gym equipment in my home is not easy. I did manage to squeeze a couple into my garage via short-term loans, though.\n\nDuring workouts, I used a smartphone-based decibel reader to get a sense of how loud they were in use, and I also tested any connected or online features, which often meant downloading relevant apps and trialling their workout content.\n\nWhere trainers had displays, I used these to log in to apps, such as Spotify and YouTube, and I also used any built-in Bluetooth speakers (if this function was offered). For each model, I made notes on ease of use, build quality and any features, as well as the overall size of the machine. If it had transport wheels, I used these to move the trainer around, simulating how easy it would be to manoeuvre in a domestic environment.\n\nBeing a petrolhead, I have to confess I was initially drawn to the BowFlex Max Trainer M6 because its LCD console reminds me of the dials found in a Mk3 Golf GTI. However, that’s not all that’s special about this cross trainer.\n\nBlending the motion of a stair-stepper with that of an elliptical machine, it has relatively compact dimensions and provides 16 resistance levels, enabling it to offer punishing, connected workouts.\n\nThose looking for powerful upper-body workouts or large, adjustable stride lengths may want to look elsewhere, but if you’re searching for a cross trainer that’ll have your glutes and quads burning in rapid time, look no further.\n\nWhy we love it\nMost elliptical machines offer a gentle, calorie-burning workout, but the Max Trainer M6 is among the few that have left me fully gassed, with slightly weak legs at the end of a workout.\n\nThis is because of its combination of elliptical and stepping motion, favouring shorter strides and an emphasis on downward pressure instead of the large strides of traditional machines. The handles are also intriguing as they offer a plethora of grip options, opening up the possibility of training multiple sections of the upper body (back, biceps, triceps and so on). But they’re fairly short, not offering a great range of motion to really work the upper body.\n\nThe machine instantly connects with the BowFlex Jrny app, which is the company’s answer to Peloton, offering video-based workouts to make the experience more interactive. You’ll need an internet-connected smartphone or tablet, but the sessions are good, if limited, providing guided workouts that span all manner of fitness goals.\n\nSmall(ish), quiet and relatively easy to move around, this is one of the few ellipticals that can be put away in the corner of a garage or living room without too much impact on living space.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t offer an adjustable stride length, and it will feel too much like a stepper for true elliptical fans.\n\nDimensions: 66 x 117 x 163cm (WLH)\n\n Weight: 61.7kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive with magnetic resistance (16 levels)\nStride length: 38cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth (for Jrny app access and HR tracking); USB charging port; media shelf for device placement\nFolding? No\nNoise level: about 45dB\nMaximum user weight: 136kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no; burn rate dial and basic LCD, supports third-party workouts including Jrny via smartphone, tablet or laptop\n\nAlthough it’s not the cheapest elliptical trainer on this list, the Horizon EX-59 is still my top value pick thanks to its array of features, robust build quality and a relatively low price.\n\nWhy we love it \nA smooth, front-mounted flywheel provides 10 levels of quiet resistance, and oversize pedals accommodate a variety of different-sized users. With a stride length of 46cm, it’s not dissimilar to the larger elliptical machines you might find at a gym – meaning it feels more natural and less intense than a stepper or cross trainer.\n\nThe EX-59 connects to third-party apps via Bluetooth, but it won’t automatically adjust the resistance like some rivals do. As with most Horizon fitness equipment, this model works with the brand’s @Zone app, which provides several high-quality on-demand workouts and training plans for free. There’s not a huge amount of content geared towards elliptical training, but most treadmill and exercise bike high-intensity interval training sessions work just as well.\n\nTo me, it’s not the prettiest fitness machine, though it certainly does the job, offering drinks holders, a place to stash your smartphone or tablet, and a built-in heart-rate monitor on the static handles.\n\nThe build quality is great, especially considering the price, although that doesn’t extend to the LCD display and console, which are basic. During testing, I found the changes to resistance inputs slow to react: not great if you’re indulging in a Hiit session and you need to spike the heart rate quickly. Similarly, the built-in Bluetooth speakers aren’t really worth the hassle of tethering a device – you’d get better sound quality out of a tin can. Instead, bring a pair of headphones, fire up the @Zone workout app and make the most of those free on-demand classes.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the Bluetooth speakers are tinny, and ECB magnetic brake resistance is slow to react to inputs.\n\nDimensions: 61 x 186 x 167cm (WLH)\nWeight: 74.5kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (10 levels)\nStride length: 46cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth speakers, device rack, USB rapid-charge port; compatible with popular fitness apps via Bluetooth FTMS\nFolding? No\nNoise level: about 42dB\nMaximum user weight: 136kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no touchscreen; has Bluetooth-enabled speakers and a tablet holder for external content\n\nIf money’s no object, it’s worth a visit to Technogym’s London Mayfair store, which is packed with drool-inducing fitness equipment that will make any home workout space feel like a five-star hotel.\n\nThis elliptical trainer is part of the brand’s focus on the home and, as such, it folds upright to minimise its footprint in your living room, home gym or – in my case at least – cobweb-strewn garage.\n\nAs a result, it shuns the traditional front- or rear-mounted flywheel for a suspended set of footplates and a resistance system that’s in its upright body. This helps save space but still offers a comparable, almost anti-gravity upper- and lower-body workout to other premium elliptical machines.\n\nWith 25 difficulty levels and up to 600W of electrically adjustable resistance (up to 160 strides a minute: good luck with that), the elliptical packs a mean punch – and it works perfectly with the brand’s digital workout portfolio. Having said that, although there’s a basic screen to show all the usual important data, you’ll need to bring your own device if you want any sort of guided workout.\n\nWhy we love it\nTechnogym’s “sessions” are up there with some of Peloton’s interactive classes, although you’ll need to provide your own tablet, smartphone or laptop. Unlike other fitness apps, there are plenty of elliptical-based classes to enjoy, which makes the experience feel much more enjoyable.\n\nIndeed, where some elliptical trainers can send me to sleep, the instructor in Technogym’s interactive classes will have you hanging off the unit, torching your glutes and pummelling your quads. It will keep you coming back for more.\n\nThe movement itself takes a bit of getting used to: the stride isn’t quite as obvious as the larger units found in commercial gyms. I had to adapt my approach to get the most out of it, and I found it lacked the multiple grip positions and range of motion for effective upper-body focus training.\n\nRegardless, this trainer has Technogym quality baked into its core. It offers a huge spread of resistance levels, is virtually silent, and is all wrapped up in one of the most compact, storable and classy units on test.\n\nIt’s a shame that … you have to bring a device to enjoy a workout, and Technogym’s monthly subscription fees are, predictably, expensive.\n\nDimensions: 65 x 162 x 160cm (WLH)\nWeight: 100kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive electronically adjustable magnetic resistance\nStride length: not specified\nConnectivity: tablet-compatible console for use with Technogym’s apps\nFolding? Yes (folds to 75cm length for compact storage)\nNoise level: about 36dB\nMaximum user weight: 130kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; designed for tablet use via console\n\nThe JTX Strider-X8 was one of the most compact true ellipticals I got my hands on: it’s just 130cm long. The BowFlex Max Trainer M6 will fit better into tight spaces, but it doesn’t offer the same kind of traditional elliptical stride.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe Strider-X8 provides 41cm of glorious gliding, corralled by a 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel at the rear. It’s quiet, although perhaps not as whisper-quiet as some rivals, and offers 16 levels of easily adjustable resistance.\n\nHowever, there are a few compromises. The compact proportions restrict the maximum user height to 5ft 9in, which means even a vertically challenged individual like myself is butting up against the limits. The build quality isn’t a strong point: the console, complete with basic display, looks and feels a bit like an oversized school calculator. However, this trainer is very much at the budget end of the budget spectrum. JTX offers a two-year at-home warranty, which should give some peace of mind for those worried it may not go the distance.\n\nWeighing 51kg, the Strider-X8 isn’t something you will want to pick up and heft around, but it’s easy to tip it on to its transport wheels and stash it somewhere convenient. Without going for a foldable, there are few cross trainers that can compete with it in terms of space-saving – and I managed to cram it into the corner of my busy garage with little stress.\n\nThe workout experience is largely fine, although the smaller footplates will be a problem for users with larger feet. It connects seamlessly with third-party apps and can even be used with virtual training software, such as Zwift.\n\nThe digital console is basic, but it all works, with a simple dial adjusting the levels of resistance. There are even 18 built-in programs for those who simply want to hop on and work out.\n\nIt’s a shame that … parts of the machine feel cheap, and the built-in heart-rate monitoring is useless.\n\nDimensions: 70 x 130 x 169cm (WLH)\nWeight: 51kg\nDrivetrain: 7kg inertia-enhanced flywheel and electromagnetic resistance\nStride length: 41cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth to fitness apps (such as Kinomap, iConsole+), built-in Polar heart-rate receiver (chest strap), hand pulse sensors\nFolding? No; includes transport wheels\nNoise level: about 38dB \n\n Maximum user weight: 120kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no; LCD console with 18 workouts\n\nSchwinn packs a lot into its relatively compact 590 Elliptical, including the ability to electronically adjust the platforms to simulate gradients of -5% to 15%. Along with the multitude of upper-body handles, this sees it bundled into the cross-trainer category (despite its name). I found it offered one of the best full-body workouts on test.\n\nThere are built-in speakers that are of mediocre quality (they’re better than those found on the Horizon EX-59 but still not brilliant) and a 7in digital display that allows for rapid leaps in resistance.\n\nWhy we love it\n\n There are handle-mounted controls for both the incline/decline and resistance settings, which is a welcome premium touch, and the unit is compatible with a multitude of virtual training software, including Zwift and Schwinn’s recommended Jrny app.\n\nThe 25 levels of resistance, the ability to adjust the incline and decline, and the multiple grip locations ensure the Schwinn provides one of the best and all-encompassing full-body workouts on test. With a pronated grip on the horizontal handles, I found it possible to work the big muscles of the back and the lats, while a supinated grip on the inner-most handles would place more emphasis on the shoulders and rear deltoid muscles.\n\nIt’s a similar case for the lower body, as adjusting the decline and incline places a focus on muscles in the legs that I rarely use. Start playing around with body positioning, and it offers all of the benefits of a static hold with dynamic movement.\n\nOf course, you can adjust the intensity as you want, but I found the unit to be one of the best for working up a sweat. It all comes in one of the most compact and easy-to-store packages on this list, too.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the built-in speakers aren’t really worth the effort, and it’s an expensive machine.\n\nDimensions: 86 x 148 x 173cm (WLH)\nWeight: 96kg\nDrivetrain: front-drive with magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (25 levels)\nStride length: 51cm\nConnectivity: Bluetooth (heart-rate enabled and built-in speakers), USB charging port, tablet/media holder, Jrny and app compatibility\nFolding? No; includes transport wheels\nNoise level: about 32dB\nMaximum user weight: 147kg\nBuilt-in entertainment: no; a 7in full-colour LCD with workout programs and connectivity\n\nWith a generous 50.8cm stride length and oversized footplates, the Sole E35 is designed for taller and larger users, offering multiple handles and grip positions for a full-body workout.\n\nTo me, it’s also one of the better-looking elliptical machines on this list, with modern styling and a sleek 10.1in touchscreen to use for a number of built-in workout sessions and longer-term fitness plans, as well as popular streaming apps, such as YouTube, Disney+ and more.\n\nThere’s a built-in fan for keeping users cool, although it’s not hugely effective, as well as a set of speakers for streaming music. These are perfectly adequate, but don’t expect room-filling sounds.\n\nThe 9kg flywheel provides plenty of resistance though, and with the FTMS protocol, it syncs up with Zwift and the brand’s own Sole+ app, offering a huge array of virtual workouts.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s a large and heavy machine that requires plenty of storage space.\n\nDimensions: 60 x 177 x 177cm (WLH); weight: 110.8kg; drivetrain: front-drive with computer-controlled magnetic ECB resistance (20 levels); stride length: 50.8cm; connectivity: Bluetooth audio speakers, USB charging port, wifi, Sole+ and Kinomap app compatibility, tablet holder, wireless charging pad; folding? No; includes front transport wheels; noise level: about 35db; maximum user weight: 158kg; built-in entertainment: 10.1in touchscreen with built-in apps (YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and so on), wifi and screen mirroring\n\nIt’s a little tricky to get your head around how the Matrix E30 works. On paper, it’s one of the more compact elliptical trainers I tested, yet it still manages to offer a 51cm stride length. This is all down to the clever, and quite complex, suspension system that houses the oversized footplates and traditional elliptical handles.\n\nMatrix kit is often found in commercial gyms and that’s pretty obvious here, as the build quality is excellent. It also sports a 10.5kg flywheel, which is one of the heaviest on test. It allows for 20 levels of resistance and is capable of a pretty hardcore workout.\n\nAn updated XER console has a crisp 10in touchscreen that takes care of most of the functionality, as well as allowing access to a handful of streaming apps and virtual training programs.\n\nIf you don’t want to pay for yet another monthly membership (Matrix suggests iFIT), it can also play nicely with whatever third-party apps you like to use and features 11 built-in workout programs.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s expensive, and the screen isn’t overly impressive.\n\nDimensions: 73x 166 x 148cm (WLH); weight: 126kg; drivetrain: suspension elliptical front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels); stride length: 51cm; connectivity: wifi, Bluetooth, USB port and entertainment apps (YouTube, Netflix and so on); folding? No; noise level: about 38dB; maximum user weight: 147kg; built-in entertainment: 10in touchscreen with apps, media streaming, web browser (XER console)\n\nBest for: build quality on a budget\n\nLife Fitness is another brand often selected by commercial gyms for its reliability, and this also filters down into its domestic range.\n\nConsidering how basic the E1 feels compared with some rivals, the price seems high, but this is a fuss-free elliptical with a massive fixed stride length, oversized footplates and an impressive spread of smooth and natural-feeling resistance. It’s also quiet.\n\nThe basic digital Go Console lacks the flashiness of a massive interactive touchscreen, but it has 13 workout programs that are easily accessed via large and obvious buttons, great for those not fussed about binging Netflix during a workout. During testing, I found the lack of a touchscreen quite refreshing: it was easy to hop on and work out without the faff of connecting Bluetooth-enabled devices.\n\nHeart-rate monitoring is fairly reliable via its handles and sports the FTMS protocol for third-party app integration, but it also works perfectly well without it, and its built-in programs span hill training and fat-burning sessions.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it feels expensive for what it is and looks dated.\n\nDimensions: 77 x 209 x 150cm (WLH); weight: 96kg; drivetrain: front-drive with ECB magnetic resistance, electronically adjustable (20 levels); stride length: 51cm; connectivity: Go Console with LCD, Bluetooth telemetry heart-rate monitoring, 13 pre-loaded workouts; folding? No; noise level: about 32dB; maximum user weight: 182kg; built-in entertainment: no built-in media apps; simple display for workout metrics and an integrated accessory tray for external device placement\n\nThe two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences. A standard elliptical machine focuses on the forward and backward pedalling motion with fixed handles, providing a low-impact cardio workout that mimics running without the joint stress. A cross trainer typically includes moving handlebars that allow you to work your upper body as well, giving a more complete, full-body workout. In most modern home fitness equipment, “elliptical” and “cross trainer” usually describe the same type of machine.\n\nEntry-level elliptical trainers start at about £400 and offer basic stride motion and limited resistance levels. Spending more than £1,000 typically gets you a sturdier build, smoother motion, more resistance levels and better consoles with Bluetooth or app integration. At the top end (£2,000+), you’ll find commercial-grade machines with advanced consoles, streaming services, more compact footprints, greater levels of resistance and suspension technology that greatly reduces noise and wear.\n\nEllipticals tend to be large machines, with footprints ranging from about 150cm in length and 70cm in width, all the way up to 200cm in length and 80cm in width, or more. You’ll also need to consider ceiling height – especially with front-drive machines, as pedals can lift you an additional 30-40cm off the ground.\n\nStride length is a key factor: shorter strides (about 40-45cm) are suitable for smaller users, while taller users will benefit from 50cm or more. Look for adjustable resistance levels and incline options if you want to vary the intensity and muscle groups worked. Consoles with Bluetooth and app support can help track progress and keep workouts engaging, and some higher-end models include large touchscreens with streaming apps, fans, speakers and wireless charging pads. If space is a concern, compact or folding designs are worth exploring.\n\nEllipticals are generally low-maintenance compared with treadmills. Most use magnetic resistance systems that don’t require ongoing adjustment as a treadmill’s belt does. Look out for manufacturer warranties that cover any wear and tear. Suspension ellipticals – which remove the traditional track and wheel system – tend to be even quieter and need virtually no lubrication.\n\nFor more ways to get fit at home:\n The best treadmills, tested by our expert runner\n\n Personal trainers on the best home exercise kit\n\nLeon Poultney is a lifelong fitness enthusiast who can often be found trying not to kill himself on a mountain bike/surfboard/other extreme thing, often at the request of an editor.

    "title": "Why You Should Give Yourself ‘Crappy’ Rewards for Your Fitness Goals",
    "description": "Paradoxically, weak rewards build strong motivation.",
    "fullText": "Rewarding yourself can backfire. If you tell yourself, “I’ll only listen to my favorite podcast while I’m at the gym,” it takes just one moment of weakness to realize you can cheat and listen to it any time you want. Instead, try this: Reward yourself with something that has no enjoyment value whatsoever. Like a checkmark on your calendar.\n\nI first heard this tip from writer Tim Clare’s podcast. If you want to stay motivated, he says, the reward has to be so crappy that you’re not actually working for the reward. He said that he puts a checkmark on his calendar every day he writes, and at the end of the week enough checkmarks earn a gold star. The same approach has worked for me and for others. I have to admit: Buying myself a pack of stickers is embarrassingly motivating.\n\nTim Clare likes the theory that this works because of cognitive dissonance: We have to change something major (our behavior) to earn something that's not valuable (a sticker), so we try to resolve that dissonance by deciding we value the behavior change. The crappy extrinsic reward strengthens our sense that the new habit is intrinsically valuable.\n\nAnd as my colleague Meredith Dietz has written, experts believe that the secret to lasting motivation lies in our intrinsic goals. Engaging in healthy behaviors like exercise only works if we're doing those behaviors for their own sake, not because we're enduring our gym time as a means to an end. Extrinsic rewards like streaks and badges can gamify this process so addictively that we lose sight of why we're actually doing it in the first place. Note that I'm not saying you should chase streaks; I'm thinking more like literal stickers on a piece of paper, or a note in your phone where you write down how many miles you ran this week.\n\nAnother type of ineffective reward is the real-life splurge: promising you'll treat yourself to something (a dessert, a clothing purchase) once you hit a certain goal. Here's the problem: If you hate exercising so much that you need a bribe to do it at all, you're quickly going to find a way to have the reward without the work. There's nothing actually stopping you from listening to that \"gym only\" podcast at home, or ordering yourself the new outfit you had earmarked as a reward for when you make it through the couch to 5K program.\n\nUsing a crappy reward works because it just reflects your existing motivation back on itself. You check off today's work, not because the checkmark is valuable in itself, but because the checkmark reminds you that you kept a promise to yourself. There's a thrill to closing that loop, and those little wins really build your self-efficacy. In self-efficacy theory, small wins boost your motivation to keep working toward bigger goals.\n\nThe best part of using stickers or checkmarks is that it’s pointless to cheat. What are you going to do—lie to yourself when you didn’t actually go to the gym? But building up that row of numbers or stickers becomes its own reward. You’re really just rewarding yourself with the satisfaction of having stuck to your habit.",

    "title": "What Is Zone 2 Cardio, and How Do I Actually Do It?",
    "description": "If you have the time for it, \"LISS cardio\" is a cheat code for fitness gains.",
    "fullText": "A healthy dose of cardio is an important part of your exercise routine, and for a lot of us, \"zone 2\" cardio is going to make up a big chunk of that. Low-intensity cardio—sometimes called LISS or “zone 2”—used to be an underrated form of exercise. It's super trendy now, after spending years on the sidelines while HIIT and lifting-only routines ran the field. But what is zone 2 cardio, exactly? How can you make sure you're doing it right? And is it really so bad if your heart rate drifts into zone 3?\n\nZone 2 training is cardio done at a steady, low intensity. It has benefits for aerobic training (so you can run faster), anaerobic training (helping you to recover faster between reps and sets, or between intervals), and it's also an efficient, low-fatigue way to burn calories.\n\n“Zone 2” is a term drawn from the five-zone system of heart rate training, and the same concept is also known by other names and metrics. To runners, it is “easy pace” or “long slow distance pace.” To cyclists, it corresponds to zones 2 and 3 of a seven-zone system of mechanical power. In other sports, like swimming and rowing, it’s often just called “easy” or “low-intensity” exercise.\n\nAll that said, there is no official definition of zone 2, and different devices won't necessarily agree with each other. The same heart rate might be \"zone 2\" on one device and \"zone 3\" on another. So please take the following with a grain of salt.\n\nThe hallmark of zone 2 training is that it’s relatively slow and that it’s done at a steady pace. You'll be aiming for a heart rate of around 70%, but that doesn’t mean doing intervals at 90% and then resting at 50%. It means holding that 70% level the whole time you’re exercising. You can do zone 2 cardio with any steady, repetitive movement. Popular methods are running, cycling, swimming, rowing, brisk walking, fast hiking, or churning away on the elliptical. (Walking can count if you're new to exercise; as you get fitter, you'll probably need to choose a slightly harder form of exercise.)\n\nTo be clear, it’s still work—it’s not the same as sitting around resting—but it should feel like you could keep going forever if you wanted to. You don’t stop a zone 2 session when you get tired, you stop it because you set out for a 30- or 45- or 60-minute session, and your time is up.\n\nZone 2 work builds your aerobic base. When you do cardio at this kind of easy pace, your body adapts to get more efficient at it. These adaptations are great for your health as well as your cardio fitness. You grow more capillaries (tiny blood vessels) to get oxygen and nutrients to your muscles more efficiently. You get more mitochondria in each muscle cell (you have thousands of mitochondria powering each cell) and you produce more of the enzymes that turn fuel from food into usable energy. Your heart and your lungs get more efficient at taking in oxygen and moving blood to your muscles, and your muscles become able to store more carbohydrates (in a form called glycogen) so that more of the carbs you eat are at the ready when you start a run or ride.\n\nFor runners, your zone 2 work, often called \"easy pace,\" should make up most (some say 80%) of your weekly mileage. The fitness you build doing easy running is what allows you to benefit from, and recover from, harder efforts like interval training.\n\nFor people whose main sport is more strength oriented (meatheads like myself), zone 2 cardio strengthens the same body systems that help us recover between sets, and even between reps. It increases our work capacity, letting us get more work done in total. As long as you’re eating enough, adding cardio into your routine should make you able to do more work in the gym, not less. (And no, cardio does not kill your gains.)\n\nAnd for people who are just exercising for health, zone 2 cardio is the perfect “moderate” exercise we’re all supposed to get at least 150 minutes of per week. It’s heart-healthy, and even people with medical conditions that limit their ability to exercise can often do low intensity cardio safely. (Ask your doctor to be sure, of course.)\n\nImportantly, zone 2 training is very low fatigue. More time-efficient forms of cardio and conditioning like HIIT, hill sprints, or CrossFit WODs are great for your aerobic fitness, but those workouts have to be high intensity to work, and you’ll be pooped afterward. They’re great in small doses, but they kind of have to be in small doses.\n\nTechnically, zone 2 is defined in terms of heart rate, and the idea is that you glance at your watch and see whether you're in zone 2 or not. (There are five zones, with zone 5 being the hardest, so zone 2 is the second-easiest). But even though “zone 2” is defined in terms of heart rate, there are so many caveats to determining your max and deciding on the zone boundaries that I don’t recommend that beginners calculate it from heart rate percentages at first. Unless you’ve actually gotten your heart rate up to a maximum effort level, and know what that number is, you don’t really know your max heart rate.\n\nSo if you're a beginner, the best way to know if you’re in zone 2 is to ignore your watch and instead pay attention to your effort, and how it feels. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is nothing and 10 is all-out sprinting, low intensity cardio is about a 3 to 5. You’re working, but not very hard. If your breath starts to get ragged, or if you feel like you're getting pretty damn tired and you can't wait for this to end, you're probably somewhere 7+ and definitely going too hard for a zone 2 workout.\n\nA zone 2 pace is conversational, and it’s sometimes described with a “talk test.” If you could tell your friend about your day while you’re exercising, you’re probably around the right level. That doesn’t mean spitting out a few words here and there, but speaking in full sentences without feeling out of breath. If you find yourself stopping to catch your breath or if you feel like you need to take break, you’re going too hard. (That said, some of zone 3 is also within that conversational zone, but it's okay—zone 3 is still good for you.)\n\nThat said, it shouldn’t feel too easy—zone 2 is more like a brisk walk or easy jog than a leisurely stroll. If you stop, you should feel like you took a break from something. It should take a little work and focus to keep up the pace.\n\nBefore you start, there's a big caveat. Zone 2 is based on heart rate zones, and to set your zones correctly, you need an accurate max heart rate. Finding your max is a trickier task than you might expect, so you have my permission to skip this section completely, and scroll down to \"How do you know when you're in zone 2?\" which will teach you how to get into zone 2 by feel, no heart rate monitor needed.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll explain how exactly to find your zone 2, if you want to do it by the book. There are two steps: finding your max heart rate, and then setting your zones based on that heart rate.\n\nYour maximum heart rate is defined as, literally, the fastest your heart can beat. (Sometimes people assume this is a guideline, that you should keep your heart rate under this number. Nope—if your heart rate is higher than the number you thought was your max, that just tells you that number was not your max.) Here are some different ways to find your max heart rate:\n\nA max heart rate field test (best for people with healthy hearts and some pain tolerance): There are a few ways of doing this, but basically you're going to try to push your heart rate to its absolute max, and see what that number is. The most common way is to find a long, steep hill, and run up it three times, really sprinting hard on the last one. The number you see at the end is a good estimate of your max. Obviously, don't do this if you've been told you shouldn't exercise at high intensity.\n\nYour personal history (best for athletes who have experience using a HR monitor): If you've done high intensity exercise in the past, especially killer efforts that left you collapsed on the floor, the highest number you've ever seen on your watch or heart rate monitor is probably your max, or close to it. A 5K race or an FTP test will often get you close, if you really pushed yourself the whole way.\n\nEstimating based on easy exercise (best for non-athletes who have experience using a HR monitor): If you have a sense of what heart rate you see when you're exercising at a steady, conversational pace, multiply the highest number you would consider conversational by 1.25 to find a number that you can use as your max. This is my own method, but it's based on studies that have found the top of conversational pace to be around 77-79% of max. This isn't as good as a field test, but for many people it will give a better result than the formula below.\n\nA formula. I don't recommend using a formula if you have the option of using either of the first two real-world options above. Using a formula to get your max heart rate is like asking ChatGPT for your shoe size. It will give a plausible guess, but it could easily be very, very wrong. Anyway, the easiest formula is to subtract your age from 220. (There are other formulas, but honestly they all have serious inaccuracies. I wouldn't worry about whether any one of them is \"better\" than the others. They all suck.)\n\nI have more here on why max heart rate formulas are pretty much all wrong, but that's beside the point for the moment. If you know your max heart rate, you can proceed to the next step.\n\nOnce you know your max heart rate (or have an estimate you're willing to work with), multiply to get the upper and lower boundaries of zone 2. Multiply by what? Well, there's more than one opinion out there about what zone 2 should be.\n\nIf you use a smartwatch or other device, go into the settings and set a custom heart rate (all the major brands can do this—check the instructions to find out where this setting lives.) The zones will usually populate automatically.\n\nAs I've written before, every device has a different idea of what should count as zone 2. If you'd like me to be the tiebreaker, I'd go with 60% to 75% of your max heart rate. So, multiply your estimated max heart rate by 0.6 to get the lower end of that zone, and 0.75 to get the higher end. For example, if your max heart rate is 200, your zone 2 is 120 to 150 beats per minute. If your max heart rate is 175, your zone 2 would be 105 to 132.\n\nI have good news for you: zone 3 has almost all the same benefits as zone 2. Don't view the top of zone 2 as a barrier thou shalt not cross; it's just a way of dividing easier exercise (zone 2) from medium intensity (zone 3). The more exercise you do, the more of it should stay in zone 2. Otherwise you could find yourself building up fatigue. After a zone 2 cardio session, you should feel good. You should feel like you totally could have done more, but you're saving some energy for tomorrow.\n\nSo if you have a hard time staying in zone 2, don't beat yourself up about it. Just try to keep your effort level low, on average, so you're still fresh for the next workout. As you get fitter, you'll find it easier to stay in zone 2.\n\nRunners often have trouble with this, because the dividing line between walking and running is sometimes too high to maintain an easy pace while you’re running, if you’re a beginner. The next best thing is to jog as slow as you can, and when you start to feel out of breath, switch to a brisk walk. For some people, a brisk walk for the whole session is a perfect zone 2 workout. As you get more fit, easy jogging will become possible.\n\nHere’s a real world example of how to keep a zone 2 pace: if I’m heading out for an easy run, I start at a nice chill jogging pace. But I live in a hilly neighborhood, so pretty soon I’ll be chugging up a hill and notice my breathing getting heavier. At this point, if my heart rate is getting higher than I'd like for this workout, I switch to a power walk. Jogging the flats and walking the uphills is a great way to keep your effort level steady, instead of accidentally turning your easy jog into a hill sprint workout.\n\nCyclists often measure their training in a seven-zone system that is based on how much power, in a physics sense, you are putting into the gears of your bike. These are called Coggan power zones, and bike training systems like Zwift and Peloton use the same basic idea. To calibrate these zones, you’ll take an FTP (functional threshold power) test—basically, a 20-minute race against yourself. From there, you (or your training app) calculates wattage numbers for your zones.\n\nZones 2 and 3 in this system usually correspond to our “zone 2” cardio. (Your heart rate at the end of an FTP test will be pretty close to your max heart rate, by the way, if you really went all-out.) If you train with both a heart rate monitor and a bike power meter, don’t worry if they don’t match exactly. A ride in power zones 2 and 3 will meet your low-intensity cardio needs, even if your heart rate starts in zone 1 and spikes into zone 3 by the end.\n\nFor other forms of cardio, go by feel, or by heart rate if you truly know your heart rate percentages. When you’re on the elliptical or the rower or the airbike, you should feel like you could carry on a conversation easily, and stop because time is up rather than because you’re running out of gas.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be sweating on the fitness of Mason Mount as he prepares for his side’s Premier League match against Wolves on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe former Chelsea man came off at half-time on Sunday in United’s 1-0 win over Newcastle. Amorim said post-match that he was hoping the injury was nothing serious.\n\nIf Mount does make it, an unchanged XI is expected, partly on merit after Sunday but also partly because there are few other options.\n\nHarry Maguire is back on the grass but is unlikely to be ready for action. Matthijs de Ligt and Bruno Fernandes are still injured, and Kobbie Mainoo is also unlikely to have recovered in time.\n\nMeanwhile, Nouss Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are still participating for their countries in AFCON. All three of their nations – Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon (respectively) – are expected to progress to the knockout stages, so they are unlikely to be back until around 10th January or even beyond.\n\nSenne Lammens will continue in goal. Amorim is likely to persist with a back four of Diogo Dalot, Sunday’s Man of the Match Ayden Heaven, Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw.\n\nCasemiro and Manuel Ugarte will once again be the twin sixes. If fit, Mount will play in front of them. Patrick Dorgu was excellent on the right wing on Sunday, so is likely to continue there, with Matheus Cunha on the left and Ben Sesko up top.\n\nIf Mount does not make it, he could be replaced directly by Jack Fletcher as he was at half-time against the Magpies. Alternatively, the boss could revert to a back three, bringing in Leny Yoro as a third centre-back and pushing the full-backs up into wing-back roles.\n\nHowever, Amorim has hinted at more than one press conference that he is reluctant to play Shaw at wing-back due to the physical exertion involved.\n\nAnother possibility would be to play 4-2-3-1 with Josh Zirkzee sitting in behind Sesko. Given the opposition’s struggles this season, it would certainly be an option.\n\nGiven all that, here is our predicted XI for Tuesday’s 8.15pm kick-off:\n\nFeatured image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Business Insider's health team share the best tips and trends we followed this year, from workout hacks to healthy eating to better morning routines.",
    "fullText": "As a health reporter, I love to tell people \"no.\"\n\nNo, you probably don't need to add protein to everything. No, you won't get swole in a month with that one-minute Instagram workout. No, a Paleo diet won't fix all your problems (and probably isn't historically accurate).\n\nThat's why, as the end of the year approaches, I wanted to change things up and ask my esteemed colleagues what simple hacks actually have made a difference for them — whether it's working out smarter, eating better, and living well.\n\nAfter a year of talking to health experts, and reading lots and lots of science, here's what helped us move the needle for a healthier mind and body in 2025.\n\nLike many of our readers, I live in a household with two working parents. Our kids are still on the younger side, 6 and 8, so life is fairly hectic. Of course, my mind is always racing, planning, organizing, scheduling, and doing all of the other things that come along with managing the mental load that we're all very aware of these days. Turning my brain off, or at least briefly pushing pause, is tricky, especially at bedtime.\n\nCommitting to taking a few deep breaths as soon as I get under the sheets has done wonders for me. Sometimes I'll follow a quick meditation track on my phone; other times, I'll do some box breathing. But more often than not, I just try to breathe in and out for a few minutes, focusing on the movement of my body and nothing else. The practice helps clear my mind and gets my body ready for bed — and the flurry I know tomorrow will bring.\n\nJennifer Beck Goldblatt, Senior Editor, Health & Parenting\n\nThis year, I've been putting a little bit of ginger in almost everything. Fresh ginger tea, grated ginger to add zip to soups and stews, and crystallized ginger as a sweet treat. I generally eat a healthy diet — lots of fiber, fruits and veggies, home-cooked meals — but the extra ginger has made a big difference for my gut health. I'm less likely to have an upset stomach even when I indulge my passion for spicy food.\n\nOne of my favorite recipes to make in big batches is fresh ginger tea with turmeric, black pepper, a bit of cayenne, and plenty of honey. It smells great, and it's warming and full of antioxidants for a perfect self-care break any time of day.\n\nMidway through the year, I bought a Brick for my phone. It's a gadget on my fridge that helps me block whichever apps I choose (in my case, my email and internet, since I already got rid of social media on my phone).\n\nI tap my phone every night before I unwind for bed and usually don't tap again until right before work starts — my peak junk-scrolling times. Something about the humiliation of having to physically walk up to my fridge because I want to Google an actor from a niche '80s movie keeps me from un-Bricking. I get to my morning workouts quicker and read more books, which has made me a much happier person.\n\nBuying an air fryer has been a game changer for quickly rustling up nutritious food. I thought they were for heating up fries and frozen treats, and that you couldn't use them to heat saucy foods, like the curries and bean stews I cook and freeze.\n\nSince realizing you can get air fryer-proof dishes, which can be DIYed with foil or baking paper, I've made dozens of protein pancakes for breakfast. I enjoy frozen veggies that are no longer soggy and sad from being defrosted in the microwave, batch-cook chicken meatballs in 10 minutes before work, and can quickly reheat my trusty frozen beans. (To make pancakes, mix up the regular ingredients, cook the batter in a single layer in the air fryer, then chop and stack once cooked.)\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor\n\nMy kids are finally all in the same school (and therefore same schedule), which means I have a bit more time in the mornings for myself before hopping online for work. I've been taking 15-30 minute walks in the morning to get some fresh air and sunlight before spending the rest of my day in front of a computer.\n\nI joke I'm like a plant and need as much sunlight as possible to have the best mood I can have, so prioritizing time outside has helped, especially with SAD now that the darker months are upon us [that's seasonal affective disorder — when your mood and energy tanks in the fall and winter.]\n\nConz Preti, Deputy Editor, Parenting & Health\n\nIn March of this year, I committed to waking up after my first alarm goes off, rather than snoozing it at least two extra times, as I had been accustomed to doing since middle school.\n\nI made this small but radical change because I was feeling exhausted all the time, and I've found that my energy level feels far more stable, and my mood tends to be better throughout the day when I manage it. It can be really difficult in the moment, but the payoff has been huge!\n\nI finally started pelvic floor physical therapy! And, reader, let me tell you: It's worth it. The pelvic floor is a \"hammock\" of muscles in your pelvis that controls your core, your breathing, your bladder, your sexual function, your digestive system, and so much more.\n\nCan you feel yours? Unless you're pregnant or have incontinence, the answer is probably \"no.\" But that doesn't mean you should leave it un-therapized. Even just one session with a pelvic floor PT showed me what I was doing wrong. I left with useful exercises I can do to improve my core control and my breathing so that my workouts are more effective, and don't put unnecessary stress on my organs. I'm a convert.\n\nMia de Graaf, Deputy Executive Editor, Health & Features\n\nI'd been in a running rut for years. I was bored with my usual routine of running a few miles at a leisurely pace, but trying to actively track and increase my speed felt daunting as well. Getting a VO2 max assessment taught me that I could run a lot faster than I thought I could — and having exact numbers to shoot for was very helpful, too. I've since joined a nearby Orangetheory, which focuses on hitting higher heart rate zones throughout class, and have slowly inched up to running paces I thought unimaginable a year ago.\n\nMy trainer gave me some advice that helped me get through a big fitness slump.\n\nEveryone's training typically falls into three phases each year: terrible, OK, and great, he said. I was in the \"terrible\" stage, where your motivation is wiped.\n\nTo my surprise, that's where my trainer was, too. Learning that even athletes like him struggle with motivation helped ease my embarrassment.\n\nIt made it easier to give myself permission not to go near a gym for three months after I got burned out by a Hyrox-esque fitness contest. I thought long-term, enjoyed leisurely walks, and the odd PS Fit YouTube dance video, knowing I'd eventually get back to regular exercise, whether that was restarting functional fitness or trying something new.\n\nI was right: I'm now doing regular Saturday morning 5K runs with my neighbor, and started using the Ladder training app this fall. The big takeaway: be kind to yourself.\n\nKashmira Gander, Senior Health Editor",

Sibling comments get starved for attention, while replies always steal the spotlight, dominating the discourse.\n\nThis makes the reading experience feel meandering, scatterbrained, and unfocused. Conversations often feel like they drift into squabbling and pedantry, because that's what the platform design prioritizes and presents.\n\nAs the reader scans top-down, they are effectively led through a “depth-first” traversal into all subdiscussions. Comment replies (no matter their quality or relevance) are always given precedence to sidetrack and derail the reading experience.\n\nThe issue magnifies for larger threads, where most readers never scroll down far enough to get past the first reply, or even the first reply to the first reply. Commenters also pile on to the first comment’s replies, knowing that that is prime real estate, and thus artificially inflating the discourse there.\n\nHere's the same reply thread as above, shown a different way.\n\nThe default HN reading experience is still available, you can read down the leftmost vertical edge and recreate the depth-first comment traversal.\n\nHowever, as you’ll notice, for each level you can now easily see the sibling comments as well and jump to them.\n\nPower-user keyboard shortcuts make all this effortless:\n\nThat’s really it.

    "title": "What Is VO2max?",
    "description": "It measures your cardio fitness, but it's not as important as tech companies want you to think.",
    "fullText": "The more you work out, the fitter you'll get. Your VO2max, sometimes described on wearables as a \"cardio fitness\" score, is a number that tends to be higher among people who are more cardiovascularly fit. But it's not the only measure of fitness, and you should know what it really means.\n\nSmartwatches and fitness trackers don't actually measure VO2max; they just estimate it. To actually find your VO2max, you'd need to go to an exercise lab and do a test on a treadmill or cycle while hooked up to equipment that measures your heart rate and the air you're exhaling. I did exactly this kind of test to compare my real VO2max to the numbers reported by nine different devices. You can read about my experience, and why it matters, here.\n\nVO2max, properly rendered VO2max, is the maximal volume (V) of oxygen (O2) your body can use per minute during exercise, scaled to your body size because larger people will naturally use more oxygen. This is considered a good measure of aerobic fitness because—think back to high school biology—your body uses oxygen and food to create a usable form of chemical energy called ATP. You then use that ATP to power the movements of your muscles. The amount of oxygen directly correlates with the amount of energy produced. Or, in simpler terms, the more work you do, the more oxygen you need.\n\nSo a person who is aerobically very fit—let’s say an elite marathon runner—can do more work (run faster) than somebody who isn’t. As a result, they’ll suck in a lot more oxygen per minute during their run than, say, I would.\n\nA typical sorta-fit human being will have a VO2max somewhere in the 30s or 40s. If you exercise a lot, you can push that number higher. Elite cyclists, skiers, and ultrarunners may have numbers in the 70s or 80s, and a few people out there have scored in the 90s. I'd call myself a recreational athlete (I run a little) and my lab-tested VO2max was 43. Most of my fitness wearables reported numbers for me in the high 30's or low 40's—a good reminder that these estimates can be useful, but they aren't necessarily correct.\n\nTo be able to use a large amount of oxygen, you need more than just good lungs. You also need a strong heart and healthy circulatory system to get the oxygen to your muscles. And you need muscles that are large and can do a lot of work per minute—which means that you're strong and can do a lot of work athletically. VO2max is a way to summarize a lot of important things about cardio fitness into one simple number.\n\nBut it’s important to know that this number isn’t everything about fitness, or even aerobic fitness. First, it doesn’t make much sense to compare your VO2max to other people’s, because it’s affected by factors like blood volume and muscle mass. Men tend to have a VO2max about ten points higher than similarly fit women, for example. There are also plenty of aspects of fitness that aren't captured by VO2max. Compare two athletes with the same VO2max, and you may find that one can keep going in an endurance race longer than the other. Or one might be better at sprinting while another is better at medium-effort work. One person may be stronger than another, or have better technique, or be more resistant to injuries.\n\nThere is research correlating VO2max with longevity, but that doesn't mean that raising your VO2max a few points will add years to your life. Fitness, in general, tends to correlate with longevity and with overall health. Scientists who want to study that relationship will usually pick an easy thing or two to measure, like VO2max or grip strength. But in real life, we don't have to choose one number to maximize; we can work on multiple aspects of fitness. It's better to be well-rounded than to hyperfocus on just one metric.\n\nThe gold standard is a lab test. High-level athletes will sometimes take this test if they or their coach want to know their actual, definite VO2max number. But we can measure aerobic fitness in other ways, and there are workouts you can do to get a good estimate of VO2max. If you’re a runner, you can look up a recent race time on this chart to find your VDOT, which roughly correlates with your VO2max. (My best-ever mile time gets me a VDOT of 38, for example.)\n\nTo estimate your VO2max from a workout, you need something that will take you to your absolute maximum aerobic output. A race does this job nicely; so will a test like running as many laps of a track as you can in 12 minutes. I recall doing a test in a Phys Ed. class once where we had to step up and down from a high box as many times as possible. These tests aren’t pleasant, but their results can be a benchmark to tell you whether you’re improving your fitness over time.\n\nSmartwatches and fitness trackers typically estimate VO2max by comparing your heart rate during exercise to a measure of how much work you're doing during that exercise. Most often, this is through outdoor running or walking. The speed you run or walk is measured through GPS, and the device compares that to your heart rate. If you can run fast with a low heart rate, you must be pretty fit and your VO2max will be estimated as being pretty high. If your heart rate is high even for a slow running or walking pace, your VO2max is lower.\n\nThese estimates aren't always accurate. If your max heart rate isn't set properly in the device's settings, if it's hot out, if your running route has hills, or if you don't happen to get out for outdoor runs or walks very often, your VO2max is more likely to be wrong. That said, your VO2max estimate doesn't have to be exactly correct to be useful. If the number increases over time, you're probably getting fitter. And if it decreases, you're likely losing fitness.",

    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance posted glossy photos of his personal training session with Navy SEALs—but the beachside stunt immediately drew mockery and accusations of political tone-deafness.\n\nThe 41-year-old former Marine, who served in Iraq before entering politics, had joined the Navy’s special-operations community for an early-morning workout at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in California, a longtime hub for SEAL selection and training.\n\nFrom the official @VP account, Vance shared images on Monday of himself sprinting along the surf, hauling a log with helmeted operators whose faces were blurred, scrambling up a cargo net, and riding in a small boat punching through the waves.\n\n“Vice President Vance trains with @USNavy Seals at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado,” the caption read. On his personal account, Vance gushed that he had “just finished PT with the Navy SEALs for 90 minutes.”\n\nHe added, “They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train. So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!”\n\nCritics were unimpressed. “Nice cosplay as a Navy SEAL,” one user wrote, adding: “Leadership isn’t about photo ops, it’s about fixing the mess at home.”\n\nOther critics photoshopped the infamous meme of Vance with a cartoonishly puffy face onto the soldiers he was working out with, using “GI Jello” as a punchline.\n\nAnother commenter sneered that it was a “desperate photo op for a Vice President who cares more about his military ‘aesthetic’ than actually governing.”\n\nDigital strategist Mike Nellis jabbed: “Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks.”\n\nAnd Democratic strategist Christopher Hale wrote on X, “It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL.”\n\nVance’s made-for-camera workout follows a Trumpian trend of the president’s inner circle engaging in theatrics. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, 45, marked the D-Day anniversary and his birthday in June by leading a filmed PT session with troops on Omaha Beach before delivering a speech at the Normandy American Cemetery, a spectacle that also drew scrutiny as self-promotion.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly been mocked as “ICE Barbie” for using federal law enforcement as props in a string of stylized photo ops, from tactical-gear raids to glossy fitness clips.\n\nThis is also not the first time Vance has tried to curry favor with the military. Ahead of Thanksgiving, he delivered a comedy skit to troops at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the vice president’s office for comment.",

    "description": "At 70, a woman with serious health problems joined a gym after her daughter's warning and lost 70 pounds, reversed conditions, and rebuilt her strength.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Joan MacDonald, 79, a former driving examiner of Collingwood, Ontario. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nJanuary 2017 was a New Year I'll never forget. It was one of the few times that my daughter, Michelle MacDonald, lost her cool with me.\n\nShe'd moved to Mexico the previous month and was visiting. \"I won't get to see you as often as I like,\" she said. \"And, every time I leave, I won't know whether it will be the last time I see you.\"\n\nThen she made another blunt comment that changed my life. \"Mom, why don't you go to the gym?\" she said.\n\nI had high blood pressure, kidney problems, and was at least 70 pounds overweight. Approaching my 71st birthday that March, I felt scared and miserable.\n\nMy doctor had already warned me that, if I didn't make an effort to improve my health, I would end up on dialysis before very long. I was effectively dying.\n\nGrowing up in Canada, I'd been an active child. I played ball, skated in the winter, and went bowling. I enjoyed doing them because they were fun. But I was by no means an athlete.\n\nI got married a month before my 21st birthday and settled into married life while working as a driving examiner. I juggled work with motherhood, raising Michelle and her older and younger brothers.\n\nGoing to the gym really wasn't a thing back then. None of my married friends worked out, or even thought about doing so.\n\nI believe that your body changes every seven years or so. I went through variations in terms of shape and size, and enjoyed certain foods, then went off them.\n\nI didn't have regular meals, often eating just two meals a day at irregular times. In between, I'd snack.\n\nThroughout my 60s, I was in poor health. I'd get bronchitis in the fall and spring — I had weaker lungs after contracting rheumatic fever as a child — and the kidney issues began.\n\nThe weight had grown to 200 pounds, which was far too heavy for my height of 5 feet 3 inches. And my blood pressure was high; I was put on medication.\n\nI'm lucky because Michelle is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and sports nutrition coach. She saw how unhealthy I'd become and was worried, especially because she'd moved thousands of miles away and couldn't keep an eye on me.\n\nHer recommendation struck home. It was enough to jolt me into action. My doctor also encouraged me to lose weight and reduce my blood pressure.\n\nI'd half-heartedly attended the gym before, but not consistently. This time, I went five times a week.\n\nI sought advice from Michelle and studied YouTube videos to learn how to use the machines and do strength training with free weights. At first, I couldn't believe how hard it was to pick up 20 pounds.\n\nI began with small weights and increased them by increments. I've since done a deadlift of 170 pounds and a hip thrust of 230 pounds.\n\nIt was amazing to see my body slim down and fit into clothes, like jeans, that I hadn't worn in a very long time.\n\nI lost 45 pounds in six months and a further 25 pounds during the rest of my 70s. I've gone from a size XL to a medium. I was able to quit my medications.\n\nMy current regimen involves spending two hours at the gym, with around 15 minutes of cardio, followed by using weights. I often work out with Michelle, whom I joined in Mexico for around a year after my husband died.\n\nAs for my diet, I eat five small meals a day, including oatmeal with egg whites, protein powder, and 1% coconut milk for breakfast.\n\nThen I'll have yogurt, an egg white omelette with ground beef, chicken, turkey, and ham, a protein bar, and a final, plain meal without starches. If I start my day at 7 am, I'll stop eating by 7 pm.\n\nUnfortunately, I suffered a shoulder injury while biking outside on a rough surface and needed surgery three months ago. I've had to take things a bit easier as I recover. However, I feel 100% happier and healthier than I did before going to the gym.\n\nMichelle and I established \"Train With Joan\" to help inspire people to take up exercise, regardless of their age.\n\nIt may slow you down a bit, but I've seen many seniors, even older than me, accomplish great things. They have resolved to do it for themselves. Nobody else is living in your body but you.",

    "description": "The actor and gym bro, 54, eats two types of eggs, salmon, and turkey each morning.",
    "fullText": "Mark Wahlberg eats a high-protein breakfast every morning that would likely get a big thumbs-up from longevity researchers.\n\nIn an Instagram post last week, the 54-year-old said he always starts the day with three hard-boiled eggs, scrambled eggs with turkey pieces, a side of salmon drizzled with lemon and what looks like olive oil, and a bowl of blueberries.\n\n\"Same old, same old, every day,\" the \"Ted\" star, who is known for his strict wellness routine and daily 4 a.m. workouts, said.\n\n\"I eat the same breakfast every day, but I feel better every day!!\" the caption reads.\n\nIn 2018, Wahlberg's daily routine included waking up at 2:30 a.m., two workouts, and cryotherapy.\n\nBut as he's gotten older, he's dialed it down a little (he now wakes up around 3:30 a.m.) as he focuses on healthy aging.\n\n\"Getting a little bit older, I'm always now thinking about longevity, mobility, flexibility, lung capacity. Rest is equally important,\" he told Business Insider in 2023.\n\nHis breakfast reflects his health goals.\n\nThe meal contains healthy fats and polyphenols — molecules that are believed to help reduce inflammation — from the olive oil, salmon, and blueberries. These foods are thought to be great for brain health and preventing cognitive decline.\n\nHis breakfast also chimes with the Mediterranean diet, which consists mainly of unprocessed whole foods like lean proteins, fresh produce, legumes, and whole grains, and is considered to be one of the healthiest ways to eat for a long life.\n\nAlthough, notably, Wahlberg's breakfast is missing complex carbs.\n\nThe dish is also high in protein, which is essential for building and maintaining muscle as well as supporting metabolic health.\n\nAs the \"The Family Plan 2\" star strength trains daily, extra protein is key. To build muscle, a person needs to eat around 0.75 grams of protein per pound of body weight, sports nutritionist Rob Hobson told Business Insider.\n\n\"If you are pushing weights and you're trying to get this hypertrophy, so the muscle is tearing, then you do need to support that with a bit more protein,\" he said.",

    "description": "The time may come when you need to tap into the power of passive-aggressive mountain climbers.",
    "fullText": "The holidays are for rest, relaxation, and eating your weight in cookies shaped like reindeer. Your fitness goals can absolutely wait until the new year. But if you find yourself trapped in a house where someone just said, \"well, actually\" for the third time in ten minutes, and you need to escape to your old bedroom before you say something you'll regret—here's a quick (and quiet) bodyweight circuit you can do surrounded by your high school participation trophies.\n\nThese are my favorite beginner-friendly exercises to efficiently blow off some steam. Hopefully you have some floor space next to your twin bed.\n\nThese are classic push-ups, but you're listening intently for footsteps. Is someone coming to ask why you fled the living room? This adds an element of anxious anticipation that really engages your core. Modify on your knees if needed.\n\nDo some deep squats while internally composing the perfect rebuttal you'll never actually say. Feel the burn in your quads and your self-restraint. Make sure you're pushing your hips back until your thighs are parallel with the floor, looking to keep your knees bent at 90 degrees and in line with your toes. Bonus points if you can do these silently enough that no one downstairs hears the floorboards creaking.\n\nLunge from your bed to your old dresser (the one still covered in stickers, right?). Consider each lunge as representing a point in the argument you're nobly choosing not to make. You're not avoiding conflict; you're being the bigger person. And getting stronger glutes!\n\nRemember, when you lunge, keep your front knee over your ankle, not your toes. Keep your torso upright and your core engaged.\n\nHold a plank while contemplating how you've become the most emotionally mature person in your family. This is harder than it sounds, both physically and existentially. If you need to drop to your knees after 20 seconds, that's fine—you're still doing better than the conversation downstairs. My top tip for keeping your body in a straight line is to engage your glutes more than you might think.\n\nQuick, quiet mountain climbers that let you burn off steam without making enough noise to alert anyone that you've rage-quit the family gathering. Imagine you're running away from the discussion, but in place, silently, on your childhood floor.\n\nLie on your back (hey, you're already thinking about taking a nap anyway), feet flat, and lift those hips. Each bridge is you rising above the drama. You're literally elevating yourself. Metaphorically and gluteally.\n\nFinish with bicycle crunches while pretending you're pedaling away from this entire situation. Alternate elbow to opposite knee and find your center.\n\nSit on the edge of your too-small bed, breathing deeply, feeling virtuously exercised and only slightly guilty for abandoning your family. Check your phone. Consider going back downstairs. Hear a raised voice mention \"fake news\" or \"snowflake\" or whatever the discourse is today. Do another round.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Manchester City at the City Ground (kick-off 12:30 GMT).\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\nOla Aina is \"progressing well\" in his recovery from a hamstring injury but is still rebuilding his fitness. He played for the B team on Monday night and came through the match \"fine and injury-free\". It is \"another step forward\" for the defender.\n\nOn the lack of intensity and urgency shown in the defeat to Fulham, Dyche said: \"You have to park these things pretty quickly. We did well overall, we weren't a million miles off. It wasn't the intensity we showed in the Tottenham game or out in Utrecht though.\"\n\nHe added: \"The game was a bit flat in general. Our fans were terrific, they were trying to get the team going, as was I. Sometimes the hardest thing is when everyone is having a bit of a down day.\"\n\nIt is \"unlikely\" that he will be weighing his players, like Pep Guardiola, before the Manchester City game. He joked: \"Is he weighing himself, do you think? One rule for one - come on, Pep!\"\n\nHe explained his philosophy around the festive period: \"I just look for my players to have a bit of common sense. I don't mind them having a Christmas dinner, why not?\" He believes \"psychology is important as anything with athletes\" and Christmas Day is \"a big part\" of life.\n\nFitness is \"very important\" but he isn't \"obsessed over weights\". He will \"encourage\" his players to \"enjoy\" the festivities, especially because they don't play until 27 December.\n\nOn opposition manager Guardiola, Dyche said: \"It is fantastic what he has achieved, there's no two ways about it. Only Sir Alex Ferguson probably tops him. He has done massive things for himself, his players and football in general.\"\n\nThe Reds will be hoping Manchester City are \"having a quiet day\" when they visit the City Ground. However, Forest will still need to play \"very well\" because they are facing a team who are \"always prepared\".\n\nDyche added: \"It's unlikely we are going to dominate the ball, so we have to be defensively sound and do all the hard yards.\"\n\nNottingham Forest's Premier League win-loss-win-loss-win-loss form \"will do\" this season, \"if it keeps going\". He explained: \"If you do the stats, if that carried on for the whole season then it would equal a pretty good situation.\"\n\nHowever, the biggest thing for Dyche is the team \"finding consistency\" - whether that be in terms of their \"training schedule or performances\" - but he recognises that will take time.\n\nHe is predicting a \"slow\" January transfer window because of the club's investment in the summer. On the other hand, he added: \"The club have shown that if players become available at the right times, they can make things happen - so you never know.\"\n\nFollow all of Tuesday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news",

    "title": "Why I Won't Be Getting an AI Home Gym",
    "description": "The \"future\" of fitness just can't beat more affordable solutions.",
    "fullText": "I've been getting relentless Instagram ads for AI-powered home gyms lately. You've probably seen them, too—sleek wall-mounted screens with impossibly toned instructors, testimonials promising \"the future of fitness,\" and before-and-after transformations that make it all look effortless.\n\nThe smart home gym equipment market is booming. According to Business Wire, the industry was valued at $3.2 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $4 billion by 2030. The numbers show plenty of people are investing in fitness technology that offers personalized, convenient, and effective home workouts. Fitness is yet another way to feed the AI beast, transforming boring old equipment into highly sophisticated systems capable of delivering real-time feedback, tracking performance, and adjusting workouts to each user's needs. It all sounds impressive—revolutionary, even. But here's the thing about fitness trends: It takes a lot more than the latest technology to make them stick.\n\nAfter months of watching these ads follow me around the internet, I got curious enough to actually dig into what these things are and whether they're worth the hype, and if the math really adds up for most people.\n\nWhatever your fitness goal is, the way to get it done is going to be time-tested and probably not too glamorous. Look at Tae Bo, Zumba, shake weights, even the world of Crossfit—most fitness fads don't have staying power once the novelty wears off.\n\nSure, exercise science evolves, but not nearly as fast as whatever trendy gadget cycles through the cultural zeitgeist. In this way, we see “fitness” get reduced to a consumer product—something to be purchased, used briefly, and then tossed aside when something shinier comes along. In 2025, spin classes are out, while Pilates and strength training are in, and that Bowflex is probably collecting dust in your mom’s basement.\n\nIn fact, in 2024 both Bowflex and American Home Fitness, two companies that bet big on the home fitness boom, filed for bankruptcy. In more recent history, Peloton once seemed unstoppable. Now, Peloton's revenue declined 2.8% in 2024 to $2.71 billion, marking its third consecutive year of declining revenue. What was once a cultural phenomenon now struggles to retain members and justify its premium pricing.\n\nFor something to stick in fitness, three questions matter: Is it affordable? Does it work? Will you personally keep coming back to it?\n\nAI home gyms might work, and you might keep coming back, but that first question is where things get complicated.\n\nAI home gyms are digital fitness systems that combine hardware with software to create a personalized workout experience at home. The most well-known is probably Tonal, but there's also Tempo, Speediance, Amp, and others.\n\nHere's how they typically work: Tonal, for instance, is a wall-mounted unit about the size of a large TV that uses electromagnetic resistance instead of traditional weights. You pull cables attached to adjustable arms, and the system can provide up to 200 pounds of resistance digitally. Built-in cameras and sensors track your movements, and the AI adjusts the weight in real-time based on your form and performance. A screen displays instructors leading classes, tracks your reps and sets, and the system learns your strength patterns over time to suggest when you should increase weight or modify exercises.\n\nOther systems work differently—Tempo uses free weights with 3D sensors that watch your form, while some use smart cables or connected dumbbells—but the core promise is the same: sophisticated technology that monitors your workout, corrects your form, tracks your progress, and adapts to your fitness level, all from your living room.\n\nSmart home gyms do offer legitimate benefits, including compact convenience, personalization, time savings, structured workouts, and potentially better injury prevention through form monitoring. And for many, devices like Tonal, Amp, and others are here to stay. “As a professional home gym equipment tester,” says Jose Guevara of ShreddedDad, “I've seen more of these continue to pop up not only in full training stations, but also in specific equipment, like cable machines, dumbbells, and sometimes a combination of both. They'll never have the longevity of weight plates or barbells, but there is an audience for them.\"\n\nAccording to Guevera, these systems appeal to \"those people who need guidance and want a done-for-you system where they can choose on-demand workouts where they can just follow along and not have to think about what to do for their workout.”\n\nThere is an audience for these products, just as there's an audience for Peloton bikes and high-end boutique fitness studios. But to me, the relevant question isn't whether they work for some people—it's whether they're the revolutionary solution to home fitness they're marketed as, or just another expensive piece of equipment that most people will use enthusiastically for a few months before the novelty wears off.\n\nStill, another Tonal user told me that comparing these AI systems to a Bowflex machine from the 1990s is like comparing a surgical robot to using a rusty scalpel. But this analogy assumes your body is a machine where the logic of “endless innovation” holds up. A smart gym isn’t exactly a medical solution. It's an accessory, a luxury good that depends on who can afford it. I don’t think the problem with working out at home has never been that we lacked sophisticated enough technology. The problem is that working out is hard, consistency is harder, and no amount of AI can fundamentally change that human reality. There are some things you just can’t hack.\n\nThere are hefty upfront costs for these products. Take Tonal, one of the leading AI home gym systems. It's around $4,300 for the unit itself, $295+ for mandatory professional installation, plus bundled smart accessories. Then comes the recurring monthly membership fee of around $60 for full access to classes and features. All told, you're looking at roughly $5,300 in the first year, followed by $720 annually for the subscription.\n\nCompare that to traditional gym memberships. According to a 2023 report, the average monthly cost of a gym membership is $58, which works out to about $696 per year. Budget options like Planet Fitness run as low as $15 to $23 per month, or $180 to $276 annually. Even mid-tier gyms like LA Fitness typically cost $40 to 56 per month.\n\nSo, to break even on a Tonal, compared to a mid-range gym membership at $50/month:\n\nYear 1: Tonal costs $5,300. A gym membership costs $600. You're already $4,700 in the hole.\n\nYear 2: You pay $720 for Tonal's subscription. The gym still costs $600. You're now $4,820 behind.\n\nYear 3: Another $720 vs. $600. Now you're $4,940 in deficit.\n\nIt would take roughly eight years of consistent use before Tonal becomes cost-competitive with a traditional gym membership. Eight years. That's assuming the hardware doesn't malfunction, the company doesn't go under (remember, Bowflex and Peloton couldn't sustain their models), and you actually use it consistently for nearly a decade.\n\nAnd the subscription costs are real. Unlike traditional weights that work whether or not you're paying a monthly fee, many digital fitness products require a subscription as long as you want to access workouts. \"I've seen some of these companies also go out of business,\" Guevara says, \"so if that happens, you're stuck with a product that doesn't function if their software is not kept up with.\" We've watched other companies’ subscription traps effectively brick your hardware.\n\nNow, proponents will argue that you save on commute time and costs. Fair enough. But for the Tonal investment to be \"worth it\" financially, you'd need to use it at least three to four times per week for those eight years straight. If you weren’t driving to a gym you pay $50/month for, are you sure you’ll consistently use your smart gym for years and years once the novelty wears off?\n\nThere’s another unspoken cost to at-home convenience, akin to people who struggle with WFH setups: the absence of gym culture. Don’t underestimate the power of casual human interaction, personal trainers who can physically adjust your form, accountability from workout buddies, the ritual of leaving your house to exercise, or maybe even the silent camaraderie of shared suffering. If you’re like me, that separation between home and workout space is a major psychological boost.\n\nThe best exercise is the one you'll actually keep doing. If you run the numbers and a Tonal makes sense for your budget and workout habits, great. Personally, as AI creeps into every other corner of my life, I find a lot of comfort in my workouts as a rare screen-free activity.\n\nMy gripe with AI home gyms is when they’re marketed as must-have solutions, instead of what they are: luxury goods, something available only to those with disposable income and spare square footage. On a grand scale, given their current costs, AI home gyms look like a passing trend to me. And two years from now, when the next fitness innovation promises to finally solve at-home workouts, I bet someone will write this same article all over again.",

    "description": "Isak Injury Raises January Signings Questions for LiverpoolLiverpool are facing an uncomfortable period of uncertainty after concerns emerged over the fitness of Alexander Isak, with early indications...",
    "fullText": "Liverpool are facing an uncomfortable period of uncertainty after concerns emerged over the fitness of Alexander Isak, with early indications suggesting the striker could be sidelined for a significant period. While the full extent of the injury is still being assessed, the situation has already sharpened internal discussions around January signings and squad depth during a decisive phase of the season.\n\nIsak’s injury arrives at an awkward moment. Liverpool have invested heavily in attacking options over the past year, yet circumstances have shifted quickly. Injuries, suspensions and international commitments are converging, leaving the club exposed in areas that were expected to be well covered. The coming days, particularly the results of further medical examinations, will play a critical role in shaping Liverpool’s strategy for the winter transfer window.\n\nThere is a deliberate sense of caution around Isak’s condition. Liverpool are waiting for comprehensive scan results before forming a definitive prognosis, but early concern within the club suggests the issue may not be short-term. The striker was visibly distressed when leaving the pitch, and staff were immediately aware that the injury could carry broader implications beyond one match or even one month.\n\nSince his arrival, Isak’s time on Merseyside has already been disrupted by physical setbacks. Another prolonged absence would not only slow his own adaptation but also place additional strain on a forward line that is already being reshaped week by week. Liverpool’s medical team are understood to be taking a conservative approach, prioritising long-term recovery over any rushed return.\n\nLiverpool had been monitoring the January market even before Isak’s injury, but the urgency has increased according to the Telegraph. Recruitment staff are actively reviewing options who could provide immediate cover across the front line, particularly players capable of operating in multiple attacking roles. Flexibility is seen as essential, given the unpredictable nature of injuries and suspensions during the second half of the campaign.\n\nWhile no final decision has been taken, the possibility of January signings is firmly on the table. Liverpool are unlikely to make reactive or inflated deals, yet there is an acceptance internally that the squad may require reinforcement to sustain momentum domestically and in Europe. Financially, the club retains scope to act, having planned prudently despite substantial recent expenditure.\n\nThe preference would be for a player who can contribute straight away rather than a long-term project. Availability, fitness history and adaptability to the Premier League are all being weighed carefully as part of the assessment process.\n\nIsak’s injury is not an isolated issue. Liverpool are managing a growing list of absentees, with several players either unavailable or facing enforced breaks due to suspension and international duty. This congestion is placing additional responsibility on a relatively small group of attackers, increasing the risk of fatigue and further injuries.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, the coaching staff are already exploring short-term adjustments to manage workloads and maintain attacking output. However, internal belief remains that structural solutions, rather than temporary fixes, may be required if Isak is ruled out for an extended period.\n\nThe January schedule offers little margin for error. League fixtures, cup commitments and the broader demands of a title challenge mean Liverpool cannot afford a prolonged dip in attacking efficiency.\n\nMuch depends on the clarity that emerges from Isak’s medical assessment. A minor setback would likely see Liverpool hold their position and trust the depth already in place. A more serious diagnosis, however, would almost certainly accelerate plans around January signings.\n\nLiverpool’s approach remains calm and methodical. There is no appetite for panic, but there is also a recognition that inaction carries its own risks. The balance between patience and decisiveness will define their winter strategy, with Isak’s injury acting as the central variable.\n\nFor now, the club wait. Yet behind the scenes, preparations are being made to ensure Liverpool are not left short-handed should the worst-case scenario materialise.",

    "description": "Outside the gym, Martha Stewart says she tries to stay active by walking, gardening, and working.",
    "fullText": "Fitness trends come and go, but at 84, Martha Stewart remains loyal to the workout routine she has followed for years.\n\n\"I've worked out ever since I can remember,\" Stewart told Women's Health in an interview published on Friday. Even outside the gym, she makes it a point to stay active.\n\n\"I walk a whole lot. I garden a whole lot. I go to work in New York [City] pretty much five days a week or do my traveling,\" she said.\n\nStewart said her go-to exercises haven't changed much.\n\n\"I might not be as energetic as I used to be, but I'm pretty good,\" she said. \"The amount of weights and things that I use are pretty much the same as they've always been, so I'm strong. I'm very strong.\"\n\nAt 6:30 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Stewart heads into a mat and reformer Pilates session with her instructor. \"I do a very intense program, and it's nonstop for 45 minutes,\" she said.\n\nSince she regularly commutes into the city by car, Stewart says Pilates helps her stay loose and flexible. \"It also is very good for strengthening one's bones, keeping one limber, working with aches and pains, stretching out,\" she said.\n\nShe practices yoga too, though less frequently than Pilates.\n\n\"Pilates reminds me a little bit of yoga,\" she said. \"I end with yoga stretches on blocks at Pilates.\"\n\nHer Tuesday and Thursday mornings are reserved for 45 minutes of strength training with her trainer, using mostly dumbbells and machines.\n\nDespite her busy schedule, Stewart remains committed to her fitness. \"Even when I get home late at night, I still go and do my workout,\" she added.\n\nA key part of her wellness routine also involves drinking green juice every morning, made with fresh vegetables from her garden. \"That's a priority,\" she said.\n\nTo make the green juice, Stewart typically mixes spinach, cucumbers, parsley, celery, and mint, and sometimes adds ginger or half an orange, including the peel.\n\n\"I grow that [produce] year-round,\" she said. \"It's very important that they be grown in my own organic soil, and it makes delicious juice.\"\n\nIn 2023, Stewart told Business Insider that Pilates and green juice helped her prepare for her iconic Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover.\n\n\"If you have my green juice every day, you would just feel great all the time,\" she said.\n\nStewart is one of several Hollywood stars who believe wellness comes down to sticking with what works.\n\nSpeaking to People in January, Jane Fonda said her workout routine hasn't changed much over the years either.\n\n\"I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,\" Fonda, now 88, said. \"I used to be a runner, but now I love walking. I love being outdoors in the woods, especially up and down hills.\"\n\nIn April, Helen Mirren told The Times that she still considers a 12-minute military workout developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1950s to be her go-to exercise.\n\nShe also encouraged those in their 50s and 60s to incorporate low-impact physical activities into their lives.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be joining a gym. It can be small changes like taking a short walk or practicing yoga, which I still enjoy,\" she said.",

    "description": "Linda Martindale, a boys high school coach, mental fitness expert and mom to collegiate players, says college athletes have this special ingredient.",
    "fullText": "Linda Martindale wasn’t brave, at least she didn’t think she was after she had been hired as a varsity boys basketball coach.\n\n“Once the game started, I was fine,” says Martindale, now in her sixth season leading Lincoln-Sudbury (MA), “but walking into the gym and people thinking I'm the scorekeeper or whatever, I had to sort of overcome this feeling of, ‘Do I belong in the gym?’ ”\n\nShe made the three words her mantra, and she convinced herself she was brave. You need to be as an athlete, or a coach, in today’s world of youth sports.\n\n“I have fond memories of my athletic career, but I also know there was a lot of heartache and it was very difficult,” says Martindale, who played Division II basketball at Alaska-Anchorage and in the old Pac-10 at Arizona in the late 1980s and early 1990s. “But nowadays, it's totally different. Your whole career is splashed all over social media.”\n\nMartindale’s father devoted his life to coaching baseball and football, driving her and her three siblings to be punctual and polite. He was hard on them, she says, but led with love.\n\n“If I had a bad game, the people in the stands knew and my parents knew, and that was it,” Martindale tells USA TODAY Sports. “You'd come home and your parents would say, ‘How did the game go?' You could self-report that. Easy to deal with.\n\n“My oldest son would literally get DMs from strangers that say horrible things if he missed a free throw in the clutch. The landscape is very different. And it obviously trickles down to youth.”\n\nMartindale got certified as a mental fitness coach to help ease the pressure on her three sons and one daughter (all of them have played college sports) but also other young athletes.\n\nShe works with sports teams at Division I Holy Cross and D-III Curry College, as well as individual athletes. She says there’s a secret beyond the physical component to playing sports in college.\n\nWe offer 10 ways, through consultation with Martindale, for parents to help athletes get there.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nWhen Martindale walked into the gym feeling the male eyes on her, she felt she needed an inner coach.\n\nYour coach on the court or field will tell you what to do but, Martindale says, the one in your head will kick you in the butt to help get you where you need to go.\n\nJenny Levy, who has won four national titles as North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, believes so strongly in an inner coach she likes when her players form their own mantras.\n\n“Confidence looks good on you,” she heard her players say to each other in 2013, the year they broke through.\n\n“A lot of coaches will say, ‘This is our saying,’ ” Levy told Martindale on Martindale’s ‘Game Changers’ podcast. “And I think that’s fine – to each his own – but I actually let our team organically come up with their own little things. This is the team having a good time together.”\n\nThe inner voice tells you it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, only what you do.\n\nTo come up with your own mantra, Martindale says, ask yourself why you play a sport? Look for performance cues to grind that thought into you.\n\n“It's not fun to lose, but it's still really fun to compete and to play,” Martindale says. “OK, good, let's start with that. So at least you can say it's not fun to lose, but it's really fun to prepare for the game. We've now established that the majority of the time is fun. Now we can get through the parts that aren't fun.”\n\nWas that ‘fun’? How Coco Gauff’s tough US Open embodies what the word means\n\nKids respond to the truth. We don’t need to always sugarcoat it.\n\nInstead of saying, “It’s not so hard,” acknowledge that something is.\n\nMaybe you’re afraid that you might lose or you’re going to make a fool of yourself in front of everybody.\n\n“I'm happy that you can articulate a fear,” Martindale might tell an athlete. “Now, let's squash it. What are you really afraid of? Is it really embarrassing to lose, or is it embarrassing not to play at all?\n\n“It would be embarrassing if you threw yourself on the floor and screamed and cried in the middle of the game. But nobody thinks it's embarrassing that you sat on the bench, cheered on your team, and then fought another day to try to get some minutes.”\n\nA current role doesn’t mean an ultimate role. Martindale goes back to Tom Brady.\n\nHe was once buried deep on Michigan’s depth chart. But he focused on nailing reps he got in practice. He was at game speed when he found himself starting.\n\n“As parents, we say, ‘I don't think you should have to be the backup quarterback,' \" Martindale says. “ 'I think you should be the quarterback.’ This is not helping. What you need to do is crush being the backup. And then your time comes and you're ready instead of spending so much time worrying that you don't have the role that you want (and) you're not ready for it.”\n\nAnother of her podcast guests, Luke Avdalovic, a former walk-on basketball player at Northern Arizona University, told her: “I had a teammate named JoJo Anderson and he told me, ‘If you want to find a role into this team, find one thing that you’re really good at. Make sure you’re head and shoulders better than every single other person on the team. Then they can’t take you off the floor.’ ”\n\nAvdalovic became a top sharpshooter who rose to the NBA G-League.\n\nAvdalovic has shot so much over the years he feels he’s never really in a slump. Some days he shoots better than others, but that is just the law of averages.\n\n“You can't be a pitcher if you can't pitch poorly,” Martindale says. “You can't be a shooter if you can't miss. It's just not possible (to) be perfect. So what do you do when you're imperfect?”\n\nThe next time your son or daughter has a bad game, ask them, “Did you compete hard?”\n\nYou don’t want them to lose or fail but they need to know how to do both. As parents, and as coaches, our best support can come out of struggles.\n\nYou know the term if you’re a baseball fan. Suddenly, Steve Sax or Chuck Knoblauch can’t make a routine throw from second to first base, or Rick Ankiel can’t throw a strike.\n\n“Yips is not a real thing,” Martindale says.\n\nStruggles come alive, she says, when we say them out loud. Instead, if you’re a parent or a coach, tell your athlete: “I really believe in you. Just keep throwing, you'll get it back, you'll find a rhythm.”\n\nWhen kids feel deep-rooted support, they have more confidence in themselves.\n\nMartindale says today’s world for young athletes is like taking the SATs while your score is being put on a scoreboard.\n\nSometimes, it seems, we expect our kids to be good at everything. Martindale asks the ones with whom she works, “What class are you good at?”\n\nShe doesn’t necessarily mean classes in which they have an “A,” but the ones they enjoy most.\n\nSometimes it takes looking at things through a less critical lens. We have an “A” in science, but we enjoy the challenge of English Lit, in which we have a B-, which energizes us to try and bring up the grade.\n\nEugene Glisky, Martindale’s father, had his ashes buried on the field where he coached near Toronto. She suspects he changed the lives of many young men.\n\nBut she stops short of calling a team a family.\n\n“When a coach says to a parent, ‘I'm gonna treat your son or daughter like my own,' I want to say, ‘No, thank you. I don't need you to treat my son like he’s your own,’ ” Martindale says. “He has a great father. What I really want you to do is treat him like a player and a human being.\n\n“It's a team, which is amazing and I love my kid being part of a team. But it's not a family. Why? Because what happens when your family cuts you?”\n\nThere are times when we need to be Coach, and times when we need to be Mom or Dad. Martindale had to be Coach when Judson, her oldest who now plays basketball for Manchester Basketball Club in the United Kingdom, came out of a game when he was younger and looked at her like, “Why are you pulling me?\n\nHe threw his water bottle, and she turned and said: \"You can take your sneakers off. You're done.\"\n\nThe same coach, though, drove him home from a different game, criticizing him for what he didn’t do while failing to realize he was sick.\n\n\"So many examples of total failure by me,\" she says. \"What kind of mother would be talking to their kid about some offensive set when clearly they needed a mother?\"\n\nLevy, North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, does parent Zoom calls. Before the first one, she asked her players what they wanted her to tell them.\n\n“They said, ‘We don’t want to talk about the game at the tailgate after,’ ” Levy told Martindale. “ ‘We don’t want any parent to have this sad conversation after the wins because their kid didn’t play. We want the parents to sit together. We want them to be positive on the sideline.’ ”\n\nLevy says the players gave her a Letterman top 10 of parent no-no’s, which she shared on the Zoom.\n\n“I think they were pretty shocked,” says Levy, who coaches her daughter, Kate, on the team. “Our kids were like, ‘Last year was not OK. This is what we want and this is what we need this year.’\n\n“And then if we saw it, I had permission from our players to call the parent and say, ‘Hey, you’re at the tailgate and your behavior was below the line for our program.’\n\n“What if I acted like that as a parent? What if I did that in the middle of a tailgate?”\n\nLevy’s point: A kid could be completely happy but if the parent is unhappy with their role, then the kid’s unhappy. And if the parent isn’t feeling like their kid is getting a fair shake, or they’re being really negative toward coaches or teammates, the kid internalizes the feeling.\n\n“Your influence is not neutral, parents,” Levy says.\n\nDuring a clip Martindale shared of her speaking to athletes, she says, “There has to be wins in there. Otherwise, you can't go an entire season and be like, ‘If we don't win a game, this whole season is a waste.’ ”\n\nShe is not necessarily talking about checks in the “W” column as much as what we perceive as personal wins. Maybe you tell a teammate you loved the way he blocked a punt or moved into position on defense. If we don’t have wins, even within losses, you don’t learn how to win.\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nMartindale believes there are five pillars of mental fitness: 1. Staying in the moment; 2. Controlling the controllables; 3. Seeing mistakes as opportunities; 4. Not judging yourself (or others) too harshly and 5. Comparison (positively).\n\nShe says she was once a failure at all of them. Has she since learned a special ingredient we need to have to play college sports?\n\nMartindale thinks Angela Duckworth, director of the Penn-Wharton Behavior Change for Good Initiative, said it best.\n\n“It’s grit,” Martindale has said. “I'm obsessed with grit, because we know it's a single defining characteristic of successful people.\n\n“Can you get up after you get knocked down? The athletes who are successful at every level of college, I think, have this kind of dog mentality that is about grit. And of course, you have to be skilled and you have to be athletic but when we really look at who performs best when it counts, it's people who have failed. Over and over and over. And then now they succeed.”\n\nWe can’t beat our kids up over mistakes. Let them hear the voice in their head that gives them the grace to move forward from them.\n\nThen, as Martindale says: “Watch them fail and then watch what they do after they fail.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "title": "How to Use 'Progressive Overload' to Get Stronger",
    "description": "You can't just stick with the same workout forever.",
    "fullText": "As you get stronger, you become able to lift heavier and heavier weights. That's the idea at the heart of an often-misunderstood fitness concept: progressive overload. Unfortuantely, there are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about this principle, so here's how to use it to plan your own workouts or judge whether a program you're following will keep you on track.\n\nProgressive overload is the increase, over time, in the amount of work or stress you ask your body to handle. The term is used two different ways: as a principle of how the human body works, and as a description of how a workout program changes over time. If you want to know how to \"do progressive overload,\" you're thinking of the second one—how to design a workout program.\n\nThe simplest way to implement this is to just do a little more each time you're in the gym. More weight, or more reps, or making the workout harder in some other way. You can still take some easier \"deload\" workouts (or weeks) from time to time, but over the long term you want to see a trend of the workouts getting harder. They won't necessarily feel harder, because you'll be getting stronger. It's more like the workouts are keeping up with you.\n\nIn other words, progressive overload is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. As you get stronger, your workouts need to get harder to keep up. But in a sense you are also becoming stronger because you're challenging yourself with harder workouts.\n\nIf you’re bummed out by the idea of working harder and harder forever, don’t panic. You’ll work harder in absolute terms—by lifting heavier weights, let’s say—but the challenge stays about the same in relative terms. Your workouts will fall into an effort level you might call “hard, but doable,” and you’ll notice progress because your numbers are going up. (A similar approach applies to endurance sports. As cyclist Greg Lemond reportedly said: “It never gets any easier, you just go faster.”)\n\nWhen I started lifting weights many years ago, 65 pounds was a decently challenging bench press for me. I remember being proud of myself for being able to squeeze out a rep or two at 85 pounds. Now, if I’m going to do a bench workout, I don’t even bother loading those amounts onto the bar. My warmup sets start at 95 pounds, and a heavy single might be around 135. That 135 feels just as hard as 85 used to, but it’s undeniably more weight.\n\nHow did I make that progress? Well, I kept lifting the weights that felt heavy for me. Over time, the same weights that used to be challenging started to feel easy, and I needed to add more and more weight to the bar to get something that actually felt heavy. (I have a guide here to figuring out whether you’re lifting “heavy.”)\n\nMost of the time, I either followed a program that told me how many pounds to lift, increasing that amount slowly over time, or one that told me what effort level to lift at (a concept called RPE), which allowed me to choose an appropriate weight each day. Following a program will usually net you better progress than just winging it, but as long as you’re using the overload principle and the progression principle, you will get stronger.\n\nHere are some examples of workout routines that use progressive overload:\n\nDouble progression. Let's say you're aiming for three sets of eight to 12 reps of dumbbell shoulder press. You choose a weight that you can handle for 3 sets of 8 reps. The next time you do shoulder press, try to add at least one rep. If you can't, that's fine—just do your three sets of eight. One day maybe you'll get 10 reps on the first set, then only eight on the next two. Another time maybe you get 12, 10, and eight. After a few weeks you manage three full sets of 12. That means it's time to increase the weight! The next time you do the exercise, you'll use a heavier set of dumbbells and start again at three sets of eight. It's called \"double\" progression because first you increase the reps, and then you increase the weight.\n\nLinear progression. This is a common progression for barbell exercises for beginners. You do the same number of reps every time (say, five sets of five reps) but add a small amount of weight every workout. Often the program will have instructions for what to do if you can't complete the five sets of five reps at the new weight. These workouts aren't usually realistic for experienced lifters, since you can't keep increasing the weight forever, but they're great for people who are learning an exercise for the first time or returning to the gym after a break.\n\nSet progression. This may be used along with double progression, or may be its own thing. You start with just a few sets of an exercise per workout, say two or three, and then add a set each week. Once you're doing, say, five sets, you'll start over with heavier weight. If you're using it with double progression, you'll increase sets, and then reps, and then weight.\n\nDensity progression. This is commonly used in timed sets, like Crossfit WODs (\"workout of the day\") or for accessory lifts. Set a timer for several minutes and do as many reps as possible in the given time, resting as needed. The next time you do the workout, try to do more reps in the same amount of time. Once you can do the lifts with little to no rest, you'll either add weight or find another way to make the exercises harder (for example, doing dips instead of pushups).\n\nAs you can see, weight isn't the only variable that progresses. You can increase reps, or sets, or increase the amount of work you do in a given time by decreasing rest. You can increase the difficulty by choosing a harder exercise (like progressing from dips to pushups). As long as things get harder over time, you're doing progressive overload.\n\nAdding weight is part of most progressive overload schemes, but you don’t have to add weight to the bar literally every time you lift. There’s a wide range of weights and rep ranges that can be effective for building strength and muscle. For example, if I did a bench workout today, I might do sets of 10 at 100 pounds, or sets of five at 120, or some heavy singles at 140, or any combination of these. If I’m really tired or stressed, I might decide to do the sets of 10 at just 90 pounds. If I’m feeling great, I might be able to do them at 105. This is what I mean by a wide range: All of these are hard enough work to spur my muscles to adapt and get stronger. (There are reasons you might choose one of these workouts over the others, but we don’t need to get into those details at the moment.)\n\nWhat wouldn’t be progressive overload? Well, if I did sets of 10 with just the bar, that wouldn’t help me get stronger. If I had a mini barbell set, and it maxed out at 85 pounds, my strength would stagnate once I got to the point where 85 pounds isn’t a challenging weight anymore.\n\nEven as your strength improves, you don’t have to do more every single workout, as long as you’re getting stronger in the long term, and your workouts are still in the range that is challenging to you.\n\nSo let’s say you’re doing bicep curls with a 10-pound dumbbell. You can do eight or 10 reps with it. Perfect. But the only way to add weight, at your gym, might be to pick up a 15-pound dumbbell. If that weight is too heavy for you, that’s okay. Keep working with the 10-pounder, and in time you’ll be ready for the 15.\n\nWhile you’re probably itching to lift heavier weights, weight on the bar is not the only way to progress. Sometimes you can’t add weight because of equipment issues, or just because your strength is improving slowly. (Even if your beginner gains were meteoric, everybody’s progress slows down at some point.)\n\nBut if you’re smart, you probably don’t want to only get better at one specific thing. A lot of beginners start off doing squat, bench, and deadlift in sets of five reps, and trying to add weight each workout. But you’ll be a more well-rounded lifter if you also know how to lift heavy singles and sets of 10 or 15. Depending on your goals you might consider front squats in addition to back squats, and reverse hypers or kettlebell swings in addition to deadlifts. There are ways to improve at all of these things, and it’s normal for a lifter to be simultaneously increasing their reps in accessory lifts, increasing their weight on the bar for heavy singles, and increasing the amount of time they spend on conditioning workouts.\n\nNot every workout or routine will have progressive overload built in. For example, if you have a favorite workout that you do every day, but you never make it any harder (say, it's always three sets of ten pushups), you won't make progress over time. That's OK if you enjoy the workout for another reason, like if you're just trying to get the mental health benefits of a little exercise boost in the morning. But if you want to get better at pushups, you need to find a way to do more of them over time, or make them harder in some way (like elevating your feet, or doing them with a backpack on).\n\nWorkouts with progressive overload tend to be personalized to you. If the workout tells you exactly what to do, down to the exact weight of dumbbell to pick up, it's not giving you room to choose the weight that matches your current strength level. The 12-3-30 treadmill workout, for example, is the same for everyone every time. If it's one-size-fits-all, there's no way to progress.\n\nThat said, some workouts have a sneaky progression built in. If you jog for 30 minutes each day, chances are you'll get a little faster over time even if you don't realize it, and then you're doing more work within the same amount of time. Or if you do \"three sets of 10\" of an exercise, but each day you pick up whatever dumbbells feel appropriate for that level, you'll probably end up using heavier ones over time. Just make sure you don't get stuck doing the exact same thing month in and month out.\n\nOne last thing, now that we’ve discussed what progressive overload looks like. It’s important to remember that progression happens in the long term. Some competitive lifters might not test their one-rep max outside of competition, which means they’ll only find out once or twice a year how much their deadlift has gone up. That doesn’t mean they haven’t progressed in the meantime. If they’re doing an effective program, consistently challenging themselves, they’re still working.\n\nPlateaus are a fact of life when you’re a lifter. Sometimes it takes a while to get stronger. Sometimes you need to work on your technique to be able to express your newfound strength. Sometimes factors like stress or weight loss or changes in your training can make you weaker in the short term, but if you keep training in a way that challenges you, you’ll set new PRs soon enough.",
