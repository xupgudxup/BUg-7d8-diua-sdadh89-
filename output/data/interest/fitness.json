    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Manchester City at the City Ground (kick-off 12:30 GMT).\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\nOla Aina is \"progressing well\" in his recovery from a hamstring injury but is still rebuilding his fitness. He played for the B team on Monday night and came through the match \"fine and injury-free\". It is \"another step forward\" for the defender.\n\nOn the lack of intensity and urgency shown in the defeat to Fulham, Dyche said: \"You have to park these things pretty quickly. We did well overall, we weren't a million miles off. It wasn't the intensity we showed in the Tottenham game or out in Utrecht though.\"\n\nHe added: \"The game was a bit flat in general. Our fans were terrific, they were trying to get the team going, as was I. Sometimes the hardest thing is when everyone is having a bit of a down day.\"\n\nIt is \"unlikely\" that he will be weighing his players, like Pep Guardiola, before the Manchester City game. He joked: \"Is he weighing himself, do you think? One rule for one - come on, Pep!\"\n\nHe explained his philosophy around the festive period: \"I just look for my players to have a bit of common sense. I don't mind them having a Christmas dinner, why not?\" He believes \"psychology is important as anything with athletes\" and Christmas Day is \"a big part\" of life.\n\nFitness is \"very important\" but he isn't \"obsessed over weights\". He will \"encourage\" his players to \"enjoy\" the festivities, especially because they don't play until 27 December.\n\nOn opposition manager Guardiola, Dyche said: \"It is fantastic what he has achieved, there's no two ways about it. Only Sir Alex Ferguson probably tops him. He has done massive things for himself, his players and football in general.\"\n\nThe Reds will be hoping Manchester City are \"having a quiet day\" when they visit the City Ground. However, Forest will still need to play \"very well\" because they are facing a team who are \"always prepared\".\n\nDyche added: \"It's unlikely we are going to dominate the ball, so we have to be defensively sound and do all the hard yards.\"\n\nNottingham Forest's Premier League win-loss-win-loss-win-loss form \"will do\" this season, \"if it keeps going\". He explained: \"If you do the stats, if that carried on for the whole season then it would equal a pretty good situation.\"\n\nHowever, the biggest thing for Dyche is the team \"finding consistency\" - whether that be in terms of their \"training schedule or performances\" - but he recognises that will take time.\n\nHe is predicting a \"slow\" January transfer window because of the club's investment in the summer. On the other hand, he added: \"The club have shown that if players become available at the right times, they can make things happen - so you never know.\"\n\nFollow all of Tuesday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news",

    "description": "The \"future\" of fitness just can't beat more affordable solutions.",
    "fullText": "I've been getting relentless Instagram ads for AI-powered home gyms lately. You've probably seen them, too—sleek wall-mounted screens with impossibly toned instructors, testimonials promising \"the future of fitness,\" and before-and-after transformations that make it all look effortless.\n\nThe smart home gym equipment market is booming. According to Business Wire, the industry was valued at $3.2 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $4 billion by 2030. The numbers show plenty of people are investing in fitness technology that offers personalized, convenient, and effective home workouts. Fitness is yet another way to feed the AI beast, transforming boring old equipment into highly sophisticated systems capable of delivering real-time feedback, tracking performance, and adjusting workouts to each user's needs. It all sounds impressive—revolutionary, even. But here's the thing about fitness trends: It takes a lot more than the latest technology to make them stick.\n\nAfter months of watching these ads follow me around the internet, I got curious enough to actually dig into what these things are and whether they're worth the hype, and if the math really adds up for most people.\n\nWhatever your fitness goal is, the way to get it done is going to be time-tested and probably not too glamorous. Look at Tae Bo, Zumba, shake weights, even the world of Crossfit—most fitness fads don't have staying power once the novelty wears off.\n\nSure, exercise science evolves, but not nearly as fast as whatever trendy gadget cycles through the cultural zeitgeist. In this way, we see “fitness” get reduced to a consumer product—something to be purchased, used briefly, and then tossed aside when something shinier comes along. In 2025, spin classes are out, while Pilates and strength training are in, and that Bowflex is probably collecting dust in your mom’s basement.\n\nIn fact, in 2024 both Bowflex and American Home Fitness, two companies that bet big on the home fitness boom, filed for bankruptcy. In more recent history, Peloton once seemed unstoppable. Now, Peloton's revenue declined 2.8% in 2024 to $2.71 billion, marking its third consecutive year of declining revenue. What was once a cultural phenomenon now struggles to retain members and justify its premium pricing.\n\nFor something to stick in fitness, three questions matter: Is it affordable? Does it work? Will you personally keep coming back to it?\n\nAI home gyms might work, and you might keep coming back, but that first question is where things get complicated.\n\nAI home gyms are digital fitness systems that combine hardware with software to create a personalized workout experience at home. The most well-known is probably Tonal, but there's also Tempo, Speediance, Amp, and others.\n\nHere's how they typically work: Tonal, for instance, is a wall-mounted unit about the size of a large TV that uses electromagnetic resistance instead of traditional weights. You pull cables attached to adjustable arms, and the system can provide up to 200 pounds of resistance digitally. Built-in cameras and sensors track your movements, and the AI adjusts the weight in real-time based on your form and performance. A screen displays instructors leading classes, tracks your reps and sets, and the system learns your strength patterns over time to suggest when you should increase weight or modify exercises.\n\nOther systems work differently—Tempo uses free weights with 3D sensors that watch your form, while some use smart cables or connected dumbbells—but the core promise is the same: sophisticated technology that monitors your workout, corrects your form, tracks your progress, and adapts to your fitness level, all from your living room.\n\nSmart home gyms do offer legitimate benefits, including compact convenience, personalization, time savings, structured workouts, and potentially better injury prevention through form monitoring. And for many, devices like Tonal, Amp, and others are here to stay. “As a professional home gym equipment tester,” says Jose Guevara of ShreddedDad, “I've seen more of these continue to pop up not only in full training stations, but also in specific equipment, like cable machines, dumbbells, and sometimes a combination of both. They'll never have the longevity of weight plates or barbells, but there is an audience for them.\"\n\nAccording to Guevera, these systems appeal to \"those people who need guidance and want a done-for-you system where they can choose on-demand workouts where they can just follow along and not have to think about what to do for their workout.”\n\nThere is an audience for these products, just as there's an audience for Peloton bikes and high-end boutique fitness studios. But to me, the relevant question isn't whether they work for some people—it's whether they're the revolutionary solution to home fitness they're marketed as, or just another expensive piece of equipment that most people will use enthusiastically for a few months before the novelty wears off.\n\nStill, another Tonal user told me that comparing these AI systems to a Bowflex machine from the 1990s is like comparing a surgical robot to using a rusty scalpel. But this analogy assumes your body is a machine where the logic of “endless innovation” holds up. A smart gym isn’t exactly a medical solution. It's an accessory, a luxury good that depends on who can afford it. I don’t think the problem with working out at home has never been that we lacked sophisticated enough technology. The problem is that working out is hard, consistency is harder, and no amount of AI can fundamentally change that human reality. There are some things you just can’t hack.\n\nThere are hefty upfront costs for these products. Take Tonal, one of the leading AI home gym systems. It's around $4,300 for the unit itself, $295+ for mandatory professional installation, plus bundled smart accessories. Then comes the recurring monthly membership fee of around $60 for full access to classes and features. All told, you're looking at roughly $5,300 in the first year, followed by $720 annually for the subscription.\n\nCompare that to traditional gym memberships. According to a 2023 report, the average monthly cost of a gym membership is $58, which works out to about $696 per year. Budget options like Planet Fitness run as low as $15 to $23 per month, or $180 to $276 annually. Even mid-tier gyms like LA Fitness typically cost $40 to 56 per month.\n\nSo, to break even on a Tonal, compared to a mid-range gym membership at $50/month:\n\nYear 1: Tonal costs $5,300. A gym membership costs $600. You're already $4,700 in the hole.\n\nYear 2: You pay $720 for Tonal's subscription. The gym still costs $600. You're now $4,820 behind.\n\nYear 3: Another $720 vs. $600. Now you're $4,940 in deficit.\n\nIt would take roughly eight years of consistent use before Tonal becomes cost-competitive with a traditional gym membership. Eight years. That's assuming the hardware doesn't malfunction, the company doesn't go under (remember, Bowflex and Peloton couldn't sustain their models), and you actually use it consistently for nearly a decade.\n\nAnd the subscription costs are real. Unlike traditional weights that work whether or not you're paying a monthly fee, many digital fitness products require a subscription as long as you want to access workouts. \"I've seen some of these companies also go out of business,\" Guevara says, \"so if that happens, you're stuck with a product that doesn't function if their software is not kept up with.\" We've watched other companies’ subscription traps effectively brick your hardware.\n\nNow, proponents will argue that you save on commute time and costs. Fair enough. But for the Tonal investment to be \"worth it\" financially, you'd need to use it at least three to four times per week for those eight years straight. If you weren’t driving to a gym you pay $50/month for, are you sure you’ll consistently use your smart gym for years and years once the novelty wears off?\n\nThere’s another unspoken cost to at-home convenience, akin to people who struggle with WFH setups: the absence of gym culture. Don’t underestimate the power of casual human interaction, personal trainers who can physically adjust your form, accountability from workout buddies, the ritual of leaving your house to exercise, or maybe even the silent camaraderie of shared suffering. If you’re like me, that separation between home and workout space is a major psychological boost.\n\nThe best exercise is the one you'll actually keep doing. If you run the numbers and a Tonal makes sense for your budget and workout habits, great. Personally, as AI creeps into every other corner of my life, I find a lot of comfort in my workouts as a rare screen-free activity.\n\nMy gripe with AI home gyms is when they’re marketed as must-have solutions, instead of what they are: luxury goods, something available only to those with disposable income and spare square footage. On a grand scale, given their current costs, AI home gyms look like a passing trend to me. And two years from now, when the next fitness innovation promises to finally solve at-home workouts, I bet someone will write this same article all over again.",

    "description": "Isak Injury Raises January Signings Questions for LiverpoolLiverpool are facing an uncomfortable period of uncertainty after concerns emerged over the fitness of Alexander Isak, with early indications...",
    "fullText": "Liverpool are facing an uncomfortable period of uncertainty after concerns emerged over the fitness of Alexander Isak, with early indications suggesting the striker could be sidelined for a significant period. While the full extent of the injury is still being assessed, the situation has already sharpened internal discussions around January signings and squad depth during a decisive phase of the season.\n\nIsak’s injury arrives at an awkward moment. Liverpool have invested heavily in attacking options over the past year, yet circumstances have shifted quickly. Injuries, suspensions and international commitments are converging, leaving the club exposed in areas that were expected to be well covered. The coming days, particularly the results of further medical examinations, will play a critical role in shaping Liverpool’s strategy for the winter transfer window.\n\nThere is a deliberate sense of caution around Isak’s condition. Liverpool are waiting for comprehensive scan results before forming a definitive prognosis, but early concern within the club suggests the issue may not be short-term. The striker was visibly distressed when leaving the pitch, and staff were immediately aware that the injury could carry broader implications beyond one match or even one month.\n\nSince his arrival, Isak’s time on Merseyside has already been disrupted by physical setbacks. Another prolonged absence would not only slow his own adaptation but also place additional strain on a forward line that is already being reshaped week by week. Liverpool’s medical team are understood to be taking a conservative approach, prioritising long-term recovery over any rushed return.\n\nLiverpool had been monitoring the January market even before Isak’s injury, but the urgency has increased according to the Telegraph. Recruitment staff are actively reviewing options who could provide immediate cover across the front line, particularly players capable of operating in multiple attacking roles. Flexibility is seen as essential, given the unpredictable nature of injuries and suspensions during the second half of the campaign.\n\nWhile no final decision has been taken, the possibility of January signings is firmly on the table. Liverpool are unlikely to make reactive or inflated deals, yet there is an acceptance internally that the squad may require reinforcement to sustain momentum domestically and in Europe. Financially, the club retains scope to act, having planned prudently despite substantial recent expenditure.\n\nThe preference would be for a player who can contribute straight away rather than a long-term project. Availability, fitness history and adaptability to the Premier League are all being weighed carefully as part of the assessment process.\n\nIsak’s injury is not an isolated issue. Liverpool are managing a growing list of absentees, with several players either unavailable or facing enforced breaks due to suspension and international duty. This congestion is placing additional responsibility on a relatively small group of attackers, increasing the risk of fatigue and further injuries.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, the coaching staff are already exploring short-term adjustments to manage workloads and maintain attacking output. However, internal belief remains that structural solutions, rather than temporary fixes, may be required if Isak is ruled out for an extended period.\n\nThe January schedule offers little margin for error. League fixtures, cup commitments and the broader demands of a title challenge mean Liverpool cannot afford a prolonged dip in attacking efficiency.\n\nMuch depends on the clarity that emerges from Isak’s medical assessment. A minor setback would likely see Liverpool hold their position and trust the depth already in place. A more serious diagnosis, however, would almost certainly accelerate plans around January signings.\n\nLiverpool’s approach remains calm and methodical. There is no appetite for panic, but there is also a recognition that inaction carries its own risks. The balance between patience and decisiveness will define their winter strategy, with Isak’s injury acting as the central variable.\n\nFor now, the club wait. Yet behind the scenes, preparations are being made to ensure Liverpool are not left short-handed should the worst-case scenario materialise.",

    "description": "Outside the gym, Martha Stewart says she tries to stay active by walking, gardening, and working.",
    "fullText": "Fitness trends come and go, but at 84, Martha Stewart remains loyal to the workout routine she has followed for years.\n\n\"I've worked out ever since I can remember,\" Stewart told Women's Health in an interview published on Friday. Even outside the gym, she makes it a point to stay active.\n\n\"I walk a whole lot. I garden a whole lot. I go to work in New York [City] pretty much five days a week or do my traveling,\" she said.\n\nStewart said her go-to exercises haven't changed much.\n\n\"I might not be as energetic as I used to be, but I'm pretty good,\" she said. \"The amount of weights and things that I use are pretty much the same as they've always been, so I'm strong. I'm very strong.\"\n\nAt 6:30 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Stewart heads into a mat and reformer Pilates session with her instructor. \"I do a very intense program, and it's nonstop for 45 minutes,\" she said.\n\nSince she regularly commutes into the city by car, Stewart says Pilates helps her stay loose and flexible. \"It also is very good for strengthening one's bones, keeping one limber, working with aches and pains, stretching out,\" she said.\n\nShe practices yoga too, though less frequently than Pilates.\n\n\"Pilates reminds me a little bit of yoga,\" she said. \"I end with yoga stretches on blocks at Pilates.\"\n\nHer Tuesday and Thursday mornings are reserved for 45 minutes of strength training with her trainer, using mostly dumbbells and machines.\n\nDespite her busy schedule, Stewart remains committed to her fitness. \"Even when I get home late at night, I still go and do my workout,\" she added.\n\nA key part of her wellness routine also involves drinking green juice every morning, made with fresh vegetables from her garden. \"That's a priority,\" she said.\n\nTo make the green juice, Stewart typically mixes spinach, cucumbers, parsley, celery, and mint, and sometimes adds ginger or half an orange, including the peel.\n\n\"I grow that [produce] year-round,\" she said. \"It's very important that they be grown in my own organic soil, and it makes delicious juice.\"\n\nIn 2023, Stewart told Business Insider that Pilates and green juice helped her prepare for her iconic Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover.\n\n\"If you have my green juice every day, you would just feel great all the time,\" she said.\n\nStewart is one of several Hollywood stars who believe wellness comes down to sticking with what works.\n\nSpeaking to People in January, Jane Fonda said her workout routine hasn't changed much over the years either.\n\n\"I essentially do everything I used to do, just slower,\" Fonda, now 88, said. \"I used to be a runner, but now I love walking. I love being outdoors in the woods, especially up and down hills.\"\n\nIn April, Helen Mirren told The Times that she still considers a 12-minute military workout developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1950s to be her go-to exercise.\n\nShe also encouraged those in their 50s and 60s to incorporate low-impact physical activities into their lives.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be joining a gym. It can be small changes like taking a short walk or practicing yoga, which I still enjoy,\" she said.",

    "description": "Linda Martindale, a boys high school coach, mental fitness expert and mom to collegiate players, says college athletes have this special ingredient.",
    "fullText": "Linda Martindale wasn’t brave, at least she didn’t think she was after she had been hired as a varsity boys basketball coach.\n\n“Once the game started, I was fine,” says Martindale, now in her sixth season leading Lincoln-Sudbury (MA), “but walking into the gym and people thinking I'm the scorekeeper or whatever, I had to sort of overcome this feeling of, ‘Do I belong in the gym?’ ”\n\nShe made the three words her mantra, and she convinced herself she was brave. You need to be as an athlete, or a coach, in today’s world of youth sports.\n\n“I have fond memories of my athletic career, but I also know there was a lot of heartache and it was very difficult,” says Martindale, who played Division II basketball at Alaska-Anchorage and in the old Pac-10 at Arizona in the late 1980s and early 1990s. “But nowadays, it's totally different. Your whole career is splashed all over social media.”\n\nMartindale’s father devoted his life to coaching baseball and football, driving her and her three siblings to be punctual and polite. He was hard on them, she says, but led with love.\n\n“If I had a bad game, the people in the stands knew and my parents knew, and that was it,” Martindale tells USA TODAY Sports. “You'd come home and your parents would say, ‘How did the game go?' You could self-report that. Easy to deal with.\n\n“My oldest son would literally get DMs from strangers that say horrible things if he missed a free throw in the clutch. The landscape is very different. And it obviously trickles down to youth.”\n\nMartindale got certified as a mental fitness coach to help ease the pressure on her three sons and one daughter (all of them have played college sports) but also other young athletes.\n\nShe works with sports teams at Division I Holy Cross and D-III Curry College, as well as individual athletes. She says there’s a secret beyond the physical component to playing sports in college.\n\nWe offer 10 ways, through consultation with Martindale, for parents to help athletes get there.\n\nYOUTH SPORTS SURVIVAL GUIDE: Pre-order Coach Steve's upcoming book for young athletes and their parents\n\nWhen Martindale walked into the gym feeling the male eyes on her, she felt she needed an inner coach.\n\nYour coach on the court or field will tell you what to do but, Martindale says, the one in your head will kick you in the butt to help get you where you need to go.\n\nJenny Levy, who has won four national titles as North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, believes so strongly in an inner coach she likes when her players form their own mantras.\n\n“Confidence looks good on you,” she heard her players say to each other in 2013, the year they broke through.\n\n“A lot of coaches will say, ‘This is our saying,’ ” Levy told Martindale on Martindale’s ‘Game Changers’ podcast. “And I think that’s fine – to each his own – but I actually let our team organically come up with their own little things. This is the team having a good time together.”\n\nThe inner voice tells you it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, only what you do.\n\nTo come up with your own mantra, Martindale says, ask yourself why you play a sport? Look for performance cues to grind that thought into you.\n\n“It's not fun to lose, but it's still really fun to compete and to play,” Martindale says. “OK, good, let's start with that. So at least you can say it's not fun to lose, but it's really fun to prepare for the game. We've now established that the majority of the time is fun. Now we can get through the parts that aren't fun.”\n\nWas that ‘fun’? How Coco Gauff’s tough US Open embodies what the word means\n\nKids respond to the truth. We don’t need to always sugarcoat it.\n\nInstead of saying, “It’s not so hard,” acknowledge that something is.\n\nMaybe you’re afraid that you might lose or you’re going to make a fool of yourself in front of everybody.\n\n“I'm happy that you can articulate a fear,” Martindale might tell an athlete. “Now, let's squash it. What are you really afraid of? Is it really embarrassing to lose, or is it embarrassing not to play at all?\n\n“It would be embarrassing if you threw yourself on the floor and screamed and cried in the middle of the game. But nobody thinks it's embarrassing that you sat on the bench, cheered on your team, and then fought another day to try to get some minutes.”\n\nA current role doesn’t mean an ultimate role. Martindale goes back to Tom Brady.\n\nHe was once buried deep on Michigan’s depth chart. But he focused on nailing reps he got in practice. He was at game speed when he found himself starting.\n\n“As parents, we say, ‘I don't think you should have to be the backup quarterback,' \" Martindale says. “ 'I think you should be the quarterback.’ This is not helping. What you need to do is crush being the backup. And then your time comes and you're ready instead of spending so much time worrying that you don't have the role that you want (and) you're not ready for it.”\n\nAnother of her podcast guests, Luke Avdalovic, a former walk-on basketball player at Northern Arizona University, told her: “I had a teammate named JoJo Anderson and he told me, ‘If you want to find a role into this team, find one thing that you’re really good at. Make sure you’re head and shoulders better than every single other person on the team. Then they can’t take you off the floor.’ ”\n\nAvdalovic became a top sharpshooter who rose to the NBA G-League.\n\nAvdalovic has shot so much over the years he feels he’s never really in a slump. Some days he shoots better than others, but that is just the law of averages.\n\n“You can't be a pitcher if you can't pitch poorly,” Martindale says. “You can't be a shooter if you can't miss. It's just not possible (to) be perfect. So what do you do when you're imperfect?”\n\nThe next time your son or daughter has a bad game, ask them, “Did you compete hard?”\n\nYou don’t want them to lose or fail but they need to know how to do both. As parents, and as coaches, our best support can come out of struggles.\n\nYou know the term if you’re a baseball fan. Suddenly, Steve Sax or Chuck Knoblauch can’t make a routine throw from second to first base, or Rick Ankiel can’t throw a strike.\n\n“Yips is not a real thing,” Martindale says.\n\nStruggles come alive, she says, when we say them out loud. Instead, if you’re a parent or a coach, tell your athlete: “I really believe in you. Just keep throwing, you'll get it back, you'll find a rhythm.”\n\nWhen kids feel deep-rooted support, they have more confidence in themselves.\n\nMartindale says today’s world for young athletes is like taking the SATs while your score is being put on a scoreboard.\n\nSometimes, it seems, we expect our kids to be good at everything. Martindale asks the ones with whom she works, “What class are you good at?”\n\nShe doesn’t necessarily mean classes in which they have an “A,” but the ones they enjoy most.\n\nSometimes it takes looking at things through a less critical lens. We have an “A” in science, but we enjoy the challenge of English Lit, in which we have a B-, which energizes us to try and bring up the grade.\n\nEugene Glisky, Martindale’s father, had his ashes buried on the field where he coached near Toronto. She suspects he changed the lives of many young men.\n\nBut she stops short of calling a team a family.\n\n“When a coach says to a parent, ‘I'm gonna treat your son or daughter like my own,' I want to say, ‘No, thank you. I don't need you to treat my son like he’s your own,’ ” Martindale says. “He has a great father. What I really want you to do is treat him like a player and a human being.\n\n“It's a team, which is amazing and I love my kid being part of a team. But it's not a family. Why? Because what happens when your family cuts you?”\n\nThere are times when we need to be Coach, and times when we need to be Mom or Dad. Martindale had to be Coach when Judson, her oldest who now plays basketball for Manchester Basketball Club in the United Kingdom, came out of a game when he was younger and looked at her like, “Why are you pulling me?\n\nHe threw his water bottle, and she turned and said: \"You can take your sneakers off. You're done.\"\n\nThe same coach, though, drove him home from a different game, criticizing him for what he didn’t do while failing to realize he was sick.\n\n\"So many examples of total failure by me,\" she says. \"What kind of mother would be talking to their kid about some offensive set when clearly they needed a mother?\"\n\nLevy, North Carolina’s women’s lacrosse coach, does parent Zoom calls. Before the first one, she asked her players what they wanted her to tell them.\n\n“They said, ‘We don’t want to talk about the game at the tailgate after,’ ” Levy told Martindale. “ ‘We don’t want any parent to have this sad conversation after the wins because their kid didn’t play. We want the parents to sit together. We want them to be positive on the sideline.’ ”\n\nLevy says the players gave her a Letterman top 10 of parent no-no’s, which she shared on the Zoom.\n\n“I think they were pretty shocked,” says Levy, who coaches her daughter, Kate, on the team. “Our kids were like, ‘Last year was not OK. This is what we want and this is what we need this year.’\n\n“And then if we saw it, I had permission from our players to call the parent and say, ‘Hey, you’re at the tailgate and your behavior was below the line for our program.’\n\n“What if I acted like that as a parent? What if I did that in the middle of a tailgate?”\n\nLevy’s point: A kid could be completely happy but if the parent is unhappy with their role, then the kid’s unhappy. And if the parent isn’t feeling like their kid is getting a fair shake, or they’re being really negative toward coaches or teammates, the kid internalizes the feeling.\n\n“Your influence is not neutral, parents,” Levy says.\n\nDuring a clip Martindale shared of her speaking to athletes, she says, “There has to be wins in there. Otherwise, you can't go an entire season and be like, ‘If we don't win a game, this whole season is a waste.’ ”\n\nShe is not necessarily talking about checks in the “W” column as much as what we perceive as personal wins. Maybe you tell a teammate you loved the way he blocked a punt or moved into position on defense. If we don’t have wins, even within losses, you don’t learn how to win.\n\nYouth sports 'crisis': Congress addresses big business in youth sports. Can we fix it?\n\nMartindale believes there are five pillars of mental fitness: 1. Staying in the moment; 2. Controlling the controllables; 3. Seeing mistakes as opportunities; 4. Not judging yourself (or others) too harshly and 5. Comparison (positively).\n\nShe says she was once a failure at all of them. Has she since learned a special ingredient we need to have to play college sports?\n\nMartindale thinks Angela Duckworth, director of the Penn-Wharton Behavior Change for Good Initiative, said it best.\n\n“It’s grit,” Martindale has said. “I'm obsessed with grit, because we know it's a single defining characteristic of successful people.\n\n“Can you get up after you get knocked down? The athletes who are successful at every level of college, I think, have this kind of dog mentality that is about grit. And of course, you have to be skilled and you have to be athletic but when we really look at who performs best when it counts, it's people who have failed. Over and over and over. And then now they succeed.”\n\nWe can’t beat our kids up over mistakes. Let them hear the voice in their head that gives them the grace to move forward from them.\n\nThen, as Martindale says: “Watch them fail and then watch what they do after they fail.”\n\nBorelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

    "title": "How to Use 'Progressive Overload' to Get Stronger",
    "description": "You can't just stick with the same workout forever.",
    "fullText": "As you get stronger, you become able to lift heavier and heavier weights. That's the idea at the heart of an often-misunderstood fitness concept: progressive overload. Unfortuantely, there are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about this principle, so here's how to use it to plan your own workouts or judge whether a program you're following will keep you on track.\n\nProgressive overload is the increase, over time, in the amount of work or stress you ask your body to handle. The term is used two different ways: as a principle of how the human body works, and as a description of how a workout program changes over time. If you want to know how to \"do progressive overload,\" you're thinking of the second one—how to design a workout program.\n\nThe simplest way to implement this is to just do a little more each time you're in the gym. More weight, or more reps, or making the workout harder in some other way. You can still take some easier \"deload\" workouts (or weeks) from time to time, but over the long term you want to see a trend of the workouts getting harder. They won't necessarily feel harder, because you'll be getting stronger. It's more like the workouts are keeping up with you.\n\nIn other words, progressive overload is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. As you get stronger, your workouts need to get harder to keep up. But in a sense you are also becoming stronger because you're challenging yourself with harder workouts.\n\nIf you’re bummed out by the idea of working harder and harder forever, don’t panic. You’ll work harder in absolute terms—by lifting heavier weights, let’s say—but the challenge stays about the same in relative terms. Your workouts will fall into an effort level you might call “hard, but doable,” and you’ll notice progress because your numbers are going up. (A similar approach applies to endurance sports. As cyclist Greg Lemond reportedly said: “It never gets any easier, you just go faster.”)\n\nWhen I started lifting weights many years ago, 65 pounds was a decently challenging bench press for me. I remember being proud of myself for being able to squeeze out a rep or two at 85 pounds. Now, if I’m going to do a bench workout, I don’t even bother loading those amounts onto the bar. My warmup sets start at 95 pounds, and a heavy single might be around 135. That 135 feels just as hard as 85 used to, but it’s undeniably more weight.\n\nHow did I make that progress? Well, I kept lifting the weights that felt heavy for me. Over time, the same weights that used to be challenging started to feel easy, and I needed to add more and more weight to the bar to get something that actually felt heavy. (I have a guide here to figuring out whether you’re lifting “heavy.”)\n\nMost of the time, I either followed a program that told me how many pounds to lift, increasing that amount slowly over time, or one that told me what effort level to lift at (a concept called RPE), which allowed me to choose an appropriate weight each day. Following a program will usually net you better progress than just winging it, but as long as you’re using the overload principle and the progression principle, you will get stronger.\n\nHere are some examples of workout routines that use progressive overload:\n\nDouble progression. Let's say you're aiming for three sets of eight to 12 reps of dumbbell shoulder press. You choose a weight that you can handle for 3 sets of 8 reps. The next time you do shoulder press, try to add at least one rep. If you can't, that's fine—just do your three sets of eight. One day maybe you'll get 10 reps on the first set, then only eight on the next two. Another time maybe you get 12, 10, and eight. After a few weeks you manage three full sets of 12. That means it's time to increase the weight! The next time you do the exercise, you'll use a heavier set of dumbbells and start again at three sets of eight. It's called \"double\" progression because first you increase the reps, and then you increase the weight.\n\nLinear progression. This is a common progression for barbell exercises for beginners. You do the same number of reps every time (say, five sets of five reps) but add a small amount of weight every workout. Often the program will have instructions for what to do if you can't complete the five sets of five reps at the new weight. These workouts aren't usually realistic for experienced lifters, since you can't keep increasing the weight forever, but they're great for people who are learning an exercise for the first time or returning to the gym after a break.\n\nSet progression. This may be used along with double progression, or may be its own thing. You start with just a few sets of an exercise per workout, say two or three, and then add a set each week. Once you're doing, say, five sets, you'll start over with heavier weight. If you're using it with double progression, you'll increase sets, and then reps, and then weight.\n\nDensity progression. This is commonly used in timed sets, like Crossfit WODs (\"workout of the day\") or for accessory lifts. Set a timer for several minutes and do as many reps as possible in the given time, resting as needed. The next time you do the workout, try to do more reps in the same amount of time. Once you can do the lifts with little to no rest, you'll either add weight or find another way to make the exercises harder (for example, doing dips instead of pushups).\n\nAs you can see, weight isn't the only variable that progresses. You can increase reps, or sets, or increase the amount of work you do in a given time by decreasing rest. You can increase the difficulty by choosing a harder exercise (like progressing from dips to pushups). As long as things get harder over time, you're doing progressive overload.\n\nAdding weight is part of most progressive overload schemes, but you don’t have to add weight to the bar literally every time you lift. There’s a wide range of weights and rep ranges that can be effective for building strength and muscle. For example, if I did a bench workout today, I might do sets of 10 at 100 pounds, or sets of five at 120, or some heavy singles at 140, or any combination of these. If I’m really tired or stressed, I might decide to do the sets of 10 at just 90 pounds. If I’m feeling great, I might be able to do them at 105. This is what I mean by a wide range: All of these are hard enough work to spur my muscles to adapt and get stronger. (There are reasons you might choose one of these workouts over the others, but we don’t need to get into those details at the moment.)\n\nWhat wouldn’t be progressive overload? Well, if I did sets of 10 with just the bar, that wouldn’t help me get stronger. If I had a mini barbell set, and it maxed out at 85 pounds, my strength would stagnate once I got to the point where 85 pounds isn’t a challenging weight anymore.\n\nEven as your strength improves, you don’t have to do more every single workout, as long as you’re getting stronger in the long term, and your workouts are still in the range that is challenging to you.\n\nSo let’s say you’re doing bicep curls with a 10-pound dumbbell. You can do eight or 10 reps with it. Perfect. But the only way to add weight, at your gym, might be to pick up a 15-pound dumbbell. If that weight is too heavy for you, that’s okay. Keep working with the 10-pounder, and in time you’ll be ready for the 15.\n\nWhile you’re probably itching to lift heavier weights, weight on the bar is not the only way to progress. Sometimes you can’t add weight because of equipment issues, or just because your strength is improving slowly. (Even if your beginner gains were meteoric, everybody’s progress slows down at some point.)\n\nBut if you’re smart, you probably don’t want to only get better at one specific thing. A lot of beginners start off doing squat, bench, and deadlift in sets of five reps, and trying to add weight each workout. But you’ll be a more well-rounded lifter if you also know how to lift heavy singles and sets of 10 or 15. Depending on your goals you might consider front squats in addition to back squats, and reverse hypers or kettlebell swings in addition to deadlifts. There are ways to improve at all of these things, and it’s normal for a lifter to be simultaneously increasing their reps in accessory lifts, increasing their weight on the bar for heavy singles, and increasing the amount of time they spend on conditioning workouts.\n\nNot every workout or routine will have progressive overload built in. For example, if you have a favorite workout that you do every day, but you never make it any harder (say, it's always three sets of ten pushups), you won't make progress over time. That's OK if you enjoy the workout for another reason, like if you're just trying to get the mental health benefits of a little exercise boost in the morning. But if you want to get better at pushups, you need to find a way to do more of them over time, or make them harder in some way (like elevating your feet, or doing them with a backpack on).\n\nWorkouts with progressive overload tend to be personalized to you. If the workout tells you exactly what to do, down to the exact weight of dumbbell to pick up, it's not giving you room to choose the weight that matches your current strength level. The 12-3-30 treadmill workout, for example, is the same for everyone every time. If it's one-size-fits-all, there's no way to progress.\n\nThat said, some workouts have a sneaky progression built in. If you jog for 30 minutes each day, chances are you'll get a little faster over time even if you don't realize it, and then you're doing more work within the same amount of time. Or if you do \"three sets of 10\" of an exercise, but each day you pick up whatever dumbbells feel appropriate for that level, you'll probably end up using heavier ones over time. Just make sure you don't get stuck doing the exact same thing month in and month out.\n\nOne last thing, now that we’ve discussed what progressive overload looks like. It’s important to remember that progression happens in the long term. Some competitive lifters might not test their one-rep max outside of competition, which means they’ll only find out once or twice a year how much their deadlift has gone up. That doesn’t mean they haven’t progressed in the meantime. If they’re doing an effective program, consistently challenging themselves, they’re still working.\n\nPlateaus are a fact of life when you’re a lifter. Sometimes it takes a while to get stronger. Sometimes you need to work on your technique to be able to express your newfound strength. Sometimes factors like stress or weight loss or changes in your training can make you weaker in the short term, but if you keep training in a way that challenges you, you’ll set new PRs soon enough.",
