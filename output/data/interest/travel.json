    "title": "Thousands of travelers stranded as US strikes on Venezuela push airlines out of Caribbean airspace",
    "description": "From outbound vacationers to students returning for the new semester, the US raid on Venezuela disrupted travel across the region.",
    "fullText": "The US raid on Venezuela that netted President Nicólas Maduro and his wife on Saturday has sent surprised travelers into a mild tailspin.\n\nFlightradar24 data shows Venezuela's airspace is empty following the strikes. While US airlines haven't flown there for years, the Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday formally barred operations in Venezuelan airspace, essentially codifying an already de facto no-fly zone.\n\nBut the impact extends beyond Venezuela.\n\nAirlines are also avoiding nearby southern Caribbean airspace due to heightened security risks. Delta, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines said they canceled flights to the Caribbean on Saturday morning following the US strike on Venezuela.\n\nThe cancellations have inconvenienced many travelers, particularly students returning for the start of the new semester.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm doing right now,\" Catalina Rodriguez, a veterinary student at Ross University School of Medicine in St. Kitts and Nevis, said in a video she posted to TikTok. \"One of my flights is good, my other flight is delayed, am I supposed to change my trip?\"\n\nRodriguez, 34, later told Business Insider in a call that she is supposed to start her third semester of veterinary school on Monday. She is scheduled to fly on American Airlines at noon on Sunday, but her flight is now delayed. She said she's also been in touch with several classmates who are stuck in airports due to cancellations and delays.\n\n\"We're just waiting to see what's going to happen,\" she said. \"It's a little stressful for sure.\"\n\nAnother student, who goes by \"dani la doctorcita\" on TikTok, said in a video that her Delta flight to St. Kitts was canceled. \"All US flights have been canceled,\" she said. \"Delta won't fly even from Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that aviation risk-intelligence firm Osprey Flight Solutions — a widely used industry service that tracks safety and security hazards for airlines — recently upgraded its risk assessment for the Southern Caribbean Sea from \"moderate\" to \"high\" amid escalating tensions.\n\nThat higher-risk zone includes places like Puerto Rico, Aruba, Curaçao, the British and US Virgin Islands, Antigua & Barbuda, Saint Thomas, Grenada, Barbados, and parts of Trinidad & Tobago and Guyana. Mass disruptions to and from these destinations have left thousands stranded as airlines reassess safety risks and insurance exposure.\n\nStranded travelers have few options to depart Caribbean nations — and little help from airlines while they wait.\n\nBecause the disruptions stem from government action outside the airlines' control, carriers do not legally owe passengers compensation. That means meals, hotels, and ground transportation are not required under federal law, though airlines may offer assistance as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nOne X user who goes by Nate_F_Thurmond posted a photo of a group of stranded travelers in St. John.\n\n\"Passengers stranded in St John just learning that Caribbean Airspace is closed,\" they wrote. \"American, JetBlue, and Delta canceled flights. People are scrambling to find places to stay. Being told 3-5 days by the airlines. All this because of Venezuela??\"\n\nIn most cases, the only guaranteed option is rebooking, and travelers may struggle to find alternative accommodations while waiting for the next available flight.\n\nSome flights are still operating, but they are taking significant detours to avoid the region. American Airlines Flight 1512 from Georgetown, Guyana, to Miami on Saturday, for example, ditched its usual route east of Venezuela through the southern Caribbean and instead flew west around the area, adding roughly an hour of flight time.\n\nFor travelers who want to cancel or postpone their Caribbean holidays, most airlines — including Delta, United, American, Southwest, and JetBlue — are waiving change and cancellation fees as the situation continues. Some western Caribbean countries, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, are not included on waiver lists.\n\nUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Saturday afternoon that the FAA will lift airspace restrictions over the Caribbean and Venezuela \"when appropriate.\" His update came about 15 hours after the FAA issued an emergency notice in the region.\n\n\"Early this morning in support of the Department of War, the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public,\" Duffy wrote on X. \"When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted. Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.\"",

    "description": "The ultrawealthy are trading in some traditional markers of luxury travel in favor of privacy and seclusion.",
    "fullText": "Classic markers of luxury travel, like five-star hotels and hard-to-get dinner reservations, are no longer enough for some ultrawealthy travelers. Instead, they're increasingly seeking a subtler status symbol: privacy.\n\n\"The privacy factor is higher than it's ever been. In fact, we have some clients who are 'no more hotels,'\" Rob DelliBovi, a luxury travel planner whose clients include celebrities and high-net-worth individuals, said. \"Even the five-star hotel experience is too crowded.\"\n\nAs international travel has grown and destinations have become increasingly crowded, luxury travel planners say their clients' top priority is to get away from everyone else.\n\nThe ultrawealthy are increasingly skipping luxury hotels and turning instead to private villas, private jets, and private chefs. A trend report from Capital One Travel last month found that 86% of luxury travelers said privacy and seclusion were top considerations when choosing where to stay, and 83% said exclusivity of access.\n\n\"The true value of luxury lies in the guarantee of an exclusive experience that cannot be accessed by the general public,\" the report said.\n\nDelliBovi said this kind of travel was always popular with his celebrity clients, \"who have a problem being seen literally anywhere.\" However, since the pandemic, and especially as we head into 2026, demand has skyrocketed among his high-net-worth clients.\n\n\"Now it's some more of our investment banker types,\" he said. \"People who would rent out a penthouse at a Four Seasons are like, 'What are my private home options?' Because even walking through the Four Seasons now can be a bit of a to-do.\"\n\nSeeking out private homes and villas that meet ultrawealthy standards can be challenging. DelliBovi said his team works with international real estate experts and luxury services networks to find properties that aren't actually listed for rent.\n\n\"We have to literally source these private homes and villas from locals. We have to know somebody in-market who's in the know,\" he said, adding they are renting from owners who don't normally lease their home or apartment. When his team calls and offers $50,000 for a week, he says owners often accept.\n\nThose homes then need to be outfitted with hotel-level services and more, including daily cleaning, Michelin-trained private chefs, high-end security, and accommodations for pets. After booking the home, DelliBovi's team will set all that up separately.\n\nFor the Super Bowl last year, he said one client spent a total of around $1.35 million on a house in New Orleans for six days. The home itself cost roughly $1 million, with the rest going toward the planning fee and services.\n\nThe inaccessibility of these homes is part of their appeal. DelliBovi said that some luxury hotels feel less exclusive because they're part of large brands with loyalty programs, allowing less wealthy travelers to stay there by accumulating points.\n\n\"That mix kind of irks some people,\" he said, adding it can feel like a less luxurious experience even if the hotel itself is great.\n\nWhen his clients do opt for hotels, DelliBovi said they prioritize properties built for discretion, like the Hotel Café Royal in London or the Rosewood Villa Magna in Madrid, which has an underground garage with an elevator that takes guests directly to their suites, bypassing public spaces altogether.\n\n\"That type of thing is priceless,\" he said.\n\nNon-disclosure agreements are a standard part of travel for the ultrawealthy, whether they're staying at private homes or luxury hotels. Daria Guristrimba, founder and CEO of Globe7, an ultra-luxury travel agency, said confidentiality isn't a preference but a baseline expectation.\n\n\"The more private it is, the better,\" she said.\n\nGuristrimba said NDAs are often signed at every stage of a trip, including with staff, vendors, and hotels. Her firm even avoids storing clients' names in internal systems, instead using coded identifiers, and sometimes handling payments to hotels or other services on behalf of clients so their travel doesn't leave a financial paper trail.\n\nShe said she routinely asks hotels not to keep any record of her clients, including deleting their information from internal systems. If a hotel requires a client's last name to confirm a booking and the client doesn't want it disclosed, they simply won't stay there.\n\nBecause of the high demand for privacy, Guristrimba said more and more of her clients are choosing fully private islands, where they can ensure there will be no other members of the public — beyond employees who have signed NDAs.\n\nThanda Island in Tanzania, which can be rented by a single group, accommodates 18 guests who are exclusively served by about 35 employees. Meals are served in different locations around the island, and no outside guests are allowed. The cost is about $33,000 per night, and Guristrimba said she's had clients rent out the entire island just as a couple.\n\nTraditional upscale aesthetics and locales are now taking a back seat to the top priority of privacy and not being seen.\n\n\"It's not about marbles anymore. It's not about the Loro Piana textile walls anymore,\" she said, adding, \"They don't want anyone to know where they are going or what they are doing.\"",

    "description": "An equipment outage and flooded roadways led to significant travel disruption at San Diego Airport, affecting over 300 flights.",
    "fullText": "Thousands of people flying into or out of San Diego on New Year's Day had their travel plans disrupted after a rainstorm hit the city.\n\nData from Flightradar24 showed 40 flights headed for San Diego International Airport decided to land elsewhere on January 1.\n\nThere were enough diversions that air traffic control activated a recovery tool to help planes reach their intended destinations.\n\nAnother 53 flights into or out of the airport were canceled, plus nearly 270 were delayed, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThat meant around 40% of the flights were behind schedule.\n\nA spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration told Business Insider it slowed inbound flights \"due to poor visibility and weather conditions,\" and to perform maintenance on an instrument landing system's glide slope.\n\nA glide slope emits a radio signal that helps planes approach a runway from the correct angle and location, which is particularly useful in bad weather or at night.\n\nAn air traffic control advisory also said the disruption was due to an\"equipment outage.\"\n\nIn a post on X, the airport said the weather was causing flight delays, with some nearby roads closed due to flooding. The airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside local working hours.\n\nSan Diego is the third-busiest airport in California. It reported handling over 25 million passengers in 2024.\n\nWhile many of the diverted flights eventually made it to San Diego, it was likely a frustrating day for many travellers.\n\nJapan Airlines Flight 66 had flown about 10 hours from Tokyo to San Diego. After circling around the airport, it diverted to Los Angeles, a 30-minute flight away.\n\nJust over two hours later, the Boeing 787 took off again and completed the short flight down to San Diego.\n\nThe airline didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome Southwest Airlines passengers departing Sacramento had a two-hour flight to nowhere. Flight 3138 spent an hour circling north of Los Angeles before returning to its origin, per flight-tracking data. It later took off again and reached San Diego about five hours behind schedule.\n\nWhile most flights were able to divert elsewhere in California, around a dozen of them diverted to Phoenix.\n\nA Southwest flight from Baltimore spent about an hour circling just west of the Arizona state capital before touching down there.\n\nIt was on the ground for over three hours before continuing on to San Diego, landing roughly five hours later than planned.\n\nA Southwest spokesperson said the airline canceled about 20 flights and diverted some others that later arrived in San Diego.\n\n\"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,\" they added.\n\nTwo private jets, flying from Colorado ski resorts, didn't have to divert too far — they were the only ones able to land at McClellan-Palomar Airport in northern San Diego County, per Flightradar24.",

    "description": "The ultrawealthy are ditching the crowds in places like Florence and Mykonos and visiting these three alternative destinations instead.",
    "fullText": "Even the ultrawealthy aren't immune to the frustrations of overtourism.\n\nAs international tourism grows, many popular luxury destinations once associated with wealth and exclusivity are now packed with large crowds, long lines, and constant noise.\n\nRob DelliBovi, a luxury travel planner whose clients include celebrities and high-net-worth individuals, told Business Insider many of his clients feel crowded out of places that used to feel special. He said there's a \"continuing trend of our clients believing everything is too crowded and they need their own space.\"\n\nAs a result, wealthy travelers are deliberately seeking out destinations that others tend to overlook, or that don't yet have the infrastructure to accommodate swaths of more budget-minded travelers.\n\n\"They want to have their cake and eat it too, in terms of going to the popular places at the popular times, but enjoying peace and quiet and their own kind of experience,\" DelliBovi said.\n\nInstead of abandoning travel to dreamy but popular destinations like Italy and Japan, Dellibovi said his clients are ditching the hottest spots and gravitating toward quieter, alternative cities in countries that are grappling with overtourism.\n\n\"These secondary markets are building infrastructure to accommodate the wealthy and the cool and the rich and the famous,\" he said.\n\nHere are three secondary destinations that luxury travelers are visiting to avoid the crowds.\n\nItaly is one of the most strained countries in the world when it comes to overtourism, with cities like Venice, Rome, and Florence experiencing record numbers of tourists and mounting protests from locals.\n\n\"Italy is a disaster right now\" in terms of crowds, Dellibovi said, adding that ultrawealthy travelers who \"still want to go to Italy and eat like Italy\" are skipping Rome and Florence and heading to Puglia instead.\n\nPuglia, located in the southeastern region of Italy, is known for its whitewashed towns and clear Mediterranean coastlines, and countryside estates, making it an appealing choice for luxury travelers seeking private villas and quieter travel.\n\nWhile Puglia is also experiencing a tourism boom, it's not yet as crowded as some of the better-known travel destinations in Italy.\n\nGreece is also facing issues associated with overtourism and protests, with popular hot spots, like Mykonos and Santorini, often overwhelmed by summer crowds and cruise ships.\n\nDelliBovi said many of his clients are skipping those islands entirely. \"People are going to Paros in Greece as opposed to Mykonos or Santorini,\" he said.\n\nParos, another Greek island in the Aegean Sea, has become an attractive alternative for wealthy travelers because it combines beaches, picturesque villages, and nightlife, but without the crush of people. \"There's not 10,000 people at every restaurant. There's not 5,000 people at every beach club,\" Dellibovi said.\n\nTourism on Paros has increased steadily over the past decade, especially with luxury travelers, but it remains less developed and less chaotic than its more famous neighboring islands.\n\nJapan's status as one of the hottest destinations in tourism has also brought issues, especially in cities like Tokyo and Kyoto, where locals have protested tourism levels that they say are unsustainable.\n\nDellibovi said his clients are increasingly asking for alternatives. \"People are like, 'Okay, we want to go to Kyoto. What other places in Japan are cool, that are high-end, that have this infrastructure for us, but are not like we're going to get run over by a mob of people?'\"\n\nKanazawa, located on the opposite coast of Tokyo, is increasingly appealing to high-net-worth travelers who are looking for a similar cultural experience but with more privacy. The city has been called \"Little Kyoto,\" and is known for its art, dining scene, historic districts, and nature.\n\nTourism to regional destinations like Kanazawa is also growing as the Japanese government has encouraged visitors to explore beyond the country's most popular destinations.",

    "title": "Every Emily Henry romance novel, ranked",
    "description": "We ranked Emily Henry's romance novels, including \"Beach Read,\" \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" and \"People We Meet on Vacation.\"",
    "fullText": "Any romance reader knows that not all romance novels are created equally: Some leave you swooning, others leave you shrugging, and the worst ones leave you shutting the book and never picking it back up.\n\nEmily Henry, a fantasy-YA author turned romance queen, is easily one of the most beloved romance novelists of the last five years. All six of her romances caused quite a stir on BookTok, and all but one have been optioned for on-screen adaptations.\n\nBut are they all five-star classics? No.\n\nWe've ranked Henry's six adult romances from worst to best — though, if we're being honest, we'd read Henry's grocery list if we could.\n\nUnfortunately, this is Henry's weakest offering — at least, in my opinion. The beauty of Henry's novels is that every permutation of a ranking exists out there. There are some readers whose very favorite is \"Happy Place.\"\n\n\"Happy Place\" marked a shift from her previous three books, focusing on a group of friends rather than a single main relationship. However, I don't think the friend group was given enough time or fleshed out fully for me to care.\n\nInstead, I felt that too much time was taken away from our core couple, Harriet and Wyn, for me to get invested in them, yet somehow not enough time was given to Sabrina and Cleo, or their partners, Kim and Parth.\n\nAlso, I love a ridiculous romance premise as much as the next person — you'll be hearing about five more of them — but neglecting to tell your group of friends that you've gotten divorced and then pretending to still be together on a group trip stretches my credulity just a tad too far.\n\nPerhaps I'll like it better when it's adapted as a Netflix series.\n\nTo speak in internet parlance, when I read \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" all I could think was that it was reheating \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo's\" nachos, but with a dash of Henry flair.\n\nThe book is a dual narrative, split between would-be author Alice Scott and her dreams to write the biography of a reclusive heiress, Margaret Ives, and Margaret's own life story, told through flashbacks.\n\nI greatly preferred the flashbacks of Margaret's life and her relationships with her sister and husband. The contemporary story of Alice competing with another journalist, Hayden, for the chance to write Margaret's story, was less compelling. I also thought that Alice and Hayden's chemistry was a bit forced and a bit \"insta-lovey\" for my taste.\n\nThe book also purports to have a twist ending, but I found it fairly easy to predict after a few chapters.\n\n\"People We Meet on Vacation\" is Henry's most popular book, the one that catapulted her to the top of BookTok, and is also the first to make the jump from page to screen; the movie adaptation hits Netflix in January, starring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth.\n\nPerhaps it's because this book was so hyped up to me before I read it, but I found it to be just fine. I liked the premise — two former best friends and travel buddies meeting up for the first time after a mysterious trip gone wrong — but I didn't really connect to either Poppy or Alex as characters.\n\nI thought their banter was great, though, which is a throughline of all of Henry's books.\n\nI would never call this book bad; it just wasn't one of my favorites.\n\nHere's where it gets hard for me to choose. I love the top three deeply, but, alas, something has to come in third.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is about Nora Stephens, a cutthroat literary agent who describes herself as the mean girlfriend in a Hallmark movie who gets left behind in the big city when her boyfriend returns to his small town and falls in love with the local [insert whimsical job title here]. Already, I was obsessed.\n\nBut when she's convinced by her sister, Libby, to visit a small town herself, she encounters one of her nemeses from NYC: Charlie Lastra, an editor she can't stand.\n\nYou can guess what happens then.\n\nI adored Nora and Charlie's relationship, as well as Nora's relationship with Libby. I also found Henry's descriptions of Sunshine Falls to be evocative, funny, and full of love and care.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is set to be adapted into a film in the future, so I can't wait to see who will bring these characters to life.\n\nIf you thought I loved Nora and Charlie, just wait until you hear about Daphne and Miles.\n\nRemember when I dinged \"Happy Place\" for having a ridiculous premise? \"Funny Story\" also uses a ridiculous trope, but a fun one that I enjoyed reading about, rather than questioning why our two main characters chose to lie to all their friends.\n\n\"Funny Story\" is a classic romance story: Daphne and Miles have both been dumped by their respective significant others, best friends Peter and Petra, after, wouldn't you guess, Peter and Petra decided that they were in love with each other instead.\n\nHomeless and heartbroken, Daphne and Miles decide to move in together — and in an act of desperation, decide to fake date in order to make their exes jealous.\n\nAs I wrote in my Goodreads review for this book, 'There's something about the way Emily Henry writes flirting that scratches my brain.\" Daphne and Miles' banter is (almost) unmatched.\n\nI relate to Daphne, her insecurities, her interests, and her flaws, the most out of all of Henry's main characters. I also just love Miles. He's the sweetest.\n\n\"Funny Story\" has also been optioned to become a movie, with Henry herself writing the screenplay, which makes me very excited.",

A landlocked nation sharing borders with six other countries, Burkina Faso announced that it had put in place \"equivalent visa measures to citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nWhile this currently means a full ban on visas necessary to enter the country, Burkina Faso said it \"remains committed to mutual respect, the sovereign equality of States, and the principle of reciprocity in its international relations.\"\n\nDue to a decades-old history of war coupled with political violence, Western travel into Burkina Faso remains very low; the U.S. State Department currently keeps it at a level four \"do not travel\" advisory over \"organizations [that] continue to plan and conduct terrorist activities.\"\n\nThe latter, along with a high visa overstay rate, were named by the Trump administration as the primary justification for being placed on the travel ban.\n\nSharing a southwestern border with Burkina Faso, Mali has also put in place a reciprocal ban on American travel.\n\nThe country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation released a statement saying that any U.S. citizens will now also be subject to \"the same conditions and requirements as those imposed by the American authorities on Malian citizens entering the United States.\"\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "description": "St. Barthelemy, or St. Barts, is a French-speaking Caribbean island with beaches and high-end shops where billionaires like Jeff Bezos vacation.",
    "fullText": "Located in the French West Indies, the small island runs about 11 miles long and 2.5 miles wide.\n\nIt's typically warm and sunny most of the year, with temperatures often in the 70s, 80s, or low 90s, and peak tourist season starts in late fall and lasts through the spring.\n\nAs a French territory, the official language of St. Barts is French, though English is also widely spoken.\n\nThe exclusive-feeling island is home to more than a dozen beaches, where visitors can soak up the sun on smooth, sandy shores and in crystal-clear water.\n\n\"I always say if you want to have your toes in the sand and eat a croissant that feels like you're in Paris, St. Barts is the place for you,\" Elisabeth Brown, the membership director at the luxury concierge service Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider's Madeline Berg.\n\nSurrounded by shallow coral reefs, St. Barts has some top-tier snorkeling spots, such as Grand Cul-de-Sac — home to sea turtles and a range of tropical fish.\n\nLocal natural sights also include mountains and hills formed from volcanic eruptions. That said, there are no active volcanoes on St. Barts.\n\nJeff Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez Bezos, were photographed in St. Barts this week — and the Amazon founder has been spotted in St. Barts on multiple occasions over the years.\n\nNo matter the time of year, though, the island regularly welcomes the wealthy.\n\nCelebrities like Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, and Leonardo DiCaprio have visited in the past, and influential banking families, like the Rothschilds, have famously purchased property there.\n\nIn addition to Bezos' vessel, massive yachts owned by Playrix founder Dmitry Bukhman, Dallas Mavericks owner Miriam Adelson, and entertainment mogul David Geffen also parked in St. Barts during the recent holiday.\n\nWhile the yachts are primarily used for transportation to the island, they're also attractions in and of themselves, featuring amenities such as jacuzzis and movie theaters.\n\nTravelers without private yachts can still reach the island by flying into an airport on a larger Caribbean island, like San Juan. From there, they could take a ferry or private boat to St Barts.\n\nVisitors have several options for accommodations, ranging from villa rentals starting at over $900 a night to luxurious hotels for an even higher price.\n\nThe Eden Rock hotel is just one example. It overlooks St. Jean Bay — home to one of the most popular beaches on St. Barts — and is home to fine-dining restaurants and holistic spas.\n\nDuring holiday seasons like New Year's, a single-night stay at its largest villa can cost upward of €13,000, or about $15,200.\n\nThere's also the Rosewood Le Guanahani resort, located on a private peninsula that's home to two secluded beaches, giving travelers the ultimate getaway far from crowds.\n\nSuch privacy comes at a price, as even its most basic room can run guests thousands of dollars a night.\n\nWith billionaire travelers always on-site, the island's retail scene largely caters to shoppers who can drop thousands at any given moment.\n\nSome of the designer brands that have boutiques on St. Barts include Hermès, Cartier, Dior, and Louis Vuitton.\n\nThe island's also home to luxury retailers like Patek Phillipe, which sells one-of-a-kind timepieces you can't find anywhere else. Some retail for five, six, and even seven figures.\n\nA trip to St. Barts isn't all about relaxation, though. There are plenty of places to party and experience live music.\n\nOne of the most popular spots for this on the island is Nikki Beach, an upscale restaurant and beach club. In past years, big-name musicians like Kygo and Mariah Carey have even performed at its New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nIt's also a go-to for people looking to relax poolside with a drink in hand — though keep in mind that even just renting a lounge chair may cost you over $100.",

    "description": "Can you live well on $100,000 per year in retirement? ChatGPT mapped out the complete budget including travel, healthcare and housing. Here's the reality.",
    "fullText": "Most retirement budgets assume you’re pinching pennies. But what if you saved well and want to actually enjoy retirement? I asked ChatGPT to map out a $100,000-per-year retirement budget for someone who wants comfort without being wasteful. The artificial intelligence’s breakdown was thorough and felt fairly realistic.\n\nThe chatbot designed a monthly spending plan, calculated how much you’d need saved and identified the best places to live on this income level. According to ChatGPT, here’s what a six-figure retirement actually looks like.\n\nChatGPT started by clarifying that $100,000 annually puts you well above average retirees. This budget supports quality healthcare, regular travel, a nice home in a desirable area and room for unexpected expenses. You’re not living extravagantly, but you’re comfortable.\n\nThe AI wrote that this lifestyle requires either strong savings or a combination of savings plus Social Security and possibly a pension.\n\nFind Out: How Much the Average Upper-Class Retiree Spends Monthly at Age 69\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nOne hundred thousand dollars per year equals about $8,333 monthly. ChatGPT broke this down into realistic categories.\n\nHousing costs $2,500 to $3,500 per month. This covers either a nice rental in a high-demand city or a mortgage-free home where you only pay property taxes, insurance and HOA fees. The chatbot gave specific examples: Austin, Texas, runs about $3,200 monthly; Phoenix around $2,600; and Tampa, Florida around $2,400. San Diego pushes toward $3,500 or more.\n\nFood and dining take $1,200 to $1,800 monthly. ChatGPT explained this includes high-quality groceries from stores like Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s plus eating out two to four times weekly. The budget also covers occasional hosting and holiday meals.\n\nTransportation costs $600 to $900 per month. The AI assumed you might have a car payment along with insurance, gas and maintenance. If you live in a walkable city without a car, this drops to $200 to $300 monthly.\n\nHealthcare and insurance run $800 to $1,500 depending on your age and state. ChatGPT broke this down as Medicare Parts B and D, supplemental Medigap or Advantage plans, dental and vision coverage, prescription medications and any specialist visits. The AI warned that people under 65 should budget toward the higher end.\n\nUtilities cost $300 to $500 monthly for electricity, water, gas, trash, internet and streaming subscriptions.\n\nTravel gets a significant chunk at $10,000 to $15,000 annually, which equals $850 to $1,250 monthly. ChatGPT explained this covers one to two major international trips plus domestic getaways, hotels and dining abroad. The AI wrote that travel makes a huge difference in retirement satisfaction.",

    "fullText": "After Joe Biden was called out on Fox News for going on a holiday vacation, many on social media rallied around the former president and slammed host Tomi Lahren for mocking the retired politician.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s broadcast of “Hannity,” Lahren openly mocked Biden for his end-of-year trip, noting, “And you’ll never believe where Joe Biden was spotted. Spoiler alert: He’s on vacation.”\n\nThis moment was clipped and shared on X Tuesday evening — and swiftly went viral, gaining 4 million views in less than 24 hours. Many were confused by Lahren’s dig, given Biden is not currently president and has withdrawn significantly from public life amid his cancer battle.\n\nOne critic responded on X, “quick question @TomiLahren what year do you think it is?” Another chimed in with, “Spoiler alert: he’s not president.” A third added, “Retired man goes on vacation. Hardly a scandal.”\n\nA fourth expressed a more biting sentiment, noting, “I’m pretty sure they call that retirement, you dumb hack.”\n\nAnother X user called out conservatives for giving Biden a hard time for doing exactly what they asked him to do: “Sleepy Joe Biden needs to retire so we can pile on to make fun of him for not working anymore.”\n\nThe irony of Lahren’s comments weren’t lost on other social media users, who pointed out that the conservative commentator was covering for Sean Hannity — who was reportedly absent for being on vacation. Watch the viral moment below.\n\nLahren: And you will never believe where Joe Biden was spotted. Spoiler alert. He's on vacation pic.twitter.com/C4RSpWi7St\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) December 31, 2025\n\nBiden notably exited the 2024 presidential race after concerns surfaced following his performance during a June 2024 debate against Donald Trump.\n\n“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden said in a letter confirming his withdrawal from the race. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”\n\nBiden’s Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in and ran in his place, but ultimately lost to Trump, who was inaugurated for his second term in January.\n\nThe post Fox News Mocked for Ripping Into Joe Biden’s Holiday Vacation: ‘They Call That Retirement’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

I'm looking forward to it. Doku maybe, John and Oscar no.\"\n\nGuardiola added: \"In terms of squad we are not in our best right now for this tight schedule. It's right lately we have played with the same guys but with the schedule we have.\n\n\"We will arrive back (from Sunderland) at 2:00 am (0200 GMT) or 3:00 am and two days later we have Chelsea and then after that we have Brighton –- really tough opponents. We don't have many players to rotate.\"\n\nCity, who will begin 2026 five points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal but with a game in hand, could strengthen their squad during the January transfer window.\n\nGuardiola, however, refused to be drawn on reports linking the club with Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.\n\n\"I don't have any news about anything right now,\" said the City boss, who also refused to be drawn on rumours Bobb could leave.\n\n\"The winter transfer window is completely closed right now. So, Sunderland…\"\n\nSunderland are seventh in the table having made an impressive return to the top flight following last season's promotion.\n\nCity defeated the Black Cats 3-0 at the Etihad on December 6 but Guardiola expects a difficult encounter at the Stadium of Light.\n\n\"They are so tough,\" he said. \"The crowd is unbelievable. They have beaten Newcastle. Arsenal and Aston Villa could not win there.\n\n\"They have had really good results. It will be completely different there but at the same time we are ready.\"",

    "description": "Americans in the country are advised to return to the U.S. as soon as possible",
    "fullText": "The State Department has updated its travel warning for Americans planning to or who are already visiting Russia. On Tuesday, the agency reissued a Level 4 travel warning for Russia that was announced in May.\n\nAs part of the warning, the State Department urged any Americans already in Russia to leave immediately. The agency cautions that it has limited resources available to assist Americans if they are detained in Russia. Furthermore, Americans who’ve been charged with crimes may not be able to receive help from the U.S. embassy while in custody in Russia.\n\n\"U.S. citizens may serve their entire prison sentence without release. The risk of wrongful detention of U.S. citizens remains high. Even if a case is determined wrongful, there is no guarantee of release.\"\n\nAmericans have reported being detained and questioned without any reason or credible evidence against them.\n\nThe State Department also warns of ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine which “has destabilized security in southwestern Russia.” Martial law has been declared in several areas of Russia further restricting freedoms in the country.\n\nU.S. officials warn that Russia is not recognizing U.S. citizenship for those who have dual citizenship with Russia. The agency goes on to claim:\n\nRussia has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens.\n\nThe Russian government has forced people with dual citizenship to join the military and has stopped them from leaving the country.\n\nIn 2022, Russia started drafting citizens for the war in Ukraine. The military draft is ongoing.\n\nFailure to adhere to Russian laws and regulations on dual citizenship can result in arrest.\n\nAlthough the warning says to leave Russia right away, it may be difficult for some. U.S. issued debit and credit cards are no longer working in Russia and sanctions have made it “nearly impossible” for electronic money transfers to be sent from the U.S.\n\nAir travel is also extremely difficult to secure at the moment and may not be possible on short notice.\n\n“If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time,” the advisory reads.\n\nShould Americans decide to visit or remain in Russia, the State Department advises:\n\nBe ready for the possibility of detention for an unknown amount of time, possibly without a clear reason, and without the ability to contact your embassy or anyone else for help.\n\nAssume all electronic communications and devices in Russia are monitored by Russian security services. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices.\n\nPrepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.\n\nShare important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip.\n\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care and custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\n\nLeave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\n\nDevelop a communication plan with family, your employer or host organization. List how and when you’ll confirm you’re safe (text or call). Specify how often you will do this.",

    "description": "Flu is rising rapidly across the U.S., driven by a new variant of the virus — and cases are expected to keep growing with holiday travel.  In the U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Flu is rising rapidly across the U.S., driven by a new variant of the virus — and cases are expected to keep growing with holiday travel.\n\nThat variant, known as “subclade K,” led to early outbreaks in the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada. In the U.S., flu typically begins its winter march in December. On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported high or very high levels of illness in more than half the states.\n\nThe CDC estimated there have been at least 7.5 million illnesses, 81,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 deaths from flu so far this season. That includes at least eight child deaths — and is based on data as of Dec. 20, before major holiday gatherings.\n\nSome states are particularly hard-hit. New York’s health department said the week ending Dec. 20 marked the most flu cases the state had recorded in a single week since 2004: 71,000.\n\nIt’s far too soon to know if this flu season will be as severe as last winter’s.\n\nBut it’s not too late to get a flu shot, which health experts say can still prevent severe illness even if someone gets infected. While this year's vaccine isn't a perfect match to the subclade K strain, a preliminary analysis from the U.K. found it offered at least partial protection, lowering people's risk of hospitalization.\n\nAccording to the CDC, only about 42% of adults and children have gotten a flu vaccination so far this year.\n\nThe flu virus is a shape-shifter, constantly mutating, and it comes in multiple forms. There are two subtypes of Type A flu, and subclade K is a mutated version of one of them, named H3N2. That H3N2 strain is always harsh, especially for older adults.\n\nSubclade K’s mutations aren’t enough of a change to be considered an entirely new kind of flu.\n\nBut they’re different enough to evade some of the protection from this year’s vaccine, said Andrew Pekosz, a virus expert at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nWill subclade K make people sicker?\n\nThe CDC said it’s too soon to know how severe this season will be.\n\nFlu seasons dominated by any version of H3N2 tend to be bad, with more infections overall and more people becoming seriously ill. But Hopkins’ Pekosz cautioned it will take time to tease apart whether this subclade K version simply spreads more easily or also is more dangerous.\n\nThat question aside, the CDC notes there are some prescription medicines to treat flu — usually recommended for people at high risk of complications. But they generally need to be started a day or two after symptoms begin.\n\nThe CDC and major medical societies all recommend a flu vaccine for just about everyone age 6 months and older. Despite lots of recent misinformation and confusion about vaccines, the flu recommendations haven’t changed.\n\nFlu is particularly dangerous for people 65 and older, pregnant women, young children and people of any age who have chronic health problems, including asthma, diabetes, heart disease and weak immune systems.\n\nThe vaccines are brewed to protect against three influenza strains. Despite concern over that new H3N2 variant, they appear to be a good match against H1N1 and Type B flu that may also circulate this year, Pekosz said.\n\nThere are shots for all ages, as well as the nasal spray FluMist for ages 2 to 49. For the first time this year, some people may be eligible to vaccinate themselves with FluMist at home.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "The No. 4 UConn men’s basketball team returns to action after a 10-day layoff following its 72-54 win over DePaul on Dec. 21. The Huskies are back on the road yet again as they travel to Cincinnati to face Xavier (9-4, 1-1) on Wednesday afternoon at the Cintas Center.\n\nThe Musketeers rank No. 100 in KenPom, with the No. 119 offense in the country, and 116th in the NET. These numbers aren’t great for a program that made two of the last three NCAA Tournaments, including just last season, but new head coach Richard Pitino has done a solid job building a team essentially from scratch that was competitive in non-conference play, perhaps more than a lot of people expected. The Musketeers beat both West Virginia and Cincinnati and lost by just one to Georgia.\n\nAs for UConn, the Huskies sit at No. 7 in KenPom and No. 8 in the NET. They have the fourth-rated defense in the country per KenPom, a continued step in the right direction from last season. The 12-1 Huskies’ only loss was to now- No.1 Arizona by four points in a game where Tarris Reed Jr. and Braylon Mullins were both out with injuries. In their last game, Alex Karaban led the charge with 21 points and three triples against the Blue Demons.\n\nThe Huskies look to start 3-0 in Big East play for the third time in their six seasons since rejoining the Big East, as the team did so in 2022-23 (3-0) and last season (4-0).\n\nDate/Time: Wednesday, Dec. 31, 5:00 p.m. EST\n\nTV/Stream: Peacock, NBC Sports Network (for YouTubeTV subscribers)\n\nRadio: UConn Sports Network, Sirius XM 85, Sirius/XM online streaming\n\nLocation: Cintas Center, Cincinnati OH\n\nKenPom Predicted Score: UConn 79-67\n\nThe Huskies and Musketeers have played 12 times, with the past 10 coming in Big East play. UConn has a narrow 7-5 advantage over Xavier with a 6-4 split in conference action. They last faced off on January 25, 2025, when Xavier beat UConn, 76-72 at the Cintas Center. Solo Ball led four Huskies in double figures with 20 points.\n\nAs of this writing, all players are expected to be available for Wednesday’s game. This includes Solo Ball, who sat out the Huskies’ previous game on 12/21 with a wrist injury. Dan Hurley said he’s been able to practice and will be good to go.\n\nRemember the last time a Top 5 UConn squad traveled on the road on New Year’s Eve to Xavier? It ended in a Musketeer win. The 14-0 Huskies led by Adama Sanogo and Co. suffered their first loss of the year in a game where the Musketeers used a big second half to pull away and hand the Huskies their first loss, more or less starting that infamous January of 2023 where the eventual national champs really struggled.\n\nThat’s not a one-off either. In fact, UConn has lost 3 of 5 games on the road at Xavier since joining the Big East. In addition to that game in 2022 and last year’s matchup while Liam McNeeley was out, the Huskies lost during the 2021-22 season by six points despite a combined 40 points from RJ Cole and Tyrese Martin.\n\nThat Xavier team in 2022 had names like Colby Jones, Jack Nunge, Zach Freemantle, and Souley Boum. The 2025 Musketeers don’t have that, not even particularly close, but somewhere deep in the mind of Dan Hurley, he’s having flashbacks from the past.\n\nWith the new head coach in Pitino, no scholarship players from last year’s Xavier team who played a single minute are back with the program. The lone returner is Roddie Anderson III, but he sat all of last season in a redshirt year. Pitino brought in players from all different levels of college basketball to construct the roster.\n\nLeading scorer Tre Carroll comes over from Florida Atlantic, where he was a key component to that Owls team that made the Final Four in 2022-23. Jovan Milicevic and Filip Borovicanin were both rotational frontcourt pieces for Pitino at New Mexico last year. Anthony Robinson and Pape N’Diaye were both reserve bigs for Virginia and UNLV, respectively, a year ago and retain that role for the Musketeers.\n\nIn the backcourt, All Wright (one of the best names in the sport) comes over from Valparaiso fresh off a great freshman year. Malik Messina-Moore and Isaiah Walker are both seniors from the mid-major level that have a lot of experience and games under their belts. Overall, this group has a good mix of veteran leadership and promising young talent.\n\nXavier has played two completely different games to kick off Big East play this season. In their opener, they hosted a struggling Creighton team that was searching for a big win. The result? A 41 point Bluejay win that saw them knock down 16 threes and shoot 60% from the field. Carroll only scored 7 points, by far his season low. The Musketeers looked lost on both ends of the floor and were down 27 by halftime. It was looking like that eighth place pick in the preseason poll may have ended up being too high.\n\nThen just a few days later the Musketeers traveled to Washington D.C. to take on Georgetown. After losing by over 40 points at home, it only made sense that they picked up a gritty road win on the road later on in the week. Carroll scored 22 points and Borovicanin had a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds in the 80-77 victory over the Hoyas.\n\nWith how well the Huskies have been playing early on in conference play with a pair of 18+ point victories, it’s easy to overlook some players who may be struggling or not playing up to their full potential that they’ve shown in non-con play.\n\nMalachi Smith is averaging 1 PPG and 1 APG through the first two Big East games after closing non-con with back-to-back 9-assist efforts vs. Florida and Texas. The Dayton transfer hasn’t been able to get a good rhythm going yet in league play, but he is averaging fewer minutes (15.5 in BE play, 19.8 in non-con).\n\nEric Reibe was everything UConn could have asked for and \n\nBoth UConn and Xavier do a good job of getting everybody involved in the offense, and it shows. The Musketeers are first in the league in assists per game at 18.6, but the Huskies aren’t far behind at 18.2. Those are on 27.1 and 29.2 made field goals per game, respectively, too, so both sides rack up assists at a rate north of 60%. Borovician and Messina-Moore combine for 8 APG, and Carroll and Anderson each average 2.8. For the Huskies, Silas Demary Jr.’s 5.8 and Smith’s 4.0 carry the load, but Karaban and Reed Jr. each average at least 2 as well.",

    "fullText": "A new year means new opportunities to travel. And if you're anything like me, you're probably already thinking about where to go in 2026.\n\nAfter visiting all 50 states, there are a few places that have really stood out to me. If traveling more is one of your New Year's resolutions, I recommend checking out these nine incredible destinations.\n\nI love visiting Teton Valley, Idaho — the area located on the Western side of the Teton Mountain Range.\n\nDriggs, Victor, and Tetonia are all great little towns in the region. I especially love floating on the Teton River through Driggs and exploring downtown Victor.\n\nThe area is also a great base for day trips to Grand Teton or Yellowstone National Parks, making it a quieter way to enjoy the Tetons without the crowds.\n\nNorthern New Mexico is the place I've come back to the most over the last decade.\n\nThe wide-open skies and landscapes are unlike anywhere else, making every visit feel completely unforgettable and unique. I recommend staying in Taos, Santa Fe, or Abiquiú.\n\nI always enjoy exploring the Ojo Caliente Hot Springs or hiking around Ghost Ranch — a national natural landmark and former home of Georgia O'Keeffe.\n\nMendocino County in California is one of my all-time favorite places to visit. I love hiking through the coastal beauty of Russian Gulch and Mendocino Headlands State Parks, before glamping at Mendocino Grove.\n\nThe town of Mendocino itself is full of charm — colorful storefronts, cozy cafés, and galleries tucked along tree-lined streets with an ocean view. It's the perfect mix of outdoor adventure and slow, small-town California coastal charm.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, is one of those cities I always find myself coming back to.\n\nI love wandering around the historic French Quarter and South of Broad areas, strolling along the Battery, enjoying Lowcountry cuisine, and browsing the boutiques and galleries.\n\nIn my opinion, Charleston is one of the most charming places in the country.\n\nAlthough I think Montana is worth visiting in its entirety, I love spending time in Glacier National Park. The mountains are massive and create the kind of scenes that make you stop and stare.\n\nWhether I'm hiking along alpine trails (I recommend the Highline and Avalanche Lake trails), driving down the iconic 50-mile scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road through the park, or just pausing to take in the views at Lake McDonald, the landscape here never fails to amaze me.\n\nCumberland Island, Georgia, is a wild and peaceful barrier island with 17.5 miles of undeveloped beaches and free-roaming wild horses.\n\nWhen I visited, I biked past the ruins of the 19th century Dungeness Mansion, explored the Plum Orchard mansion, and visited the First African Baptist Church, where John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette were married.\n\nOverall, it's a very unique, seemingly untouched place to visit.\n\nWestern North Carolina is one of my favorite parts of the country. I love exploring the towns around Asheville — Hendersonville, Boone, and Brevard.\n\nThe latter is my favorite, with the Brevard Music Center bringing classical performances to the mountains each summer. Plus, there are plenty of opportunities for outdoor recreation nearby.\n\nBetween the waterfalls, hiking trails, and small-town vibes, it's a part of the state I keep coming back to.\n\nI've visited Alaska many times and it's massive. Because of its size, though, it can sometimes be challenging to navigate, which is why I always recommend using Anchorage as a base.\n\nI love staying at the Wildbirch Hotel downtown, grabbing breakfast at Biscuit Club next door, or having pizza at Moose's Tooth before heading out on adventures.\n\nPlus, one of my favorite scenic drives of all time is just south of Anchorage along Turnagain Arm. I recommend stopping in Girdwood to stretch your legs and grab a beer at Girdwood Brewing.\n\nFrom Anchorage, I've also taken glacier tours out of Whittier, driven out to explore the charming village of Hope, and gone on trips to Katmai and Lake Clark National Parks.\n\nBetween the wildlife, glaciers, and endless landscapes, it's a place that never stops amazing me.\n\nAs someone who's visited all 50 states, coastal Maine will always be on my short list for the most beautiful places in the US.\n\nI love starting my trip in the quaint town of Kennebunkport, visiting the iconic Portland Head Light in Cape Elizabeth, and then making the drive to hike in Acadia National Park.\n\nIf you have time, I recommend following the coast up to Lubec, the easternmost point in the continental US, for a taste of why this rugged, timeless coastline is so unforgettable.",

    "fullText": "ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey and Armenia have agreed to simplify visa procedures as part of efforts to normalize ties, Turkey's Foreign Ministry announced Monday, making it easier for their citizens to travel between the two countries.\n\nRelations between Turkey and Armenia have long been strained by historic grievances and Turkey’s alliance with Azerbaijan. The two neighboring countries have no formal diplomatic ties and their joint border has remained closed since the 1990s.\n\nThe two countries however, agreed to work toward normalization in 2021, appointing special envoys to explore steps toward reconciliation and reopening the frontier. Those talks have progressed in parallel with efforts to ease tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nTurkey supported Azerbaijan during its 2020 conflict with Armenia for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, a territorial dispute that had lasted nearly four decades.\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on social platform X that Ankara and Yerevan agreed that holders of diplomatic, special and service passports from both countries would be able to obtain electronic visas free of charge as of Jan. 1.\n\n“On this occasion, Turkey and Armenia reaffirm once again their commitment to continue the normalization process between the two countries with the goal of achieving full normalization without any preconditions,” the ministry said.\n\nTurkey and Armenia also have a more than century-old dispute over the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians in massacres, deportations and forced marches that began in 1915 in Ottoman Turkey. Historians widely view the event as genocide.\n\nTurkey denies the deaths constituted genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of civil war and unrest. It has lobbied to prevent countries from officially recognizing the massacres as genocide.",

    "fullText": "HOLBROOK, Ariz. (AP) — Investigators declined to reveal the suspected motive in the shooting death of a prominent California farmer’s estranged wife in eastern Arizona, but they said the couple's prolonged divorce case arose in nearly all interviews with family and friends.\n\nMichael Abatti, 63, was arrested last week in El Centro, California, in the shooting death of Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, at her family’s vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.\n\nInvestigators, who discussed the case at a news conference Monday, say Michael Abatti traveled from El Centro to Pinetop on Nov. 20, carried out the killing and returned to California early the next morning. They declined to say what occurred at the Pinetop house in the last days of Kerri Abatti’s life.\n\n“Different theories will come up,” Navajo County Sheriff David Clouse said of the motive. “The only thing that’s glaring that I think everybody already knows is there’s a divorce in place and they weren’t able to come to a resolution. But I can’t speak exactly to what the motive would be.”\n\nOwen Roth, one of Michael Abatti’s attorneys, said his client surrendered to law enforcement, agreed to be extradited to Arizona and remains innocent under the law. “Our client is in his mid-60s and has significant health issues, and we continue to worry about his well-being,” Roth said. “We ask the public to respect his privacy and constitutional rights and reiterate that this case will be decided based on the evidence by a jury.” An autopsy report released Monday said Kerri Abatti’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nThe report said she was found unconscious on the floor near her kitchen by her nephew, who told investigators he heard a loud sound before finding her. When investigators searched the home they found a “circular defect” on a window and determined “a gunshot likely originated from the yard outside the home,” the autopsy report said.\n\nThe Associated Press left a message for the Navajo County Sheriff’s Office for further explanation. The medical examiner’s office in Coconino County, which conducted the autopsy, directed questions about the report to a Navajo County official, and the AP also left a message for the official. A descendant of early Latter-day Saints settlers who helped found Pinetop in the 1880s, Kerri had filed for divorce, with proceedings pending in California at the time of her death.\n\nAuthorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife’s death.\n\nMichael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops. His grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region’s early settlers and his father helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association.\n\nMichael Abatti served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.\n\nThe Abattis, who married in 1992 and had three children, were sparring over finances. Kerri told the court the couple had lived an affluent lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned property in three states, vacationed internationally and sent their children to private school.\n\nKerri initially received $5,000 monthly temporary spousal support. She later sought an increase, citing struggles to maintain her standard of living as well as keep up the Arizona property. She also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney’s fees, court filings showed.\n\nMichael Abatti eventually agreed to raise support to $6,400 monthly, despite having countered in a court filing that poor farming years had reduced his income. He blamed market shifts favoring Ukrainian crops, rising shipping costs and harsh weather.",

    "title": "8 things to pack for a Disney vacation and 3 to leave behind, from a travel planner who's visited the parks over 40 times",
    "description": "As a frequent Disney World visitor and travel planner, there are things I always pack to survive park days, such as ponchos, plus some I never bring.",
    "fullText": "After going to Disney World over 40 times, I've gotten really good at visiting the parks — especially when it comes to optimizing the space in my suitcase.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels specializing in Disney destinations, so my clients often ask me about the most important items to pack for a trip to the parks.\n\nRead on for the essentials I always bring, as well as the things I think you can leave at home.\n\nIf you've spent any time in the Orlando area, you know it will likely rain during your Disney trip.\n\nDon't let that stop you from having fun — just throw on rain ponchos and hit the parks. It's often much cheaper to buy them before you leave rather than inside Disney World.\n\nYou can also wear ponchos if you don't want to get wet on rides like Splash Mountain and Kali River Rapids.\n\nI've tried out every kind of bag you can imagine when visiting the parks. Ultimately, my biggest advice is to bring something small that fits your main essentials.\n\nMy husband's favorite is a cross-body bag, and I love a small backpack, purse, or fanny pack.\n\nYou want something that's easy to take on and off quickly, compact enough to take on rides, and roomy enough that you're not cramming your phone and necessities in.\n\nWhen you head to the parks, you want to travel light, so I like having smaller versions of essentials to carry.\n\nI raid the travel section of my local store before every trip to make sure I have sunscreen, hand sanitizer, aloe-vera gel, sanitizing wipes, a mini first-aid kit, pain relievers, and tissues.\n\nIt's not a Disney trip without the quintessential Mickey or Minnie ears. At this point, I have plenty to choose from based on different seasons, holidays, and moods.\n\nI also pack some of my many Disney T-shirts — one for each day at the parks. We always get one special matching family shirt for each trip, as well.\n\nThis way, we can stay on theme without feeling tempted to spend money on more merchandise while in the parks.\n\nA lot of planning in the parks requires the use of the My Disney Experience app, which is crucial for tasks like checking maps or making dining reservations. Plus, we love snapping lots of photos.\n\nVisiting Disney involves a lot of walking — on many days in the parks, I log over 10 miles. Also, because of frequent rain and water rides, my shoes often get wet.\n\nSo, I bring comfortable, fast-drying shoes to ensure my experience isn't ruined by blisters or sore feet. My husband always wears his Keen sandals, and I switch between my Sanuks and Tevas.\n\nMy family has made it a tradition to send a letter or postcard to someone back home from inside the parks.\n\nYou can always bring souvenir postcards to the front desk of your resort. However, it's more fun to put it in one of the four mailboxes on Main Street USA at Magic Kingdom.\n\nYou can pay for almost everything at Disney World with Disney gift cards, including dining, merchandise, and resort charges.\n\nMany external retailers offer small discounts when you purchase these cards, so buying them ahead of time is a great way to save a little money on your vacation.\n\nTo curb excess spending, we give each of our kids a gift card at the beginning of the trip for souvenirs. Once they use up their card's balance, they're done spending.\n\nAside from Victoria and Albert's at the Grand Floridian Resort, none of the Disney dining locations really expect more than casual dress.\n\nI love this aspect of Disney World because it means there are wonderful dining options with upscale-feeling food that are still super family-friendly.\n\nMy husband and I usually throw one nicer casual outfit in our suitcase if we decide we want to get a little fancy. But, generally, our dress clothes get left in the closet at home.\n\nMy clients often ask me if they need to bring life jackets or towels for their children to enjoy the hotel pools. Fortunately, the answer is no.\n\nAll the Disney resorts provide these items, so you can save space in your suitcase and leave them at home.\n\nIt's nice to have a few quick snacks on hand in the hotel room or in your park bag, but don't waste space in your suitcase. You can have groceries delivered to your Disney resort.\n\nMost national delivery services are available, or Garden Grocer is a local option. These deliveries can be picked up in the lobby at no charge or sent straight to your room for a small fee.\n\nThis story was originally published in January 2022 and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

    "description": "Blackstone valued its real estate portfolio, which includes vacation destinations across the globe, at $611 billion.",
    "fullText": "A vacation destination nestled off the coast of Australia will soon be owned by Blackstone, the US-based investment firm.\n\nBlackstone announced on December 23 that it entered an agreement to acquire Hamilton Island. Outlets, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said the deal is worth $1.2 billion.\n\n\"This investment, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, builds on Blackstone's leading global position in leisure and hospitality, including in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, where it has made significant investments across Australia, Japan, and India,\" Blackstone said in a press release.\n\nBlackstone valued its real estate portfolio, which includes numerous vacation destinations worldwide, at $611 billion as of September 2025.\n\nHere is what Blackstone is getting with its latest purchase.\n\nHamilton Island is part of the Whitsunday Islands chain in Queensland, located off the northeast coast of Australia. The Ngaro people originally lived on the Whitsunday Islands, which are near the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nTourists from Australia's outback and southern region began vacationing at Hamilton Island in the 1920s, according to the Hamilton Island tourism website.\n\nHamilton Island transformed into a resort destination in the 1980s under Keith Williams, who owned and operated the island for two decades, according to the tourism website.\n\nDuring that time, he built Hamilton Island's marina and a resort. The island was later acquired by the family of Bob Oatley, a famous Australian winemaker.\n\nThe Hamilton Island tourism website said the Oatley family spends millions of dollars each year on upgrading the infrastructure, accommodations, and services.\n\nHamilton Island measures 2,800 acres across two islands. There are five hotels, 20 retailers, over 20 restaurants and bars, a marina, a golf course, and a commercial airport.\n\nAbout 70% of the area remains undeveloped, Blackstone said.\n\nHamilton Island is located near the Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As a result, significant efforts are made to preserve the area.\n\nIn addition to sustainable waste disposal, the tourism site said the island has nature-based experiences to educate guests, island-wide erosion and sediment control measures, water treatment plans, liquid composters, and more.\n\nHamilton Island has a range of activities for guests, including ATV riding for children, snorkeling, mountain biking, a golf club, a yacht club, and more.\n\nHamilton Island's position near the Coral Sea makes it an ideal destination for sailing, a popular activity among visitors. In addition to the marina and local yacht club, Hamilton Island has hosted an annual sailing race week for four decades.\n\nThe next race week is scheduled for August 2026.\n\nNearly two decades ago, Queensland's tourism office launched a campaign encouraging people to apply for the \"Best Job in the World\": a six-month stint as a caretaker on Hamilton Island.\n\nQueensland's tourism website said the winner, Ben Southall, beat out over 34,000 applicants from over 200 countries. The BBC reported that the position came with a $150,000 salary and a luxury villa for accommodation.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sharonda Scott, 37, an LA-based stuntwoman. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTwo years ago, at 35, I decided to take what I now call my \"radical sabbatical.\"\n\nMy life in Los Angeles had turned into a whirlwind of auditions, stunts, and constant training. I had been working in the entertainment industry as a stuntwoman and actor since I was 30, but by early 2024, after the writers' and actors' strikes, I hit a wall.\n\nThe industry had slowed to a trickle, my savings were tight, and I realized the way I was living — chasing gigs, enjoying luxury, yet constantly stressed — just wasn't sustainable anymore.\n\nI grew up in Detroit as the youngest of five, raised by a single mom. College took me to the University of Miami, where I switched from pre-med to international studies and spent time in Brazil learning Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nAfter graduation, I worked in prostate cancer research but knew it wasn't my path. I bounced between singing, fashion design, and volunteer work in Rio before moving to LA — where a background acting job unexpectedly led me into stunt work.\n\nMy first big break came when I got hired to be Miranda Bailey's stunt double on \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\nBut by January 2024, the industry was quiet, and I found myself anxious about bills despite careful saving.\n\nI felt trapped. It was a conversation with a close friend that changed everything: \"What do you really want?\"\n\nI wanted to travel and experience the world beyond LA. So I started imagining a sabbatical — not for a few weeks, but for a full year or more.\n\nI didn't have a detailed plan. I wrote down 12 countries I hoped to visit, sold everything in my LA apartment, broke my lease, and found someone to rent my car to cover the payments.\n\nMy friends and family were supportive; they helped me pack and even bought some of my things to help fund the trip. My rule was to spend no more than $500 per plane ticket, which wasn't too hard since most were one-way.\n\nPeople warned me about traveling solo as a woman in India, but from the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed.\n\nWhat I thought would be a short stay became transformative. Two young girls who had experienced trauma arrived the same week, and we quickly became inseparable.\n\nFrom there, the journey unfolded organically. My sister joined whenever she could get time off — she ended up traveling with me to 13 countries. Even my mom, who had feared flying for decades, caught up with me along the way.\n\nWe zip-lined along cliffs in Cape Verde, rode camels in Morocco, and cage-dived with sharks in South Africa. In Zimbabwe, we even cage-dived with crocodiles. We paraglided over Rio during Carnival and danced for hours at a salsa congress in Paris.\n\nBut I also found magic in the quieter moments — sharing meals with locals in Vietnam and Thailand, wandering Moroccan souks, and experiencing festivals and ceremonies through invitations from people I met on the road.\n\nIn the Philippines, I completed my divemaster certification, mastering skills I had been working toward for years. In Scotland, I celebrated a friend's wedding, reconnecting with people I hadn't seen in years.\n\nTraveling solo forced me to problem-solve constantly: exchanging currency, navigating transportation, finding food, and making friends in unfamiliar cultures.\n\nAs an introvert who thrives on connection, I discovered I could build community anywhere, and those relationships shaped my experience as much as the places themselves.\n\nI slowed down, learned to trust the process, and stopped striving for the American dream as defined by society: the house, the car, the white picket fence. My dream became freedom — the ability to move, explore, and experience the world on my own terms.\n\nNow, back in the US, I'm navigating reverse culture shock. Hollywood is pretty much decentralizing itself; auditions are scattered. I'm exploring new projects in travel filmmaking and documentary work.\n\nBut my long-term vision is clearer than ever: I want to live abroad.\n\nLooking back, my advice for anyone considering an adult gap year is simple: don't overthink it. Reduce your financial anchors, embrace flexibility, and trust the process.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "description": "The Patriots travel to face the Jets on Sunday. We break down what the game means for the NFL playoff picture in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "4 p.m. window update: The Eagles beat the Bills courtesy of a last second stop on a Buffalo two-point conversion attempt. The Bills loss means the Patriots have clinched the AFC East title. They now will play for the No. 1 seed in Week 18.\n\nGame update: The Patriots’ blowout win over the Jets has New England on the cusp of clinching the AFC East title. If the Bills lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles later today, the Patriots will wrap up the division title.\n\nIf the Bills win that game, the Patriots will have to wait until Week 18 to clinch the division. New England would just need a win over the Miami Dolphins to clinch their first division title since 2019.\n\nNew England’s win also denied the Broncos a chance at wrapping up the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nTwo AFC East rivals meet on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.\n\nOne team has already clinched a playoff spot, but the other would love to play spoiler.\n\nHere is what is at stake Sunday when the New York Jets host the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Buffalo Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. The Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the division back in Week 15 when they blew a 24-7 halftime lead to the Bills, but still remain in the driver’s seat in the division title race. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nWith the Jets already eliminated from the playoffs, this game has no tiebreaker implications between the two teams.\n\nHowever, it could play a role in the chase for the AFC East title. Right now the Patriots have a one-game lead over the Bills, and with the two teams having split the season series, the second tiebreaker is division record. New England has a 3-1 record in AFC East games (with the Jets and Miami Dolphins remaining) while the Bills are 3-2, with the Jets on the schedule in Week 18. A New England loss to the Jets opens the door to the Patriots and Bills finishing with the same division record, which would then move the AFC East title to the third tiebreaker, which is record in common games. Right now the Patriots are 9-1 in those games while the Bills are 9-2, but a loss to the Jets would drop New England to 9-2.\n\nWhich would potentially mean the AFC East title would be decided by the fourth tiebreaker, AFC record. Entering Week 17 the Bills have a better record in conference games, 8-3 versus 7-3.",

    "fullText": "DENVER (KDVR) — Hundreds of flights were delayed at Denver International Airport on Sunday as snow across the country and heavy holiday travel combined to slow operations on one of the busiest travel days of the season.\n\nAirport officials said passenger volume was high as travelers returned home from holiday celebrations, while others arrived in Denver ahead of New Year’s festivities. Long lines formed throughout the airport, from parking shuttles to baggage check and security checkpoints.\n\nSee the latest traffic conditions in Denver on FOX31\n\nSecurity wait times reached about 30 minutes at their peak on Sunday morning. While most travelers moved through the lines without major issues, at least one passenger said the delays caused her to miss a flight.\n\n“I couldn’t get through security, and I had a really nice guy help me get a flight change,” said Kelly Marlor, who was traveling Sunday.\n\nFlightAware reported that more than 480 flights at Denver International Airport were delayed or canceled by 2 p.m. Some travelers also experienced turbulent flights due to windy conditions.\n\n“It was really bad turbulence,” said Sonia Rosenberg, who was visiting friends in Denver. “They couldn’t even give us drinks or snacks on our flight, but it was fine. We made it here. So that’s all that matters.”\n\nDespite the crowds, many travelers said they expected delays and came prepared with extra time. Travelers who spoke to FOX31 said the busy airport was a small price to pay after spending the holidays with loved ones.\n\n“It was a lot of fun,” said Patricia Cunningham, who was traveling home to Albuquerque after visiting her kids for Christmas. “The weather was unusually warm, but we woke up to a little bit of snow today, so that was kind of nice.”\n\nOutside the terminals, reunions played out as friends and family greeted arriving passengers. Risa Nutt and Samantha Freedberg said they were picking up friends they met at summer camp and planned to spend New Year’s together in Denver.\n\n“We’re spending New Year together, so we’re going to take them to all the iconic places,” Nutt said.\n\nAirport officials estimate more than 750,000 passengers traveled through Denver International Airport from Dec. 19 through Sunday.",

    "description": "The US president flies on Air Force One. World leaders in other countries also have their own official aircraft.",
    "fullText": "The Boeing VC-25 is arguably the most famous jetliner in the world, even though most people have never heard of it.\n\nMost do know it, though, by the call sign it's assigned when the president of the United States is on board: Air Force One.\n\nAir Force One is instantly recognizable, both as the president's airplane and as a flying symbol of American military and economic might. With its hand-polished blue, white, and silver livery, Air Force One boldly proclaims the arrival of the leader of the free world.\n\nThe US president is not the only one to have their own presidential jet. A number of prominent international leaders also use some form of executive transport.\n\nThe Boeing 747 jumbo jet is a popular option for many nations, including China, India, and South Korea. The Airbus A330 and A340 are also commonly found in presidential fleets.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the presidents, chancellors, and prime ministers of the world travel.\n\nThe Boeing VC-25A entered service as Air Force One in 1990. At 231 feet long, it can transport 30 crew members and 71 passengers.\n\nThere are two nearly identical Boeing jets that serve as the official transport of the president. Normally, the planes are referred to by their tail numbers: 28000 and 29000. When the commander-in-chief steps on board, they take on the call sign \"Air Force One.\"\n\nNew VC-25B Air Force One planes, based on the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, are now expected to be ready by 2028 after years of delays. Boeing has already lost over $2 billion on the project due to various manufacturing and supply-chain issues.\n\nThe presidential jets are operated by the Presidential Airlift Group out of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\n\nThe smaller C-32, measuring 155 feet long, normally serves as the US vice president's plane. It is used by the president for travel to smaller airports that don't have the infrastructure for the larger Air Force One jet.\n\nUntil 2015, the UK prime minister chartered commercial jets for state visits.\n\nThe modified Airbus A330 was converted for VIP duties in 2015, but can still serve as a refueling tanker when not on state business. It is outfitted with 58 business-class seats.\n\nIn 2020, its gray Royal Air Force livery was repainted with a new white color and the Union Jack on the tail, a refurbishment that cost £900,000, or around $1.1 million, the BBC reported.\n\nNicknamed \"The Flying Kremlin,\" the Ilyushin Il-96-300 measures over 181 feet long and can hold 262 passengers, The National Interest reported.\n\nThe Russian president has also been known to fly on a fleet of smaller executive aircraft based on the Tupolev Tu-214 airliner. Tupolev TU-214s were designed as the Russian equivalent of Boeing 757s and can hold around 210 passengers.\n\nGerman leaders previously used modified Airbus A340-300 airliners for official travel, but they were withdrawn from service and put up for sale in 2024 after experiencing maintenance issues with German officials on board.\n\nThe German fleet also features several Airbus A320-family-based executive jets.\n\nWhen carrying the president of France, the plane's call sign is COTAM 001.\n\nFrance's presidential fleet also includes several Airbus A310-300s and Airbus A340-200s.\n\nDesignated as B-2479, the plane can fly 14,320 kilometers, or around 8898 miles, without stopping to refuel.\n\nJapan's old Air Force One plane, a Boeing 747-400, was listed for sale on an aviation classifieds site for $28 million in 2019.\n\nThe plane uses the call sign \"Code One\" while carrying the South Korean president. Leased from Korean Air, it began serving as South Korea's presidential aircraft in 2021, AeroTime reported.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil switched from using a luxurious Airbus A319 corporate jet to the more utilitarian KC-30 after the presidential plane experienced a technical issue in 2024 while visiting Mexico, Reuters reported.\n\nBrazil's presidential fleet also features several domestically produced Embraer VIP transports.\n\nThe Canadian government bought the Airbus A-330-200, known as Airbus 02, from Kuwait Airways for $50 million in 2023, CBC reported.\n\nPoland received its first Boeing 737 BBJ2 jet in 2021 featuring the serial number 0111 and nicknamed \"Roman Dmowski\" after the Polish politician, Key.Aero reported.\n\nWhen carrying the prime minister, the plane is known as \"India One.\" It can fly for 13,500 kilometers, or around 8,388 miles, without refueling.\n\nThe fleet includes Airbus A330-200s, Airbus A340-500s, and a Boeing 747-8I private jet reportedly gifted to Turkey by the Qatari government, the BBC reported.\n\nThe plane is nicknamed \"Chammae-1,\" named after North Korea's national bird, AP reported.\n\nIn June, Iran's presidential plane flew to Jordan accompanied by two Airbus A321s, The War Zone reported.\n\nAustralia's KC-30A, a modified Airbus A330, features the gray Royal Australian Air Force livery with a kangaroo design.\n\nThe plane is known as \"Wing of Zion,\" with the registration \"4X-ISR.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published by Benjamin Zhang in April 2019.

    "fullText": "When I tell people I bought a fixer-upper in Vermont with my siblings, the reaction is almost always the same: part envy, part amusement, part horror.\n\n\"That's so exciting, but you must really like your siblings. I could never do that with mine. It would end in disaster,\" they say.\n\nDid I mention the house — tucked deep in the woods — is nearly impossible to find, three stories tall, and has no interior staircases or electricity?\n\nMy brother, sister, and I grew up with a second home that served as a vacation house (and a source of rental income for our parents).\n\nSo, I liked the idea of buying a property and continuing this tradition with my siblings. My brother was immediately on board, and not to be left out, our sister quickly agreed to the venture as well.\n\nTogether, we decided on a few rules for purchasing a property: At least one of us would need to see it in person, and at least two of us would have to agree to make the purchase.\n\nWe also didn't want to buy a place too far from any of our current homes, so we looked for properties in New England.\n\nAfter three years of searching, we settled on a fixer-upper home in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom that was within our budget.\n\nOur house needs a lot of work, but the process has been somewhat slow because all three of us have full-time jobs and the property is between four and seven hours from our respective homes.\n\nMy brother has been there the most often to check in, meet contractors, and mow a path through the often-overgrown grass to the front door.\n\nHowever, the few weekends where we've all worked on the house together feel like an episode of a low-budget renovation show, except more bickering and no production crew.\n\nAs the eldest daughter, I tend to slip into project-manager mode, whether I mean to or not. I create long to-do lists and ask many questions about the plan that my brother attempts to answer — and my sister mediates when we get frustrated with each other.\n\nWe've argued about everything from which of the previous owner's possessions to discard to where the key lock box should go and how to start a generator.\n\nSomehow, we've still managed to get some things done: We created signs to mark the hidden road and driveway, cleared out the house, installed insulation, and started taking quotes for solar panels.\n\nFor now, this process has been 100% worth it, not just because of the future I'm able to imagine here, but for the journey we're taking to achieve it.\n\nOn challenging days, I often wonder what exactly we've gotten ourselves into, but my siblings are smart and kind, and I'm glad I still really like them.\n\nMy brother was originally hoping the home would be mostly livable by the end of the year. However, we still need to install staircases and fix the electricity — among many other things, so I'm not so sure.\n\nMy hope, though, is that within two years we won't be embarrassed to invite people to stay for a weekend, and that one day, this place will be a shared refuge.\n\nI picture it as the backdrop for long summer weekends, big dinners with family and friends, and quiet mornings; a place where we take long walks with our dogs, where our kids run barefoot in the grass, and where we can all catch our breath when the world feels like too much.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham travel to Selhurst Park on Sunday afternoon facing a familiar challenge this season: how to balance tactical continuity with enforced changes. Another London derby arrives at a delicate moment for Thomas Frank, whose side have shown flashes of cohesion and attacking fluency but continue to be disrupted by suspensions and long-term absentees.\n\nThis fixture against Crystal Palace comes with heightened scrutiny, not just because of recent results, but because squad availability is once again shaping selection decisions. With several senior figures ruled out and others edging closer to returns, Tottenham’s predicted lineup reflects both necessity and opportunity as the Premier League calendar reaches its congested winter phase.\n\nTottenham’s defensive structure will look different this weekend after a costly previous outing. Cristian Romero is suspended following his red card, while Xavi Simons will also serve a ban after a separate disciplinary incident. Their absence removes two influential presences from Frank’s preferred XI and forces a reshuffle at the back.\n\nKevin Danso is expected to step into central defence alongside Micky van de Ven, offering physicality and aerial security against a Palace side that remain dangerous from set-pieces. Pedro Porro should continue at right-back, while Destiny Udogie would ordinarily start on the left, but his fitness situation complicates matters.\n\nIf Udogie is not deemed ready, Tottenham may have to adapt again, potentially asking van de Ven to cover wider areas or adjusting their build-up shape to compensate. The defensive line will therefore be under pressure to settle quickly, particularly in an away environment that can turn hostile early.\n\nIn midfield, Tottenham are likely to retain a double pivot designed to provide stability rather than risk. Rodrigo Bentancur is expected to anchor proceedings, offering composure in possession and positional discipline out of possession. He is likely to be partnered by Archie Gray, whose growing influence has been one of the more encouraging developments in recent weeks.\n\nFurther forward, Lucas Bergvall should continue to operate between the lines, tasked with linking midfield to attack and finding pockets of space behind Palace’s midfield block. His intelligence off the ball has become increasingly important in a side that has often lacked a natural rhythm during disrupted spells.\n\nThe absence of Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr, both unavailable due to international commitments, limits Frank’s options and underlines the importance of managing workload carefully across the festive period.\n\nTottenham’s attacking selection is expected to reward recent performances. Richarlison is in line to start through the middle after making a notable impact from the bench last time out. His energy and physical presence offer a different dimension to Spurs’ forward play, particularly against a Palace defence that prefers to hold a compact shape.\n\nOut wide, Mohammed Kudus and Randal Kolo Muani are expected to support the central striker, providing pace and directness in transition. Kudus, in particular, has become a key outlet in one-on-one situations, while Kolo Muani’s movement allows Tottenham to stretch the pitch vertically.\n\nThe emphasis will be on fluidity rather than rigid positional play, with Frank encouraging interchanges across the front four to disrupt Palace’s defensive organisation.\n\nTottenham’s injury list remains a significant factor in planning. Dominic Solanke continues to recover from a persistent ankle issue that has sidelined him since August, while Dejan Kulusevski is still working his way back from a long-standing patella problem. James Maddison is unlikely to feature again this season as he progresses through rehabilitation following a serious knee injury.\n\nUdogie’s hamstring injury is being monitored closely, with a return expected early in the new year rather than this weekend. Elsewhere, Takai also remains unavailable, adding further strain to squad depth.\n\nFrank has consistently played down timelines, preferring to reintegrate players only when they are fully ready. That approach is shaping Tottenham’s predicted lineup as much as tactical preference, with availability dictating selection more than form in several positions.\n\nTottenham are expected to line up in a 4-2-3-1 system, with Vicario in goal; Porro, Danso, van de Ven and potentially Udogie across the back; Bentancur and Gray in midfield; Kolo Muani, Bergvall and Kudus supporting Richarlison.\n\nThis match represents another test of Tottenham’s adaptability. While injuries and suspensions continue to disrupt continuity, there is a growing sense that the underlying structure is beginning to hold. How effectively this predicted lineup performs may go a long way towards defining the tone of Tottenham’s second half of the season.",

    "fullText": "With Donald Trump expanding the travel ban inspired by his first term in the White House to 20 more countries, as well as the Palestinian Authority, on Dec. 16, a total of 39 countries from different corners of the world now face either a total ban or restrictions on entering the United States.\n\nMali, South Sudan, Niger, Burkina Faso, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority have been added to the list of nations whose citizens cannot enter the U.S. at all, first introduced in June.\n\nAngola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were meanwhile added to a list of countries facing a block on student and business visas; the list that Trump put in place in June 2025 previously included Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.\n\nImmediately after their nations were added to the ban, multiple diplomats and heads of state responded with condemnation. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a statement saying that the Caribbean country's government was \"deeply disappointed\" given that the justification accusing it of loose rules for granting citizenship by investment \"does not reflect the present reality of our laws.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the expansion of the ban, the West African nation of Niger has taken the most drastic step of permanently banning any granting of new visas to U.S. visas in a reciprocal measure until the situation changes.\n\n\"Niger is completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States,\" a governmental representative said to the Associated Press.\n\nA landlocked country bordered by Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger is a Muslim-majority nation with a population of just over 25 million people. In the document announcing the travel ban, the White House said the country has a visa overstay rate of 13.41% for business visas and 16.46% for student ones as well as \"terrorists and their supporters [that] are active in planning kidnappings.\"\n\nWhile a history of war and political instability and coups d'états means that travel into Niger from Western countries remains very low (the State Department has kept it at the \"do not travel\" advisory level for years), the latest move from its government is a major escalation in relations.",

    "title": "Immigration lawyers say the H-1B chaos is forcing tough business calls",
    "description": "H-1B visa policy shifts in 2025 cause firms to reconsider staffing, use alternative visas, and update HR travel guidance.",
    "fullText": "Since September, the H-1B visa program has been caught in a whirlwind of changes.\n\nAs a result, companies nationwide are scrambling to determine their next steps, rewriting travel guidance for foreign workers, and lining up backup staffing plans, including shifting some work overseas, according to five immigration attorneys who spoke with Business Insider.\n\n\"Unpredictability is one of the number one enemies for business,\" said Rohit Srinivasa, an immigration attorney based in Los Angeles who works with startups and medium-sized tech companies.\n\nFirst came a $100,000 fee on new applications in September. Then came social media vetting requirements that left visa holders stranded abroad during the holidays. Now, a wage-based lottery system will favor the highest-paid applicants by giving them more chances in the annual H-1B lottery.\n\nImmigration lawyers say the constant policy shifts have companies tightening sponsorship guidelines, re-budgeting for higher costs, and gaming out contingency plans for a program that keeps changing shape.\n\nCompanies are taking a more calculated approach to who they sponsor for work visas and how they do so, attorneys told Business Insider.\n\nDivij Kishore, an immigration attorney at New York-based Flagship Law, which represents clients across various sectors, including tech, healthcare, and energy, told Business Insider that he has seen a 40% to 50% drop in H-1B sponsorship inquiries compared to previous years.\n\nTypically, by this time of the year, clients reach out with lists of employees they'd like to sponsor for the spring lottery, Kishore said.\n\n\"This year, that's not been the case because employers are just not sure what the costs are,\" Kishore said.\n\nOn the other hand, K. Edward Raleigh, a partner at immigration firm Fragomen, which represents some of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, including Apple and Nvidia, told Business Insider that he hasn't seen a material slowdown in H-1B filings overall, as most are renewals for existing workers.\n\nStill, companies are \"tightening up their sponsorship guidelines\" and \"proceeding with caution, understanding that various things could trigger the fee,\" he said.\n\nThis recalculation is occurring despite the $100,000 fee having a narrow scope. It applies to new visa petitions for workers living abroad and does not apply to the vast majority of cases, such as foreign students already in the US switching from an academic visa to a work visa or existing H-1B holders changing employers.\n\n\"One of the main attributes of this administration is that they keep people guessing,\" said Ted Chiappari, who leads the immigration practice at law firm Duane Morris. \"Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back to things on Wednesday.\"\n\nFewer H-1B visas have been issued to Indian IT consulting firms, according to data from the National Foundation for American Policy, an Arlington-based nonprofit research organization focused on immigration and international trade.\n\nInstead, for the first time in the program's history, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google occupied the top four spots for H-1B approvals in fiscal year 2025, a shift that began before the recent policy upheaval. The trend suggests companies were already reassessing tech hiring strategies before the recent policy changes.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Srinivasa believes the H-1B will endure, saying the program is \"so baked in\" to the US economy, he said, that it's undergoing overhaul rather than replacement.\n\nSome sectors saw more impact than others. Universities and nonprofit healthcare organizations that have historically recruited professors and medical workers from abroad have largely stopped filing petitions subject to the fee, Chiappari said. Unlike for-profit companies, these institutions can hire H-1B workers throughout the year without going through the annual lottery.\n\n\"That pipeline is now dried up,\" Chiappari said.\n\nRather than abandoning H-1B sponsorship, companies are exploring alternative pathways and backup strategies.\n\nSrinivasa said interest in O-1 visas for workers with \"extraordinary ability\" has surged, though not everyone qualifies. To qualify, applicants typically need to demonstrate a track record of impact and achievements in their field as evidenced by patents, awards, membership in select associations, and media coverage about them.\n\nSome founders from countries with US trade treaties are turning to E-2 investor visas, which also provide work authorization for spouses. Others are using the EB-1C path, where companies send managers abroad for a year before bringing them back to the US.\n\nCompanies are also increasingly establishing international offices and using L-1 visas to transfer employees to the US, or opting for services like Deel and Rippling that serve as the official employer, handling immigration paperwork on behalf of client companies.\n\nBig Tech, as well as Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have been expanding their operations in Indian cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad.\n\nKishore said some clients are preemptively reaching out to offshore providers to ramp up staffing capacity in case they are unable to bring workers to the US as planned.\n\n\"If they can't spend that same hundred dollars within the US next year, they will spend a hundred dollars outside the US,\" he added.\n\nStarting with the 2026 lottery, visa applications will be weighted based on salary level. Workers offered the highest wages will get four entries in the lottery, while those at the lowest tier get just one. The administration says this will ensure visas are awarded to the most skilled workers.\n\nRaleigh said companies are already thinking about how this will affect their recruitment strategy, \"without the exact terms of how those rules are going to work.\"\n\nThe change will likely benefit large tech companies that can afford to place workers in top salary bands, while creating challenges for smaller companies, nonprofits, and early-stage startups.\n\n\"Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission,\" said Sophie Alcorn, a Bay Area immigration attorney who focuses on startups and entrepreneurs. \"Those same startups may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system.\"\n\nKishore said that a higher salary doesn't always mean more skill. A first-year associate at a major law firm might make $225,000, while an equally qualified associate at a smaller firm makes significantly less. Under the new system, the big-firm lawyer would have much better lottery chances, he said.\n\nSome attorneys are advising clients not to artificially inflate salaries to game the system. Chiappari said the spread between wage levels is typically $20,000 to $30,000 — far less than the $100,000 fee — and companies aren't rushing to increase compensation anyway.\n\nImmigration attorneys previously thought that the $100,000 fee might improve the chances for foreign students already studying in the US by increasing their chances if fewer companies enter candidates in the lottery. Now, the wage-based lottery means that it might not happen.\n\n\"That logic's been turned on its head,\" said Kishore, adding that students, who typically enter the workforce at lower salaries, will get fewer chances at the lottery.\n\nBeyond policy changes, companies are also recalibrating their compliance strategies to avoid triggering fees or violating new rules.\n\nRaleigh said that ensuring workers maintain valid immigration status has become even more critical, as any lapse could force someone to leave the country and return on a new H-1B visa, potentially triggering the $10,000 fee.\n\nCompanies are updating their HR policies, including guidance on social media presence for foreign hires, in response to new vetting requirements, Srinivasa said. Some are advising employees to avoid international travel altogether, even when technically permitted.\n\nChiappari said he still gets constant questions from worried H-1B holders about whether it's safe to travel internationally.\n\n\"Even if I write a three-page affidavit explaining how they're not going to have any trouble coming back to the United States, they're just not going to believe it, and they're staying here,\" Chiappari said. \"They're just not traveling.\"\n\nThe human cost is real: postponed weddings, skipped vacations, and delayed work travel.\n\n\"Employers,\" Kishore said, \"need to be prepared and agile for what's coming in the next few months.\"",

    "description": "Fancy fliers are creating a huge boom in private-jet travel, no longer the exclusive province of Fortune 500 companies, Donald Trump, or Taylor Swift. Yet for all the allure of flying private, it’s a rather dangerous luxury.",
    "fullText": "THEY CALLED HER Gypset. The name, a combination of gypsy and jet set, wasn’t one she’d come up with herself; she’d gotten it from the writer Julia Chaplin, who coined the term in her 2009 book, Gypset Style, to evoke the vibe of bright young things who waft from Sayulita to Tangier to Topanga Canyon, crafting eclectic necklaces and draping yurts with Hermès cashmere. Athletic and glamorously bohemian, with glacial blue eyes and a silver ring in her nose, Gypset embodied her nickname’s ideal, always flying off to go skiing or hang out backstage at a rock show.\n\nHer given name was Lindsey Gleiche. She was 31 and lived in Huntington Beach, California, a short walk to the Pacific surf. Being a gypset is an occupation best suited for the independently wealthy, and Gleiche wasn’t that; she had a normal job, designing websites for Dollar General. But she was beautiful, friendly, and free-spirited.\n\nIn mid-2022, she met a man five years her junior, Riese Lenders, on a ski trip to Mammoth. Lenders was a pilot who was building his flight experience in Cessnas, turboprops, and small jets. He took her on jaunts to Las Vegas to see shows; to Arizona for her birthday; to the Bay Area for more music.\n\nIt was an intense but short-lived relationship. The two called it quits in spring 2023, but they continued to see each other occasionally, as exes sometimes do. On a Friday night in July, Gleiche was in her apartment getting ready to have dinner by herself when her phone rang. It was Lenders. He was about to take a spur-of-the-moment flight to Las Vegas with two older couples. The relationship was personal and professional—Lenders was working for Manuel Vargas, but the two were also friends. Perhaps that’s why Lenders was allowed to ask Gleiche if she wanted to tag along—they could make a night of it, hit some bars, and then fly home. What did she think?\n\nShe said yes right away. It was a nearly two-hour drive across the mountains to get to French Valley, the airstrip Lenders was departing from—a slog, but better than sitting at home on a Friday night.\n\nThe plane, a white Cessna Citation II jet with red and tan speed stripes, took off at 9:18 p.m. from the exurbs on the far side of the coastal mountains. Lenders, the pilot in command, sat in the front-left seat. To his right was his copilot, 32-year-old Vargas. Vargas had a successful real estate and landscaping business and flew helicopters, jets, and prop planes for both business and pleasure. He and his wife, Abby, had five kids, ranging in age from 1 to 14, and lived in a sprawling compound in Temecula. Abby was sitting in the back of the plane with Gleiche and the other couple, Alma, 51, and Abe Razick, 48. The Razicks had seven kids and owned several car dealerships in California and Arizona.",

    "description": "More than 122 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles for Christmas and New Year's holidays this year.",
    "fullText": "More than 60 million people across the U.S. are under winter weather alerts as a powerful storm system targets the Northeast after Christmas, while a separate atmospheric river continues to batter California with flooding rain, high winds and dangerous conditions.\n\nForecasters warn the systems could disrupt flights and road travel as millions of Americans head home after the holidays.\n\nThe severe weather is expected to unfold over several days, with impacts stretching from the West Coast to the Northeast. Forecasters say conditions on the ground could change quickly, affecting everything from short drives to long-distance travel. Here’s what to know about the most affected regions.\n\nThe tristate area is expected to bear the brunt of a major winter storm on Friday, with snow, sleet and freezing rain forecast to create hazardous travel conditions. Accumulating snow is forecast to hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — where a state of emergency has been declared — beginning Friday through early Saturday. Some forecast models suggest that parts of New York and New Jersey will see up to 9 inches of snow, depending on the storm’s track.\n\nThe storm is already disrupting air travel in the region. As of Friday morning, at least 1,300 flights across the U.S. had been canceled, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware, with delays expected to grow as the storm intensifies.\n\nSnowfall totals of roughly 1 to 6 inches are expected across northeastern Pennsylvania, much of New Jersey, large portions of New York state and parts of southern and central New England, with higher amounts possible in elevated areas north and west of New York City.\n\nThe system is also expected to bring sleet and freezing rain to parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and northern Virginia. A wintry mix is likely in cities including Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the West Coast, California is facing dangerous conditions from a powerful atmospheric river system bringing flooding rain, high winds and heavy mountain snow to the state.\n\nWith atmospheric rivers, intense rainfall, and strong winds ahead, I’m declaring a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties to activate emergency authorities and preposition resources to keep our communities safe. pic.twitter.com/C3eLImPkwx\n\n— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) December 24, 2025\n\nThe storm has already turned deadly, with at least three deaths reported in Southern California.\n\nParts of Southern California saw record-breaking rainfall earlier this week, with some locations seeing their wettest Christmas Eve or Christmas-week totals in decades.\n\nThe prolonged rainfall has increased the threat of mudslides, particularly in areas recently burned by wildfires. Officials have urged residents to avoid flooded roadways and to be prepared to evacuate if conditions worsen.\n\nAt higher elevations, the same storm system has delivered dangerous winter weather to the Sierra Nevada, making mountain travel hazardous across parts of California and western Nevada.\n\nAvalanche warnings were issued for parts of the Sierra as heavy snow and strong winds created unstable conditions in the mountains. Forecasters say 5 to 10 feet of snow could pile up in some high-elevation areas, significantly increasing avalanche risk and making travel especially dangerous through the weekend.\n\nThe Sierra Avalanche Center has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Watch for the backcountry areas around the Greater Lake Tahoe region as high avalanche danger is expected Thursday.

The American Automobile Association estimates that more than 122 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles during the end-of-year holiday period, increasing the potential for widespread delays as severe weather moves across the country.",

He works in IT and earns about $90,000 a year, while she earns roughly $55,000. He wrote that growing up lower middle class shaped his careful approach to money.\n\nUntil recently, he wrote, their everyday spending had felt manageable.

He created a rough budget covering flights, hotels, trains, food, and tours, estimating the total at about $4,500 for both of them — excluding shopping.\n\nHe suggested that if they started saving immediately, each could set aside about $400 to $450 per month over several months and split the cost evenly.\n\nAfter reviewing the spreadsheet, she laughed and questioned why he was treating the trip \"like a business contract,\" pointing out that he earns significantly more.

During that discussion, she compared him to an ex who never asked her to pay for vacations.\n\nSince then, he said, the tension continued. She made sarcastic comments about money during meals, and later compromise proposals were dismissed.\n\nHe suggested splitting costs based on income, such as a 60-40 arrangement or covering flights while she handled her spending money. She rejected those options, saying they showed he was \"keeping score.\"\n\nRead Next: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "fullText": "Republican senators have joined Democrats to issue a pointed message to Donald Trump as he prepares to meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nZelensky, 47, will travel to Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a possible peace agreement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump, 79, who previously tried to bully Ukraine into accepting a U.S.-brokered deal favorable to Vladimir Putin.\n\nAfter Putin, 73, hit Ukraine with hundreds of drones and missiles over Christmas, GOP senators Thom Tillis, Jerry Moran, and John Barrasso, along with Democratic colleagues, offered a reminder that Putin, 73, is a “ruthless murderer.”\n\n“Today’s decision by Putin to launch attacks rather than hold fire is a sobering reminder for us all: Putin is a ruthless murderer who has no interest in peace and cannot be trusted,” reads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee release.\n\nThe senators added, “It bears repeating that President Zelenskyy agreed to a Christmas truce, but Putin declined, yet he directs soldiers to continue to commit brutal crimes of aggression on one of Christianity’s holiest days.”\n\nTillis, 65, a senator from North Carolina, Moran, 71, a senator from Kansas, and Barrasso, 73, a senator from Wyoming, were joined by Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, Jacky Rosen, Chris Coons, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nThe message was not joined by more MAGA-friendly members of the committee, including its Republican chairman Jim Risch and Texas’ Ted Cruz.\n\nOnce firmly in control of congressional Republicans, Trump’s influence has weakened in recent months as his approval rating has plummeted and the GOP has lost in contests across the country.\n\nThe defeats suggest a path for Democrats to reclaim at least partial control of Congress in the 2026 midterms by flipping the House and even the Senate, leaving Trump to serve the remainder of his second term as a lame-duck president.\n\nMoreover, the trio of Republican senators is largely free from electoral pressure: Tillis is retiring in 2027, Moran faces reelection in 2028, and Barrasso in 2030.\n\nCritics have long accused Trump of playing into Putin’s hands while being hostile towards Ukraine and other traditional allies.\n\nIn recent months, he launched a diplomatic push to end the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, but his proposed peace plan initially reflected many of Putin’s demands, blindsiding Zelensky and European allies.\n\nThe demands included limitations on Ukraine’s military and, crucially, the surrender of territory to Russia.\n\nLast month, Trump melted down at Ukraine on Truth Social, claiming that Zelensky had shown “ZERO GRATITUDE” in a message echoing his tantrum at their contentious Oval Office meeting in February. Zelensky responded by thanking Trump again.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader announced Thursday that he’d had a “good conversation” with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nHe told reporters Friday that he plans to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine with Trump on Sunday, as well as the “sensitive issue” of possible territorial concessions.\n\nWhile Zelesnky said the 20-point plan under discussion “is about 90% ready,” he cautioned, “Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree.”",

    "fullText": "A turbulent year for air travel isn't over yet.\n\nSnow and rainstorms hit multiple states on both coasts on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and are now heading for the Northeast, including New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Travellers are now having a difficult time getting home as major airports see mass delays and cancellations.\n\nAccording to the \"Misery Map,\" published by FlightAware, which tracks real-time flight disruptions, there have been over 1,000 delays and more than 350 cancellations across the largest US airports as of 6:45 p.m. ET on Friday.\n\nHere's a look at the latest flight disruptions, and when you may expect to fly if your flight has been canceled.\n\nThe storm that first hit the Midwest is coming for the East Coast. New York City is set to see the most snow it has seen in years, since the last time it saw at least 4 inches of snow was January 2022. New Jersey and upstate New York will see similar weather conditions.\n\nThe NYC Emergency Management said in a press release that \"snow is expected to develop Friday afternoon and intensify into steady, accumulating snow Friday night.\" The National Weather Service has forecast 3 to 7 inches of snow with locally higher amounts possible.\n\nAccording to FlightAware, JFK International Airport is experiencing 369 cancellations, with 210 on Friday alone. The situation at Newark Liberty International Airport is also not optimistic, with 244 cancellations and counting.\n\nBased on the Misery Map, flights from airports around NYC to Chicago, Detroit, and Denver are seeing the highest number of delays and cancellations.\n\nThe West Coast is slowly recovering from an exceptionally wet Christmas.\n\nOver the past two days, most residents of California have received at least one weather warning as an atmospheric river accompanied by high winds, floods, and mudslides hit the Golden State. The NWS said that this Christmas season is the wettest one Los Angeles has experienced in 54 years.\n\nThe San Francisco International Airport said that 153 flights had been delayed on Friday morning due to windy conditions. To make matters worse, the police briefly shut down Terminal 1 due to a \"suspicious package,\" but then reopened it without explanation. By midday, FlightAware reports that a total of 381 flights from SFO have been delayed.\n\nAccording to the Misery Map, flights from the Los Angeles International Airport to Seattle, Salt Lake City, Denver, and the East Coast are all experiencing disruptions. FlightAware counted a total of 283 delays and 41 cancellations.\n\nThe disruptions come at the end of a tough year for air travel.\n\nHigh-profile plane accidents, including when an American Airlines Flight crashed into a Black Hawk helicopter, and the firing of hundreds of FAA employees by the White House DOGE office, triggered a newfound fear of flying among some Americans earlier this year.\n\nThe subsequent government shutdown also led to flying snags this year, as air traffic controllers who were left without pay called in sick, and some airports were paralyzed.",

Getting around was tiring enough in familiar places.\n\nI used a cane, and encountered tons of obstacles and problems — like crossing paths with people who were looking at their phones. The idea of navigating this in a completely new country sounded like a horror-movie plot.\n\nNow, my dog and I have been to 16 countries together — he's been an important constant in my life as I've eaten crickets in Mexico and visited museums in Germany.\n\nI wouldn't change our journey for anything, but it hasn't always been easy — mainly because of the judgment we face from others.\n\nWhen I travel with Indio, there are so many things I just don't have to think about.\n\nHe'll learn my hotel room as soon as we set foot inside, and help direct me to places we already know if I get lost after a day of exploring. I no longer have to depend on fellow travelers when I'm on a city tour, because my dog can follow a guide independently if I ask him to.\n\nCrucially, I feel like I can now walk around an unfamiliar city without having to worry nonstop. I can simply enjoy the feeling of being in a new place, listening to people speaking different languages around me, knowing that Indio is by my side to keep me safe.\n\nHaving this security has helped me go on adventures I'd never expected. Without thinking twice, I took a four-hour bus ride from Prague and woke up in Vienna with no plan except to explore.\n\nWithout Indio, this wouldn't be possible — and the ability to travel freely is not something I take for granted. Sometimes, though, having him with me brings problems that I wish I could avoid.\n\nWhen I decided to get a guide dog, the first thing many people told me was that I had to give up my dreams of traveling, especially abroad.\n\nSome dogs struggle with changes in environments, and most countries also require multiple types of documentation for traveling with service animals. Plus, I often have to fill out lots of extra airline forms whenever I fly with him.\n\nIn many cases, I also prepare myself for how people — especially those who haven't encountered a guide dog in public — might react when they see us exploring the streets of their city.\n\nSadly, my worries aren't unfounded. Once, I had to miss a museum tour because I struggled to find a taxi driver who would allow my dog in the car. Other times, I've been stopped from entering supermarkets.\n\nPractically everywhere we go, we have to deal with people who don't know how to act around a guide dog — whether they try to pet him at times when it's dangerous for him to get distracted, or they react with fear or surprise at his presence.\n\nDespite the issues we've faced, being able to travel with Indio is one of the most rewarding things I've ever done in my life.\n\nEven when there are snags or setbacks, there are kind, positive moments that restore my faith and joy in traveling, too. I've encountered strangers who were willing to help support Indio and me, even though there was no incentive beyond kindness to do so.\n\nAt the end of the day, I just wish certain people we've encountered would recognize that, for me, traveling with Indio isn't a choice. He gives me freedom and a gateway to a world I never thought I would know.\n\nNo matter what, I'll continue traveling and occupying space — because, despite my limitations, I believe that the world is too big to wait for someone to tell me about it at home.",

In Philadelphia, you can expect a mix of sleet and freezing rain with some snow. South Jersey and Delaware will transition to rain at some point overnight Friday.\n\nThe Philly area will start seeing precipitation around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on Friday, again moving west to east. Then, models predict the storm will move offshore sometime between 10 a.m. and noon on Saturday.\n\nModels vary about potential snow totals. But in general, forecasters predict between one and two inches of snow in northern Delaware, 1.5–4 inches in the Philadelphia area, and higher snow totals the further north you travel.\n\nPhiladelphia, according to the National Weather Service, has a nearly 30% chance of seeing 4 inches of snow/sleet or more by Satuday morning, with those chances being as high as 63% just 30 miles north in Trenton.\n\nIn addition to snow, experts predict large ice accumulation overnight Friday into Saturday, making streets and sidewalks dangerously slippery.\n\nThe National Weather Service says that people \"should consider delaying all travel\" until after the winter storm is over.\n\n\"If travel is absolutely necessary, drive with extreme caution,\" the NWS said, recommending travelers bring safety kits and other supplies in the event that they get stranded.\n\nInformation in this story is from FOX 29 meteorologist Sue Serio and the National Weather Service.",

    "description": "Cities in Japan, Scotland, and Spain are among the destinations that will become more expensive to visit in 2026 because of tourist taxes.",
    "fullText": "Tourists visiting Edinburgh after July 24 next year will be charged an extra 5% on top of their accommodation costs for the first five nights of their stay.\n\nThe City of Edinburgh Council said the charge is intended to raise money that will \"sustain Edinburgh's status as one of the world's greatest cultural and heritage cities.\"\n\nEvery year, Edinburgh's summer festivals — the Edinburgh International Festival, Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo — draw millions of tourists.\n\nThe council said the visitor levy is expected to raise up to £50 million ($67 million) a year by 2029, with the revenue earmarked for things like improving city infrastructure and managing tourism.\n\nTourists love Kyoto for its ancient temples, pagodas, and its cherry blossoms. But from early next year, staying in the Japanese city will become more expensive.\n\nAfter March 1, visitors in Kyoto will face higher overnight taxes on accommodation across the city.\n\nThe tax is tiered according to the nightly cost of accommodation: rooms under 6,000 yen, about $38, a night will remain taxed at 200 yen, or $1.28, while the tax on rooms priced between 6,000 and 20,000 yen a night will double to 400 yen.\n\nThe steepest increases will be applied to high-end accommodations. Rooms costing 50,000 to 100,000 yen a night will see the tax jump from 1,000 to 4,000 yen, and those over 100,000 yen will rise tenfold to 10,000 yen.\n\nKyoto's government estimates the revised tax will generate 12.6 billion yen a year, about $81 million.\n\nBarcelona is one of Europe's most visited cities, famed for its unusual architecture and urban beaches.\n\nTourists staying in five-star hotels and other luxury accommodations in the city now pay a regional tourism tax of 3.50 euros, about $4, a night.\n\nBut under a revised Catalan tax framework, that regional levy on high-end accommodation in Barcelona is set to double to 7 euros.\n\nThe increase was initially scheduled for 2025, but the Catalan government has delayed implementation until at least April 2026.\n\nThe measure comes amid growing anti-tourism sentiment in Spain. In the summers of 2024 and 2025, protesters in Barcelona demonstrated against overtourism and rising living costs.\n\nIn 2023, Thailand's cabinet approved in principle a 300 baht, about $10, entry fee for visitors arriving by air, and half that amount for those arriving by land or sea.\n\nThe fee was originally expected to be implemented in 2025, but it has repeatedly been delayed, partly because of weak tourism numbers.\n\nTourist arrivals from the start of this year to December 21 fell 7.25% compared to the same period a year earlier, according to Thailand's Ministry of Tourism and Sports.\n\nInternational tourism has long been a pillar of Thailand's economy, with visitors drawn to its temples, islands, and elephant treks.\n\nEuroNews reported that the 300 baht fee is now expected to be introduced in mid-2026.\n\nThe Norwegian government has introduced a law that gives municipalities the authority to impose a 3% tax on tourist accommodations, targeting both cruises and overnight stays.\n\nIt will roll out in 2026. It is not automatically in place in all municipalities, and cities struggling with the impact of tourism need to apply to implement the fee.\n\nMunicipalities such as Lofoten and Tromsø, which are renowned for their views of the northern lights, have already opted in, according to travel magazine AFAR.\n\nUnlike Thailand, Norway had a tourism boom this year. June, July, and August each broke records for the number of nights visitors spent in the country, totaling about 17.7 million guest nights across the summer, according to Norwegian tourism statistics.",

    "fullText": "Heavy rain and fierce winds from an atmospheric storm slammed Southern California on Wednesday, flooding roads and triggering mudslides as authorities urged parts of the region to evacuate.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties on Wednesday. Some areas had already received 4 to 8 inches of rain by Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAnother wave of the storm was expected to hit on Christmas Day, with flood and wind advisories for \"life-threatening\" storm conditions from the National Weather Service remaining in effect until Thursday afternoon.\n\nOver 163,000 homes and businesses across California were still without power on Christmas morning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Redding Police Department reported one storm-related fatality in Northern California. Two more deaths occurred in South Sacramento and San Diego, CNN reported.\n\nThe storms are affecting the entire state, from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\n\nThe storms began on Christmas Eve, with the Weather Prediction Center warning that a \"dangerous scenario\" was on the way.\n\nPer CNN, 15 million people were still in the moderate-risk zone for flooding on Christmas Day.\n\nThe airport saw 3 inches of rainfall on the 24th.\n\nAccording to CNN, emergency crews were pulling people from flooded cars and homes, and some people even had to be rescued from their roofs via helicopter.\n\nSarah Bailey, a resident of the Wrightwood area for two decades, told the Times this was the worst flooding she'd seen.\n\nChristopher Prater, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department, told the outlet they'd received \"dozens\" of rescue calls on Wednesday night.\n\nA Pineapple Express is an atmospheric river, a band of concentrated water vapor. These \"rivers\" are responsible for 30 to 50% of California's rainfall.\n\nThe power outages are focused in Northern California, according to The New York Times.\n\nAny additional rainfall that comes on the 25th and 26th, even if it's less intense, could cause more flooding and debris to wash away, especially in areas that were devastated by the LA wildfires earlier this year.\n\n\"I am urging all Angelenos to stay safe and be extremely careful on the roads if you absolutely must travel,\" Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said in a statement. \"Please do not take this storm lightly.\"",

    "fullText": "There's no shortage of flight horror stories, but a bed bug infestation sounds particularly unsettling.\n\nThe Albuquerque's, a family of four from Virginia, filed a lawsuit against Delta and KLM on December 18 after they said they experienced a \"bed bug infestation\" on a flight from March 21.\n\n\"While aboard a Delta and KLM flight across the Atlantic, the entire Albuquerque Family was bitten and injured by bed bugs that had infested the cabin of the plane,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe family claimed in the lawsuit that the bites led to \"raised and itchy welts, lesions, and rashes across their torsos and extremities.\"\n\nThe lawsuit said the family wishes to be compensated for the incident, which \"ruined their family vacation\" and caused \"embarrassment, anxiety, discomfort, inconvenience, medical expenses, and loss of clothing and personal items.\"\n\nThe Albuquerque's took a Delta flight from Roanoke to Atlanta, then a KLM flight to Amsterdam, and then to Belgrade, Serbia, according to the lawsuit. The family had planned a vacation to Serbia to visit family and friends, the lawsuit stated.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Delta said that \"the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines.\" The airline added that it will \"review the complaint and respond accordingly in due course.\"\n\nThe filing states the flights were round-trip and business class, purchased through Delta's SkyMiles program, and operated by KLM. The four tickets were worth $8,800 at the time, according to the suit.\n\nRoughly two hours into the flight to Amsterdam, one of the plaintiffs started to feel like she was being bitten by bugs crawling on her, according to the filing. She then realized that bugs were \"crawling on her light-colored sweater,\" the filing stated.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the couple \"immediately\" notified the flight staff and were told to keep their voices down to avoid causing \"panic\" on the plane. The couple took photos and videos of the bugs crawling on the sweater and in the creases of their seats, which were included in the lawsuit.\n\nPrior to landing, the flight attendants urged the couple again not to tell anyone about the infestation because they would miss their connecting flight to Serbia if they did, the filing stated.\n\nA little over a week after the incident, the couple took their children to doctors in Roanoke, Virginia, where it was confirmed that the bites were caused by bed bugs, the lawsuit said. The family was recommended to employ \"bug bombs\" in their home and car, and wash their clothing in hot water, the filing said.\n\nWhile bed bugs are an unusual complaint, this isn't the first time passengers have turned to the courts after a bad flight experience. In September, 16 passengers sued American Airlines after their flight caught fire. Last year, a passenger sued Delta for $1 million, alleging a faulty armrest broke his rib.\n\nKLM did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "The holidays are all about time with family and friends. For some of us, that means pullout couches and six to a bathroom. For others, it's a villa in St. Barts or a ski house in Aspen.\n\nNow that the end of the year is upon us, the uber-wealthy are deploying their private jets and superyachts and heading to expensive destinations to enjoy vacations — and often the company of other billionaires.\n\n\"It's going to places that are exclusively pretty much high net worth,\" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. \"They want these private resorts away from everyone else.\"\n\nMany of the world's largest yachts have already sailed to warmer waters.\n\nMark Zuckerberg's yacht, Launchpad, is in the Gulf of California, not far from Cabo San Lucas.\n\nOn the other side of the continent, Jeff Bezos's Koru, David Geffen's Rising Sun, and Eric Schmidt's Whisper are among the dozens of yachts floating in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nOnce their billionaire owners are aboard, several of these ships will likely head to St. Barts to celebrate New Year's Eve.\n\n\"I always say if you want to have your toes in the sand and eat a croissant that feels like you're in Paris, St. Barts is the place for you,\" Elisabeth Brown, the membership director at the luxury concierge service Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider.\n\nThose who don't stay aboard their ships can spend upward of $7,000 a night for a room — and well into five figures a night for a suite — at luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by the billionaire Bernard Arnault's LVMH.\n\nThe steep price is part of the appeal.\n\n\"There is nothing mass-market about it,\" Chesterfield said. \"It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy.\"\n\nOther superrich travelers choose to embrace the winter weather.\n\n\"The holidays in the mountains are more of an escape than any other holidays, even escapes to their own remote private islands and things,\" Chesterfield said.\n\nIn Europe, that means the Alps. Gstaad, St. Moritz, Courchevel — which used to be a favorite of Russian oligarchs — and Val-d'Isère are classic choices for the ultrahigh-net-worth set, Chesterfield and Brown said.\n\nReal-estate prices continue to rise in these locations, with homes in Gstaad, the most expensive locale, costing as much as 47,300 euros, or about $55,600, per square meter, according to the property consultancy Knight Frank's 2025 Alpine Index.\n\nStateside, Aspen, Vail, and Carbondale in Colorado are among the most popular ski resorts for the ultrawealthy, Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider.\n\nAspen has the highest density of homeowners worth more than $30 million in the US and the second-highest in the world, behind Monaco, according to a 2025 report by the wealth-tracking firm Altrata.\n\nHedge fund titan Ken Griffin, Walmart heir Rob Walton, and businessman Charles Koch are among the richest of those with second (or third or fourth) homes near the ski resort. Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos are regular visitors.\n\n\"It is the closest you'll get to a European après situation,\" Brown said. \"Great mountains, great skiing, the hotels are top-notch, the restaurants are awesome.\"\n\nThere's a restaurant by the chef Nobu Matsuhisa, designer shops like Gucci and Prada, and private clubs like Casa Tua and the Caribou Club to make the überrich feel at home.\n\nBut skiing is the real draw. The No. 1 interest of Aspen's ultra-high-net-worth homeowners is sports, according to Altrata.\n\nThose with more spiritual interests may prefer a different type of trip — quite literally.\n\n\"They're doing these inward journeys with psychedelics,\" Garcia said of several R360 members doing retreats in places like Peru or Costa Rica.\n\nMaybe a little plant medicine is the secret to families getting along over the holiday.\n\nThis story was initially published in December 2024 and has been updated with new information.",

The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.\n\nRead our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here\n\nIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.\n\nRead our review of Ball X Pit here\n\nIf you are \n\nRead our review of Blue Prince here\n\nWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.\n\nCheck out a bit of the history behind Peak here\n\nWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!\n\nRead our review of Super Smash Bros.

    "description": "After spending more than 80 days on different cruise lines this year, I rounded up the travel mistakes I'll avoid making when I set sail in 2026.",
    "fullText": "In 2025, I spent about 85 days at sea across several cruise lines, sailing on some of the world's largest mega-ships and smaller vessels with fewer than 200 guests.\n\nI explored the Mediterranean, rode the Rhine River from Amsterdam to Basel, made several runs through the Caribbean, coasted the Mexican Riviera, and visited many places off my bucket list.\n\nAll of the globe-trotting sounds pretty glamorous (and parts of it absolutely were), but now that I'm reflecting on my year, I realize I made several mistakes that left me more exhausted than energized.\n\nHere are mistakes I don't want to repeat in 2026 — and a few smart travel strategies that I plan to continue.\n\nI love going on cruises and am fortunate to do so often for work.\n\nHowever, boarding more than 10 ships in 12 months — including doing a stint of several back-to-back sailings around Europe — was simply too much, even for me.\n\nAll the itineraries started to blend together. Throughout the year, I would scroll through my camera roll and struggle to remember which ship I was on or which port I'd seen three weeks earlier.\n\nI never had enough time to decompress, reflect, or even appreciate where I'd just been before boarding the next vessel.\n\nTravel is supposed to create memories, not erase them through sheer volume. In 2026, I plan to slow down (a bit), so I can really savor my trips.\n\nThe Mediterranean is beautiful, but I wish I hadn't spent several weeks there in July and August — some of the area's hottest, busiest months.\n\nWhile docked in places like Turkey and Greece, temperatures climbed over 80 or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat and humidity put a damper on my trip, sometimes making sightseeing feel like a survival training exercise.\n\nAdditionally, I was one of many tourists visiting these countries during their busiest travel season.\n\nI reached my breaking point in Santorini, which had been on my bucket list for years. Instead of the magical experience I imagined, I spent my time wading through crowds in near-suffocating heat.\n\nAfter standing for over two hours in the direct sun, waiting in a mile-long line just to take the gondola back down to where my ship was docked, I had mentally checked out.\n\nThough these places are incredible, I couldn't fully appreciate them. In the future, I'd like to prioritize traveling during the shoulder seasons for milder weather and fewer crowds.\n\nI made a major tactical error this year: I booked too many port-intensive itineraries that had zero sea days.\n\nThat meant I was \"on\" every single day — exploring, touring, photographing content, and rushing back on board just in time to shower and run to dinner.\n\nThat pace isn't sustainable for anyone, let alone someone who's stacking cruises without a break.\n\nThe real loss is that I barely enjoyed the ships themselves and rarely took advantage of the amenities, such as swim-up bars, spas, and waterslides, that make certain vessels special.\n\nNot having sea days already made it tough to take a break, but constantly giving in to my fear of missing out didn't help.\n\nWhenever I had the chance to explore a city, try a new activity, or join another excursion, I said yes. Repeatedly.\n\nI never carved out time for rest, which is ironic given that cruising is designed to be one of the most relaxing ways to travel. I didn't nap, linger over breakfast, lounge by the pool, or even sit on my balcony with a book.\n\nInstead, I packed my schedule with excursions because I didn't want to miss a thing at each stop. By the time I returned to the ship most evenings, I was just exhausted and desperate for a shower.\n\nHeading into the new year, I'm reminding myself that rest isn't optional; it's a strategy. Being well-rested makes any cruise far more enjoyable.\n\nI consider myself a good packer, but even I struggled this year when my itineraries shifted climates faster than I could keep up.\n\nFor example, while in Europe, I went straight from blistering heat in Greece, Croatia, Montenegro, and Turkey to the cool, rainy Rhine Valley.\n\nI ended up having to stop in Amsterdam to buy a sweater and a rain jacket — which I wore on repeat — just to comfortably get through the river cruise.\n\nNext year, I'll check the weather forecasts for every stop on an itinerary before leaving for a cruise (or any multi-stop trip).\n\nThis experience also served as another reminder to slow down and not overbook myself with back-to-back itineraries.\n\nI didn't get everything wrong this year. In fact, a few strategies paid off that I plan to continue:\n\nStill, heading into 2026, I hope to make a few intentional shifts, from scaling back on excursions to cruising during shoulder seasons whenever possible.\n\nThis time, I'll let myself enjoy the ships as much as the ports — even if that means ordering room service in my robe and doing absolutely nothing for a whole afternoon.\n\nIf 2025 was about seeing everything, 2026 will be about savoring it.",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is gathering with top national security officials on Monday, a meeting that comes as the U.S. Coast Guard steps up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Republican administration's escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan are scheduled to join Trump, who is vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort, for what the White House called a \"major announcement.\" Trump plans to discuss a shipbuilding initiative at the event, according to a White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Trump's gathering of key members of his national security team also comes at yet another inflection point in Trump's four-month pressure campaign on the Maduro government, which began with the stated purpose of stemming the flow of illegal drugs from the South American nation but has developed into something more amorphous.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has started evacuating the families of diplomats from Venezuela, according to a European intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\n\nThe official told The Associated Press the evacuations include women and children and began on Friday. The official said Russian Foreign Ministry officials are assessing the situation in Venezuela in “very grim tones.” The White House and Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday continued for the second day to chase a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration describes as part of a “dark fleet” Venezuela is using to evade U.S. sanctions. The tanker, the official added, is flying under a false flag and is under a U.S. judicial seizure order.\n\nIt is the third ship pursued by the Coast Guard, which on Saturday seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries that U.S. officials said was part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet.\n\nThe Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, seized a sanctioned tanker called Skipper on Dec. 10, also part of the shadow fleet of tankers that the U.S. says operates on the fringes of the law to move sanctioned cargo. That ship was registered in Panama.\n\nTrump, after that first seizure, said the U.S. would carry out a “blockade” of Venezuela. Trump has repeatedly said that Maduro's days in power are numbered.\n\nLast week, Trump demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against sanctioned oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said in a Monday appearance on “Fox & Friends” that the targeting of tankers is intended to send “a message around the world that the illegal activity that Maduro is participating in cannot stand, he needs to be gone, and that we will stand up for our people.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department, under Trump's orders, continues its campaign of attacks on smaller vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that it alleges are carrying drugs to the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.",

    "fullText": "The world's largest technology companies are scrambling to manage a growing crisis affecting thousands of their employees on work visas, as new social media screening requirements trigger delays at US embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and ServiceNow have all sent advisories to visa-holding employees in recent days, warning them against international travel and describing appointment delays stretching up to a year.\n\nThe memos, sent by immigration law firms representing these companies or by their internal legal teams, paint a picture of mounting uncertainty for foreign workers who form a critical part of the tech industry's workforce.\n\nThe warnings come as American embassies have postponed routine visa stamping appointments, leaving some employees already abroad unable to return to work in the US for extended periods.\n\nFor H-1B holders, the primary work visa used by tech companies, the situation creates a particularly difficult bind. If their visa stamp expires and they travel abroad, they must obtain a new stamp at a consulate before re-entering the US. With appointments now being rescheduled months into the future, what would typically be a routine trip home has become a potential career disruption lasting up to a year.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was now conducting \"online presence reviews for applicants.\" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,\" the State Department spokesperson said. Appointments in Ireland and Vietnam have also been postponed, according to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC.\n\nBelow are the full texts of the internal memos sent to employees at these companies, obtained by Business Insider, which reveal how corporate America is responding to the visa processing slowdown.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple and ServiceNow did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBelow is the text of a memo sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (BAL), the immigration firm that represents Google.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Apple's immigration team.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by ServiceNow's Global Mobility Team.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Doug Beachy, 61, upsized to a larger vacation home so his entire family could gather in one place, visit more frequently, and have more fun together.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 61-year-old Doug Beachy, a Cincinnati-based business owner who bought a vacation home with Pacaso in 2022. Pacaso is a platform for fractional ownership of luxury vacation homes. The company allows multiple individuals to co-own a second home and share ownership of the property. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been married to my wife, Jamie, for 37 years. We have four married children and 16 grandchildren. Our oldest grandchild is 12, and our youngest isn't quite one yet.\n\nOnce our kids started having children, they all moved back closer to home in Cincinnati, where we live. We own a five-bedroom home that's about 4,000 square feet. We're empty nesters, so there's plenty of space for us, but when the whole family is over, everyone is on top of each other.\n\nWe've converted one room into a kids' playroom and another into a nursery, and we have a finished basement where the kids can play, but family gatherings are still a bit hectic.\n\nIn the past, to bring everyone together, we would either rent a large beach house or book a cabin-style retreat in the woods here in Ohio.\n\nWe did that about every other year because it's hard to coordinate everyone's schedules — especially with grandkids in school — and seasonal rates for a large home are expensive. It was a big chunk of money for just a week's experience.\n\nHilton Head Island has always been a fun family destination for us. It's an island in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, just outside Savannah, Georgia, with about 12 miles of pristine beaches.\n\nThere's so much to do here from a family activity standpoint, in addition to simply soaking up the sun and going to the beach — it's just a great place to relax and unwind.\n\nHomes here can be expensive, though. The average home is priced in the upper $700,000s, and properties can sell for as much as $10 million. For a while, I thought about buying a second, larger home here, but I'm not retired yet, and I realized that putting that much money into a house where I don't live full time just didn't make sense.\n\nIn early 2022, I started exploring different homeownership options, including shared or fractional ownership. That's when I found Pacaso online and saw they had some homes available in Hilton Head.\n\nWe ultimately settled on an about 5,000-square-foot home with six spacious suite-like bedrooms — five with king-sized beds, large walk-in closets, and private bathrooms, and one with several bunk beds for the children — and seven and a half bathrooms.\n\nAs you can imagine, taking 20 people out to eat all the time is not exactly fun, so we wanted a house with a large, well-stocked kitchen. Our kitchen almost occupies the entire second floor and, by my last count, it can seat 19 or 20 people. It also has a beautiful ocean view.\n\nWhen we bought the home, it was valued at over $5 million. We own a 1/8 share — we made a 50% down payment on our portion of the home — and there are seven other owners, whom we don't know.\n\nOur friends will say, \"It sounds like a timeshare.\" But I think it's much more transparent than a traditional timeshare. There are no extra markups or mystery fees added on top.\n\nI also feel that, unlike a timeshare, which can leave you feeling stuck and lose value over time, this is a long-term investment. Of course, everything depends on the real-estate market, but I feel fairly confident this is an appreciating asset.\n\nI think going this route, instead of buying another second or vacation home, has eliminated all the concerns I had about upsizing — like having to maintain the home ourselves or deal with high HOA fees. We wanted a place we could share with family, and this setup works well for us at this stage of our lives.\n\nPacaso provides a house manager who handles everything. It's essentially a concierge service — the home is clean when we arrive and fully stocked with towels, linens, soaps, and disposable items, such as paper towels and paper plates.\n\nWhen we go, the only thing we really need to think about is what food we want to buy, depending on what we plan to cook — and we have a lot of good cooks in the family.\n\nWe have the home reserved for 44 nights a year, and we use nearly all of that time. Not everyone in the family is there for every stay, but they come as they please.\n\nOur family gets together more often now, about twice a year. In the summer, during the high season when the kids are out of school, we typically reserve the house for a couple of weeks at a time.\n\nThe grandkids look forward to each trip and talk about it all the time. Many of them are around the same age, and they love the opportunity to spend time with their cousins.\n\nThe house came with six beach cruiser bikes, which is perfect because there are plenty of biking trails on the island. It also has a private pool and hot tub, and the grandkids love that it's fully stocked with games and puzzles.\n\nOur favorite things to do with them are spending time in the pool, watching the sunrise, and hanging out on the beach. We also take a lot of bike rides and play pickleball. We just love how much more quality time we're spending together as a family.",

    "fullText": "West Ham United travel to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday afternoon to face an in-form Manchester City side.\n\nThe Hammers arrive in Manchester on the back of a damaging 3-2 home defeat, a result that extended their winless run.\n\nWest Ham are rooted in the relegation zone heading into the festive period.\n\nThe Irons are now 18th in the table, three points adrift of safety, and defeat this weekend would guarantee they spend Christmas inside the bottom three.\n\nUnfortunately for Hammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo, he must prepare for one of the toughest fixtures in English football with a depleted squad and mounting pressure.\n\nSince the end of October, Man City have taken things up a notch.\n\nPep Guardiola‘s side have won 10 of their last 12 matches across all competitions and are back in the title race.\n\nCity extended their winning run to six games in mid-week by beating Brentford 2-0 to reach the EFL Cup semi-finals.\n\nThey sit just two points behind leaders Arsenal and could briefly move to the top with a victory before the Gunners face Everton later on Saturday.\n\nWest Ham, by contrast, are struggling for momentum.\n\nSince Nuno’s arrival, the Hammers have picked up just two wins from 11 Premier League games, with a five-match winless run keeping them entrenched in danger.\n\nHowever, there is some encouragement on the road for the East London side.\n\nWest Ham are unbeaten in their last three away league matches, drawing all three, and twice taking the lead before being pegged back.\n\nMan City are unbeaten in their last 19 Premier League meetings with West Ham (W16, D3), winning each of the last five while scoring at least three goals in every match.\n\nWest Ham have lost 15 of their last 16 Premier League away games against City, conceding two or more goals on 13 occasions.\n\nCity have won seven consecutive home league games since their defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and have collected more home points than any side since April.\n\nIf West Ham are to defy history, they will need discipline, structure, and no shortage of resilience.\n\nWest Ham will be without Aaron Wan-Bissaka and El Hadji Malick Diouf, both away on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Senegal and DR Congo.\n\nNiclas Fullkrug and Lukasz Fabianski are minor doubts and will be assessed closer to kick-off.\n\nNuno will likely stick to a back three against City. Kyle Walker-Peters, who brings ‘high quality’, is in contention to start at wing-back alongside 20-year-old Oliver Scarles.\n\nWalker-Peters has the unenviable job of curtailing the Premier League’s most unpredictable dribbler (Jeremy Doku).\n\nExpect to see Max Kilman in the starting XI alongside Konstantinos Mavropanos and Jean-Clair Todibo, shielding Alphonse Areola in goal.\n\nIn midfield, Soungoutou Magassa and Freddie Potts are expected to retain their places after starting against Aston Villa.\n\nMeanwhile, Matheus Fernandes continues in an advanced role alongside the underwhelming Lucas Paqueta.\n\nJarrod Bowen is expected to lead the line, with Callum Wilson likely to settle for a place on the bench.\n\nAlphonse Areola; Konstantinos Mavropanos, Jean-Clair Todibo, Max Kilman; Kyle Walker-Peters, Soungoutou Magassa, Freddie Potts, Oliver Scarles; Lucas Paqueta, Matheus Fernandes; Jarrod Bowen.",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace travel to Elland Road on Saturday night looking to bounce back from last weekend’s defeat and maintain their push to play European football again.\n\nPalace were punished despite a strong performance in a 3-0 loss to Manchester City at Selhurst Park last week, a result that ended their three-game winning run.\n\nHowever, Oliver Glasner’s side remains firmly in the mix, sitting just two points off the top four and boasting one of the league’s strongest away records in 2025.\n\nWith Palace also juggling European commitments, rotation is expected, but Glasner has made it clear that his senior players will return for this trip to Yorkshire.\n\nElland Road has been a lively venue in recent weeks, with Leeds United scoring and conceding freely under Daniel Farke’s new 3-5-2 system.\n\nLeeds are unbeaten in three league matches and have shown renewed attacking zest, but their defensive structure still allows chances, something Palace will exploit.\n\nDespite the heavy loss, the Eagles generated close to two expected goals last weekend and remain one of the most dangerous transition sides in the division.\n\nGlasner’s decision to rest most of his first-choice XI in mid-week means Palace should arrive fresher than their schedule suggests.\n\nCrystal Palace have won more away Premier League games than any other side in 2025 (10), collecting a league-high 34 points on the road.\n\nThe Eagles have underperformed their expected goals by more than any team this season (-6.5). Their finishing needs to improve.\n\nMeanwhile, Leeds have scored and conceded in each of their last six home league games, netting multiple goals in four of those fixtures.\n\nPalace won 5-1 at Elland Road in their last top-flight visit and are looking to secure consecutive league wins away to Leeds for the first time.\n\nPalace are without Daichi Kamada after the midfielder suffered a serious hamstring injury.\n\nDaniel Munoz, Cheick Doucoure, Chadi Riad, Rio Cardines, and Caleb Kporha also remain sidelined.\n\nIsmaila Sarr is away on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Senegal, further limiting Glasner’s options in wide areas.\n\nHowever, the Austrian has confirmed that the players who did not start Thursday’s Conference League draw with KuPS will return to the XI, providing welcome continuity.\n\nDean Henderson will come back in goal, while Marc Guehi, Maxence Lacroix, and Chris Richards are all set for defensive recalls.\n\nThe ‘Outstanding’ Will Hughes is expected to partner with Adam Wharton in midfield.\n\nEddie Nketiah, 26, should start in support of Jean-Philippe Mateta alongside Yeremy Pino in place of Sarr.\n\nDean Henderson; Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix, Marc Guehi; Nathaniel Clyne, Adam Wharton, Will Hughes, Tyrick Mitchell; Eddie Nketiah, Yeremy Pino; Jean-Philippe Mateta.",

    "description": "I flew Breeze Airways with my family of five over the holidays. I was surprised by the lower fares and easy travel experience with the budget airline.",
    "fullText": "As a family of five who travels a lot, I'm always looking for the best deal because air travel can get expensive very quickly.\n\nWhen we planned a recent trip from Portland, Maine, to Pittsburgh over the holiday break, low-cost flights from Breeze Airways caught my eye.\n\nThey were also the only direct routes available, yet I was hesitant to book with the low-budget airline after reading negative online reviews that mentioned frustrations about delayed flights and hidden fees.\n\nI was already skeptical about traveling with my kids during peak travel season, but, left with no other option that fit our budget, I decided to give Breeze Airways a try. I'm glad I did.\n\nThough our tickets with Breeze Airways weren't cheap — we paid $1,790 for the five tickets plus two carry-ons — they were significantly cheaper than those of other airlines.\n\nOur options with other airlines had at least one stop (which I try to avoid when traveling with kids), and five tickets started at over $2,000.\n\nI purchased our tickets in July and chose the cheapest seats, which also had the most restrictions — no checked luggage, no carry-ons, a fee to select certain seats, and only one personal item allowed per person.\n\nEach carry-on costs us an extra $70 to fly with, so we only brought two — one for each adult.\n\nAll of us were allowed to bring a personal item for free, and for the kids, it was a small backpack filled with entertainment, such as stuffed animals and coloring books.\n\nBecause we were staying with family, I knew I could do laundry during our trip, which allowed us to travel with minimal luggage.\n\nI chose seats in row 24, the first row where you didn't have to pay to choose your seat, and within the \"family seating\" section to ensure that we could sit together at no additional cost.\n\nI was able to grab an entire row — two window seats, two aisles, and one middle. If I had wanted anything closer to the front, seats would've cost an extra $25 (or more) each.\n\nWhen we arrived at the airport for our outbound flight, I panicked because Breeze Airways was not showing on any of the departure screens, and my app said our gate was \"TBD.\"\n\nLuckily, an airport employee helped guide us to a specific gate, where Breeze usually operates. There we found our flight, which was listed as being on time.\n\nBoarding started soon after, and it was far more organized than other airlines I've flown with.\n\nThough families with kids were welcomed to board first, we stuck with our group so the kids could get as many wiggles out as possible before having to be seated for the flight.\n\nLuckily, we had no issues finding overhead space for our bags when boarding in group three.\n\nOnce on board, I was surprised at how new the plane felt. It had smooth leather seats, and the entire cabin appeared to be free from dings and dents.\n\nOur seats were comfortable for a short flight, though they barely reclined at all. We still had small tray tables that came in handy for my kids to color and play on.\n\nThe legroom was fine for me as a 5-foot-6-inch adult, and I was able to fit everyone's backpacks comfortably on the floor by our feet.\n\nThough there were no seatback screens for entertainment, I was prepared with sticker books and stuffed toys to keep our kids happy.\n\nDuring both flights, we were only served cups of water, and the snack cart didn't come out because there was significant turbulence.\n\nSince we were in the cheapest section, we would've had to purchase other drinks and any snacks. We weren't particularly bothered by this since our flights were only 1 hour and 20 minutes long.\n\nWe just packed snacks in the kids' backpacks and grabbed food at the airport before boarding, so everyone would be content.\n\nI've grown accustomed to flight delays in recent years, but both of our flights landed a little ahead of time, which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nMy family has flown with low-cost carriers before, trying both Frontier Airlines and Spirit.\n\nI've had good experiences with Frontier, though its flights often depart at odd hours from our closest airport. Looking back, taking a 5 a.m. flight to Miami with kids was not the best choice.\n\nOn one Spirit flight to Mexico, my husband and I experienced several delays and almost missed our connection, barely making it to the plane on time.\n\nThough I can't say with certainty that Breeze Airways is the best of the three, our one experience was significantly better than previous ones with budget airlines.\n\nThe company only flies from our local airport to about a dozen cities in the US, but I'm happy to consider Breeze Airways for future family travel.\n\nThe low-cost airline will be especially helpful during the holiday season, when we're bound to see our extended family in Pittsburgh.",

    "description": "As a Mexican travel journalist, I have seen tourists make many mistakes when visiting the country, like skipping museums and not trying local dishes.",
    "fullText": "I was born and raised in Mexico and have spent the last 15 years exploring the country as a travel journalist. So, I know it has lots to offer, from incredible biodiversity and beautiful resorts to world-class museums.\n\nHowever, I've seen tourists make plenty of mistakes when visiting my country, from failing to learn any Spanish to missing opportunities to explore.\n\nHere are five things tourists should avoid so that they can get the most out of their trip.\n\nMexico is a huge country. To put it into perspective, the largest state, Chihuahua, is slightly larger than the UK. So, to reduce Mexico to a single stereotype would be to erase its incredible diversity.\n\nIt has everything from tropical beaches and historical cities to snow-capped mountains and deserts.\n\nGetting from one city to another can require long bus rides or flights, so if you hope to travel throughout the country, I recommend trying not to plan too much for one trip.\n\nAlthough Mexico is home to incredible resorts in cities like Cancún and Cabo San Lucas, the country has so much more to offer.\n\nFor example, about two and a half hours outside downtown Cancún lies Chichén Itzá, an archeological site of Mayan ruins and one of the \"New 7 Wonders of the World.\"\n\nOne of the main attractions is El Castillo, also known as the Pyramid of Kukulkán, which stands nearly 100 feet tall and has impressive features. For example, if visitors clap at the base of the pyramid, they'll hear the sound of a quetzal, a sacred bird associated with the god Kukulkán.\n\nMeanwhile, about 30 minutes outside Cabo San Lucas lies San José del Cabo, a charming town with a laid-back vibe full of art galleries and colonial architecture.\n\nIf you're willing to venture a bit further from Cabo San Lucas, I also recommend visiting Todos Santos, home of Hotel California, or Cabo Pulmo, a national marine park perfect for snorkeling and diving among coral reefs.\n\nDuring your visit, I highly recommend trying one of the more than 50 types of mole, a traditional Mexican sauce that's very different from the spicy salsa you might be used to.\n\nIt's made with a wide range of ingredients, such as chiles, chocolate, nuts, seeds, spices, vegetables, and sometimes fruits like raisins or apples. It's usually served with meat or as the base for popular dishes, such as enchiladas de mole.\n\nAnother must-try dish is pozole. Almost every state has its own version of this comforting, flavorful soup.\n\nIt's made with cacahuazintle (a special type of corn), broth, and meat, and comes in various styles, including white pozole (without chile), red pozole (with red chile), and green pozole (with ground pumpkin seeds).\n\nThe spiciness is real, so I recommend starting slow and only trying what locals say is just a little spicy.\n\nMexico City is home to the greatest concentration of museums in the country.\n\nOne unmissable stop is the spectacular National Museum of Anthropology in Chapultepec Park. With more than 20 galleries showcasing pre-Hispanic artifacts and ethnographic treasures, it's worth setting aside several hours — or even an entire day — to truly take it all in.\n\nA short walk away, Chapultepec Castle houses the National History Museum, which showcases Mexico's story from pre-Columbian times to the modern era. As a bonus, you'll also find epic murals by David Alfaro Siqueiros and Juan O'Gorman, two of the most acclaimed Mexican visual artists of the 20th century — plus stunning views of the city.\n\nAnd for fine art lovers, head downtown to MUNAL (the National Museum of Art), located in Plaza Manuel Tolsá. Its collection spans from the colonial period to the mid-20th century and includes works by Diego Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, and María Izquierdo.\n\nAt upscale hotels and restaurants, you'll probably get by just fine in English, but you shouldn't expect to do the same when wandering local streets, exploring markets, or trying street food.\n\nI encourage learning a few Spanish phrases, such as thank you (gracias), good morning (buenos días), and please (por favor). It'll open doors and hearts.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was expanding travel restrictions to an additional 20 countries and the Palestinian Authority, doubling the number of nations affected by sweeping limits announced earlier this year on who can travel and emigrate to the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration included five more countries as well as people traveling on documents issued by the Palestinian Authority to the list of countries facing a full ban on travel to the U.S. and imposed new limits on 15 other countries.\n\nThe move is part of ongoing efforts by the administration to tighten U.S. entry standards for travel and immigration, in what critics say unfairly prevents travel for people from a broad range of countries. The administration suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nPeople who already have visas, are lawful permanent residents of the U.S. or have certain visa categories such as diplomats or athletes, or whose entry into the country is believed to serve the U.S. interest, are all exempt from the restrictions. The proclamation said the changes go into effect on Jan. 1.\n\nIn June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from coming to the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.\n\nAt the time the ban included Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Republican administration announced it was expanding the list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the U.S. to Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria. The administration also fully restricted travel on people with Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents, the latest U.S. travel restriction against Palestinians. South Sudan was also facing significant travel restrictions already.\n\nAn additional 15 countries are also being added to the list of countries facing partial restrictions: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Ivory Coast, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe restrictions apply to both people seeking to travel to the U.S. as visitors or to emigrate there.\n\nThe Trump administration said in its announcement that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had “widespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records” that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the U.S.\n\nIt also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens whom the U.S. wished to deport or had a “general lack of stability and government control,” which made vetting difficult. It also cited immigration enforcement, foreign policy and national security concerns for the move.\n\nThe Afghan man accused of shooting the two National Guard troops near the White House has pleaded not guilty to murder and assault charges. In the aftermath of that incident, the administration announced a flurry of immigration restrictions, including further restrictions on people from those initial 19 countries who were already in the U.S.\n\nThe news of the expanding travel ban is likely to face fierce opposition from critics who have argued that the administration is using national security concerns to collectively keep out people from a wide range of countries.\n\n“This expanded ban is not about national security but instead is another shameful attempt to demonize people simply for where they are from,\" said Laurie Ball Cooper, vice president of U.S. Legal Programs at the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nAdvocates for Afghans who supported the United States' two-decade long war in Afghanistan also raised alarms Tuesday, saying the updated travel ban no longer contains an exception for Afghans who qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa. That’s a visa category specifically for Afghans who closely assisted the U.S. war effort at great risk to themselves.\n\nNo One Left Behind, a longtime agency advocating for the Special Immigrant Visa program, said it was “deeply concerned” about the change. The organization said it appreciated the president's commitment to national security but allowing Afghans who'd served the U.S. to enter the U.S. — after extensive vetting — also contributes to the country's security.\n\n“Though intended to allow for review of inconsistent vetting processes, this policy change inadvertently restricts those who are among the most rigorously vetted in our history: the wartime allies targeted by the terrorists this proclamation seeks to address,” the organization said in a statement.\n\nCountries that were newly placed on the list of banned or restricted countries said late Tuesday that they were evaluating the news. The government of the island nation of Dominica in the Caribbean Sea said it was treating the issue with the “utmost seriousness and urgency” and was reaching out to U.S. officials to clarify what the restrictions mean and address any problems.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to the United States, Ronald Saunders, said the “matter is quite serious\" and he'll be seeking more information from U.S. officials regarding the new restrictions.\n\nThe Trump administration also upgraded restrictions on some countries — Laos and Sierra Leone — that previously were on the partially restricted list and in one case — Turkmenistan — said the country had improved enough to warrant easing some restrictions on travelers from that country. Everything else from the previous travel restrictions announced in June remains in place, the administration said.\n\nThe new restrictions on Palestinians come months after the administration imposed limits that make it nearly impossible for anyone holding a Palestinian Authority passport from receiving travel documents to visit the U.S. for business, work, pleasure or educational purposes. The announcement Tuesday goes further, banning people with Palestinian Authority passports from emigrating to the U.S.\n\nIn justifying its decision Tuesday, the administration said several “U.S.-designated terrorist groups operate actively in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and have murdered American citizens.” The administration also said the recent war in those areas had “likely resulted in compromised vetting and screening abilities.\"\n\nAnika Kentish in Saint John’s, Antigua, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Billions of dollars are about to be spent on upgrading the country's air traffic control system, according to the boss of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe FAA is committing $6 billion on ATC telecom and radar infrastructure, Administrator Bryan Bedford told a House subcommittee on Tuesday.\n\nThe new infrastructure is set to be deployed by the end of 2028, down from a previously planned timescale of 15 years, Bedford said.\n\nIt comes after incidents this year have highlighted the fragility and age of the current system.\n\nHowever, while Congress has so far approved $12.5 billion to upgrade the air traffic control system, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said it will cost $31.5 billion overall.\n\nPassengers around the country have faced disruption this year due to the aging ATC system.\n\nIn April and May, several communications outages occurred at a control center that guides planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\nRadar displays briefly went offline, so the FAA had to slow arrival and departure rates. The airport has also been dealing with runway construction.\n\nAt one point, Newark was limited to an hourly rate of 34 departures and arrivals, less than half the number it typically handled.\n\nThe government shutdown in the fall further exposed the fragility of the ATC system.\n\nControllers were among the federal workers who were told they had to keep working without a paycheck. As the shutdown dragged on, fewer and fewer controllers turned up for work.\n\nIn California, Hollywood Burbank Airport's control tower was left unstaffed for about six hours one day.\n\nEventually, the FAA had to mandate flight cuts at 40 of the country's busiest airports due to staffing shortages.",

    "description": "See the US State Department travel advisories for popular Caribbean travel destinations and locations the US advises against visiting.",
    "fullText": "Planning a Caribbean vacation? The US State Department wants you to know how safe your destination is before you board your flight.\n\nThe Caribbean has long been a popular vacation destination thanks to its beautiful natural sights, yearlong tropical weather, and calm turquoise beaches.\n\nWhile traveling to one of the Caribbean's islands and its coasts in South, Central, and North America, tourists can explore historic sites that document the region's colonial and pre-colonial days, enjoy cultural enrichment during carnivals or local holidays, and indulge in an array of cuisines that combine indigenous, African, and European influences.\n\nThe US State Department has issued travel advisories for some countries in the region, advising Americans to exercise caution when visiting. Amid an increased US military presence in the region, travelers may also be wondering if it's wise to travel there.\n\nThe agency uses four levels of travel guidance to know what to expect in each country:\n\nAs of December 12, 21 countries around the world are designated \"do not travel,\" mostly because of ongoing armed conflicts.\n\nIn the Caribbean, only Haiti and Venezuela have an advisory Level 4, along with some parts of Mexico, Jamaica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Colombia.\n\nAcross the Caribbean — which we have defined widely, including every country with a Caribbean coast in South, Central, and North America — levels of safety and resources can vary, and travelers should be aware of the specific conditions of the country or territory they intend to visit.\n\nWe looked at the travel advisories and information for every country in the Caribbean. Here's everything you need to know about your tropical destination before planning your next getaway.\n\nRebecca Harrington and Michelle Mark contributed to an earlier version of this story.\n\nWhile the US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, it advises travelers to exercise caution when driving, as the roads can be in poor condition. Additionally, it notes that medical facilities on the island fall below US standards.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the popular cruise-ship destination, but it advises travelers on the country information page to be \"extremely careful when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads.\"\n\nIt also notes that medical facilities on the island don't meet US standards, and divers facing decompression illness need to be evacuated from the island as it does not have a hyperbaric chamber.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be warned that local \"indecency statutes\" criminalize \"consensual same-sex sexual activity between adult men\" with a maximum sentence of up to 15 years, according to the US State Department. LGBTQ+ couples married outside the island also do not enjoy spousal rights or privileges when visiting Antigua and Barbuda.\n\nThe agency also says that mosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are prevalent in the islands.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch island, but warns that \"access to quality medical care is limited,\" and in cases of decompression sickness, divers need medical evacuation from the island as it does not have a decompression chamber.\n\nMosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are also prevalent in the island, and the CDC recommends the use of \"mosquito repellents and insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\"\n\nWhile crime isn't a particular concern there, theft is the main offense committed against tourists. The department suggests securing personal property in public areas, hotel rooms, and cars.\n\nThe US State Department advises travelers to the island chain to remain cautious, as violent crimes — like armed robberies and sexual assaults — can \"occur anywhere in the Bahamas.\"\n\nIt also notes that a majority of crime occurs in the islands of New Providence and Grand Bahama, and warns to stay alert in the \"Over the Hill\" area in Nassau, south of Shirley Street, where gangs have been reported to have murdered residents.\n\nThe department also warns about unsafe, unregulated tourist watercraft, such as boat tours, and the potential of sexual assault by Jet Ski operators. US government employees are prohibited from using Jet Skis and watercraft rented from independent operators on New Providence and Paradise islands.\n\nIt also advises travelers to be wary of weather alerts and notes that the island's hurricane season generally runs from June through November.\n\nThe US State Department lists Barbados at Level 1 but warns that \"crimes of opportunity\" and violent crimes occur occasionally, advising the use of the same personal security measures as in any major US city.\n\nIt also notes that travelers should \"exercise extra vigilance at night on party cruises and in the downtown area.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that, while rarely enforced, consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized on the island, and they can be penalized with up to life imprisonment.\n\nMosquito-borne diseases, such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, are also prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department warns of violent crime, including \"sexual assault, home invasions, armed robberies, and murder,\" which it says \n\"are common even during the day and in tourist areas,\" and can be gang-related.\n\nBelize City has a travel advisory Level 3, and the agency suggests that US citizens should avoid traveling to the city, which has historically seen much of the country's violent crime in its south side. The area, defined as Haulover Creek Canal and extending south to Fabers Road, \"does not overlap with the typical tourism areas,\" the agency said.\n\nMuch of the crime in the city, and in the country, is gang-related, and local police don't have resources to look into serious crimes, so most go \"unresolved and unprosecuted,\" the US State Department wrote.\n\nThe department said it also discourages driving at night due to poor road conditions, frequently unavailable road assistance, and unreliable phone reception in remote areas.\n\nDiseases like malaria, dengue, Zika, leishmaniasis, and NWS (New World Screwworm) are also prevalent in the country, and medical care, while generally available in urban areas, can be hard to access in rural and remote areas.\n\nThe agency also warns that many hotels aren't equipped with carbon monoxide detectors, and that US citizens have died from poisoning from the gas.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch islands, which it assesses as low-crime areas with responsible police sources and a high level of social control in its small population. The most common crimes are usually \"non-violent, financially-motivated, and opportunistic in nature,\" like pickpocketing and theft of unattended belongings.\n\nUS travelers are advised to use caution when driving in the islands, as roads can be \"slippery during rainfall,\" wild animals often cross roads, and in Saba, roads can be steep and have sharp turns.\n\nThere is limited access to quality medical care in the islands, and facilities do not always meet US health and service standards.\n\nThe CDC also recommends using mosquito repellents and sleeping under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, but notes that drivers should be attentive on the road as \"speeding and reckless driving are fairly common.\" Nighttime drag racing and livestock crossing are also common.\n\nWhile the British Virgin Islands don't have particularly high crime, crimes of opportunity and violent crimes occur occasionally, and travelers are advised to use the same personal security measures they would in any major US city.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have also been reported.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island chain, which is a British territory, and says the islands have \"low rates of criminal activity affecting tourists,\" although crimes like pickpocketing and purse snatchings still happen occasionally.\n\nZika, chikungunya, and dengue fever are also prevalent, and the CDC recommends the use of insect repellents.\n\nThe US State Department warns of crime, terrorism, unrest, and kidnapping throughout Colombia and asks visitors to reconsider travel to the country. Terrorists operate in some areas, and violent crime is possible, the agency says.\n\nParts of the country are a Level 4 advisory, with the agency recommending Americans don't travel to Arauca, Cauca (except Popayan); Chocó (except Nuquí); Nariño; and Norte de Santander (except Cucuta) because of crime and terrorism.\n\nThe country's border with Venezuela is also at a Level 4 advisory, and the agency advises avoiding the area altogether to prevent accidental crossings into Venezuela, as the border isn't clearly marked. The department says that Americans should not travel to this region \"for any reason,\" since crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict are common in the area.\n\nEven in public and in affluent neighborhoods, well-organized crime can occur, the agency says. Americans are also targeted by terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them, per the State Department.\n\nDating apps and internet romance scams are also common, and the department advises being cautious when meeting with strangers.\n\nTravelers are advised against hailing taxis on the street, and US government employees are prohibited from doing so, as US citizens have been killed during robberies on hailed street taxis.\n\nThe agency also advises against participating in ayahuasca \"spiritual cleansing\" practices using psychedelic drugs illegal in the US, because \"people claiming to be shamans or spiritual practitioners are neither licensed nor regulated,\" and there are risks of robbery, assault, illness, or death while intoxicated.\n\nAdequate healthcare facilities are available throughout the country; the agency warns that healthcare in rural areas may be below US standards, and tap water is not safe to drink in these areas.\n\nCommon diseases include COVID-19, dengue, chikungunya, malaria, Yellow Fever, and Zika. Using mosquito repellents and sleeping under nets is suggested.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread petty and violent crime, like armed robbery, homicide, and sexual assault, affecting tourists, and recommends increased caution when traveling to the country. The agency strongly advises against taking public buses due to the threat of pickpocketing.\n\nIt also warns of dangerous rip currents in Costa Rica and notes that most beaches lack lifeguards or \"warnings about unsafe conditions.\" In July, \"The Cosby Show\" star Malcolm-Jamal Warner drowned while visiting the country.\n\nThe agency also advises against participation in spiritual ceremonies or rituals involving hallucinogens like ayahuasca or kambo, which are \"not regulated by the Costa Rican Ministry of Health and are illegal in the US.\"  The agency says Americans have been victims of \"sexual assault, serious injury, and theft\" while intoxicated with the substances, and recommends using \"extreme caution\" if they choose to participate in such ceremonies.\n\nSome travelers have reported tainted alcohol causing serious health issues, the agency added.\n\nMedical care in San José is \"usually good;\" the department warns that quality services outside the city may be limited. Tap water is often unsafe to drink in the country.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and malaria are prevalent.\n\nCosta Rica is also prone to a variety of natural disasters as an active earthquake and volcanic zone, with three volcanoes that have become more active in recent years. Tsunamis can also occur after significant earthquakes.\n\nFlash floods and severe landslides are common during the rainy season, from April to October, in the Limon, Puntarenas, and Guanacaste provinces.\n\nBetween January and the end of May, wildfires are also common throughout Costa Rica, particularly in Guanacaste and the northern region of the country.\n\nThe US State Department advises that travelers maintain an increased level of caution due to crime and an unreliable power grid. Petty crime, including pickpocketing, purse snatching, and car break-ins, is common, and violent crime like armed robbery, murder, and home invasions is also on the rise, the department said.\n\nUS law also prohibits tourist travel to Cuba, and travelers must comply with OFAC licensing requirements, which establish different categories for permitted travel, such as educational activities, humanitarian projects, or visiting family.\n\nTravelers should avoid demonstrations, as peaceful assembly and free speech are not protected, and protests can often trigger government responses. The agency also warns that the Cuban government has detained US citizens for activities that are not criminal in the US.\n\nScams on dating apps and internet romance schemes are common, it added. Internet and phone communication can also be compromised while visiting the island, as \"there is no expectation of privacy in Cuba,\" per the department, which advises the use of VPNs and avoiding connecting to public WiFi networks.\n\nRoads can be hazardous due to poor lighting, aging vehicles, and unpredictable nighttime conditions, and the department discourages using overcrowded public buses or unregulated taxis.\n\nThe agency warns that ambulances \"are not present throughout the country and can be unreliable where available,\" and they're not usually equipped with up-to-date medical equipment. The agency recommends travelers bring basic over-the-counter medication, as shortages are widespread throughout the island.\n\nAir quality can be poor on the island, and tap water is not safe to drink. The agency recommends opting for bottled water, asking for drinks without ice, washing hands often, and avoiding uncooked or undercooked food.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, COVID-19, Oropouche, hepatitis A, and traveler's diarrhea are prevalent.\n\nTravelers should also be aware that between May and November, the island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch territory, but notes that nonviolent crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, are common in areas like beaches, hotel lobbies, and cars.\n\nInstances of violent crime, although not common, often take place in more isolated areas of the island, like remote beaches or nature areas, where thefts and assaults have been reported.\n\nZika, dengue, and chikungunya are prevalent, and the CDC recommends the use of mosquito repellents and insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for Dominica, but notes that crimes of opportunity, violent, and drug-related crime occur occasionally.\n\nThe department also advises caution when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads, as roads in the country tend to be in \"average to poor condition.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that consensual same-sex conduct is illegal on the island, and local laws do not protect against sexual-orientation-based discrimination.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have been reported on the island.\n\nThe agency also warns that medical facilities on the island do not meet US standards, and there is \"limited ambulance service.\"\n\nThe US State Department warns of violent crime, including armed robbery, homicide, and sexual assault. The agency also says that while the country has its own tourist police force and that resort areas are generally safer, urban areas like Santo Domingo aren't very well-policed, and drugs, weapons, and criminal justice systems are a concern throughout the country.\n\nThe agency advises against wearing expensive jewelry and warns of dating app or internet romance scams.\n\nWhile prostitution under certain circumstances is legal in the country, the agency warns US citizens against hiring prostitutes or escort services, as \"disagreements over price and claims of mistreatment\" can result in police involvement.\n\nPrevalent diseases include dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis, and \"public clinics lack basic resources and supplies,\" the agency said. It also notes that \"many US citizens have suffered serious complications or died during cosmetic or other elective surgeries in the Dominican Republic.\"\n\nTap water in many areas is not safe to drink, and the agency suggests requesting bottled water and no ice in drinks.\n\nThe country has the highest road-crash-related mortality rate in the world, the agency says, and travelers should drive with extreme caution or consider hiring a professional driver. Shared buses are available, but they do not always meet US safety standards.\n\nDue to security concerns, the agency advises against using unregulated taxis and buses, as well as hailing taxis off the street.\n\nThe island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes between May and November, and flooding often occurs without warning during heavy rainfall. The country is also prone to earthquakes.\n\nThe agency also warns of life-threatening currents and advises against swimming alone.\n\nAfter years of higher-risk warnings, the US State Department now lists El Salvador at Level 1, citing a decrease in violent crime and gang activity over the past three years.\n\nThe US prohibits government employees from traveling between cities or departments at night and from using public buses due to concerns over infrastructure and criminal activity.\n\nSince 2022, El Salvador has been under a \"State of Exception\" in response to gang violence, allowing local authorities to arrest anyone suspected of being involved in gang activity — including several US and foreign citizens — and suspending \"several constitutional rights,\" like the right to a fair and speedy trial, the agency notes.\n\nWhile no alerts are active for the country, the agency suggests exercising caution and warns that the \"crime threat level in El Salvador is high,\" citing common crimes like robbery, car theft, and sexual assault. \"Most serious crimes in El Salvador are never solved,\" the department says.\n\nThe country has a police force dedicated to tourists in 19 popular destinations, but the agency advises against remote hikes or hiring guides.\n\nThe agency warns of the risks of surfing in the country's Pacific Coast, which has made El Salvador a popular surfing destination. The currents \"can be dangerous, even for skilled swimmers,\" the department said, and the country has limited search-and-rescue capabilities.\n\nEl Salvador also has severe penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs, which might include THC and CBD products legally sold in the US.\n\nNatural disasters also occur occasionally in the country, which has 21 active volcanoes and experiences frequent earthquakes. Flooding and mudslides are common during the rainy season.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that while same-sex sexual relations aren't restricted in the country, there is \"widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" the department said, including by public officials and police, who have been involved in violence against LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nQuality care is available in San Salvador, but medical care can be limited outside the city, per the agency.\n\nPrevalent diseases include dengue, diarrheal illness, chikungunya, and Zika\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the French West Indies, which include the islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy. The agency notes that petty street crime, like purse snatching, occurs, and advises against leaving valuables unattended in public areas or visible in cars.\n\nOther recommendations include avoiding wearing expensive jewelry or carrying large amounts of cash, and keeping doors and windows locked at night.\n\nChikungunya and dengue are prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island, but it notes that crimes of opportunity like petty theft and break-ins still occur occasionally, as do violent and drug-related crimes. The agency advises travelers to exercise the level of caution that they would in any major US city.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law \"criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activities between men,\" with up to 10 years imprisonment, the agency says. Although prosecutions are rare, Grenadian society is considered to be \"generally intolerant of same-sex sexual conduct,\" it noted.\n\nDuring hurricane season, from June 1 to November 30, travelers are advised to monitor local weather and be prepared for potential threats, including earthquakes and tsunamis, since the island is located in a seismic zone.\n\nVisitors should drive slowly and with caution, as the roads are usually narrow and winding and often lack proper signage, according to the agency.\n\nThe department also notes that medical care in Grenada is \"below US standards\" and that dengue is prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread crime, including violent crime like armed robbery, murder, and gang activity, particularly in Guatemala City, Escuintla, Chiquimula, Izabal, and Petén. The agency advises reconsidering travel to the country.\n\nSome areas, including the departments of San Marcos and Huehuetenango, and parts of Guatemala City like Zone 18 and Villa Nueva, have a travel advisory of Level 4: Do Not Travel due to increased crime.\n\n\"While tourists are not usually targeted, they can still be victims of opportunistic crime,\" the agency says, and local police — which have a dedicated force to protect tourists in popular destinations — often lack the resources to respond effectively.\n\nTourists are advised against wearing expensive jewelry or using cellphones in public. Internet romance and dating app scams are common and can often target US citizens.\n\nRoad travel after dark is discouraged due to poor lighting and a high accident risk. Public transportation, especially \"chicken buses\" and unregulated taxis, can be unsafe, the agency said.\n\nTravelers should also avoid swimming in the Pacific Ocean because the currents and undertow can be dangerously strong, and lifeguards aren't always available.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that discrimination and harassment are common throughout the country.\n\nMedical care in Guatemala City is generally adequate, but facilities elsewhere often lack basic supplies.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria, and COVID-19 are present, and tap water is unsafe to drink, including ice made from non-potable water.\n\nAir pollution is also an issue in major cities, and travelers should monitor for altitude effects in high-elevation areas.\n\nThe US State Department warns of extreme crime, kidnapping, civil unrest, terrorist activity, and a total collapse of public security in the country. The agency emphasizes that it cannot provide emergency assistance in Haiti and advises against all travel to the country. US airlines are not operating commercial flights to Haiti due to the substantial threats to travelers.\n\nIn late August, the country declared a state of emergency across many districts due to gang violence. Kidnapping is widespread and often violent, with US citizens among the victims, the department said.\n\nDemonstrations and roadblocks are frequent and unpredictable, and clashes between gangs and security forces routinely involve gunfire. The agency notes that stray bullets present a significant threat to visitors, even if they aren't involved with armed conflict.\n\nRoad conditions are dangerous, traffic is chaotic, and public transportation is unsafe, according to the agency.\n\nLGBTQ+ individuals and women may face targeted harassment or violence, and consular support is unavailable.\n\nThe State Department warns that medical facilities lack basic supplies, emergency response is nearly nonexistent, and essential resources, including water, fuel, and electricity, are severely limited Diseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria, cholera, and Zika are prevalent.\n\nThe country is also vulnerable to hurricanes during the season that runs from June 1 to November 30, during which roads often become impassable.\n\nThe US State Department warns of violent crime, including homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and gang activity, throughout Honduras. The easternmost department, Gracias a Dios, is a Level 4: Do Not Travel area due to narcotics trafficking, limited security presence, and poor infrastructure.\n\nSince 2022, the country has been under a state of national emergency in response to the high crime rate.\n\nTourist areas like the Bay Islands and Copan Ruins \"have a higher concentration of law enforcement resources,\" the agency said, but drug-related crimes remain a concern in the region.\n\nRoad conditions are hazardous, especially at night, with poor lighting, landslides, and frequent accidents. Carjackings occur along major highways, and the agency warns against using public transportation or hailing taxis on the street.\n\nWhile no laws prohibit same-sex relationships, LGBTQ+ travelers often face discrimination, and crimes committed against LGBTQ+ individuals often go unpunished. The agency advises LGBTQ+ travelers to \"exercise caution, especially when expressing affection in public.\"\n\nMedical facilities \"often do not meet US standards,\" the agency said. Dengue is widespread, and diseases like chikungunya, malaria, and Zika are prevalent. Tap water is not safe to drink, and air pollution can reach hazardous levels during the dry season.\n\nThe country is also vulnerable to hurricanes, heavy rain, and flooding, especially between June and November.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread violent crime — including armed robbery, sexual assault, and homicide — and notes that serious incidents can occur even inside gated resorts. Some neighborhoods in Kingston, Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, and other parishes are at an advisory of Level 4: Do Not Travel due to what the agency calls persistent gang violence.\n\nIt also notes that the country has one of the highest homicide rates in the Western Hemisphere. Tourists tend to experience a lower rate of crime than in other parts of the country, the agency said.\n\nHurricane Melissa also caused significant damage in late 2025, and the agency advises confirming transportation and lodging availability before travel, as services may remain disrupted, especially in areas such as Black River and Montego Bay, which were heavily impacted by the storm.\n\nTravelers should avoid secluded areas, including at resorts, remain in groups, and avoid displaying valuables.\n\nRoad conditions vary widely throughout the island; nighttime driving is hazardous, and carjackings and accidents are common.\n\nEmergency response can be slow, and medical care outside major cities is limited, according to the agency.\n\nScams are common here, the agency says, warning that LGBTQ+ individuals may face targeted violence, including assaults arranged through dating apps.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that local law specifically prohibits \"any kind of physical intimacy between persons of the same sex, in public or in private,\" with up to 10 years in prison, and \"consensual same-sex sexual conduct between men\" is also outlawed. LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination and assault, the agency said.\n\nDiseases like COVID-19, dengue, chikungunya, and HIV are present, and the CDC recommends the use of mosquito repellents and sleeping under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department warns of terrorism, violent crime, kidnapping, and cartel activity throughout Mexico.\n\nStates like Colima, Guerrero, Michoacán, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas are Level 4: Do Not Travel due to extreme violence, roadblocks, and targeted killings. The agency particularly warns against travel to Tamaulipas due to the threat of organized crime activity and kidnapping.\n\nOther states are Level 3: Reconsider Travel, and only the Gulf states of Campeche and Yucatán are Level 1: Exercise normal precautions.\n\nCrimes like armed robbery, extortion, and sexual assault occur in both tourist and non-tourist areas, and the agency notes that \"emergency services may be limited or unavailable in remote or rural areas.\" Travelers should avoid hailing taxis on the street, use only vetted transport, and avoid intercity driving at night due to risks of crime and unreliable road conditions.\n\nScams, including virtual kidnappings, romance schemes, banking fraud, and timeshare scams, are also common.\n\nThe agency also notes that carbon monoxide incidents have resulted in tourist deaths since many hotels and vacation rentals lack detectors.\n\nMexico is also prone to earthquakes and tsunamis, and hurricanes and tropical storms often take place between May and November.\n\nMedical care is generally good in major cities, but complications are frequent in travelers seeking elective procedures, such as plastic surgery.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria, and Zika are present in the country.\n\nThe US State Department warns of \"arbitrary enforcement of laws, risk of wrongful detention, civil unrest, limited healthcare availability,\" and crime. The government, which the agency describes as authoritarian, has detained US citizens, restricted entry or exit without explanation, confiscated property, and monitored digital activity.\n\nViolent crime, including sexual assault and armed robbery, occurs, and roadblocks and paramilitary groups can restrict movement and extort travelers. The Nicaraguan government may also monitor social media accounts for content that is \"critical of the government, controversial, or that might involve illegal activity,\" the agency said.\n\nBeaches can have dangerous currents and undertows, and hiking around volcanoes requires hiring local guides by law. Travelers should maintain emergency supplies, avoid nighttime travel, and only use licensed taxis recommended by trusted sources like airports and hotels due to unsafe conditions on public transportation.\n\nMedical care outside Managua is extremely limited, and even the capital's facilities may lack emergency resources. Ambulance services are unreliable, tap water is not potable, and diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, typhoid fever, pneumonia, leptospirosis, and rabies are present.\n\nThe country is prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, landslides, and volcanic eruptions. Travelers should have emergency plans, as remote locations may lack cellphone coverage.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, but notes that petty crimes and violent crimes still occur occasionally. Travelers are advised to use the level of caution they would in any major US city and stay aware of their surroundings, especially when visiting more isolated areas.\n\nChikungunya and dengue are present on the island.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the islands, but notes that petty theft, break-ins, and incidents of violent and drug-related crime occasionally occur. Travelers should use the personal security measures they would in any major US city.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law criminalizes \"consensual same-sex activity between men\" with a penalty of up to 10 years in prison, although enforcement of this law is relaxed, according to the agency. While the law \"does not prohibit sexual activity between women,\" it also doesn't prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have been reported in the islands.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island, but notes that crimes of opportunity, violent and drug-related crimes occur occasionally, and suggests using the same level of caution as in any major US city.\n\nThe department also notes that medical facilities in the island \"do not meet US standards,\" and that major roads are in \"average to poor condition,\" so travelers should \"be extremely careful when driving.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law criminalizes \"consensual same-sex sexual activity\" with penalties of up to 10 years in prison, and there is no legislation protecting people from \"discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" per the agency.\n\nChikungunya, dengue, and Zika are present.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island chain, but notes that it can be vulnerable to natural disasters.\n\nLocated on the north of Saint Vincent, La Soufriere is an active volcano that the agency says \"poses a constant threat.\" In mid-April 2021, it erupted nearly every day, forcing nearby communities to evacuate.\n\nEarthquakes, which are also often associated with volcanic activity, can occur \"at any time,\" the agency said. The islands can be impacted by hurricanes and storms between May and November.\n\nThe department also notes that medical facilities fall below US standards, and that since there isn't a hyperbaric chamber on the islands, divers suffering decompression illness require evacuation.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law criminalizes \"consensual same-sex sexual activity\" with sentences of up to 10 years in prison, and there is no legislation protecting people from \"discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" the agency said.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are present.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Netherlands territory. Sint Maarten shares an island with Saint Martin, which is part of the French West Indies.\n\nThe agency warns travelers against attempting to experience the \"jet blast of approaching and departing aircraft\" at the island's Maho Beach, adjacent to the Princess Juliana International Airport. The blast \"can result in serious injury or death,\" per the department.\n\nCrimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing or petty theft, can also happen, and the department advises against leaving belongings unattended.\n\nThe State Department also warns that \"access to quality medical care is limited\" on the island, and facilities may not always meet US standards.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department warns of crime throughout British territory, particularly on Providenciales, where it says police resources may be limited.\n\nCrimes of opportunity, including theft, burglary, and car break-ins, and occasional violent incidents occur. The agency advises US citizens to exercise the level of caution they would in any major US city.\n\nVisitors should avoid walking alone at night, secure valuables, and use only clearly marked taxis.\n\nThe islands are also vulnerable to hurricanes from June through November.\n\nMedical care can handle non-life-threatening issues, but serious injuries often require air evacuation.\n\nThe US State Department warns of wrongful detention, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, terrorism, and extremely poor health infrastructure, and advises all US citizens and permanent residents to leave the country and not travel to Venezuela \"for any reason.\" The US Embassy in Caracas has been suspended since 2019 and is unable to provide consular or emergency assistance anywhere in the country.\n\n\"Security forces have arbitrarily detained US citizens for up to five years without respect for due process,\" the agency said, and former detainees have reported torture and inhumane treatment.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has responded to reports from international organizations documenting arbitrary detention, inhumane conditions, and torture in the country's prisons, calling them \"interventionist.\" The government has called allegations of due process and human rights violations \"irresponsible, biased, and deeply polarized,\" as reported by CNN.\n\nViolent crime, including homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, is pervasive in the country, the US state department said, and criminal gangs and Colombian terrorist groups operate openly, especially in border regions. Political rallies occur often and often turn violent as police and security forces use tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against participants.\n\nTerrorist groups often target places frequented by tourists, like hotels and restaurants, shopping centers, and public transportation.\n\nShortages of gasoline, electricity, food, medicine, and medical supplies are widespread, and public hospitals lack basic resources like water, medications, and staff. Even private facilities are strained, and medical evacuation is difficult and expensive.Those who decide to disregard the advisory and travel to Venezuela are advised to prepare a will, consider hiring professional security during their stay, and develop communication plans with family in case of kidnapping or detention, the State Department said.\n\nThe agency emphasizes that there is \"no safe way to travel to Venezuela,\" and notes that the area within 50 miles of the entire Venezuela-Colombia border is \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\nThe agency advises against using public transport and driving defensively on the roads, which are often poorly marked. Traffic jams in Caracas are often exploited by armed motorcycle gangs to rob drivers.\n\nInternet scams, like romance schemes and relative targeting, are common in the country.\n\nTap water is unsafe to drink even in major cities, and shortages in running water are frequent. Diseases like dengue, Zika, chikungunya, malaria, Chagas disease, measles, travelers' diarrhea, and other infectious illnesses are prevalent.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace in what promises to be an entertaining Premier League affair later this afternoon.\n\nThe Cityzens will be out for vengeance after falling to the Eagles in the 2024/25 FA Cup final, but Palace have proven they’re no pushovers this season.\n\nNevertheless, City head into the game in remarkable form, having won four consecutive games in all competitions, most recently claiming a 2-1 Champions League win against familiar foes Real Madrid.\n\nLos Blancos got off to a fine start when Rodrygo broke the deadlock just before the half-hour mark, but goals from Nico O’Reilly and Erling Braut Haaland helped City turn the game on its head.\n\nBefore that fixture, City had seen off Leeds United, Fulham, and Sunderland to keep pace with Arsenal at the Premier League summit.\n\nThe Gunners extended their lead with a 2-1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, so it’s up to City to respond, but it may not be straightforward.\n\nCity have a dominant record against Palace. They’ve won four of their last seven league meetings with the Eagles (D3), but the FA Cup final is proof that Palace have what it takes to halt their momentum.\n\nThe last time Pep Guardiola made sweeping changes to his starting line-up, City paid the price with a 2-0 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nSince then, the Spaniard has made it a habit of keeping the core of the squad intact, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he makes just one change to his starting XI against Palace.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma is guaranteed to retain his place in goal ahead of out-of-favour James Trafford, while a back four of O’Reilly, Josko Gvardiol, Ruben Dias, and Mathues Nunes should also remain intact.\n\nThe minor tweak expected should come in midfield, although Nico Gonzalez is expected to keep his place while Rodri continues his recovery.\n\nTijjani Reijnders should come in for Bernardo Silva, who wasn’t at his best against Madrid.\n\nThe 31-year-old’s 6/10 performance might be a sign of fatigue, so Reijnders, who has notched seven goal contributions (two goals and five assists), could get a chance.\n\nThe Dutchman will likely be joined by Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki, and Phil Foden, while Haaland leads the line.",

    "description": "I wanted my family of five to travel more, so I created budgeting strategies to take more vacations. I know when to splurge and when to save.",
    "fullText": "I used to scroll through friends' glamorous-looking vacation photos and feel a familiar pang, knowing there was no way my family could afford trips like that. But I didn't want to stew in jealousy, so I decided to figure out how we could travel more on our budget.\n\nSince some of my favorite travel memories aren't from far-off places but from day adventures or quick weekend trips, I learned to prioritize them in our calendar. Mini vacations are cheaper — no flights, rental cars, time off work, or dog sitters needed, since we generally bring our dog on these trips or leave her with the neighbor.\n\nWe live in Arizona, so we schedule hiking excursions with friends to Sedona's Red Rocks or other scenic areas at least once every few months. We also visit my parents, who live an hour and a half north of us, enjoying their cooler weather and small-town charm.\n\nHowever, I don't want my family to miss out on exploring beyond our little bubble, so my next tactical move was to maximize credit card points.\n\nI'd earned free flights and hotels before, but my friend showed me I had more to learn.\n\nOver the past two years, I've signed up for credit cards when the point offers looked too good to pass up. I often book under my friend's referral link, so we both earn bonuses. My husband then signs up using mine, and we add each other as authorized users, often for extra points.\n\nI currently have nine credit cards. It sounds intimidating, but it's manageable as I never add more than one sign-up bonus at a time. Closing cards can ding your credit score, so I phase them out slowly.\n\nSome, though, I'll keep long-term, like my Sapphire card with its zero foreign transaction fees and great travel partners, and my Southwest card, which allows me to book flights with my Rapid Rewards points and offers one free checked bag for myself and up to eight guests.\n\nBecause the Sapphire card's points can be transferred to Southwest, I was able to combine them and book a flight for my family of five to Washington, D.C., this summer. The flight cost me 130,000 Rapid Rewards points, which is about $1,300. The only thing I paid out of pocket was the $56 in security fees. Then I used 78,914 introductory points from my husband's new Sapphire Chase card, valued at $788, to pay for half of our five-night hotel stay in Georgetown. In total, I saved around $2000.\n\nOne caveat: I always pay my credit cards off monthly. I want to be the one benefiting — not the credit card company.\n\nWe often split hotels or Airbnbs with family or friends. Sharing costs makes trips more economical and usually more fun. We plan meals together, too, when the place we're staying has a kitchen, which further cuts costs.\n\nI discovered that when new properties are listed on Airbnb, the first few stays are often discounted to drive more bookings and garner reviews. We've stayed in some upgraded places using this tactic. On an upcoming trip to Europe, I found a two-bedroom flat in London's city center with only a few reviews, offering a better deal at $970 for four nights, while many nearby properties were $1,300 or more.\n\nWhile in Europe, we plan to take trains to and from a few cities. I was shocked by train costs. That's how I found Omio, which helped me compare, purchase, and store tickets for train, bus, and ferry trips in one place, saving me time and money.\n\nWhen traveling, we rely on public transportation if the city is well-connected, only hopping in a rideshare or taxi if we are worn out. If we do need a rental car, I usually check a few companies to find the best deal, as rates can vary significantly.\n\nOn a seven-day trip to Maui in 2024, I found the best deal by booking directly with Alamo through my Sapphire rewards program. I secured a Chrysler Pacifica for 48,989 points, which equates to around $490.\n\nMy dad's vacation rule: splurge on a nice hotel for a few nights, then switch to budget options. Admittedly, I am scarred by that one cockroach-infested motel he booked when I was 11, so I never go too budget. Still, I like his thinking. If we're traveling to multiple cities, we often take this approach, staying in one nicer place and then offsetting it with something more budget-friendly in the next.\n\nEven with hacks, traveling is an expensive undertaking. Tucking money into a vacation fund every month helps, and staying strategic is key. For me, experiencing new places as a family is worth prioritizing.",

    "fullText": "NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip (AP) — Haneen al-Mabhouh, 34, sits in a wheelchair in her family home in Nuseirat, central Gaza, mourning the loss of her four daughters, including her 5-month-old baby, who were killed in an Israeli strike on her home last year. Al-Mabhouh also lost her leg in the attack and awaits permission to travel abroad for further treatment that could restore her mobility.\n\n“I dream of walking again, of holding a new baby, of rebuilding my family,” she said, her voice heavy with grief. For now, she relies on her parents for basic daily care and cannot even hold a pen.\n\nNearby, 23-year-old Yassin Marouf lies in a tent, his left foot amputated and his right leg severely injured after being hit by Israeli shelling in May. His brother was killed in the same attack, and Marouf struggles with basic movements. Doctors say his right leg may also need amputation unless he receives treatment outside the Palestinian territory.\n\n“If I want to go to the bathroom, I need two or three people to carry me,” he said.\n\nIn Gaza, thousands face similar challenges. Youssef al-Samri, 16, lost both legs while fetching water near his home after an Israeli airstrike in May. Displaced to a kindergarten in the al-Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, he navigates his world on his hands, relying on support to move through the classrooms where children play around him.\n\nTwelve-year-old Fadi al-Balbisi is learning to walk again with a prosthetic after losing his right leg to shelling in April. At Hamad Hospital in Zawaida, he practices with a prosthetic limb under the guidance of specialists, each step a hard-earned milestone toward regaining independence.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 5,000 to 6,000 people in Gaza have become amputees from the Israel-Hamas war, a quarter of them children. Many face long waits for prosthetics or medical evacuations abroad. Local centers, like the Artificial Limbs and Polio Center in Gaza City, are overwhelmed and have only limited supplies to provide artificial limbs.\n\nWhile a recent shipment of essential prosthetic materials has arrived in Gaza, the need remains critical. Patients like al-Mabhouh and Marouf face months-long waits for treatments that could prevent further amputations or restore mobility. Even with ceasefires in place, medical evacuations have been slow, hampered by bureaucratic and logistical barriers.\n\nIn the midst of this crisis, the lives of those affected are frozen in uncertainty. For al-Mabhouh, Marouf, al-Samri, and al-Balbisi, each day is a struggle for movement, dignity, and hope, as they navigate the aftermath of war with resilience and the faint promise of medical help.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "description": "After many arguments with my husband about when to leave for flights, we started arriving at the airport separately. This trick helped our marriage.",
    "fullText": "For the nine years we've been a couple, my husband and I have taken countless flights together.\n\nWe've visited family in the Carolinas, Tennessee, Montana, and Maryland. We've wandered around the Duomo in Florence, enjoyed tacos and tequila in Mexico City, and explored the breathtaking Normandy coastline.\n\nNow that we live in London, travel has ramped up. We're in our late 20s and early 30s, and wedding season has us flying back to the US on a near-monthly basis for our friends' nuptials … in addition to other scheduled trips.\n\nUnfortunately, we would get in a fight — almost every time — about what time to leave for the airport.\n\nAs a chronically early person, I hate rushing and get intense anxiety about cutting things too close.\n\nI'd rather sit in an airport for an extra hour than make a sweaty sprint through the terminal to catch a flight.\n\nMy husband, on the other hand, doesn't like to waste time — and with his demanding, meeting-filled job, he rarely has a moment to spare.\n\nHis perfect travel day involves passing through security as the plane begins boarding. Though that's anxiety-inducing to me, for what it's worth, he's only ever missed one flight.\n\nBecause of this, in the hours before a flight, I'd be huffing around our apartment with bags packed and shoes on. He'd get frustrated that I was rushing him, and I'd get annoyed that he was making us \"late.\"\n\nCue lots of tense moments and grumpy silence in transit.\n\nA few months ago, ahead of yet another long-haul flight to the US, I suggested what I thought was a reasonable time to leave — not too early, not too late. My husband wanted to leave even later.\n\nI decided to just leave when I wanted to avoid the stress and inevitable argument. We were taking public transportation, so the cost was the same either way.\n\nI told him I'd meet him at the gate, gave him a quick kiss, and made my way — happily, unhurriedly — to the airport. He arrived much later, but still on time.\n\nWe proceeded to have the smoothest trip we'd ever had in nine years.\n\nSince we started arriving at the airport separately, we noticed tons of other benefits, too.\n\nMy husband and I have very different work schedules, and this setup helps us both effectively manage our responsibilities. Sometimes, I'll get to the airport extra early to take a call or put finishing touches on an assignment.\n\nWe've also found that there's no financial downside to this system.\n\nObviously, this travel hack works best for city dwellers with easy access to public transport. It's definitely trickier if you live out in the suburbs and either share a car or don't want to park two at the airport.\n\nBecause we've only ever lived together in cities, though, this option is easy for us. Even if we planned to take an Uber together, the added cost of one of us leaving earlier on public transit is generally pretty marginal — in our case, usually no more than about $15.\n\nBest of all, by arriving at the airport when we like, we start our trips on a positive note. The last thing we need on an already stressful travel day is to be fighting or feeling frustrated with or another.\n\nThough this works well for us, we don't always travel separately.\n\nThere are times when our schedules make it more convenient to head to the airport together, or we have enough luggage that it makes more sense to schedule an Uber.\n\nIn those instances, we talk through our schedules the day before to make sure we can clearly communicate expectations so that there are no surprises.\n\nThese days, though, this heading to the airport separately has become our norm. I'll tell my husband which train I'm planning to take, and he tells me which one he's on.\n\nWe know that we'll see each other at the gate, one way or another.",

    "description": "Instead of our usual big holiday celebration with extended family, the four of us spent Christmas traveling and making new traditions on our trip.",
    "fullText": "Christmas is a really, really big deal in our house.\n\nIt's when our close-knit extended family gets together to celebrate, feast, and spend time with one another.\n\nHowever, my husband, two young kids, and I spent last Christmas sitting in our caravan on a remote beach in South Australia, just the four of us.\n\nIt was a far cry from the holidays before. But after years of deliberating, we'd just recently packed up our lives and belongings and headed toward the Australian outback for a yearlong adventure in a small caravan.\n\nComing home for Christmas wasn't an option — but, with a bit of planning, we still ended up having a brilliant (and unique) holiday.\n\nWhen you travel with everything you own packed into a caravan, space is at a premium.\n\nWe would've loved a standard Christmas tree, but we opted for a small, travel-sized version that had been stashed in the back of a cupboard for months as it silently traveled Australia.\n\nAs the holiday season approached, we dug out the tree and our kids decorated with the small selection of trimmings we'd brought with us.\n\nQuickly, the whole caravan turned into a Christmas ornament, with tinsel and fairy lights hanging from every nook and cranny. To our surprise, it was really magical. The kids loved the space so much that the lights stayed up long after December 25.\n\nWe also got creative when planning our Christmas feast, especially since our caravan doesn't have an oven and we'd be miles from any major city on the big day.\n\nInstead of roasting a whole bird, we made nachos with our barbecue and stove and topped them with ground turkey and other fixings.\n\nWhile sitting on a blanket on a beach, we used our best plastic plates and shared our low-stress Christmas-inspired feast. As a bonus, cleaning up after dinner was a breeze.\n\nLike any inquisitive 4-year-old, my daughter asked: \"How will Santa find us?\" She was concerned we didn't have a chimney, a letterbox, or even space for Santa to fit in our van.\n\nOnce again, we did some serious problem-solving. Thanks to the magic of Christmas — and preparations we made months in advance — Santa did find us.\n\nGrandparents also wanted to send gifts, which proved difficult on the road. Since we'd be in a remote area at Christmastime and unable to receive parcels, we arranged for relatives to get their presents to a town we knew we'd be visiting a few weeks prior.\n\nThen, we hid them in the van the best we could until Christmas Day.\n\nThat morning, thanks satellite coverage and modern technology, we were able to video call members our extended family so they could see the kids unwrap their gifts.\n\nOur holiday wasn't traditional, and we'll absolutely remember it for years to come.\n\nBeing on the road forced us to problem-solve and come up with ideas as an extended family. It allowed us to rethink many traditions and leave some behind simply because, logistically, they couldn't happen.\n\nInstead, we created new traditions and memories as a young family, while still staying connected with loved ones over video calls.\n\nWould we do it again? Absolutely. But this year, we plan to celebrate in person with our larger family again … and we might even bring the turkey nachos!",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa travel to Switzerland aiming to tighten their grip on a top-eight Europa League berth when they face Basel tonight.\n\nVilla arrive in red-hot form, winning 13 of their last 15 matches in all competitions.\n\nUnai Emery’s side claimed a statement win against Arsenal over the weekend, with Emiliano Buendia’s 95th-minute strike sealing a dramatic 2–1 victory.\n\nThe Villans sit third in the Premier League, three points off the top, and with European progress firmly in view.\n\nThey enter matchday six on 12 points (W4, L1), joint-top of the 36-team standings. However, Basel are dangerous, especially at home.\n\nThe Swiss side has alternated between wins and defeats throughout the League Phase (W2, L3).\n\nIt is worth noting that they have won their last seven Europa League home matches, their longest active streak in the competition.\n\nA late defeat to Genk dropped them to 24th, but they still occupy the final play-off spot with three games remaining.\n\nConfidence is rising after back-to-back domestic wins, including a last-gasp 2–1 victory over Winterthur last weekend.\n\nThis will be the clubs’ first meeting in 23 years, since Villa’s 4–1 aggregate victory in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nThe Villans must be wary as Basel have won five of their last 10 matches against English opposition.\n\nBasel have also been flawless at home in this competition, with seven straight wins at St Jakob-Park.\n\nVilla have struggled on the road in Europe recently, winning just one of their last six UEFA Cup/Europa League away games.\n\nHowever, Villa have scored two or more goals in 10 of their last 15 matches, highlighting their firepower heading into this fixture.\n\nDonyell Malen up top will likely carry Villa’s greatest threat with Ollie Watkins rested. Malen has scored three goals in his last two Europa League outings.\n\nTyrone Mings (thigh) and Ross Barkley (knee) remain out, while Evann Guessand is doubtful after missing the Arsenal win.\n\nUnai Emery may rotate. Emiliano Martinez has started the last three European games but could be rested, with Marco Bizot pushing for minutes.\n\nMatty Cash might also drop out, opening the door for Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof or Andres Garcia at right-back.\n\nIf Lindelof does not play wide, he could partner Pau Torres centrally, with Lucas Digne competing with Ian Maatsen on the left.\n\nIn midfield, Boubacar Kamara and Amadou Onana are expected to continue, while Youri Tielemans or Morgan Rogers may be managed due to fixture congestion.\n\nFurther forward, Buendia is pushing for a start after his last-gasp Arsenal heroics. The 28-year-old could get a shot.\n\nHarvey Elliott will likely not play today. Emery confirmed that the youngster, who is a ‘special player’, could return to parent club Liverpool in January.\n\nJadon Sancho and John McGinn are alternative options. Malen is expected to lead the line, with Emery likely to rest Ollie Watkins again.\n\nMarco Bizot; Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof, Pau Torres, Lucas Digne; Boubacar Kamara, Amadou Onana; John McGinn, Emiliano Buendia, Jadon Sancho; Donyell Malen.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa travel to Switzerland on Thursday night looking to extend a magnificent winning run.\n\nThey face FC Basel at St. Jakob-Park in the Europa League. Unai Emery’s side arrive in Basel brimming with confidence after a dramatic 2-1 victory over Premier League leaders Arsenal last weekend. This result extended their winning streak to seven matches across all competitions. The Villans currently sit joint-top of the Europa League standings with 12 points.\n\nThey aim to secure a top-eight finish. However, they face a formidable test against a Basel side that has turned St. Jakob-Park into a fortress. The Swiss outfit have won each of their last seven home Europa League matches. This is the longest current winning home run in the competition.\n\nDate: Thursday, 11 December 2025\n\nHead coach Ludovic Magnin will rely heavily on the experience of captain Xherdan Shaqiri. He has been instrumental this season with 11 goals and 10 assists. The former Liverpool man scored the opener in last weekend’s win over Winterthur and is expected to retain his place in attack. In midfield, Andrej Bacanin is likely to come into the starting XI to replace Marin Soticek. Moritz Broschinski is expected to lead the line. However, there are doubts over the availability of Kaio Eduardo due to injury.\n\nUnai Emery is expected to rotate his squad following the intense victory over Arsenal. Consequently, Matty Cash could be rested after scoring the opener against the Gunners. Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelöf, or the returning Andrés García are contending for the right-back slot. In attack, Donyell Malen is pushing to replace Ollie Watkins. Furthermore, Emiliano Buendía is in contention for a start after scoring the winner against Arsenal. Tyrone Mings and Ross Barkley remain sidelined.\n\nBasel enter this contest knowing their home form is their greatest asset. They are unbeaten in 10 European matches on home soil since 2015. Moreover, they have won five of their last 10 major European games against English opponents. Despite a rocky start to the league phase, they have found domestic rhythm recently. They have won back-to-back games in the Swiss Cup and Super League.\n\nVilla are enjoying a historic year in Europe. They have won eight of their last 10 major European matches. All eight wins came in 2025, which is a club record for a single calendar year. Their style under Emery has been distinct. Indeed, they have played the highest percentage of short passes of any team in the competition. History also favours the visitors as Villa triumphed when these sides met in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nBasel predicted XI: Hitz; Tsunemoto, Adjetey, Daniliuc, Schmid; Metinho, Bacanin; Shaqiri, Leroy, Otele; Broschinski\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Bizot; Bogarde, Lindelof, Torres, Digne; Kamara, Onana; Buendía, Tielemans, Rogers; Malen\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports. Coverage starts at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead- Mainoo preference abroad move over Premier League loan\n\nSee more- Saudi Pro League CEO endorses Mohamed Salah transfer\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "Data from Strava and AllTrails show a surge in new hiking clubs, while National Parks continue to be top travel destinations.",
    "fullText": "The run clubs that took off in the past few years were outpaced by hiking.\n\nThat's according to new data from Strava, a fitness tracking app, and AllTrails, a hiking navigation app.\n\nStrava's end-of-year report, analyzing data from over 180 million users and surveying over 30,000 users and non-users, found that hiking clubs grew sixfold in 2025 — nearly double the pace of run clubs. In 2025, AllTrails saw a 20% increase in users (i.e., people who created an account on the app) to 90 million.\n\nOnline, you can find hiking clubs for seemingly every preference, whether you're a creative in LA looking for a morning workout, a woman who doesn't want to hike alone in North Carolina, or a \"hot girl\" on the hunt for new travel companions.\n\nWhile run clubs are still popular, hiking and walking have an advantage: simplicity. They offer similar health benefits and social perks — without requiring the same stamina or potentially pricey gear.\n\nCOVID lockdowns famously drew people to the outdoors, whether they joined run clubs or sought out nearby hikes.\n\nAnd then there were National Parks, which experienced a surge of visitors since 2020 during the pandemic — and don't seem to be losing their allure. According to the National Parks visitation data, 2024 broke the record for the highest number of visitors of all time at over 331 million, a 28% increase since 2020.\n\nFive years after the pandemic, National Parks continue to be popular destinations. \"When you start looking at that number as feet on the trail, bodies in the visitor's center, cars on the road, you see that the parks have exploded,\" Jason Frye, a hiking writer who most recently published a National Parks guidebook, told Business Insider. Strava reported that hiking was the second most popular reason for traveling, behind winter sports.\n\nCarly Smith, chief marketing officer for AllTrails, said its data shows many hikers search for locations over 200 miles from their home. \"So we know that people are using us for planning travel and then for navigating and exploring National Parks and other destinations,\" she said.\n\nSmith believes part of the reason hiking and National Parks continue to be hot is that, for many, life still hasn't changed all that much since the peak-remote work pandemic years. \"There are more people working remotely than there were in the past,\" she said. \"Hiking clubs in particular can give people a good sense of community in ways that maybe they aren't finding in other parts of their life.\"\n\nRunning isn't the cardio workout for everyone. It's also not the only — or best — way to burn fat.\n\nWhile sprinting at a very fast pace (zone 4 or zone 5) is great for your heart health, it consumes more carbs than fat compared to a brisk walk or light jog.\n\nHiking long distances with a heavy backpack can help hit two goals: shedding fat while building muscle.\n\nThat's partly why rucking, or walking with weights, became a buzzy fitness trend last year. We saw a boom in networking events where people chat shop while breaking a sweat.\n\nPrice-wise, hiking, rucking, and walking also more financially accessible than joining a luxury gym. Weighted vests, the walking accessories du jour, cost about $30-$40 on Amazon — though a backpack from GoRuck, one of the biggest players in this space, starts at $115.\n\nPlus, in many cases, hiking and walking can be interchangeable: not all hikes have to be strenuous to count, making them less physically and financially daunting.\n\nFrye, who lives in Wilmington, North Carolina, near Great Smoky Mountains National Park, said there are many hiking trails nearby that are \"really walks in the woods more than true hikes.\"\n\n\"You can hop out of the car and do it in your flip flops from most of them,\" he said — no high-tech gear needed.\n\nAccording to Strava's report, walking was the second-most tracked activity in 2025, after running. Along with hiking, both activities can feel like a more low-stakes group activity than a seven-mile run.\n\nJonathan Jacobs, who started a men's walking group in LA this year, previously told Business Insider that the accessibility of walking made newcomers more likely to show up.\n\n\"Men who come to the walks repeatedly tell me that the low barrier to entry — no need to sign up or pay a fee to join — makes it easier for them to commit,\" he said.\n\nCity dwellers who partook in walking Manhattan from \"tip to tip\" — another popular TikTok trend of the year — also cited it as a memorable (but still low-key) experience with their friends.\n\nFrye believes the hiking hype is all part of the same phenomenon behind the renewed interest in dumb phones and old-school activities like pickling and crocheting.\n\n\"There seems to be this cultural shift, away from the digital and more toward the analog,\" he said. \"We're looking at these ways to return to easier things, and it doesn't get much easier than hiking.\"\n\nDecember 10, 2025: A previous version of this story stated that the Strava report data came from 30,000 Strava users. It came from 180 million users, as well as an additional survey of 30,000 users and non-users.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest will look to strengthen their Europa League ambitions with another crucial win as they travel to the Netherlands to face Utrecht, keeping one eye firmly on securing a place in the round of 16.\n\nDespite a turbulent domestic campaign, Sean Dyche’s side remain well positioned to progress in Europe. Forest sit in a promising spot heading into the final group fixtures, though they will still need a result against a Utrecht team who, despite sitting 32nd in the league phase standings, cannot be underestimated.\n\nForest had enjoyed a three-match winning run – scoring three goals in each victory over Leeds, Liverpool and Malmö – but their momentum has stalled since.\n\nA dip in results has dragged them back into a mid-season relegation battle, something the club hoped to avoid following Dyche’s appointment in October.\n\nDays after edging past bottom-placed Wolves, the Tricky Trees fell to a comfortable defeat away at Everton, leaving them 17th in the Premier League and just two points above the relegation zone.\n\nAttention now turns back to the Europa League, where Forest sit two points outside the top seven and four off first place. With the league phase tightly congested, every point against those around them is pivotal.\n\nUtrecht, meanwhile, are competing in European football for the first time in 14 years. They are one of only five teams yet to record a win in this season’s competition, having drawn once and lost four. Their solitary point came against Porto before falling to a fourth defeat against Real Betis on matchweek five.\n\nDomestically, however, Ron Jans’ side has been far more consistent. Just five defeats in 15 league matches have pushed Utrecht into the European positions once again as they look to turn what has been an occasional high into a more regular achievement.\n\nThey enter this match as clear underdogs but will hope to channel their steady league form into a much-needed European lift.\n\nUtrecht will be without midfielder Davy van den Berg, who remains sidelined through injury, while goalkeeper Vasilis Barkas is recovering but could return in time to start. Attacking midfielder Victor Jensen (hamstring) and full-back Niklas Vesterlund (knee) will also miss Thursday’s clash.\n\nFor Nottingham Forest, Dyche remains without full-back Ola Aina, midfielder Douglas Luiz (both thigh) and striker Chris Wood (knee), with all three continuing their rehabilitation. Defender Murillo is facing a race against time to return from a hamstring issue and illness, having missed Forest’s last three matches in all competitions.\n\nUTR: Barkas; Horemans, Van De Hoorn, Viergever, El Karouani; Bozdogan, Ongena, De Wit; Rodriguez, Min, Cathline",

    "fullText": "Tourism in Portugal has reached record numbers over the past two years, with over 31 million visitors in 2024.\n\nAlthough the coastal wonders of the Algarve region and the historic castles of Sintra are often a selling point for tourists, I took the seven-hour trip for reasons unrelated to wanderlust.\n\nPortimão, Portugal, is the home of Afro Nation, the biggest annual Afrobeats festival in the world — and this summer, I was one of the 40,000 festival-goers in attendance.\n\nThough dancing on the stunning beaches of Portugal to the sounds of Burna Boy and Tems live was definitely a bucket-list experience that I wouldn't have traded for the world, I'm not sure it's one I would repeat.\n\nDon't get me wrong: This realization had nothing to do with a lackluster experience. There is nothing dull about being serenaded by a shirtless Damini, and there was nothing disappointing about Portugal, either.\n\nInstead, I left feeling like I hadn't visited Portugal at all, but rather that I attended an event that just happened to be there.\n\nSomewhere between day two and day three, it hit me: I was in Portugal, but I wasn't really seeing the country.\n\nMy days weren't spent wandering tiled alleyways or eating salted cod by the water. Instead, I spent all my downtime resting at my resort, ordering food, getting dressed, and then heading back onto the beach — not for a swim, but for another 12 hours of music.\n\nThe experience wasn't exactly cheap, either. Aside from the nearly $600 I spent on the festival tickets, food and drinks were expensive at the venue, and rideshare trips cost more than I'd planned on spending, probably due to the crowds.\n\nI don't regret what I spent on the experience, but I did find myself thinking about what it would have been like to spend that money at a Lisbon flea market or on a cooking class, learning how to make pastel de nata from a local.\n\nThe beach could've been in Miami. The resort could've been in Cancún. The only Portuguese thing about my trip was the exchange rate.\n\nI did have two days after the festival ended to explore Lisbon, but it wasn't nearly enough time. I was exhausted after three days of standing on my feet and singing along, and after all of the rideshares we had purchased, both my feet and my wallet needed a break.\n\nOnce I got home, I noticed that my Instagram feed was flooded with other people's Portugal trips: sunsets on sailboats in Portimão, wine in Porto, mist hanging over Sintra's castles.\n\nI felt like they'd gotten to see Portugal. I'd gotten to see a festival that happened to be hosted there.\n\nI don't regret my trip — Afro Nation itself was unforgettable. I loved the music, the chaos, the feeling of being surrounded by a global community all singing Burna Boy under the same sky.\n\nIn an ideal world, I'd be able to go back to Afro Nation with an extra three or four days to actually roam. However, extra days meant extra costs for food, accommodations, and the experiences I was so desperate to have — and unfortunately, I didn't have unlimited PTO.\n\nI learned that my idea of a perfect trip doesn't center on an international festival or specific experience. I don't want to cross an ocean just to stand in a crowd.\n\nMy version of travel definitely includes sun, sand, and bottomless drinks, but also curiosity. I want to wander, learn, and actually see where I am.\n\nI'd say that Portugal is still on my travel bucket list — though I went, I barely touched it. Next time, I'm not going for a stage on the beach. I'm going for the country.",

    "fullText": "Since I was a child, receiving holiday cards has been one of my favorite parts of December.\n\nI love seeing the snapshots families choose to represent their year and reading the little updates that I don't get on social media.\n\nWhen I was in my 20s, I wanted to start sending my own, but I felt I had to wait for traditional milestones — like getting married and having kids — before it would feel \"appropriate.\"\n\nIn my mind, holiday cards seemed like a privilege reserved for conventional lives.\n\nAs the years went by, I continued to see stories about unmarried, single, or child-free women sending holiday cards that poked fun at their status. They'd pose with sad faces and wine bottles or include clever quips about being alone once again.\n\nEvery year, without fail, someone would send me these articles as if I could relate, but I couldn't. To each their own, of course, but I never saw my life as something to be made fun of, and I definitely didn't feel sorry for myself.\n\nSo, I created a new holiday card tradition — one that celebrates my beautiful and full life.\n\nAs I neared 30, I started doing a lot of solo traveling and set the goal of visiting all 63 major US national parks on my own by the time I turned 40.\n\nThough I was posting some of my trips on social media, I also wanted to share them more personally with my friends and family.\n\nFinally, I decided to print a holiday card featuring a photo from a summer trip I took to Canada — a simple shot of my backpack overlooking the mountains of Banff National Park.\n\nI hesitated for a while before mailing them, worried that friends and family might find it narcissistic or odd to receive a card with only me in it.\n\nHowever, many who received the card reached out to express their love for the photo and how happy they were to get it in the mail.\n\nI've kept the tradition going ever since — for nearly 10 years now, through my entire 30s, I've sent a card filled with my favorite photos from the year's solo adventures.\n\nFriends and family often ask well in advance if they're still on my mailing list and tell me how much they look forward to receiving them.\n\nFor me, sharing these more personal photos — the ones I cherish most — in a tangible, intimate way has become a highlight of the season.\n\nCreating the cards each year makes me feel empowered, proud of my accomplishments, and confident in the life I've chosen.\n\nMore than anything, it's a reminder that holiday cards can celebrate joy, connection, and the version of life you're proud to live — however unconventional it may be.",

    "title": "I went on a monthlong nomad cruise. The travel disappointed, but the community onboard didn't.",
    "description": "After 15 years as a digital nomad, Kaisu Koskela went on her first cruise. She found it both exciting and overwhelming.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kaisu Koskela, 48, a postdoctoral researcher on digital nomads. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a digital nomad for 15 years, so Nomad Cruise had been on my radar for a while. What began a decade ago as a relocation cruise for remote workers has grown into something much bigger — twice-yearly trips that feel like floating community conferences.\n\nAs a researcher and policy advisor on digital nomadism, I was especially curious. After some deliberation, my partner and I booked the 27-day Pacific crossing from Seattle to Sydney.\n\nNeither of us had ever been on a cruise before. It felt exciting, but also overwhelming.\n\nSomething was always happening: talks on life and work, meetups, and workshops. All of that was just the nomad program. The ship added even more, from cabaret shows to talks on local history. We also had full days ashore in places like Honolulu and Samoa.\n\nStarlink WiFi made working easy, and I met people in all kinds of fields, from AI to videography. But it was a long route, and no one was overly focused on productivity, including me.\n\nI'd planned to finish an article but never got to it, and honestly, I didn't mind. I was there for the experience.\n\nThe 230 passengers felt like a true snapshot of the nomad world. The youngest passenger was 23, and the oldest was in their 60s, but the majority were in their 30s.\n\nThe cruise is set up as a peer-learning conference: passengers give talks and share their expertise for free. I spoke about digital nomad visas and helped people one-on-one afterward. In return, before I got onstage a performance coach prepped me for my talk, and a designer explained a confusing part of my chart. Everyone gave something.\n\nI was surprised by how many passengers weren't nomads yet. They'd come for inspiration. Some were so enamored by the idea of location independence that they quit their jobs on the spot, pushed over the edge by burnout and encouraged by others to go freelance and build something of their own.\n\nA common theme kept coming up: Don't stay tied to an employer who's breaking you down.\n\nAs the days passed, we created more together. In the first week, someone formed a choir. I joined, and we rehearsed on every sea day before performing a full concert with professional lights and sound. I've had to sacrifice very little to be a digital nomad, but singing in a choir is off the table. Having one of my hobbies back for a month felt incredible.\n\nMeetups took off just as easily. I posted one for speed puzzling and ended up playing with a group that included someone who'd competed in the World Puzzling Championship. What started as a fangirl moment became real technique training.\n\nThe community was big enough that no matter how niche the interest, someone else shared it.\n\nLife onboard was easy — the staff were wonderful, and the vibe felt warm. But being a \"cruise tourist\" on land felt different\n\nVanuatu, an island archipelago in the South Pacific, was our final stop. It was also a new country for me. There, we were dropped on an otherwise uninhabited island where bars and food stalls had been set up just for us. Technically, I've now been to Vanuatu, but I had no contact with local life. I didn't love that.\n\nCruise stops are short; you're usually back onboard by 4:30 p.m. Early in the trip, after docking in Hawaii, we rushed around Maui trying to see everything. It felt pointless, a YouTube video would've given me the same overview.\n\nWe'd cracked the formula by the time we reached Savusavu in Fiji. It was a real town with a market, and we just wandered, with no agenda. I preferred those stops; even a tiny slice of local life beats racing through a checklist.\n\nThe remoteness of the Pacific was surreal. Seattle to Hawaii took a week; Hawaii to Samoa took another 16 days with no land, no ships — just ocean and the occasional pod of dolphins.\n\nThere was even a Crossing the Line ceremony for first-time equator crossers. We had to kiss a fish and jump into the pool. I loved it.\n\nNomad Cruise was expensive — €4,300, or about $5,000 each — so we thought hard before booking. We chose a basic cabin with a window and ate like royalty.\n\nAlcohol was extra, though happy hour made wine about $6 a glass. Onboard purchases came with an automatic 18% tip, plus a crew appreciation fee of about $17 per day. But reaching these destinations on our own would've cost more, and once we were on the ship, I stopped thinking about money; everything felt free.\n\nLeaving after a month on the cruise felt surreal; the community bubble was hard to step out of. I loved the people, the sunsets, and even the small things like watching the weather and birdlife change across the ocean.\n\nI'm sure I'll cross paths and deepen connections with some of the people I met on board. We shared something special.",
