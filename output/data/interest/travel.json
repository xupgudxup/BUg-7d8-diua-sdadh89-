    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

    "description": "Disney reported \"headwinds\" in international visitation to its American parks as foreign travelers continue to avoid the US.",
    "fullText": "Looks like even \"The Most Magical Place on Earth\" isn't enough to entice foreign travelers who are skipping the US.\n\nDisney is facing some \"international visitation headwinds\" at its parks in the US, which include Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California, the Walt Disney Company said in its first-quarter earnings report on Monday.\n\nDespite the slowdown in international visitors, the company reported growth in its experiences segment, with visitation at its domestic parks up 1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nHugh Johnston, Disney CFO, told analysts on a call that the company has less visibility into international visitor trends than domestic because foreign travelers tend to stay in non-Disney hotels, but that there were other indicators international visitation was down.\n\n\"As a result of that, we pivoted our marketing and sales efforts, promotional as well as marketing efforts to a more domestic audience, and we're able to keep attendance rates high from that perspective,\" he said.\n\nDisney's just the latest American company to feel the slowdown in foreigners traveling to the US.\n\nInternational visitation was down for the eighth straight month in December, according to data from the National Travel and Tourism Office. As of October, the number of international visitors to the US was down 5.5% in 2025 compared to a year prior.\n\nAmir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International, a market research consultancy that specializes in the travel tourism industry, said visits from Canada especially declined, but that there were also significant declines in visits from countries like Germany, France, and India.\n\nCanadian visits to the US were down 22% year-to-date as of October compared to a year prior, according to NTTO data.\n\n\"We have an image problem right now with our Canadian neighbors to the North and, as evidenced with some other countries, we have an image problem in some of our key international feeder markets as well,\" Eylon told Business Insider.\n\nHis firm's research has found a majority of Canadians say American trade policies and political rhetoric are deterring them from visiting the US in the next 12 months. Many also say they do not feel like the US is a safe place to visit.\n\nCanadians also typically make up a significant portion of international travel to Florida, so Eylon said Disney likely isn't the only destination in the Sunshine State feeling the slowdown.\n\nTravelers seeking to avoid the US also have other options when it comes to experiencing Disney. Disneyland Paris is fully owned by the Walt Disney Company, while the company has minority ownership in the Disney resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Disney has no ownership in Tokyo Disneyland, which operates under a licensing agreement.\n\nDisney also benefited from consistent demand in domestic leisure travel, with Americans continuing to prioritize travel, Eylon said.\n\nAnna Abelson, an adjunct professor at New York University's Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality, said the slowdown in international visitors to Disney underscored a broader industry shift.\n\n\"Even 'bucket list' icons are navigating significant macroeconomic volatility, ranging from currency fluctuations to shifting geopolitical sentiments,\" Abelson told Business Insider.\n\nHave a story to share about travel to the US?

When Padilla Vélez tried to drive away, they began shooting. As bullets riddled the car, amid the chaos of glass exploding and pain in her shoulder, Crispin heard Padilla Vélez say he'd been shot.\n\nHe had been shot in the head, and would die three weeks later on Jan. 22, NBC Philadelphia reported.\n\nNo person of interest has been named and no arrests have been made nearly a month since the shooting.\n\nCrispin alleged to the Inquirer that San Juan police did not visit the scene until five days after the crime, and did not interview her until Jan. 21.\n\nSan Juan police did not respond to several calls for comments on Friday.\n\nQuestions still linger in the investigation.\n\nCrispin says at one point during the ordeal, she heard some of the attackers yell at others to stop shooting because there was a woman in the car, giving her the impression that they may have made a mistake.\n\nThey searched her purse, took nothing and returned her phone, she told the Inquirer.\n\nPerhaps most surprising of all, she says one of the attackers gave them directions to get out of the neighborhood while Crispin tended to the victim.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nPadilla Vélez was an accomplished scientist with publications in various prestigious science journals and platforms.\n\nIn a moving tribute on Facebook, Crispin mourned the future that was snatched away from them.\n\n\"So much was stolen from us in just a moment.

    "fullText": "Clive Campbell, like many travelers, parked his car at a Midlands airport before boarding a plane over the Christmas holiday. When he returned days later, he was surprised to find that his car was gone.\n\nHis 2022 Nissan Pathfinder, which he’d parked at a long-term parking facility at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport, had been repossessed on Dec. 28, 2025 by West Columbia Recovery & Towing Company at the behest of Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\nThe problem? The Pathfinder was paid in full and free of any liens, according to a certificate of title Campbell attached to a lawsuit he filed against the towing company and Navy Federal.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday, raises questions about whether the Columbia Metropolitan Airport Police Department routinely grants towing access to private tow companies to airport parking facilities, whether such access is governed by a contractual relationship, and whether lien status is verified prior to removal of vehicles left in long-term parking by traveling passengers, Campbell told The State in an email.\n\nA spokesperson with the airport police department said she would look into the matter and get back with The State.\n\nNavy Federal declined to comment on the case.\n\nWhen Campbell realized his car was missing, he contacted airport police, who confirmed the vehicle had been repossessed. Campbell then reached out to the towing company and provided a New York State Certificate of Title reflecting no recorded lien against the vehicle, according to the suit.\n\nDespite documentation, the towing company refused to release the vehicle to Campbell, while still continuing to rack up storage fees, the suit said.\n\nCampbell was then prompted to file a Temporary Restraining Order against the company as well to secure a police report.\n\nThe report, which was attached to the lawsuit as an exhibit, shows the tow was initiated based on information allegedly provided by Navy Federal Credit Union; law-enforcement database checks revealed no active lien; documentation reviewed appeared to show the lien had been satisfied and released; and the towing company nevertheless refused to release the vehicle, according to the suit.\n\nCampbell’s request for a Temporary Restraining Order remains pending, according to court records.\n\nMeanwhile, when asked whether the towing company needs confirmation of an active lien before repossessing a car, a manager with the company told The State “to call Navy Federal.”\n\nIt’s the same thing they advised Campbell after he’d provided proof that he owned the car free and clear.\n\nThe towing company “did not dispute the absence of a lien or court order and instead directed (Campbell) to ‘call Navy Federal,’ a party with no enforceable interest,” the suit said.\n\nCampbell claims that Navy Federal and the towing company are guilty of, among other things, conversion, trespass to chattels, civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment.\n\nHe has asked the court for compensatory and punitive damages along with an order that the towing company release his vehicle free of any towing and storage fees, according to the suit.",

    "title": "These are the 21 most dangerous countries for US travelers, according to the State Department",
    "description": "The US State Department warns Americans not to travel to these 21 countries due to risks like terrorism, kidnapping, and limited embassy support.",
    "fullText": "Overseas travel can be an immensely enriching experience, from learning about different cultures to seeing some of the world's greatest sights, but in some countries, it can also come with risks.\n\nThe US State Department ranks 21 countries around the world as a travel advisory level four, \"Do Not Travel\" due to risks like terrorism and kidnapping.\n\n\"All countries will rank destinations slightly differently,\" Alan Fyall, a professor of tourism at the University of Central Florida, told Business Insider.\n\nWhile they frequently overlap, the US and the UK don't have identical lists, for example. Historical and cultural ties, proximity, and level of familiarity may all play a role in shaping these lists, he said.\n\nFor some of these countries, the US has suspended embassy operations. That makes it difficult for it to assist travelers when they're in trouble, and that's part of the reason the warnings can be stringent, said Fyall.\n\n\"Do you really want to go and rescue your citizens from a country that, really, they're not that advised to go to in the first place?\" he said.\n\nThe US and UK governments also issue warnings for specific areas in some countries, such as near the Thailand-Malaysia border, the Western Desert in Egypt, or parts of Israel. In July 2025, the US State Department changed Israel and the West Bank's travel advisory from a \"do-not-travel\" to a \"reconsider travel\" country, but the level four advisory has remained for Gaza as well as the Israeli regions near the Lebanese, Syrian, or Egyptian borders.\n\nWhile some risk-takers travel to these countries for a thrill, others visit family or for business.\n\n\"Some people think the perceived risk is overstated,\" Edward Dramberger, a University of South Carolina tourism and hospitality professor, told Business Insider.\n\nFor those who travel to level-four countries, the US State Department often offers routine advice, including staying aware of your surroundings, keeping your travel documents on hand, drafting a will before travel, creating a plan to leave the country without the aid of the US government, and monitoring local news for emergency situations.\n\nNations and regions can change travel advisory levels on the US' list based on changing circumstances, but these are the 21 countries the State Department considers \"do-not-travel\" zones as of January 2026.\n\nSitting between Iran and Pakistan, mountainous Afghanistan has rugged terrain and an arid climate.\n\n\"People perceive Afghanistan as just a desolate, mountain desert country with no attributes, no culture, which is wrong,\" Dramberger said.\n\nDecades of coups, civil wars, and invasions have made the country difficult for travelers to get to know, except via the news.\n\nThe US State Department lists crime, civil unrest, terrorism, wrongful detention, health, and kidnapping among the safety concerns when traveling to Afghanistan. Medical care may be more difficult to obtain in rural areas.\n\nIn 2021, the US Embassy in Kabul closed its operations in the country.\n\nThe agency recommends that American visitors keep a low profile while in the country.\n\nOnce part of the Soviet Union, Belarus maintains close ties with its neighbor, Russia. From Gothic architecture to rare near-endangered species, Belarus has attractions for castle seekers and nature enthusiasts.\n\nIn recent years, Belarus has allowed Russia to use some of its territory to invade Ukraine.\n\nThe risk of civil unrest makes visits to Belarus unwise, according to the State Department. The US Embassy suspended operations there in 2022.\n\nAmericans traveling to Belarus should exercise the usual precautions for visiting high-risk countries and consider leaving their phones, computers, and other electronic devices behind. The State Department also recommends not accessing social media accounts while in Belarus because they may be monitored.\n\nOuagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, is a West African hub of culture and arts, and the country also has an incredible wildlife refuge, Réserve de Nazinga, near its border with Ghana.\n\nDespite the country's positive attributes, the US State Department advises that travelers avoid visiting the country.\n\nThe country's government has declared a state of emergency for several regions.\n\nTerrorism, crime, and other threats have displaced over 2 million residents, as reported by the United Nations. While the displacement crisis has been slowly decreasing, the country still finds itself engulfed in a deep humanitarian crisis.\n\nSince 2015, several citizens of countries like the US have been kidnapped in Burkina Faso, according to the US Overseas Security Advisory Council, which classifies the situation in the country as \"critical.\"\n\nWhile the US Embassy still operates in Ouagadougou, government employees are unable to travel to many parts of the country due to safety concerns, which include the threat of terrorist violence.\n\nIn January 2026, the US government began suspending visas and limiting entry for citizens of 39 countries, including Burkina Faso. As a response measure, the West African country also suspended visas for US citizens.\n\nThe US government's recommendations for lowering risk while traveling in Burkina Faso include avoiding areas where Westerners typically travel and not resisting if someone attempts to rob you.\n\nThe Central African Republic touches several other level-four countries, including Sudan and South Sudan, and is home to incredibly rich biodiversity in its national parks, including Dzanga-Sangha National Park and Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park.\n\nMany of the country's species are endangered, and its citizens have faced decades of instability, according to the United Nations.\n\nRecently, armed groups have targeted Muslims and refugees.\n\nThe US State Department considers CAR a dangerous travel destination due to threats of terrorism, crime, civil unrest, unexploded land mines, and kidnapping, as well as health concerns. US citizens can expect limited help from the US Embassy in Bangui, CAR's capital.\n\nDue to the threat of kidnapping, the US' travel advisory website suggests travelers leave DNA samples with their doctor and establish proof-of-life protocols with family or friends so they can assist you if you're abducted. The State Department also suggests keeping a low profile, avoiding travel to rebel-controlled areas, and not resisting robbery attempts.\n\nThe Caribbean country of Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. The country, which won its independence from France in 1804, maintains some of its historic monuments, like its Citadelle Laferrière.\n\nIn recent years, the country has fallen under a state of emergency. In July 2023, the US ordered government employees to leave the country, and since 2025, the US government has enforced a ban on flights to Port-au-Prince, its capital, due to gang violence. The ban has since been extended to March 2026, and the country's capital remains cut off from US travel.\n\nIn addition to the flight ban, the country is also under a travel ban to the US, meaning that its citizens cannot enter the country, and that new visas are not being issued.\n\nIn the capital city of Port-au-Prince, local authorities have enforced curfews and \"shelter-in-place\" advisories since the beginning of the state of emergency.\n\nThe State Department has warned that armed robberies, sexual assaults, and kidnappings are among the reasons to reconsider travel to Haiti.\n\nAnyone who does go should avoid walking in the streets when possible, travel in groups, and keep vehicle doors and windows locked when driving, according to the State Department.\n\nOne way to see over 800 miles of this Middle Eastern country is the Trans-Iranian Railway, which runs from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf. Tehran, the capital, lies along the route.\n\nSome of the country's natural wonders include dormant volcanoes and the stunning limestone formations of Badab-e Surt.\n\nRight now, it's not safe for US citizens to travel to the country, according to the State Department.\n\nFollowing protests in 2022, thousands of people were arrested and tortured by Iranian authorities, according to Amnesty International.\n\nSince December 2025, massive anti-government protests have broken out in the country yet again and have recently resulted in violent crackdowns by state actors, with thousands of deaths and arrests in the tens of thousands. The Iranian government has also imposed an internet blackout in efforts to censor information about the protests.\n\nThe US government has cautioned that Iranian officials may wrongfully and arbitrarily detain or imprison US nationals and other foreigners.\n\nThe travel advisory also warns of terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping throughout the country.\n\nThe US doesn't have a physical embassy in Iran. The American government's travel advisory site states that visitors should have a means of leaving Iran that doesn't depend on its assistance, as it cannot provide consular support or facilitate departure from the country.\n\nFrom the Tigris and Euphrates to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Iraq holds sites that many remember from their ancient history textbooks. Sadly, some of its artifacts were lost to looting during the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\nSince the US invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Iraq has faced threats from terrorist groups such as ISIS.\n\nTerrorism, kidnapping, and civil unrest are enough of a risk that the State Department considers Iraq a level-four country.\n\nAs of August 2025, ISIS was still active in parts of Iraq, according to OSAC. Armed conflict and terrorist threats are dangerous at the northern borders, per the State Department.\n\nThe State Department also warns that US travelers should avoid the country's northern border and consider making arrangements with a professional security organization for any visits. US employees in the country are also forbidden from using Baghdad International Airport for travel due to security concerns.\n\nAt just over 4,000 square miles, Lebanon is just a bit bigger than Puerto Rico.\n\nA lengthy civil war from 1975 to 1990 left scars in its capital city of Beirut and beyond. In recent years, an economic crisis has taken a toll. Meanwhile, conflicts in neighboring Israel and Syria have also affected Lebanon.\n\nThe US government has said that terrorist groups operating in Lebanon put travelers at risk. There have been suicide bombings, and a gunman opened fire at the embassy in Beirut in June 2024.\n\nThe country's level four travel advisory warns of crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, armed conflict, and unexploded land mines.\n\nThe State Department also warns that US citizens should especially avoid Southern Lebanon, the country's border with Syria, and refugee settlements, urging them to depart if they are there.\n\nVisitors should take the advised security measures for high-risk countries and have a kidnapping protocol in place with family members, per the State Department.\n\nSituated between Egypt and Algeria, Libya has a coastline along the gorgeous Mediterranean Sea. Roman emperor Septimius Severus was born in Leptis Magna, an UNESCO World Heritage site with striking ruins of large, impressive buildings.\n\nViolence, including two recent civil wars, has marred the country. Armed groups have attacked hotels and airports in Tripoli, Sruman, and other cities, according to the State Department. The US Embassy hasn't been active in Tripoli since 2014.\n\nThe State Department warns of violent crime, terrorism, unexploded land mines, civil unrest, widespread kidnapping, and armed conflict throughout the country, and suggests that US citizens draft a will and consult with a professional security organization if traveling to the country.\n\nThe agency urges US citizens in the country to depart as soon as possible via commercial means, even though US commercial flights aren't allowed to operate within the country's airspace.\n\nCenturies-old mosques can be found in Mali's Timbuktu, symbols of its history as a seat of Islamic culture and learning. Its marketplace drew travelers and traders during the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nTo the southwest of Timbuktu is Bamako, Mali's capital. Outside the city and in other parts of the country, terrorists and kidnappers target foreign visitors in the hopes of getting a ransom, according to OSAC. US personnel aren't allowed to visit nightclubs or attend concerts for safety reasons.\n\nThe State Department's advisory warns of terrorism, civil unrest, inadequate health services, and violent crime, including kidnapping, throughout the country.\n\nSome advice for traveling in Mali includes avoiding walking deserted streets at night, carrying minimal cash, not leaving valuables in your hotel, and looking for a well-lit area when stopped by police.\n\nUS citizens are also advised to avoid travel outside Bamako and to have a plan to leave an emergency plan that doesn't require help from the US government.\n\nLocated on the Bay of Bengal in Southeast Asia, Myanmar boasts a fascinating mix of architecture, from pagodas and palaces to colonial hotels and government offices. One stupa, or pagoda, the Shwedagon, is the country's most sacred Buddhist site.\n\nA coup in 2021 sparked demonstrations. The military detained protestors and used force against them and bystanders, according to the State Department.\n\nThe risk of continued civil unrest and wrongful detentions, and arbitrary arrests, as well as poor health infrastructure, land mines, and crime, makes it unwise to travel to the country, according to the US State Department travel advisory.\n\nSome armed groups have used improvised explosive devices in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, while NGOs have reported land mines in Shan State, Chin State, and Kachin State.\n\nVisitors to the landlocked African country of Niger can explore the ancient mud-brick mosque of Grande Mosquée d'Agadez and the storied old town of Agadez, as well as see the Sahara Desert and the country's unique wildlife.\n\nIn October 2025, the US authorized that all government employees leave the country due to widespread safety concerns. Parts of the country have been under a state of emergency for over a decade, and local authorities \"require military escorts for any foreigners\" traveling outside the capital, Niamey, per the US State Department.\n\nThe agency warns of violent crime, civil unrest, terrorism, limited health services, and kidnapping throughout the country.\n\nIf they choose to visit anyway, US citizens are advised by the government to draft a will and have an emergency plan that doesn't depend on support from the US Embassy.\n\nOne of the world's most mysterious and isolated countries, North Korea shares borders with South Korea, China, and Russia. Kim Jong-Un took over the presidency in 2011, continuing a family dynasty that's been in power since the 1950s.\n\nIn 2025, North Korea reopened to Western tourists for the first time since the pandemic. The State Department warns that US nationals may be arrested and held for extended periods.\n\nIt warns that it cannot provide emergency services to its citizens who are detained, as the two countries do not have diplomatic relations.\n\nRussia's cities contain dazzling buildings, and its landscape is breathtaking. Siberia's Lake Baikal is the planet's oldest and deepest. The world's last woolly mammoths lived and died out on Wrangel Island, where polar bears, musk oxen, and walruses now congregate.\n\nDue to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US State Department has declared it unsafe for US citizens, who may face harassment or detention. The US State Department urges every US citizen in the country to leave immediately, and notes that authorities might not inform the US government if an American is arrested.\n\nThe US' travel advisory also cited drone attacks and explosions in Moscow, St. Petersburg, locations near the Ukrainian border, and other areas.\n\nThe State Department notes there may be risks for those with dual US-Russian nationality. Because the situation is volatile, travelers should stay informed about the latest local news while visiting.\n\nDigital communications also pose a risk, and the agency advises US citizens to reconsider bringing any electronic devices into the country, as the Russian government's security services closely monitor electronic communications and can use them to arrest foreign nationals.\n\nThose who still choose to travel to the country are advised by the government to prepare for wrongful detention, draft a will, and leave DNA samples with a medical provider.\n\nLocated in the Horn of Africa, Somalia's lengthy coastline borders the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. Somali archaeologist Sada Mire has called the capital, Mogadishu, an \"unbreakable pearl,\" tracing its history as a trade center back to the first century AD.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Somalia experienced famine and civil war. Instability continued in the form of terror attacks, including a suicide bombing on a popular beach in 2024.\n\nDue to the possibility of kidnapping, terrorism, and civil unrest, the US has issued a do-not-travel advisory. The State Department notes that the US also has very limited consular services in the country and that health services in Somalia can be limited and absent in rural areas.\n\nThe State Department also advised against sailing near Somalia's coast due to piracy.\n\nIt was only during the 21st century that South Sudan declared its independence and was recognized as a sovereign state. Its neighbors include Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIts short history was dominated by a civil war, and a new conflict is brewing between the military and an opposition force, which clashed near the Ethiopian border. NGOs, the UN, and others have found it difficult to accurately assess crime levels, but firearms easily cross the border from Sudan, according to OSAC.\n\nThe US State Department warns of civil unrest, violent crimes, kidnapping, unexploded land mines, and limited health services in the country and urges US citizens not to travel to the country for any reason.\n\nAnyone traveling in South Sudan should avoid its border areas and adhere to restrictions around public photography and videography, the State Department says.\n\nKhartoum, Sudan, is where the Blue and White Niles meet. Meroë is further north, where ancient Kushite rulers lived and were buried in pyramids. Some date back to the third century BCE; several have collapsed but others retain decorative carvings.\n\nCivil war threatens not only the archaeological history but locals and travelers. Officials at the US Embassy hastily evacuated Khartoum in 2023, soon after the conflict broke out. Various groups frequently engage in violent fighting, the State Department says.\n\nThe Darfur, Khartoum, and Kordofan regions have all been sites for kidnappings, according to OSAC. The Khartoum International Airport is closed.\n\nThe State Department warns of widespread violent crime, kidnapping, terrorism, unrest, unexploded land mines, and extremely limited health services in the country.\n\nThe US travel advisory suggests travelers be aware of their surroundings, especially in locations where Westerners typically visit, and that they draft a proof-of-life protocol with loved ones in case of kidnapping.\n\nNot only is Damascus the capital of Syria, but it's also the seat of cultural history. Established over 2,000 years ago, it's one of the oldest cities in the Middle East. Evidence of its Roman and Byzantine past exists alongside important Islamic monuments such as the Umayyad Mosque.\n\nDespite the allure of these ancient sites, the US doesn't recommend travel to Syria. A lengthy civil war broke out in 2011, with efforts to oust Bashar Assad from power. Since Assad resigned at the end of 2024, violence has continued to erupt in parts of western Syria.\n\nThe State Department has also warned that terrorism, kidnapping and hostage-taking, and unjust detention are risks in Syria, saying that \"no part of Syria is safe from violence.\"\n\nThe agency recommends visitors set up proof-of-life protocols with loved ones, among other precautions, before and during travel.\n\nMuch like Istanbul's Hagia Sofia, for which it was named, the Saint Sophia Cathedral serves as an eye-catching landmark in Kyiv. It's just one of the Ukrainian capital's architectural treasures.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and years of fighting have ensued, mainly in the east, where the border lies. Belarusian troops are also present along its border with Ukraine.\n\nThe ongoing conflict is the principal reason the US government cautions against visiting. Areas that aren't on the frontline of fighting could still experience drone and missile attacks, the State Department notes.\n\nDrafting a will, coordinating a security plan, and creating a communication protocol with loved ones are just a few of the steps suggested on the travel advisory website.\n\nWith its dizzying height of over 3,000 feet, the Salto Ángel waterfall has drawn tourists for decades, though it's notoriously tricky to access. It's found in the southeast of Venezuela, in the Canaima National Park, in the Amazon rainforest near the border with Brazil and Guyana.\n\nThe country is in the midst of an economic and political crisis. Heavily reliant on oil for income, it suffered years of recession. In 2024, the US and several other countries refused to recognize the results of its presidential election, calling it fraudulent, BBC News reported at the time.\n\nSince then, the US has launched a multifaceted military presence that has increased naval posture and tensions in the Caribbean and led to the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro by US military forces in January.\n\nThe US Embassy ceased operations in Caracas in 2019 amid the country's deep economic crisis. The State Department has issued warnings about arbitrary detentions and unpredictable enforcement of local laws. In 2023 and 2025, Venezuela released several Americans, some of whom were \"wrongfully detained,\" according to the US government.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory emphasizes the \"extreme danger to US citizens living in or traveling to Venezuela\" and urges all US citizens and lawful permanent residents to leave the country immediately.\n\nThe travel advisory warns of wrongful detention and torture, arbitrary law enforcement, civil unrest, widespread violent crime, including kidnapping, and poor health services throughout the country.\n\nTravelers who still choose to visit the country may want to hire a professional security team during their stay and prepare a will before their trip, according to the US travel advisory site.\n\nBeautiful gypsum patterns adorn red fired-brick buildings in the Old City of Sana'a. People have lived in this area of Yemen for over 2,500 years. The country is located on the Arabian Peninsula next to Saudi Arabia and Oman.\n\nYemen's civil war started over a decade ago and continues today. The threat of armed conflict continues, according to OSAC. Detained US citizens have not been allowed to contact their families or the embassy, which suspended its operations in 2015.\n\nThe US travel advisory says US citizens should avoid travel to the country due to the threat of terrorism, civil unrest, unexploded land mines, crime, including kidnapping, and health risks.\n\nThe State Department warns against visiting the Yemeni island of Socotra. Some travel companies have offered trips there with unofficial visas, which puts travelers at risk, according to the travel advisory website.",

    "fullText": "Being spontaneous and going with the flow when traveling might sound romantic and adventurous, but I believe the best experiences come with a bit of prep work.\n\nSaving a list of places to visit on Google Maps gives me a sense of orientation when I arrive somewhere new — but when those pins come from algorithm-fed videos, influencers, and glossy listicles, I find they often miss the mark.\n\nCreators and I rarely share the same definition of what's worth seeing or eating, and media roundups can sometimes lack a personal touch.\n\nThat's why trusted insider tips remain my favorite way to get recommendations. Unfortunately, not every destination I travel to comes with a friend ready to share their carefully curated list of local gems.\n\nSo, I use dating apps. A few days before a trip, I change my Hinge location to a cool neighborhood in the city I'm visiting and ask locals for suggestions.\n\nThrough a mix of profile curation and the questions I ask my matches, I make my intentions clear from the start. And usually, people are happy to provide recommendations.\n\nRecently, while planning a trip to Istanbul, I set my location to Kadıköy. Within an hour, I had more than 50 locals ready for a chat.\n\nA quick, \"Hey, it's my first time visiting the city. Do you have any tips?\" is often enough to get the conversation going.\n\nTo make things even easier, I sometimes change one of my profile prompts to something that invites recommendation-giving. From Hinge's long list, there are plenty that work:\n\nFrom their responses — and their profiles (age, occupation, interests) — it's easy to tell if our tastes align and know who to ask for specific recommendations.\n\nFor example, I can ask an architect about a local building he thinks is underrated or a runner about the best nearby park for a morning run.\n\nIf the conversation flows, the person genuinely piques my curiosity, and I've got time in my itinerary, I sometimes meet my virtual guides in person.\n\nWhen I do, my usual dating safety rules apply: We meet in public (preferably in daylight), I share my location with someone I trust, I don't drink too much, and I always watch my drink.\n\nRomance is never completely off the table — who says you can't mix business with pleasure? However, most of my matches have remained on the app or turned into Instagram friendships.\n\nThrough these encounters, my matches have scored me discounts at their friends' stores, invited me to parties filled with locals, and even guided me on personalized bar-hopping adventures.\n\nI've found that most people naturally like to help others and to show their city in the best possible light. And if the chat is pleasant, I encourage them to reach out when they're in my city so I can return the favor.\n\nThis travel hack might be a single-person privilege. However, in times when main courses can sometimes only be ordered for two, there aren't many perks left — so let us have this one.",

    "fullText": "(Corrects to clarify remarks by official in paragraph 23)\n\nVERBIER, Switzerland, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A New Year fire that killed 40 people at a Swiss ski resort bar has shaken a lucrative tourism industry that long had an impeccable reputation and has piled pressure on the country to tighten safety standards.\n\nNews ​that \"Le Constellation\" bar, in the town of Crans-Montana in Canton Valais, had gone six years without a safety check quickly prompted officials to ban some practices, including the ‌use of sparkling candles blamed for the tragedy.\n\nThe stain on Switzerland's otherwise exemplary safety record was quickly felt as local hoteliers reported cancelled bookings in a canton where the cost of real estate in resorts such as nearby Verbier ‌can fetch prices on a par with Hong Kong.\n\n\"There were cancellations, there were reservation postponements to later dates in hotels,\" said Bruno Huggler, director of the Crans-Montana tourism office, after the blaze that killed mostly teenagers and injured more than 100 people.\n\nLe Constellation owners Jacques Moretti and his wife are under investigation for negligent homicide and other crimes.\n\nThe disaster has ignited a fractious political debate over safety, including calls for harmonised national standards in a country that prizes local autonomy.\n\nIt has also sparked alarm in Verbier's hospitality sector.\n\n\"We realize this could very well happen right here,\" said Lionel Dubois, head ⁠of Verbier's Association of Hoteliers, Cafe Owners and Restaurateurs. \"That, I think, ‌is a bit frightening.\"\n\nTourism in Switzerland was worth about $22.17 billion, or 3% of national output in 2021, official data showed.\n\nWhile bookings at Crans-Montana's roughly 1,300 hotel rooms have suffered, the overall picture is stable, as chalet and apartment rentals cover most stays, tourism boss Huggler said.\n\nYoung people have been ‍shaken, though, and while some restaurants are returning to life, bars remain quieter, said Cedric Berger, head of the Association of Apartment and Chalet Owners of the Crans-Montana Upper Plateau.\n\nSome local accommodation providers have seen cancellations in short-term vacation rentals.\n\n\"January is a month to forget, a lost month for everyone,\" said Berger.\n\nSurvivors of the fire, which also killed French and Italian citizens, are still hospitalised around Europe.\n\nCrans-Montana apartment owners from Italy ​and France are angry, said Berger, who is also a lawyer.\n\n\"People go to Valais not because it's the 'best party', but because it's Switzerland, and you think it's safe. If that quality ‌disappears, then Switzerland's 'fortress' is a bit shaken,\" he added.\n\nAnxiety about the fallout is palpable in Verbier, where Reuters contacted 37 hospitality venues.\n\nMost declined to speak or did not reply, though the 12 who did said checks were conducted properly. But all agreed that rules must be reinforced to guarantee regular inspections, limit numbers at venues and provide fire-safety training to staff.\n\nIn four of Switzerland's 26 cantons, including Valais, building insurance is not mandatory - potentially increasing risks for owners hit by fire, as well as weakening controls.\n\nThe Swiss Insurance Association said over 90% of buildings in Switzerland are insured according to market estimates, adding it does not keep precise figures on how many are not. Reuters could not establish if Le Constellation had building insurance.\n\nThe fire generated the ⁠biggest media storm around Switzerland since the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse bank, said Alexandre Edelmann, head of ​Presence Switzerland, the foreign ministry unit that promotes the country's image abroad.\n\nAs media reports about Switzerland jumped to 25 ​times more than average in early January, a crisis room was established to support people abroad following the fire, said Edelmann.\n\nLawmaker Jacqueline de Quattro, head of the lower house of parliament security committee, said the fire had exposed potential shortcomings in Switzerland's federal system, which allows cantons to set their own ‍rules.\n\n\"We believed we had strict rules and that Switzerland ⁠was well‑prepared,\" said de Quattro. \"But then we were brutally confronted with reality.\"\n\nProposing a national review to harmonise standards backed by an events industry group, she voiced concerns over event professionals' reports of sloppy work stemming from inadequate training, cost pressures and irregular inspections.\n\nBut the head of Verbier's Val de Bagnes municipality, Fabien Sauthier, said inspections need resources ⁠and that, while regular checks occur, it was tough to inspect some 400 public buildings annually with just four full-time safety officials.\n\nAnd any push towards greater federal oversight could face resistance.\n\n\"I'm a Swiss person, so I think the canton ‌should decide what it wants to do,\" said Willy Schranz, head of the municipal council in Adelboden in Canton Bern. \"If you take responsibility, then it's a ‌very good system.\"",

    "fullText": "Costco did not even sell merchandise on its website until 1998, and, in those days, the selection was very limited.\n\nAs a longtime member, I used the website for benefits such as Costco Travel and ancillary services, like TurboTax access, that the warehouse club sells. Until much more recently, though, I rarely bought anything there.\n\nNow, Costco has a greatly expanded selection, and it allows members to use Instacart and Shipt to order select items directly from its warehouses. It's building on that with its digital-only program, Costco Next, which lets members access items the warehouse club does not stock.\n\nIt's not a new service; it has technically been around since 2017. But Costco does not promote the offering, and it's something I, and many other members, did not know about.\n\nIn fact, I only learned about it because the chain started mentioning it during earnings calls, which most members do not listen to or read transcripts of.\n\nA third-party marketplace like the model pioneered by Amazon, Costco Next offers an expanded selection of items that never make it into a Costco warehouse. The program, however, differs from Amazon's approach in important ways.\n\nApril 17, 2001: Costco expands online with a B2B e‑commerce site aimed at business customers, accessible through the main Costco.com site, according to a 2001 Costco earnings release.\n\n2017: Costco partners with Shipt for grocery delivery in select U.S. markets and expands same‑day and two‑day delivery options for members, reported SuperMarket News.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 to 2021): Online sales surge dramatically as consumer demand for non‑contact shopping grows. Costco’s ecommerce growth in 2020 surpassed the prior five years combined, according to the retailer's fourth-quarter 2021 earnings release.\n\nCostco's deal with Shipt ended in 2025, according to Costco's website, and was replaced with an Instacart partnership.\n\n\"Our digital vision at Costco is to deliver a seamless experience that builds trust and loyalty with our members both in warehouse and online,\" Costco CEO Ron Vachris said during the company's first quarter 2025 earnings call. \"We aim to make shopping at Costco easier, faster, and more personal, no matter where or how our members choose to shop. This isn't about technology for technology's sake.\"\n\nCostco Next allows the retailer to offer more merchandise, but have it shipped directly from partners. The warehouse club, however, is still careful with its merchandise, and its buyers work with partner retailers.\n\nIt's a more carefully curated selection than Amazon offers, because Costco remains focused on offering value to members. The retailer has grown Costco Next from its modest beginnings.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nHistory of Costco: Company timeline and facts\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n\"Costco Next, our curated marketplace, also continues to show healthy year-over-year growth. In Q3 fiscal year 2025, our sales on Costco Next equaled our total sales for all of fiscal year 2022, and we are excited about the pipeline of new vendors and development for future rollout,\" CFO Gary Millerchip said during the company'sthird quarter 2025 earnings call.\n\nCostco Next is a curated third‑party marketplace that lets Costco members buy directly from select brands and manufacturers at discounted prices, without Costco holding all the inventory itself.\n\nProducts are offered from hand‑selected suppliers chosen for the quality of their merchandise and strong customer service, expanding the variety beyond typical warehouse inventory.\n\nThe platform helps Costco offer higher‑margin discretionary items (e.g., electronics, appliances, goods sold directly from vendors) while leveraging member pricing perks.\n\nAccording to strategic reports, Costco Next has become a scalable engine for high‑margin products, with estimated sales in Q3 2025 equal to Costco’s entire fiscal 2022 performance in that channel, AInvest reported.\n\nThe impetus for Costco Next is to strengthen e‑commerce and mobile growth by offering discounted deals from trusted brands that complement warehouse inventory.\n\n“Separate from what members will find in the warehouses or at Costco.com, Costco Next showcases products from some of Costco’s suppliers that have been selected for the quality of their merchandise and their exceptional customer service,” Costco General Merchandise Manager Cheryl Smeby said on Costco's website.\n\n“By shopping at Costco Next, you have access to a variety of products from these vendors, and you’ll get a discount that is available only to Costco members.\"\n\nCostco is not alone in adding an online marketplace.\n\n\"Marketplaces are a relatively simple, low-capital way of expanding choice and widening audiences,\" GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders shared on RetailWire.\n\nHe believes, however, that it's not as simple as tacking on an online marketplace to an existing business.\n\n\"If they work, they can generate incremental revenue. But they are not surefire winners. Retailers need to make sure they don’t just cannibalize existing sales, and they cannot be used as an excuse to neglect the core proposition. And of course, there are now so many marketplaces that the strategy is not really a big differentiator,\" Saunders added.\n\nHis Retailwire Brain Trust colleague, Jeff Hall, believes that online marketplaces are table stakes, but must be run with intent.\n\n\"They allow you to expand assortment, enter new categories, and test demand without tying up capital or taking markdown risk. Just as important, they attract new customers who often convert into higher value buyers of owned inventory,\" he posted.\n\nCostco Next has been around since 2017, but the brand has never promoted it.\n\n\"Costco instead relies on its memberships and rotating selection of deals to do the selling for it, often through social media and word of mouth. Costco Next benefits similarly from this fear of missing out,\" CustomerThink.com shared.\n\nThe services launched with about 15 suppliers.\n\n\"There are currently over 90 brands included in the Costco Next universe. Some are familiar: Mikasa dinnerware, Dearfoams slippers and Thomas Kinkade Studios fine art. You’ll also find Artika lighting products, Baggallini accessories, Bench activewear, Cangshan handcrafted cutlery, Briggs & Riley luggage and Golden Arowana flooring, among others,\" Kiplinger reported.",

    "description": "In college, Cameron Mofid set out on a mission to visit every country — not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront his obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
    "fullText": "As a kid, I pored over maps, flags, and history books, curious about what life looked like in far-off corners of the world. At the same time, I was quietly struggling with debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder, which often left me feeling trapped inside my own mind.\n\nOne night during my freshman year at the University of Miami, I came across an article in my apartment that stunned me. It said that more people had been to space than had visited every country in the world.\n\nFinding that out changed the direction of my life. I decided to set out on a mission to visit every country, not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront my OCD and prove to myself that it didn't have to dictate the limits of my life.\n\nOver the next few years of college, I saved aggressively while working in nightlife marketing in Miami, putting aside just enough to make the trip possible if I budgeted carefully and kept costs low.\n\nWhen I told my parents about my plan, they laughed and shrugged it off, not quite taking me seriously. Not long after, I called one of my best friends. He laughed too and said just two words: \"Good luck.\"\n\nAfter graduating, I made it my mission. I backpacked mostly alone across conflict zones, remote islands, and places at the center of ancient history. On April 3, 2025, I reached my 195th and final country in North Korea. The journey was verified by NomadMania, the world's largest travel community, which confirmed that I was the youngest person ever to have visited every country.\n\nAfter completing my mission, a few places stood out as truly unforgettable. These are three cities I always suggest others experience — and one I wouldn't rush back to.\n\nOut of the hundreds of cities I've visited in my life, Sydney is my favorite. What stood out most was how relaxed and welcoming people were. The pace reminded me of my hometown in San Diego, with the same laid-back energy but an even greater sense of warmth.\n\nOne morning, while sitting at a café, an older couple at the table next to me struck up a conversation and started sharing their favorite places around the city. They talked about the coastal walks they loved, which neighborhoods were worth spending time in, and the restaurants they kept going back to. Interactions like that happened often enough that the friendliness stopped feeling like a novelty and became part of everyday life.\n\nAs I explored the city, I kept noticing how naturally beautiful it was. More than 100 beaches are within reach, including Bondi, where I watched surfers roll in with the tide. In the city center, I wandered through different neighborhoods and took in the mix of historic architecture and modern design. The sunsets were especially memorable. I watched ferries cut across the water as the skyline came into view, framed by the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge.\n\nSydney is the kind of city I could easily imagine building a life in.\n\nValletta felt like a living crossroads of history from the moment I arrived. Sitting at the center of the Mediterranean, the city reflects centuries of Italian, Arab, British, and North African influence, all packed into a compact, walkable capital.\n\nI'd walk past waterfront cafés and, minutes later, find myself standing on the city's fortified walls, looking out over waters once traveled by Phoenician traders, Ottoman fleets, and British warships.\n\nWhat surprised me most about Valletta was how under-visited it felt compared to much of southern Europe. Even during peak season, it never felt overrun. A short ferry ride away, I spent time on the island of Gozo, where life moved even slower. I visited ancient temples older than the Egyptian pyramids and passed through small villages where fishing and farming still shape daily life.\n\nExperiencing Gozo made Valletta feel even more special: a historic capital with easy access to a quieter, older side of the Mediterranean.\n\nKrabi wasn't even on my radar at first, and it ended up being one of the last places I reached on my journey. A Thai friend I'd met years earlier on the junior tennis circuit told me it was the most beautiful part of the country and insisted I couldn't miss it.\n\nHe was right. Krabi Town is the province's main city, but most travelers use \"Krabi\" to refer to the surrounding beaches and islands — and few places on Earth combine land and sea as dramatically. At Railay Beach, limestone cliffs rise from turquoise water, creating a backdrop unlike anything else I've seen.\n\nI took day trips through Phang Nga Bay and out toward the nearby Phi Phi Islands, weaving past mangrove forests and hidden coves that felt largely untouched. And then there was the food. For a few dollars, I could get a delicious local meal and a fresh dragon fruit smoothie from a roadside stall or beachside café.\n\nKrabi is a reminder that some of the most memorable places aren't always part of the original plan.\n\nIndia was one of the countries I was most excited to visit, and it delivered some amazing experiences. Seeing the Taj Mahal in Agra lived up to every expectation, and witnessing the ancient religious rituals along the Ganges in Varanasi was one of the most powerful cultural moments I've experienced anywhere in the world.\n\nThat said, New Delhi isn't a place I feel a strong pull to return to. The air quality was poor enough that I found myself coughing constantly, making it uncomfortable to spend much time outside. In a city of more than 22 million people, the traffic was relentless, adding to a sense of chaos that, unlike in other busy cities I've loved, never felt energizing. Compared to other parts of India, I also didn't find the city's main sights as compelling.\n\nI'm glad I went, and India as a whole left a lasting impression on me. But if I were planning another trip, New Delhi wouldn't be on my list.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's main space contractor vowed to develop space tourism in the next five years, state media reported on Thursday, as Beijing revs up its commercial spaceflight and deep space exploration ambitions ​amid a technology race with the U.S.\n\nState-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would \"achieve the flight operation of ‌suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism,\" as well as \"build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\nChina and the U.S. are competing ‌as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a \"world-leading space power\" by 2045.\n\nBeijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to ⁠achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites ‌and it is also used for orbital space tourism.\n\nReusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches ‍last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.\n\nHowever, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.\n\nIn late ​December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over ‌the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.\n\nCASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.\n\nThe new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in ⁠detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on ​the inauguration.\n\n\"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog ​development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration,\" Xinhua wrote.\n\nThursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies ‍such as small celestial resource exploration ⁠and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and ⁠Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.\n\nThe U.S. faces intense competition this decade from ‌China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. ‌Apollo mission in 1972.",

That left the community without a true grocery store for years, forcing people to drive nearly a half-hour to pick up basics, or to overpay for them at local specialty stores.\n\nSomething similar happened when the K-Mart closed in Key West. That shutdown, one of the last in the chain, robbed that remote area of its only department store, forcing residents to drive four to five hours before they hit a Walmart or a Target.\n\nResidents in the Pacific Northwest now face similar challenges, according to local reports.\n\nIn the markets it serves, Cascade Farm and Outdoor, which is closing all its stores, will leave a similar hole for consumers.\n\nA rival to Tractor Supply, Cascade Farm serves farmers and rural communities.

    "fullText": "Starmer’s team is wary of spies but such fears are not new – with Theresa May once warned to get dressed under a duvet\n\nWhen prime ministers travel to China, heightened security arrangements are a given – as is the quiet game of cat and mouse that takes place behind the scenes as each country tests out each other’s tradecraft and capabilities.\n\nKeir Starmer’s team has been issued with burner phones and fresh sim cards, and is using temporary email addresses, to prevent devices being loaded with spyware or UK government servers being hacked into.\n\nThe employment of such tactics may sound dramatic but they are par for the course in an age of digital espionage and information security. Burner phones, for example, are routinely used by No 10 on some trips abroad – at G20 the summits in Brazil in 2024 and South Africa in 2025, for example – though not on visits to allied nations or Five Eyes intelligence partners.\n\nFor visits to China these precautions have been standard for at least a decade, such is the expectation that Beijing will eavesdrop and monitor.\n\nWhen she was prime minister, Theresa May was warned ahead of her trip to Beijing in 2018 to get dressed under the duvet to ensure that spy cameras would not film her without any clothes on. It was advice that was passed on generally by officials to all those travelling on the trip eight years ago.\n\nConcerns about peeping tom surveillance are particularly relevant to those in the official entourage or business and press delegations staying in hotels. “There was a well-worn routine in places like Shenzhen that foreigners from the west would be assigned the same rooms so they wouldn’t have to move the equipment,” a former senior British intelligence official said. Those with time on their hands would try to find the concealed bugging devices for fun.\n\nWhen Gordon Brown visited China in 2008, an aide was victim of a honey trap. The male aide met a Chinese woman at a lively hotel disco in Shanghai and left with her. The next day, he reported that his BlackBerry phone was missing. He was reprimanded, though No 10 said there had been no security compromise.\n\nPart of the standard security guidance given to ministers and their aides reflects this incident. “The rest of the advice,” the senior security official said, “was warning middle-aged men that if an attractive young Chinese woman appeared interested in you, she probably wasn’t”.\n\nMichael Gove, writing in the Mail last year, recalled being given similar warnings before being dispatched on a ministerial trip in 2010: “I was also told that if anyone from the opposite sex who approached me was out of my league they had only one thing on their mind – and it wasn’t comparing notes on Confucian philosophy.”\n\nDavid Cameron visited Beijing as prime minister in December 2013. A former aide recalled that China insisted on supplying a personal protection officer “over six-and-a-half-foot tall” to follow the British prime minister and his team as closely as reasonably possible.\n\nThe practice, again, is relatively standard, but it offered an obvious possibility for low level information gathering. “At the end of the trip after pretending he couldn’t speak or understand, at the plane he said goodbye and safe travels in perfect English,” they recalled, presumably as a reminder they were being watched.\n\nGeneral guidance, according to one British official who visited Beijing, “is that everything is bugged” and the only area for sensitive or secret conversations and debriefs is the secure compartment in the British embassy.\n\nSimilar considerations apply when meeting Chinese leaders or officials – at international summits – or when visiting the country’s diplomatic premises in London or elsewhere.\n\nWhen James Cleverly was foreign secretary, a former adviser recalled that during the UN general assembly in New York, he and his team refused to take their mobiles into the Chinese consulate. The handsets were all stored in a lead-lined bag in the hands of officials who did not go inside the diplomatic building.\n\nOne of the consequences of this abundance of caution is that ministers are out of ordinary contact in China, meaning their families cannot easily get in contact, having instead to communicate via a private secretary or other close aide.\n\nIt can also cause other political issues, as happened to Vince Cable in 2014. The Lib Dem, who was then business secretary, was visiting China and did not have his mobile phone with him. Back in the UK, an old ally, Matthew Oakeshott, launched a coup attempt against the then party leader, Nick Clegg – but the plot struggled for momentum and quickly collapsed with Cable uncontactable.\n\n“I wasn’t part of this plot. It all broke in the middle of the night in China and not surprisingly we were not rushing to the phone,” Cable said.",

    "title": "I went on my first cruise — here are 15 things that surprised me about this type of travel",
    "description": "From room size to food quality, my first-ever cruise on board Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas was full of surprises.",
    "fullText": "The ship has 18 decks and 2,867 staterooms, according to Royal Caribbean.\n\nI booked a mid-tier room — a step above windowless interior staterooms, a step below staterooms with a balcony, and two steps below suites.\n\nMy 179-square-foot cabin had a private bathroom, a king-size bed, and an ocean view.\n\nI was surprised by how big the discount was. To me, $1,000 feels like a huge price difference for the same vacation.\n\nI thought the stateroom made great use of a small space with plenty of storage for my clothes and other belongings. There were two closets for hanging space and more drawers than I used.\n\nAfter leaving to start my day each morning, a stateroom attendant cleaned my room. And after I left for dinner each night, they came back to clean up again. Every evening, they brought me fresh towels — sometimes creatively folded — and a flyer featuring the next day's schedule, including the weather, dress code, and any other important information, such as a time change.\n\nThis surprised me because I am used to having my room serviced once daily, if at all, during my hotel stays, and never in Airbnbs.\n\nAn electronic shade over the window could be lowered to reveal grand views. I loved waking up after a night at sea to a front-row view of the place I'd be visiting that day.\n\nWhile windowless rooms are cheaper, I couldn't imagine staying in one. My ocean-view stateroom cost about $300 more than an entry-level room.\n\nI booked a stateroom at the front of deck eight and felt constant motion in my room.\n\nSome nights were rockier than others. On the roughest nights, I heard and felt a similar sensation to thunder beneath me every few minutes. Loud thumps and heavy vibrations in my room sounded like large pieces of furniture falling. The first night this happened, I feared the worst, but over time, I realized that this was a normal aspect of cruising — but one I would likely never get used to.\n\nAfter talking to seasoned cruisers on the ship, several told me that the front of the ship is one of the worst places to be for feeling motion. Higher decks in the middle of the ship feel calmer and more stable, they said.\n\nNext time, I'd choose a room in the middle of the ship.\n\nAll I had to do for safety training was watch a couple of videos — either on my room TV or on the Royal Caribbean app — and then check in at my assembly station, the area I was assigned to in case of an emergency. At the assembly station, an attendant checked the Royal Caribbean app to confirm that I had completed the mandatory training.\n\nI was expecting to attend a large safety training session once I got on the ship, so this alternative was a breeze.\n\nSince there were so many elevators on the ship, I expected them to be a pretty efficient way to get around. But they were often so crowded and slow that I took the stairs instead. By the middle of my trip, unless I was going all the way up to the pool decks, I always opted for the stairs to save time.\n\nThe ship has 16 guest decks; each deck is divided into three sections — forward, middle, and aft.\n\nIt took me a few days to get used to the sections, and I often found myself heading to the right deck but the wrong section of the ship. Luckily, there were maps on every floor, which I used until the morning I left.\n\nIf I woke up on deck five of Wonder of the Seas with no memory of my cruise, I'd think I was in a shopping mall.\n\nAside from the slight movement of the ship, the indoor decks were so big that, as a cruise newbie, it was hard to believe that I was on a gigantic boat in the middle of the ocean. Everywhere I looked, I saw shops, stands, restaurants, large sculptures, and a unique ceiling structure that reminded me of the malls I've visited.\n\nAside from music festivals, I've never heard more live music on a trip than on this cruise. On the communal decks, musicians played for hours while people relaxed and played around them. I was also surprised by the eclectic mix of genres I heard, from rock to jazz to classical.\n\nIn addition to the music hall, where concerts were regularly held, live bands performed on indoor and outdoor communal decks. Some people watched, while others listened while swimming, relaxing, or walking around.\n\nI like to be comfy, so I was dreading formal nights going into this cruise.\n\nI brought one fancy dress with me to wear whenever I needed, but on the first formal night, I realized that the dress code wasn't strictly enforced. People wore a range of outfits, from evening gowns to T-shirts.\n\nFor the rest of the trip, I also relaxed my interpretation of the dress code.\n\nThe excursion I was most thrilled about — a hot-air balloon ride over the Bahamas — was canceled the day of because the winds were too high.\n\nIt was on the last day of my trip, and with only one day in port, it could not be rescheduled. It was the experience I was looking forward to most, so I was disappointed. On a cruise ship, I learned that all plans are subject to change based on things outside the crew's control, like the weather.\n\nSince we traveled such a long way to each port, I wrongfully assumed we'd spend more time in them. The ship usually docked around 8 a.m. and left in the early afternoon.\n\nI thought I'd have time to explore the port for a while after each excursion, but some of my excursions took the entire day, getting me back to the boat just in time for departure. I also hoped to see what these places looked like at night, but we never departed after sundown.\n\nAlthough I got a taste of the Caribbean, I didn't have enough time to get a sense of each place, which made me realize that I would probably prefer to vacation in just one place and have time to truly explore it.",

    "title": "Russian Scientists Test Plasma Engine That Could Cut Mars Travel to About 30 Days",
    "description": "Russia is testing a plasma engine prototype designed to slash Mars travel time to just 60 days. Developed by Rosatom’s Troitsk Institute, the system uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate particles to 100 km/s, promising a flight-ready model for deep-space missions by 2030.",
    "fullText": "Russia is quietly testing a new plasma propulsion system that, if it performs as claimed, could dramatically change how long it takes to travel to Mars. Early results suggest a leap in speed and efficiency that has drawn attention precisely because it is not coming from NASA or private U.S. companies such as SpaceX.\n\nThe engine is being developed by the Troitsk Institute, part of Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom. According to researchers involved in the program, the system could reduce interplanetary travel time from several months to roughly one to two months. Ground-based testing is currently underway, and the developers say the technology could be ready for space deployment by around 2030.\n\nUnlike conventional chemical rockets, the new system relies on electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged hydrogen particles. This places it firmly in the category of electric or plasma propulsion, a field that has gained increasing global attention as space agencies look for more efficient ways to travel deeper into the solar system.\n\nChemical rockets deliver very high thrust for a short time, which is ideal for launching from Earth. However, they are inefficient for long-distance travel once a spacecraft is in orbit. Plasma engines, by contrast, generate much lower thrust but can operate continuously for long periods, gradually building up extremely high speeds while using far less propellant.\n\nIf the Russian system achieves its projected performance, it could have a major impact on how future missions to Mars and beyond are planned, both for scientific exploration and for potential military or logistical applications.\n\nThe prototype engine is currently being tested inside a 14-meter-long vacuum chamber designed to simulate space conditions. According to technical details reported by the Russian newspaper Izvestia, the engine operates at a power level of 300 kilowatts in a pulsed periodic mode and has already demonstrated a working lifespan of 2,400 hours. That duration would be sufficient for a full Mars mission, including acceleration and deceleration phases.\n\nResearchers say the engine accelerates charged hydrogen particles, including protons and electrons, to speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second. By comparison, traditional chemical rockets typically achieve exhaust velocities of around 4.5 kilometers per second. This massive difference in exhaust velocity is the key to the engine’s potential efficiency and speed.\n\nThe plasma engine is not intended to launch directly from Earth’s surface. A conventional chemical rocket would first carry the spacecraft into low Earth orbit. Once in space, the plasma engine would be activated to provide continuous thrust for the journey through deep space.\n\nOfficials involved in the project also note that the system could function as a space tug, moving cargo, modules, or satellites between different planetary orbits. This concept aligns with broader international interest in reusable orbital transport systems.\n\nThe engine uses hydrogen as propellant and relies on an onboard nuclear reactor to provide a constant energy supply. According to project researcher Yegor Biryulin, hydrogen’s low atomic mass allows for faster acceleration while reducing fuel consumption. Its abundance in space could eventually allow for in situ refueling, at least in theory.\n\nThe propulsion system uses two high-voltage electrodes to create directed plasma flow. Charged particles pass between them, forming a magnetic field that expels plasma and generates thrust. This design avoids the need to heat plasma to extreme temperatures, which reduces component wear and improves overall efficiency.\n\nRosatom documentation lists the projected thrust at 6 newtons, which is high for a plasma propulsion prototype. Even so, the thrust remains far lower than chemical rockets, meaning spacecraft would be designed for slow but continuous acceleration rather than short bursts of power.\n\nPlasma propulsion is already used in orbit on many satellites, including systems on OneWeb spacecraft and on NASA’s Psyche mission launched in 2023. Most existing plasma engines operate at exhaust velocities between 30 and 50 kilometers per second. The Russian claims of 100 kilometers per second would represent a significant step forward.\n\nHowever, the technology remains unproven in space. Peer-reviewed scientific data have not yet been published, and the nuclear reactor design has not been disclosed. Nuclear-powered spacecraft raise complex safety, regulatory, and international approval issues, especially during launch.\n\nWhile the concept is promising, the engine is still years away from practical use. Its projected readiness by 2030 will depend on continued testing, funding, and successful resolution of engineering and regulatory challenges.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Autorepublika.com and has been republished with permission by Guessing Headlights.

    "description": "I spent six months traveling Europe with two backpacks, and loved having things like a portable white-noise machine and flat travel pouches with me.",
    "fullText": "Packing for a six-month trip around Europe wasn't easy. I deliberated for a good two months about what to take with me and what to leave behind. Since I only had two backpacks, I had to be picky about what I brought.\n\nNow that I'm back home, I'm able to reflect on the items I took with me. Here are the three things that now have a permanent spot in my luggage and the two that won't make the cut next time.\n\nNoisy neighbors and loud city streets are part of the traveling experience. Although some people like to counteract these things with earplugs, I've always found them uncomfortable as a side sleeper.\n\nSo, I brought a mini white-noise machine to drown out any music, traffic, or chatter. The little cylinder was quite loud for its size, and did a great job of masking any background noise.\n\nI definitely had more restful sleep because of it, and it's now an essential for all my future trips.\n\nI find the traditional hard-plastic travel containers for liquids to be quite clunky. So, for this trip, I bought a pack of flat travel pouches in different sizes.\n\nI used the bigger bags for shampoo and body wash and the smaller ones for face wash and conditioner. I'd then refill them from larger bottles purchased during my longer stays.\n\nAlthough they took a little more patience to fill, these pouches stacked up much more neatly than the bulky travel bottles I used to use.\n\nI typically won't wear a pair of earrings or a bracelet if I can't physically see it. This presents a problem for many bag-like travel containers where the jewelry isn't laid out neatly.\n\nWhen I researched other travel-jewelry options, I found that many were large and bulky, which wouldn't bode well for my limited space.\n\nHowever, I saw a hack online about using a foldable pill box to store jewelry. I ordered one immediately and found it to be the perfect solution.\n\nWhile packing for my trip, my mind went to everything I'd have to charge: my laptop, smartwatch, phone, and white-noise machine.\n\nSo, I purchased a travel power strip/adapter with three ports and a long cord. I figured I'd be set for all my charging needs.\n\nIn practice, however, this big rectangle ended up being a nuisance. It was incredibly bulky, and if I plugged two or more things into it, a spark would shoot off from the plug.\n\nI ended up throwing it out and replacing it with a high-quality cube adapter. This much-lighter converter had a three-prong port and several USB slots, which suited my needs just fine.\n\nIf anything, I'd bring two cube adapters next time to have one in the bedroom and one in the living room.\n\nThis story was originally published on February 4, 2025 and most recently updated on January 28, 2026.",

The day ended with 6,250 canceled flights, per FlightAware.\n\nThat compares to Sunday's 11,618 canceled flights.\n\nSunday marked the worst day for air travel since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Monday.\n\nHe added that the government expects flight schedules to return to normal on Wednesday.\n\n\"This storm is unique,\" he said. \"You get the ice, and you get the snow, and on top of that, we have now a cold weather snap that comes after it.\"\n\nAirport and airline workers have also struggled to get to work due to the state of the roadways.\n\nOn Monday evening, Heather Garboden, American Airlines' chief customer officer, wrote to customers saying the storm \"continues to present travel challenges across the country.\"\n\nAmerican has been the most-affected airline each day, including over 1,900 cancellations on Sunday, per FlightAware.\n\nGarboden added that five of the airline's nine hubs were \"significantly impacted,\" including its largest at DFW, which saw \"record-setting\" weather conditions.\n\nAnd as the storm affected cities that don't generally experience such cold, many areas lacked the infrastructure to handle the heavy snow and ice.\n\nThis, in turn, has \"led to staffing issues as team members, plus vendor and federal partners, struggle to make their way on the roads,\" she said.\n\nAirlines have waived change fees so that passengers have more flexibility to avoid disruption due to the storm.\n\nHowever, while American's waiver covers travel through Thursday, United Airlines' is through Wednesday, and Delta Air Lines' only continues through Tuesday.",

    "description": "As a Disney travel planner who's visited the theme parks many times, here are the mistakes I always see people make that cost them time and money.",
    "fullText": "I've been to the Disney parks over 50 times, so I've truly done it all.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels who specializes in Disney destinations, so a big part of my job is making recommendations about how to plan an epic trip. I also give my clients a lot of advice on what not to do.\n\nHere are some of the biggest mistakes people make at Disney World.\n\nIf you have any flexibility, avoid scheduling your Disney vacation during major school breaks in the US.\n\nHoliday weekends, spring break, and winter holidays will almost always bring the biggest crowds to the theme parks.\n\nDisney doesn't really have many low seasons anymore, but avoiding these highly popular times will give you more freedom to explore the parks with fewer crowds and lower ticket prices.\n\nThe theme parks are a big part of the Disney experience, and I love spending time at them. However, there's so much more to do in the area.\n\nFor one, I recommend taking a day off to lounge by your hotel's pool, resort hop, shop at Disney Springs, or even play a round of mini-golf.\n\nWhen we go to the parks, my family also usually takes a midday break to rest and relax. It is supposed to be a vacation, after all.\n\nSpeaking of just how much there is to do at Disney beyond the parks, you must check out its shopping, dining, and entertainment complex Disney Springs. It's free to explore.\n\nPick up some souvenirs at the massive World of Disney shop, check out the hundreds of sets and amazing displays at the Lego store, or just enjoy some snacks while you bask in the Florida sun.\n\nIf you get really hungry, head over to grab a delicious lunch at one of my favorite eateries, like Homecomin' or Frontera Cocina.\n\nMy No. 1 tip for visiting theme parks of any kind is to arrive early.\n\nYou'll get a huge jump on your day if you get to the parks as soon as they open, or just before. Crowd levels tend to be much lower at this time, meaning you can experience many attractions early in the day.\n\nAs with most theme parks, the longer you stay, the lower your daily ticket and accommodation costs are likely to be with bundles.\n\nIf you're already paying to travel to Disney, do yourself a favor and stay a few extra days.\n\nAfter all, the biggest complaint I get from clients is that they didn't stay long enough. In my opinion, a week is the ideal amount of time to truly experience Disney World.\n\nSome organization and prep are required for the ideal Disney World trip, but you shouldn't overplan.\n\nYou don't need to schedule every moment of your day or have every detail organized. Make a general outline of your daily agenda — with dining reservations and a list of must-do rides and attractions — but leave room for spontaneous fun.\n\nIf you're on too tight a schedule, you'll miss all the good stuff, like unique character interactions.\n\nThe park-hopping ticket option allows you to visit more than one park per day for less than it'd cost to buy each ticket separately.\n\nHowever, unless you're staying for only a very short time and want to see as much as possible, there are few reasons to park hop with small kids.\n\nIt can just become an unnecessary added expense that you probably won't make the best use of if you're pausing for afternoon naps or breaks.\n\nHowever, groups with older children or only adults may enjoy and fully take advantage of the flexibility that park hopping offers.\n\nIf you want to dine at table-service restaurants, you should make reservations in advance. However, eating three sit-down meals a day at Disney World will take up way too much of your time.\n\nMany table-service experiences can take 90 minutes to two hours from start to finish, so you wouldn't be left with much time to experience the rest of the parks.\n\nOne table-service reservation a day is usually a perfect respite from the hustle and bustle without overcrowding your schedule.\n\nRider swap, or rider switch, is a great service when traveling with young children who aren't tall enough for or don't want to ride certain attractions.\n\nIt allows one parent or guardian to wait with the child while the rest of the party rides. Once the first group returns, the waiting adult can go on the attraction without having to get in the back of the line.\n\nHowever, not enough people know about it, and they can end up wasting time in lines.\n\nJust get in the habit of asking the park employee at the front of the ride whether it's available for a particular attraction.\n\nStaying off the property can save you money, and I've done so many times on Disney trips. However, if you've never stayed at a Disney resort, you're missing out.\n\nThese stays can come with practical benefits, including complimentary transportation to and from the parks. The biggest perk, though, is the access to extra Disney magic.\n\nThese resorts typically have incredibly immersive themes and special touches that should be experienced at least once. Though there are some extravagant Disney resorts, there are also value ones that tend to be more budget-friendly.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 9, 2021, and most recently updated on January 27, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Before Melania Trump became a fashion model and first lady of the United States, she was Melanija Knavs, the Slovenian daughter of a car salesman and a textile factory worker.\n\nAs the first naturalized US citizen to serve as first lady and the second foreign-born first lady in US history, Trump's hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has become a tourist destination attracting visitors to see where she spent her early years.\n\nHere are some Sevnica landmarks from Trump's childhood.\n\nTrump was born in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, on April 26, 1970.\n\nShe spent her childhood in Sevnica, a small town 30 miles away.\n\nIt has a population of 17,672, according to data collected by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia in 2023.\n\nSlovenia became independent in 1991.\n\nSevnica produces over 150 kinds of salami, a feat celebrated at its annual Salamiada festival.\n\nSevnica's tourism doubled in the year before Donald Trump's first term as interest in Melania Trump grew, a tour guide told Reuters in January 2017.\n\nThe small town capitalized on its claim to fame as the former FLOTUS' hometown, offering tours, foods, and souvenirs named after her.\n\nFor 2017 as a whole, the number of foreigners visiting Slovenia jumped 17% when compared to the previous year, with a total of 3.4 million visitors, Reuters reported in January 2018.\n\nThe number of visitors has risen in the years since, with just under 7 million visitors in 2025, The Slovenian Times reported.\n\nHer father, Viktor Knavs, worked as a car salesman. Her mother, Amalija, worked at a local textile factory.\n\nTrump has one sister, Ines Knauss, and a half-brother, Denis Cigelnjak.\n\nMirjana Jelancic, a friend of Trump's who went on to become principal of the school, told ABC News in 2016 that the young Trump was \"an angel\" and \"a very good student.\"\n\nWhen Trump and her sister, Ines, were in high school, the Knavs family moved to Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital. There, Trump was scouted by photographer Stane Jerko and signed with a modeling agency when she was 18.\n\nTrump made the donation after her wedding in 2005, The New York Times reported.\n\nTrump is the second first lady born outside the US. The first was John Quincy Adams' wife, Louisa Catherine Adams, who was born in London.\n\nThe Rotary Klub Sevnica held events in honor of Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017 and 2025. Proceeds from the 2025 event went toward a youth scholarship fund, the Slovenian outlet Dolenjski List reported.\n\nA plaque at the site says the new bronze statue is \"dedicated to the eternal memory of a monument to Trump which stood in this location from 2019-2020.\"\n\nAt a 2023 naturalization ceremony held at the National Archives in Washington, DC, Trump said that becoming a US citizen is a \"life-altering experience that takes time, determination, and sometimes even tremendous strength.\" She also recalled navigating a \"labyrinth\" of paperwork to obtain a worker visa during her modeling career.\n\n\"I recall feeling a tremendous sense of pride and belonging after I recited the US oath of allegiance, as the pathway to citizenship is arduous,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Thousands of flights were canceled this weekend as Winter Storm Fern brought heavy snow and ice to much of the country.\n\n19,450 flights within, into, or out of US airports were canceled between Saturday and 7 a.m. ET on Monday, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThe majority of those, more than 11,000, occurred on Sunday. That made it the worst day for flight cancellations since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDisruption continued on Monday, with 3,700 flights canceled as of 7 a.m. ET, per FlightAware. At that time, Boston Logan Airport appeared to be the worst affected, with 60% of its departing flights canceled. However, the situation overall was improving.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth International Airport was the worst affected this weekend, with around three-quarters of its scheduled flights canceled. By Monday morning, 3,200 flights in and out of the airport had been canceled.\n\nFour inches of snow fell in 48 hours at the airport, which is American Airlines' main hub, per the National Weather Service.\n\nThe second-most cancellations were seen at Charlotte Douglas, another American Airlines hub, numbering almost 2,000 between Saturday and Monday.\n\nDFW had nearly twice as many cancellations as Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International, Delta Air Lines' primary hub, which ranked third.\n\nThe New York City area's three airports — JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark — each saw about 1,500 cancellations. Close to 10 inches of snowfall was recorded at each location, the local CBS News outlet reported.\n\nUsing FlightAware's data, Business Insider created this map that shows the number of cancellations at the 20 worst-affected airports.\n\nAmerican Airlines was the worst-affected carrier on Sunday with nearly 1,900 cancellations, representing 58% of its schedule, per FlightAware's data.\n\nThe airline said it added 3,200 extra seats on flights in and out of Dallas-Fort Worth, and another 3,000 on flights from Charlotte to Chicago O'Hare.\n\nOn Thursday, it said it was \"repositioning aircraft, aligning crew resources, and reinforcing staffing at key airports\" to help minimize disruption.\n\nAirlines waived change fees for passengers flying to or from cities affected by the weather.\n\nDelta Air Lines, which canceled nearly 1,500 flights, per FlightAware, said it was operating a reduced schedule as freezing rain and ice hit Atlanta.\n\nIt also said it was bringing in additional reserve pilots and flight attendants, plus \"relocating experts from cold weather hubs\" to several airports in the South, to support its de-icing and baggage teams.",

    "description": "As a travel planner, there are a lot of mistakes I tell my clients to avoid when booking all-inclusive vacations, especially when choosing rooms.",
    "fullText": "As a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels, one of my areas of expertise is booking all-inclusive vacations.\n\nThere are a lot of resorts out there with different tiers and offerings, so it's easy to get tripped up if you're new to booking them. And if you're spending a few thousand dollars for a weeklong getaway for two, you want to ensure you're getting your money's worth.\n\nHere are the biggest mistakes people make while booking all-inclusive vacations — and how to avoid them.\n\nWhen choosing an all-inclusive resort, it's important to consider your dream vacation before you even start looking online. Determining a trip bucket list will greatly help to narrow down your search.\n\nI encourage clients to think about things like their budget, nonnegotiable amenities, ideal locations, flight accessibility, desired room features, and resort size.\n\nMany popular all-inclusive resorts are in tropical locations, but there are also some great options in places like Canada, Europe, and Japan.\n\nClub Med offers all-inclusive resorts worldwide. One of its newer offerings is Club Med Québec Charlevoix, which offers an all-inclusive ski experience in the winter and an adventure experience in the summer.\n\nIn all-inclusive travel, you truly get what you pay for.\n\nValue properties often struggle to provide quality food options, comfortable accommodations, and adequate service. I recommend focusing searches on properties with a rating of at least 4.5.\n\nAlthough entry-level rooms are the least expensive, booking them can also come at a price.\n\nThe cheapest rooms can have views of the parking lot or construction sites. Or they're located on the ground floor, which can get musty in humid, tropical climates.\n\nYou can often upgrade to a better room for a minimal extra cost, and I think it's more than worth it. If you're really on a strict budget, shorten your trip by a day or two to allow for a higher-quality experience.\n\nThere are many great kid-friendly, all-inclusive resorts, but taking an adults-only trip is so much fun.\n\nGrab your friends, family, or significant others to rewind for a few days without the kids.\n\nOn one kid-free trip to Le Blanc Spa Resort in Cancún, my husband and I appreciated the time we spent reconnecting, unwinding, and unplugging from work and family responsibilities.\n\nBooking a trip to the Caribbean or Mexico in summer and fall (hurricane season) carries some risk, but prices are usually significantly lower than at other times of the year.\n\nThe weather can be gorgeous, and there's no guarantee your trip will be affected by bad weather. For example, my husband and I honeymooned in the Caribbean in the fall, and the weather was some of the best I have ever had on a vacation.\n\nIf you're concerned, definitely keep an eye on the weather and add travel insurance to your booking.\n\nOne of the best parts of an all-inclusive vacation is enjoying the all-you-can-eat cuisine and top-shelf drink selections.\n\nSpending up to a week at a luxury resort with mediocre food can be an unenjoyable experience. When reading reviews, pay close attention to comments about food quality.\n\nI love the food and drinks at Palace, Sandals, and Beaches resorts and often recommend them to my clients.\n\nOne of the biggest disappointments I hear from clients is that the view from their room didn't live up to their expectations.\n\nSome resorts are more liberal with their categorization of partial-ocean-view and ocean-view rooms — maybe you can see a sliver of blue through the trees if you crane your neck.\n\nIf you want to see the beautiful blue of the sea from your balcony, you generally need to book an oceanfront room.\n\nYour friend might have impeccable taste, but that doesn't mean their favorite resort meets your style or needs.\n\nOne of my clients might love a resort, but another may not enjoy the experience at all. For example, your friend may love lounging by the pool, but you prefer beachfront activities. Maybe they'd rather have mindblowing cocktails, while your priority is being served first-class dinners with bites from around the globe.\n\nRemember, finding the resort that's right for you is a very personal process.\n\nSure, I'm a little biased, but hear me out: Choosing the right destinations and resorts for your all-inclusive vacation can be daunting.\n\nIn Mexico alone, there are hundreds of lodgings to choose from.\n\nMost travel planners offer complimentary services (we get commissions from hotels and other bookings), which can greatly reduce the headache of planning your trip.\n\nI always look for the best pricing and make sure to support my clients before, during, and after their vacations so they can relax.\n\nAs an agent, I also visit resorts to vet them for my clients. Reading online reviews can be helpful, but they can also be confusing, so I like being able to make personal recommendations.\n\nThis story was originally published on May 4, 2024, and most recently updated on January 26, 2026.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jim Rowley, CEO of Crunch Fitness and United States Marine Corps. veteran. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat's interesting about my day is that it's never really routine.\n\nIt's highly dependent on where I'm working from, so if I'm in my main office in Manhattan, the day is quite different than if I'm at home in Lake Tahoe. It's fulfilling to not have the same routine over and over again.\n\nI've been doing this for 34 years, so monotony is a killer for me.\n\nWhere my job gets fun is if I'm on the road, I'm in gyms. My team and get to go to our more than 500 gyms, and I love meeting the members.\n\nLately, we've been spending a lot of time on understanding where AI is going to integrate perfectly with the member experience and the team member experience. We're testing some ideas out in the field.\n\nWhen I'm feeling like I'm in a rut from a strategy standpoint, creatively, I go to the gyms. I think all the answers are in the gyms. So I talk to my teams about what's working, what's not.\n\nPeople think I'm kind of a hard guy, but I think I'm pretty relaxed, especially on the road. There are just a few non-negotiables I have in my regular cadence to stay on track.\n\nTypically, I get up at 5:45 a.m. to 6:30 a.m., depending on the day. My morning is like an old grandpa's. I watch the business news, see how the markets are trending. I usually have my one cup of coffee for the day.\n\nRight now, my morning is special — I had a granddaughter born last June, so she's up really early, my daughter's up really early, so I usually get to chat with them via text or FaceTime before everything has started. Once that's done, I start my emails. The majority of my day is set up around Zoom rodeos, performance updates, executive leadership team meetings, or huddles.\n\nThis may be funny, but when I'm on the road, I need to have a desk or a sitting area so I have space to think and stretch my legs. I can't just be checking emails from bed.\n\nI also need to get a protein shake in the morning, especially when I'm on the road. I'm not going to sit down and have a hotel breakfast or stop anywhere.\n\nI believe fitness is medicine. I'm 58 now, and I'm chasing being happy, healthy, and mobile in my eighties and nineties, so it's really about staying active, keeping moving.\n\nWhen I was in the Marine Corps., I worked out in the morning. Prior to 2020, I worked out at the end of my day.\n\nI'm finding that the midday routine is best for me now, to block out some time.\n\nAt lunchtime, around 1 p.m., I break for exercise. So about 12:45, I wind down my meetings, and I'm either headed to Pilates or the gym.\n\nI can walk to our gym, which is great. It's about a 20-minute walk there and back, so you get 40 minutes of cardio with your weightlifting.\n\nI don't lift for ego anymore. I rarely bench. I used to bench press all the time, and I was very proud of what I could bench press. Now, I don't bench press at all because it's so hard on my shoulders. I do a lot more dumbbell workouts now, a lot more machine lifting.\n\nHaving lifted weights since I was 14, I felt like Pilates was an opportunity for me to try to lengthen, strengthen, and activate some of the smaller muscles.\n\nIt changed my life, to be honest with you. I became much more limber, a lot less tight. At first, I was the only man in the Pilates class, but I've been telling my neighbors and building a little army of Pilates guys.\n\nI've done both yoga and Pilates, and prefer Pilates because there is a little bit of strength with mobility and balance.\n\nAfter the gym, I'll have lunch, and then I'm back at the office for more calls, meetings, and so forth. It's problem-solving, it's answering questions, and then I wrap up my day.\n\nI like to get out of here by 5:30 p.m. to get a walk in, especially this time of year, because it's cold and it's just refreshing.\n\nWe eat dinner around 6:30 or 7 p.m.\n\nMy wife and I aren't big on sitcom television, but we do like series. She likes anything out of England, the BBC. I'm more into military history, US history, or westerns. We settled in the middle with dramatic crime whodunnit type of series.\n\nI do have a passion for \"Survivor\" and \"The Amazing Race.\" People laugh at me, but I just love competition.\n\nThen I read a little bit, and I'm in bed usually by 11.",

    "description": "As a frequent traveler, noise-canceling headphones, a notebook, electrolyte packets, and a tripod are some of the things I never travel without.",
    "fullText": "I've been to all 50 states and have explored everywhere from tiny towns in New England to the mountains of Alaska. Along the way, I've learned that the right travel essentials can make all the difference.\n\nAfter hundreds of flights and road trips, I've boiled my packing list down to 11 things I never leave home without. Whether it's a quick weekend getaway or a cross-country adventure, these are the items I always bring with me.\n\nAs a very frequent traveler, I do everything I can to turn airport chaos into a calmer experience, whether I'm on a packed plane or waiting in a noisy lounge or terminal.\n\nSo, I use noise-cancelling headphones to sleep, listen to music, or just tune everything else out. They've saved more trips than I can count, and I never leave home without them.\n\nNo matter where I'm going, I always bring a small first-aid kit with me.\n\nScrapes, blisters, or minor aches happen on the road, and having basics like Band-Aids and over-the-counter medications means I'm ready for anything.\n\nBetween long hikes, flights, and summer heat, it's easy to get dehydrated while traveling. That's why I always bring electrolytes with me.\n\nA quick powder package or tablet keeps me energized and feeling my best without weighing down my bag. I rarely leave home without them, as they're a small addition that makes a big difference.\n\nThis should go without saying, but hydration is a non-negotiable. That's why I always bring a refillable water bottle when traveling.\n\nI always fill mine up immediately upon entering the airport terminal (after going through security), and it makes it much easier for me to stay hydrated. Plus, it's much more cost-effective than buying airport water.\n\nI always bring cash and multiple credit cards with me when I'm on the road.\n\nCash always comes in handy for tips and hole-in-the-wall vendors that don't accept cards. However, I also pay attention to which credit cards have the best travel benefits and use them to my advantage.\n\nFor example, my American Express Platinum Card gets me into lots of airport lounges and provides a host of other benefits, including rental car theft and damage insurance.\n\nPlus, my United Airlines MileagePlus credit card helps me save on in-flight purchases.\n\nAs a woman traveling solo, I'm always thinking about my safety, so I carry a whistle with me and keep it within arm's reach.\n\nThankfully, I've never needed to use it, but knowing I can quickly draw attention to myself in any situation gives me peace of mind.\n\nAs a solo traveler, I depend on a tripod for photos. I simply place my phone on it and snap photos on a delay.\n\nThis way, I don't have to reply on other travelers — or selfies — to capture the moment.\n\nI spend a lot of time outside when I travel, so sun protection — like sunglasses and a hat — are key.\n\nIt feels obvious, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen people around me scrambling to buy these essentials because they didn't think to bring them.\n\nI love to journal on the road, so I always bring a notebook with me. I often spend nights doodling memories of the day to look back at later.\n\nIt may sound fancy, but I never travel without my large black cashmere scarf. It doubles as a blanket on flights, works well as a shawl over outfits, and adds another layer anytime I need one.\n\nIt's such a versatile item and keeps me at the perfect temperature at all times.\n\nAs a female solo traveler, I always travel with an Addalock — a small, portable device that lets me secure doors from the inside for additional peace of mind.\n\nEven if the main lock feels safe, having this on hand is a tiny addition that makes me feel more secure.",

    "description": "As a seasoned travel planner, I have suggestions for the best European destinations to visit, from Italy's Cinque Terre to France's Strasbourg.",
    "fullText": "As a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels, I've explored Europe extensively to find the best recommendations for my clients.\n\nThough popular cities such as Paris, London, Rome, and Amsterdam have massive appeal, the continent's vast landscape offers gems around every corner.\n\nHere are five European destinations I think everyone should visit at least once.\n\nSalzburg is a stunning destination — especially if you're a \"Sound of Music\" fan.\n\nThere are plenty of prearranged tours to iconic filming locations where you can dance around the Pegasus fountain like Maria and the children, visit the \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" gazebo, and tour the stunning Basilika St. Michael, where Maria was married to Captain Von Trapp.\n\nIn the summer and fall, there are even \"Sound of Music\" bike tours available.\n\nAnd yes, there are plenty of other activities in the city, even if you're not into musicals. Young children may like the Salzburg Zoo, and music lovers can explore Mozart's birthplace and residence.\n\nSitting atop a hill, Hohensalzburg Fortress is one of the largest castles in the area and boasts great views of the city. To get another stunning view, take the Untersberg cable car.\n\nJust a few hours from London by train, Liverpool is a must-visit spot for Beatles fans.\n\nAll four band members grew up in the port city. There are many different types of excursions, from short bus rides to full-day private tours that will immerse you in the sights and sounds of the band's legacy.\n\nIn Liverpool, football (or American soccer) is a way of life, and there are two main clubs here: Liverpool and Everton. Fans of the game can take an LFC stadium tour for a behind-the-scenes look.\n\nThe city also houses a slew of theaters, art galleries, and museums — and it's becoming a hot destination for shopping and unique culinary experiences.\n\nCinque Terre is one of my favorite cities — or, more accurately, my favorite collection of five villages.\n\nNestled along the Italian Riviera, Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore are accessible only by train, ferry, or foot.\n\nEach has a distinct style, and hikers flock to this region to enjoy the beautiful scenery.\n\nVernazza, my favorite village, is the gem of this region. I love wandering the cobbled streets to shop, snack, and explore. You can also visit the Castello Doria or the church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochia.\n\nIn the summer months, tourists sunbathe on the beaches of Monterosso or take a dip in the sea. For a history lesson, visit the remains of Castello Fieschi or the Church of St John the Baptist and the Capuchin Monastery.\n\nIn Manarola, take some time to watch locals cliff-jump into the marina. I also suggest taking a wine tour through the town to sample some local specialties. Be sure to try Sciacchetrà, a sweet but strong dessert wine produced in Cinque Terre.\n\nRiomaggiore is also home to a castle and churches dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries. The center of the town is great for wandering, shopping, and eating.\n\nCorniglia is probably the quietest of the five villages. There, climb the Lardarina staircase for beautiful views of the coastline or take a boat tour to fully enjoy the area's beauty.\n\nJust about two hours east of Paris by high-speed train, Strasbourg is a beautiful city along the border of France and Germany.\n\nEvery trip should include a visit to the Gothic Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Strasbourg. Try to plan your day around arriving there at 12:30 p.m. to see the wooden figures dance around the clock.\n\nAfter your cathedral visit, stroll through Petite France, explore cheese shops, and take a break to sip a glass of wine at one of the canal's many cafés.\n\nAt the end of the year, Strasbourg is also home to one of the oldest Christmas markets, dating back to the late 1500s. The Christkindelsmärik is truly magical, with more than 300 vendors selling their holiday best.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 3, 2024, and most recently updated on January 23, 2026.",

    "description": "My friend wanted to plan a Europe trip, but then I got laid off. We went to Montreal instead, and the more affordable vacation was just what I needed.",
    "fullText": "I'm never one to say no to travel, whether it's for work, to visit a friend, or just because.\n\nIn the first half of last year alone, I flew from New York to Palm Springs with friends, planned a London trip around a play I wanted to see, and saw Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour in Los Angeles.\n\nOne of my friends was trying to sell me on one more big vacation — Scotland, maybe, or Paris — that we could take together before 2025 was over.\n\nIt wouldn't have taken much convincing, but then I got laid off right at the end of May. Suddenly, traveling anywhere felt out of reach.\n\nHowever, as the dust settled and summer came and went, the thought kept creeping back into my mind: Transatlantic travel would definitely have to wait until I had steady work again, but maybe it wouldn't be impossible to take one more small trip while I still had severance?\n\nTurns out, it was possible. We went to Montreal for a long weekend in late October, and it turned out to be the perfect trip.\n\nI'd never been to Montreal before, but it was the perfect destination for several reasons.\n\nLogistically, it was a quick, 90-minute flight from New York, making it an easy choice for a weekend trip. Less time in the air meant we could make the most of just a handful of days on the ground.\n\nI was also able to buy my airfare with credit-card points, which helped keep my out-of-pocket costs low.\n\nPracticalities aside, I knew that Montreal, with its cobblestone streets in the Old Port, cozy cafés, and official language (French), would feel like a true \"trip\" — a chance to hit pause on the stress of the last few months and immerse myself in a new place.\n\nWe kept the itinerary for this girls' weekend loose. Apart from making a few dinner reservations, we really just took our time exploring the city.\n\nAs someone who tends to plan jam-packed vacations, this was definitely a departure for me, but I was surprised to find I didn't really care.\n\nIt certainly didn't feel like I was missing anything as we took our time yapping, poking through vintage stores, and taste-testing Montreal-style bagels.\n\nSure, we made time to hike up Mount Royal and checked out the Old Port, but this trip wound up being less about sightseeing and more about just having a good time together. Getting to close my laptop and not think (too much) about work was the biggest gift of all.\n\nInstead, I got to channel my energy into a few days of uninterrupted time focusing on things that brought me joy: spending quality time with a friend I'd never traveled with before, taking in a new-to-me city, people-watching on public transportation, and successfully ordering my daily oat latte in French.\n\nThe past few months had been unsteady and stressful, and I knew those same uncertainties would be waiting for me when the plane touched down. Still, our trip recharged my batteries in a way I didn't know I needed until we got home.\n\nTaking any sort of trip is a privilege, especially when your life is in flux. Those three days, though, wound up being the perfect trip for this moment in my life.\n\nBest of all, there was enough I didn't do or see in Montreal that I'm already excited to visit again, if given the chance.\n\nI know I'll take another European vacation at some point, once things feel a little more settled. In the meantime, while I wait for the next chance to grab my passport and get on a plane, I'll just sit here with my \"Bon Matin\" mug and be glad I took the trip.",

    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

    "fullText": "President Trump is set to scale back international travel to focus on upcoming midterm elections after an Air Force One malfunction curtailed his sleep as he jetted into Davos.\n\nThe decision was relayed to reporters aboard the aircraft heading to Zurich on Wednesday, and news of it came after an electrical issue on board forced the plane to circle back to Washington, D.C. This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "fullText": "As horrific details of the Iranian government’s suppression of protesters emerge — with internal estimates counting more than 10,000 dead — the country’s young, wealthy elite are inciting further rage by continuing to flaunt their lavish lives online as they have for years, as if the nation weren’t on the brink of collapse outside of their privileged bubble.\n\nAmid an enforced internet blackout that allows an oppressive regime to commit “genocide under the cover of digital darkness,” according to one outraged expert, reporters from the Telegraph are said to have observed “rich Iranians” partying at a nightclub in a popular holiday hot spot on the border with Turkey.\n\n“Their lifestyle has enraged the citizens of Iran, specifically Gen Z in their age group, mainly because they see how these rich kids live — with no accountability for anything that they do,” Ella Rosenberg, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Centre for Foreign Affairs, told the Times of London.\n\nMostly the children of Iran’s ruling class, they’ve famously led hedonistic lifestyles for decades, but their jaw-dropping wealth had become more visible in recent years, due to the government’s temporarily loosened grip on the internet and social media, before the current unrest began.\n\n“They’re the equivalent of the Iranian ‘Gossip Girl’: luxury cars, living in opulent high-rises in north Tehran,” Rosenberg said.\n\nThe wealth of Iran’s young elite first came to global attention more than a decade ago, with the Instagram account @richkidsoftehran.\n\n“It depicts seemingly affluent teens flaunting Rolex watches, Porsches and Maseratis, sprawling estates and pricey attire,” The Post reported in 2014.\n\nThe Instagram account has remained active and now boasts 477,000 followers.\n\nGlamorous snaps ceased being shared on the account in 2024 — since Jan. 9, six new posts relating to current events have appeared, referring to the government as a “regime” — but other well-connected and cashed-up Iranians have become influencers in their own right.\n\nAnashid Hoseini, who is married to the son of Iran’s ambassador to Denmark, has more than 1.7 million followers, thanks to envy-inducing photos that show her dripping with jewels and toting designer handbags.\n\nHoseini is reported to live in Niavaran, an affluent neighborhood in northern Tehran, but she has not posted to her account in almost a month.\n\nIt’s unclear whether she remains in Iran amid the unrest, but many have fled the country in recent weeks seeking shelter in Van, a Turkish province about 60 miles from Iran’s border.\n\nSaid to be a popular holiday spot with affluent Iranians, the Telegraph reported seeing well-heeled types gathering in a venue that can easily cost more than $100 for entry and drinks, according to the outlet.\n\n“These people benefit from the regime. They left Iran for now, because they were worried about staying there. Here, they can feel safe,” one Iranian at the club told the paper.\n\nOther young and well-connected Iranians left their home country long ago, but have still incited anger among those less affluent citizens left behind.\n\nSasha Sobhani, the son of a former Iranian ambassador to Venezuela, became a social media star showing off his expat life in Spain, where he moved in 2019.\n\nSnaps show Sobhani surrounded by scantily clad ladies and luxury sports cars, and he has since denounced Iran.\n\nHowever, the country is seeking his extradition after accusing him of money laundering and running illegal websites.\n\nThe current uprising, which exploded Dec. 28, has morphed into the most serious threat to Iran’s clerical rulers since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nThe regime has answered with overwhelming force, deploying the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij militia to crush the unrest, according to rights groups and witness accounts.\n\nSources inside Iran estimate at least 12,000 — and possibly as many as 20,000 — people may have been killed during the unrest, according to CBS News.\n\nTehran has fiercely disputed the numbers, blaming the bloodshed on what it calls “armed rioters” and “terrorists” backed by foreign powers, including the US and Israel.",

    "fullText": "World Cup 2026 ticket holders can now access priority visa appointments for travel to the United States - but doubt remains whether fans from every country to have qualified will be able to enter.\n\nThe Fifa Prioritised Appointment Scheduling System - or Fifa Pass - announced by US President Donald Trump in November, went live on Tuesday.\n\nIt was introduced in part because citizens of some countries whose teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup may not otherwise receive visa appointments in time for the tournament.\n\nBut the US State Department has stressed that a Fifa Pass appointment does not guarantee a visa will be approved, with all ticket holders having to \"undergo thorough security screening and vetting\".\n\nMost citizens of countries under the US visa waiver programme, which covers much of Europe, including the UK, along with Japan, Australia and others, can ordinarily travel visa-free for up to 90 days, so do not need to use the Fifa Pass. Travellers from those countries would need to apply instead for an Esta - an Electronic System for Travel Authorization.\n\nA senior State Department official said the new Fifa Pass system will cut wait times - with applicants in \"over 80%\" of countries now able to schedule a visa appointment in \"less that 60 days\".\n\nIt added: \"At the visa appointment, the applicant must show they qualify for the visa and plan to follow our laws and leave at the end of the tournament. America's safety and the security of our borders will always come first.\"",

The program allowed citizens of 125 countries to apply for permission to enter easily online.\n\nFrom August 2024, citizens of countries like the United States, Canada and most European and Asian nations could apply for a 90-day tourist or business visa for free by submitting their passport information and trip details through a government portal.\n\nTravelers looking to come to the country were the first to notice that the \"Pak ID\" mobile application now directs applicants to select a traditional visa category for which they have to pay $35 USD for a single entry of up to three months (the prior visa allowed for multiple entries) and will take up to seven business days to be processed.\n\nCitizens of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom have to pay a higher $60 fee for reasons not expanded upon. The Pakistani government has not released an official statement on the change or provided any information on whether the simplified application will ever be brought back.\n\nIn August 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif classified \"this easing of the visa regime [as a way to] help make Pakistan an attractive destination for investments and tourism.\"\n\nThe country sees significantly less tourism interest than neighboring India and has over the last half-decade made several efforts to draw in international visitors.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots punched their ticket to the AFC Championship on Sunday, January 18, with a hard-fought 28-16 victory over the Houston Texans. In a game defined by a relentless Foxborough snowstorm, Mike Vrabel’s squad overcame a turnover-heavy first half to secure the franchise's first conference title berth since 2019.\n\nThe matchup lived up to its billing as a defensive slugfest. While the Texans’ top-ranked unit made life difficult for Drake Maye, forcing him into four fumbles, the Patriots’ defense proved even more opportunistic. New England feasted on a record-tying four interceptions from C.J. Stroud, including a crucial Marcus Jones pick-six that swung the momentum for good. Despite the sloppy conditions, Maye’s three touchdown passes provided the necessary spark to push the Patriots past a Houston team that had dominated the Wild Card round.\n\nWith the win, the Patriots now look ahead to a high-stakes trip to higher altitudes next Sunday, January 25. Now, a new generation takes the stage as the Patriots aim to rewrite history and claim the all-time postseason wins record for themselves.\n\nHere is more on who the Patriots play next in the 2026 NFL playoffs.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\nWith the win, the Patriots move on to the AFC Championship, facing the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos squeaked past the Buffalo Bills and Josh Allen, automatically getting home-field advantage for the AFC Championship Game. Mile High is certainly no easy place to play, and Denver earned the right to host by clinching the No. 1 overall seed. Though Denver suffered a brutal blow when starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury.\n\nThe matchup carries heavy foreshadowing. The last time these two storied franchises met in the AFC Championship was exactly a decade ago in January 2016. That legendary \"Mile High\" battle served as the final postseason chapter of the Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning rivalry — a game the Broncos won 20-18 on their way to a Super Bowl title.\n\nThis time around, with a new quarterback at the helm, New England is searching for revenge.",

Making matters worse, C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions — one returned for a touchdown — and lost a fumble.\n\nThe Patriots will look to improve to 9-0 on the road when playing the Broncos, who survived a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills. But the AFC West champions suffered a huge loss in the process, as quarterback Bo Nix broke his ankle at the end of the game.\n\nThat places former Patriots reserve Jarrett Stidham in line to make his fifth career start.

    "fullText": "The US isn't the tourist destination it once was.\n\nVisits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, according to data released earlier this month by the National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nIn 2025, visits to the US were down among 10 of the top 20 overseas tourist-generating countries, including India, Germany, and South Korea.\n\nThe decline is a sustained blow to the travel and tourism industries, which in 2024 supported more than 15 million jobs, and generated about $1.3 trillion in economic output — including $181 billion from inbound international travel.\n\nMajor tourism hubs like Las Vegas are seeing widespread layoffs due to the downturn, forcing workers to get creative with their career pivots. Business Insider reported earlier this month that laid-off hospitality workers contributed to a 55% increase in dancer auditions at a Las Vegas strip club compared to the prior six months.\n\nIt doesn't appear the travel bug has gone anywhere — just that international tourists are avoiding the US.\n\nIn Australia, for example, overseas arrivals and departures data released Friday by the country's Bureau of Statistics shows that international travel returned to pre-pandemic levels just before the lockdowns began in 2020. Australians travelling to Canada rose 4% in the last year, 10% more visited India, and visits by Australians to China and Japan rose 20% and 21%, respectively, but 3.2% fewer booked a trip to the US.\n\nFewer Canadian travelers are visiting the US, as well, opting instead to go further south to Mexico, Business Insider reported last April.\n\nComplicating demand were ongoing trade frictions, tariff battles, and geopolitical unease, which helped fuel grass-roots boycotts of US goods and, in some cases, changes in travel plans.\n\nEuropean travel firms and analysts pointed to tariff-driven consumer backlash and growing anti-American sentiment as factors that contributed to early-year softness in bookings, even as demand showed signs of rebounding later in the summer.\n\nDomestic travel has helped cushion the blow so far, with the US Travel Association projecting that domestic leisure travel was forecast to grow 1.9% to $895 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, if international visitors continue to stay away, destinations that depend on overseas spending — from iconic tourism cities to national parks — could feel growing pressure as the US heads into a high-stakes stretch of global events in 2026 and beyond.",

The rest, as they say, is history, and what a ride it's been so far.\n\nWe were dating for about a month when Stewart said, \"I've got something to tell you.\" He continued: \"I'm going to quit my job and cycle around the world. Do you want to come with me?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" I said without hesitation.\n\nStew had already planned a 24,000-mile turn-by-turn route across 32 countries.\n\nHe saved enough money that he could ride around the world for 18 months unemployed. His plan was to carry a tent and stay in cheap accommodations, like hostels and Airbnb rooms.\n\nAll I needed to do was save enough money to cover my flights. For a few months, we cut costs, but left ourselves with enough money to enjoy being a young couple; a meal out each month was a non-negotiable.\n\nAs we left our jobs, Stewart also organized the bikes: bright yellow steel-frame touring bikes that could manage long-distance cycling, as well as the additional weight of our luggage.\n\nWhen we left the UK, we waved goodbye to our families at Stewart's mom's house, and we wobbled down the driveway on the heaviest bikes we'd ever ridden.\n\nI will never forget the feeling of freedom. We were unemployed, and everything we needed for the next 18 months was packed into six bright yellow panniers, which fit proudly on our bikes.\n\nI was nervous, excited, and weightless.\n\nThere are many prominent moments as you cycle from one country to another. But the first one was leaving Georgia and arriving in Azerbaijan. The gorgeous greenery of Azerbaijan turned into flat desert landscapes.\n\nAustralia was similar. Across Nullarbor Plain, we rode desert flatlands with kangaroos and Wedge-Tailed Eagles. Service stations were over 100 miles apart. Then we reached New South Wales, home to green mountains and Bulli Pass.\n\nAt the top, there was a wedding venue overlooking the sea. We talked about weddings and all the things we didn't want: first dances, speeches, and the pressure of invitations.\n\nAfter Australia, our next stop was New Zealand. We flew to Queenstown and researched what it takes to get married there. You need a marriage license and a celebrant who will officiate the ceremony in front of two witnesses.\n\nOur celebrant was someone we found online, named Sean. He was a lovely Irish gentleman with a steady voice, a calming presence, and an art for perfectly timed humor. He knew exactly when to drop a joke and when to let a moment breathe. He promised us two witnesses (his wife, Vee, and friend, Chris) for the price of two quality bottles of wine.\n\nAfter one call with Sean, we stepped out into Queenstown, engaged-ish. We booked a date, bought New Zealand-gold wedding rings, and hired wedding attire.\n\nStew surprised me with a proposal and a placeholder ring, and of course, I said yes.\n\nOur next bike ride was 500 miles from Queenstown to Christchurch, so we could marry. I'd love to tell you that it was straightforward, but on a cycling adventure, unforeseen challenges arise. At Haast Pass, there was a landslide. Delays meant we would miss our own wedding.\n\nThe beauty of an elopement? We only had ourselves to please. I called Sean, the hair salon, and the florist to change the date. The landslide was cleared, and we made our way to Christchurch.\n\nWe married at The Sign of the Bellbird in the Port Hills. It was beautiful. Rolling hills with the yellowest of flowers looked stunning against the deep green mountains and gorgeous blue skies.\n\nOn that quiet hill, with only us to please, and nothing but birdsong and sunshine, we spoke our vows and became husband and wife.\n\nThere were no crowds, no pressure, and no expectations. It was just us, which was all we'd known in the year leading up to it as we cycled from the UK to New Zealand. What followed was an eight-month honeymoon cycling home via South America.",

    "description": "In this Saturday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about the best ways to go OOO.",
    "fullText": "As you may have noticed, I wasn't at work last week. (Thanks, Paige, for filling in!) I decided to ease into the year sans meetings, emails, or circling back.\n\nMy intention for taking the first full week of the year off was simple: to be intentional about rest so that I can spend the next two quarters running at full speed. I had planned to do only one joyous activity per day.\n\nI started the week by taking my son to a pottery painting class and then a massage on Tuesday. Wednesday was spent decluttering the garage, followed by doing absolutely nothing but catching up on Netflix series on Thursday. I capped the week off with a Friday facial.\n\nDespite sticking to my one activity per day, I still had to get the kids off to school. I had more time, so I also offered to pick them up, too. I cooked all of my meals (because have you seen this economy?!) and I finally joined Costco. I felt very productive, but also very tired.\n\n\"There is a win. You set good intentions, and you set a plan,\" Bryant, who's also the author of \"Homecoming: Overcome Fear and Trauma to Reclaim Your Whole Authentic Self,\" told me. \"Intention doesn't equal impact.\"\n\nBryant said my mistake was clear. \"You traded labor. You did less of one job and replaced it with more of another job,\" she explained. \"The reason the exhaustion surprises you is because you're like, 'but I didn't do any work this week.' But the driving, the cooking, the baths, these things are work.\"\n\nFor you, it may not be your home life, but the incessant accumulation of small tasks or tiny decisions — whether it's text message triage, planning meet-ups with friends, or caretaking your parents — can eat up ease while on vacation.\n\nIn the future, Bryant suggested that I remember that childcare and home labor are still work, even if they are labors of love. She added that instead of taking on more at home, outsource as much as I can afford.\n\nBryant also left me with this reminder: \"Embrace the truth that 'I'm worthy of rest from it all.'\"",

    "description": "Himal Mandalia was worried about explaining his career break on his resume, but it helped him deal with emotional baggage, accept himself, and finally start to slow down.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Himal Mandalia, 45, who lives in London. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI had a difficult childhood, and I missed a lot of school. When I hit my 20s, I didn't know what I wanted to be, so I floated between jobs. By age 32, in 2012, I'd reached a low point and felt my life was going nowhere.\n\nWhat I achieved in the following 10 years went beyond my wildest dreams.\n\nIn 2013, I landed a job as a software developer for a content marketing agency. I'd been coding as a hobby since I was young, and had relevant volunteer projects under my belt, but this formally kick-started my career in technology. By 2021, I was the head of technology for the UK government's official website.\n\nIn 2022, at age 42, I took a six-month break from work. It turned into 3½ years, and I traveled the world, but I found that I couldn't slow down. It unearthed hard truths about myself that I had to address.\n\nAt first, I was anxious about explaining my career break on my résumé, but I realized that people often take long career breaks to be parents, and I had reparented myself.\n\nIn the process, I learned to accept myself and be more present in the moment, which has been life-changing.\n\nI hadn't planned to work for the government, but when I started doing contract work for a department in 2014, I fell in love with designing services to support people's needs. In 2021, I got the job as the head of technology for GOV.UK, which felt like a huge achievement.\n\nAfter more than a year in the role, I reached a natural point where I needed a break from my career and could comfortably afford one, and left my job in April 2022. I didn't know what I wanted to do next in my role, and also had personal issues related to my difficult childhood to address.\n\nDuring my time off, I wrote my memoir, but realized there was little continuity to the narrative. Plus, even \"successful\" chapters felt hollow. I decided I needed more time to find out why that was.\n\nI hit the road on an open-ended trip to work on my book and myself. I flew to New Zealand and jumped to a new destination every week, including Bangkok, Singapore, and Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat struck me during this time was my need for control. Whenever I sat in a café to relax, I felt compelled to plan my next four weeks in a document. I was exhausted and wondered if I'd become the only person to burn out on their career break.\n\nAfter six months, I made Melbourne my base and slowed down, traveling a little. In mid-2024, at age 44, I drew the line at 18 months of travel and returned to the UK indefinitely.\n\nI'd always felt different from others, and met some neurodivergent people while travelling.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD in October 2024 and autism in May 2025.\n\nThe diagnosis and tendencies associated with ADHD explained many of my lifelong patterns. I was often restless and always had to be on the go. I feel like it's why I pushed myself to travel to new places every week during my break.\n\nI'd also shift from being hyperfocused to disengaged. I could apply extraordinary effort and long hours to something, but it wasn't sustainable. During my career, I developed a drill sergeant in my head that drove me to sometimes work 80 hours a week, even though no one asked me to. I'd eventually get bored and walk away from things.\n\nADHD prevented me from sitting still and having a life of continuity, but it also meant I was always learning new skills, and it helped me become successful. It's not something I can hate.\n\nMedication has helped slow me down, and in early 2025, I started dealing with the emotional baggage that I'd taken around the world. It was like opening a warehouse full of boxes that I was scared to look inside. I had experienced a lot of shame about being different, so I had to forgive how unkind I'd been to myself and get \n\nIn June 2025, I founded a nonprofit called ADHD Pathfinding, focused on improving ADHD care in the UK.\n\nMy journey made me realize that the only thing we really have is the moments. There's a finite number of them, and when they're gone, that's it. There's only one way to make sure you don't miss them, which is to slow down and be present.\n\nI've seen more of the world than most people, but I missed most of it, because I was going too fast. Whatever keeps someone living on fast-forward, whether that's ADHD, unhealed trauma, or something else, understanding it can make it possible to slow down and feel more connected.",

The agent, identified as Tomas Escotto, believed he was on a date with woman while he was blabbing about Vance; the woman turned out to be a reporter for O’Keefe Media Group.\n\nEscotto talked about how the vice president is protected and the security measures agents take. He also told the woman he voted for ex-President Joe Biden and “I hate that sh*t” when talking about President Donald Trump’s ICE raids.\n\nThe agent later texted the woman on Dec. 26 about Vance’s travel plans for the next week, revealing he would be in Ohio and Florida for a handful of days. He also sent the reporter pictures of him aboard Air Force 2 and also pictures that provided metadata on where the president’s convoy was located.\n\nHe knew he was not allowed to share much of the information he was talking about.

    "description": "When my husband was laid off from his tech job, we sold our house and decided to travel for a year in our 40s. It changed how we view happiness.",
    "fullText": "We lived with our two greyhounds in an over-3,000-square-foot home outside Boston that we owned. We were both hustling and climbing the corporate ladder — he in the tech industry, and I at a law practice.\n\nThen, in 2022, Dave got laid off, and we lost our two dogs to cancer.\n\nThat's when we had the harrowing realization that the life we'd spent years building no longer fit us. Our home now felt far too big, and we felt lost and restless. We desperately needed a change — but first, a change of scenery.\n\nSo, we sold our house and decided to spend a year traveling the world as we contemplated our next move.\n\nBefore hitting the road, I figured out a plan to work remotely. That income, plus Dave's severance and the money made from the sale of our home, would allow us to enjoy some time away without financial strain.\n\nOur travel goals were simple — see a lot of places, think about what to do with our lives when we returned to the US, and spend time with animals along the way.\n\nThough we're ambitious, we've always found that spending time around animals forces us to slow down. It's a lesson we'd learned after adopting our dogs, who always seemed happy just to be, sans any hustle.\n\nSo, we started our trip on a farm about an hour south of Dublin, where we were able to really mellow out.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to find a note from Dave that said he was joining the husband-and-wife farmers to scan the bellies of the pregnant sheep on-site.\n\nI cradled a warm cup of coffee in my hands as I stood behind my husband while he helped the farmers. His smile was the biggest I'd seen in a long time.\n\nOver the next nine months, we visited other countries in Europe including Croatia, Portugal, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nWe traveled slowly and established home bases in each place, which allowed us to really relax into the environment. We were able to explore at our own pace, and we also had time to consider what our future looked like back in the US.\n\nWhatever was next, we knew it would involve less hustle and more time in the natural world.\n\nAfter nine months, our hunger for travel felt more than satiated.\n\nWe returned to the US with a clear understanding that the life we'd left behind in the States — with a giant home and a constant desire to climb the corporate ladder — wasn't the one we wanted to cultivate again.\n\nDuring our travels, some of our most cherished memories included spending time on the farm in Dublin and sinking into the hot springs in Iceland. It was moments such as these that helped us realize the life we wanted was slower and more intentional.\n\nSo, we downsized to an 800-square-foot home on a lake in central Massachusetts. We even adopted another greyhound — one who's always eager to sit lakeside with his dads, watching the birds fly by.\n\nA little more than a year after we returned, I retired from my law practice to focus on writing, and Dave left the tech industry behind to start a whole new career at a mom-and-pop company.\n\nIf traveling for that year taught us anything, it's that our joy is better accessed with less stuff, less chasing of bigger-and-better opportunities, and more chances to be with the natural world.\n\nThis story was originally published on June 17, 2025, and most recently updated on January 14, 2026.",

    "fullText": "According to SPORT, Barcelona youngster Pedro ‘Dro’ Fernández did not train in the session prior to the match against Racing Santander and will not travel to Santander for the Copa del Rey tie.\n\nThe 18-year-old midfielder will be unavailable and will not join the squad after it was confirmed that he is carrying physical discomfort that prevents him from competing at full capacity.\n\nThe coaching staff have chosen not to take risks and, pending official confirmation, everything indicates that he will not be included in the matchday squad.\n\nDro’s absence represents a significant setback for Hansi Flick, as everything suggested that he could have been given minutes in tomorrow’s game in the Copa del Rey Round of 16.\n\nIn fact, the Spain Under-18 national team had released the La Masia graduate from the squad, aware of his discomfort. Although there was confidence that he would recover in time, this has ultimately not been the case.\n\nDro out of Copa del Rey clash. (Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images)\n\nDro will now remain in Barcelona throughout the week and focus on a full recovery before returning to the group as soon as possible.\n\nThe objective is for him to be available again in the coming weeks and to resume his normal routine, putting behind him a physical issue that has arrived at the worst possible moment.\n\nBarcelona have been working for some time on renewing Dro’s contract. The player is held in very high regard internally due to his projection and performances.\n\nThe teenager has made a strong impression on Flick since pre-season, with the coach satisfied by his attitude and his fit within the playing model.\n\nWith Dro turning 18 years old earlier this month, Barcelona plan to follow the same strategy that they did with Lamine Yamal and Pau Cubarsi and tie down the academy ace to a new long-term contract at the earliest possible.",

    "description": "Myrtle Beach is moving to give drivers more freedom downtown this summer. Here’s what we know about plans to end Ocean Boulevard flushing.",
    "fullText": "Myrtle Beach drivers could soon see a change in the busy tourist district as City Council moves to end downtown flushing.\n\nAmid a flurry of legislative initiatives on Tuesday’s agenda for Myrtle Beach City Council’s first meeting of the year, a new motion would direct city manager Jonathan “Fox” Simons Jr. to end the Summer Emergency Vehicle Access Plan, or SEVAP, more commonly called flushing.\n\nThe plan – which city police said was intended to improve response times, increase visibility and allow officers to address concerns – seasonally reroutes part of the northbound lane Ocean Boulevard on weekend nights.\n\nIncoming Mayor Mark Kruea said the traffic diversion “visually sends the wrong message,” contributes to declining tourism and hurts local businesses.\n\n“The merchants reported a 40% decline in their revenues last year. If you’re trying to kill tourism, that’s the way to do it. We need to not take that action,” said Kruea.\n\nAlthough the motion would end scheduled flushing, it would still allow staff to utilize traffic control practices.\n\n“Police still have the ability to divert traffic as needed, but the automatic shut the boulevard down at 4:00 on Friday and Saturday serves no good purpose,” Kruea said.\n\nDespite support from businesses and the mayor, the motion isn’t without controversy. Councilman Mike Lowder shared support for SEVAP on behalf of consituents.\n\n“It is amazing how many residents, non-business owners, that I heard from,” said Lowder, “their displeasure, when they go down to the boulevard, they have to be turned off of the boulevard every Friday and Saturday night.”\n\nThe motion directs the manager to end SEVAP “effective immediately,” but a consultant is still finalizing an assessment of the plan. According to the motion language, a draft of the report will be ready in February.",

    "description": "I tested Cadence Capsules, a luxury-grade travel container system. They make it easy to measure out my skincare routine, but cost a fortune.",
    "fullText": "I'm turning 30 this year, and one of my goals for the next decade is to travel more (I know, so original). I just went on my first big international trip last year, though I wish I'd known about Cadence Capsules before I went.\n\nMy Instagram algorithm was a little late on the draw for me to invest in these expensive little pods so close to my trip, but I kept getting ads from polished jet-setter types about how amazing they are. So, I decided to test them out between now and my next adventure and see for myself about the hype.\n\nCadence Capsules are reusable toiletry containers designed to organize pills, lotions, potions, or any other tiny items that can easily get lost in a suitcase mid-travel. They're mostly for storing medications and beauty products, but you can get creative with how you fill them.\n\nA system is made up of matte hexagonal Capsules varying in size, which stack together magnetically (the same way Fenty beauty products do) with a satisfying, ASMR-level click. You can keep easily keep track of what's inside thanks to the several interchangeable magnetic tile labels, which to me look a lot cleaner and more efficient than my smudgy handwriting.\n\nBefore I went home for the holidays, I packed my petal pink Capsule system in its matching petal pink Cadence Parcel. It's a clear, quart-sized bag that meets TSA requirements (and looks good doing it). It's not my favorite travel makeup bag I've ever used, but I like how it functions like a tray when I'm getting ready with limited counter space.\n\nI take magnesium each night before bed so I brought a week's worth, which fit in one Small Capsule. I take a few other medications as needed, so I brought two extra small Capsules as back up.\n\nInstead I ended up using them for my jewelry, and — if we can be real — they work well for storing cannabis buds, too. I'm also thinking ahead on how to use them in summer, and I think they'd be great for storing herbs and spices when camping. They're not technically food-safe (but only because companies can either be certified for ocean-bound plastic or food-safe, not both).\n\nA big reason Cadense Capsules are so expensive is because they're made with recycled plastics. It's a costly, laborious process to source recycled plastic and give it a whole new shape, color, and purpose. Cadence claims it uses 20% ocean-bound plastics to form its TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane), the same of which Nike uses. The AAPI, woman-led company also keeps it fulfillment and design teams local, so you're paying for an ethically-made product.\n\nMy dream for the next big innovation in travel accessories is a method that doesn't waste all my expensive hair products. Cadence offers Adapters (which notably, are also quite expensive) to help pour in fluids without spilling, but I hate the fact that I'm wasting even a minuscule amount of my curl defining cream.\n\nThat said, the Capsules never leaked on me once. Plus, the curved Spatula made it easy to scoop out every hard-to-reach drop of product. And since every Capsule is labeled with its fluid ounce capacity, you can rest assured you're packing according to strict airline requirements.\n\nIf you're a frequent flier who packs a lot of medications, then I say a Cadence Capsule system is worth the splurge. I rarely feel this put-together when I'm traveling, but the sleek, customizable design has put me in control of all my odds and ends. \n\nI didn't find them particularly helpful as someone who struggles the most with packing fluids, but the Cadence Capsules are really satisfying to use and look at. Even though they're pricier than almost any alternative, the aesthetic is unmatched.",

    "fullText": "French Polynesia is one of the world's most romantic travel destinations. However, my trip there was anything but romantic.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I came across a cheap flight deal to Tahiti, we jumped at the opportunity to visit. Yet instead of planning a romantic getaway for just the two of us, we invited his dad to come along.\n\nOur travel group was certainly unconventional, but we were excited to make memories together in such a dreamy destination. Even though we love planning trips with just us, it can be just as (if not more) fun to share the experience with loved ones.\n\nThroughout our trip, we had an incredible time exploring the islands, but also learned a few lessons about traveling with a parent.\n\nIn the end, despite our out-of-the-ordinary travel group, it was one of our best trips yet.\n\nI love searching the web for cheap flight deals. There are countless websites listing low fares (and even some subscription models), but my personal favorite is The Flight Deal.\n\nFrom time to time, I briefly browse the site to see what's available, and it's led to some great savings over the years. Yet in the midst of winter in 2023, I came across my most dream-worthy deal to date: a round-trip flight from San Francisco to Papeete, Tahiti, for $600.\n\nThe flight departed in less than two weeks, and leaving our snowy home behind to enjoy the tropics was enticing. I quickly called my boyfriend to propose the idea. With ample vacation time to spare, he was sold within minutes.\n\nAlthough French Polynesia is known for its romantic atmosphere, the deal felt too good not to share. After securing our flights, we asked family members to tag along, too.\n\nDue to the last-minute nature of the trip, my boyfriend's dad was the only one available.\n\nAt first, we wondered if we should postpone a family trip and just travel as a couple, but ultimately decided it would be a great bonding experience for the three of us.\n\nAfter landing in Tahiti, we spent a night on the island before traveling to the breathtaking island of Mo'orea, where we would spend the next five days.\n\nThe three of us spent our time snorkeling amongst colorful reefs, eating freshly-caught seafood at local food trucks, cycling around the island, and enjoying some of the most stunning sunsets we've ever seen.\n\nWe spent the majority of our time together, but my boyfriend and I still got alone time here and there, whether we visited a beach together or enjoyed a private meal.\n\nSurprisingly, his dad was always the one to suggest this, explaining that he'd stay behind to relax at the pool while we explored.\n\nTraveling with a group is all about balance, and our trip had the perfect mix of both family time and couple time.\n\nSince we booked our trip less than two weeks before departure, accommodation options were limited on the small island.\n\nMost hotels were fully booked, and French Polynesia's iconic overwater bungalows were outside of our budget.\n\nUltimately, we chose a budget-friendly Airbnb. For $100 a night, the rental was mostly perfect. It had an ocean view, small pool, and an outdoor kitchen.\n\nYet there was one major downside with the rental: It had just one bedroom with two beds — not exactly ideal for our travel party.\n\nDuring the week, we couldn't help but laugh at our living arrangement. Here we were, in one of the world's most romantic destinations, sharing a room with one of our parents!\n\nWe had to take what we could find for our last-minute trip, but I'd definitely spend extra for more private, spacious accommodations next time.\n\nIn the end, my boyfriend and I had no regrets about bringing his dad on our trip to French Polynesia.\n\nGoing on a trip with a parent or in-law can come with extra challenges, but the three of us traveled exceptionally well together. We made sure to give each other space when needed, and ultimately loved creating such wonderful memories as a group.\n\nIt may not have been the most romantic trip, but for my boyfriend and I, traveling with his dad made our trip even more special than if we had visited alone.",

    "fullText": "Jaguars vs. Bills radio coverage: Station, channel, streaming to listen live to NFL wild card playoff game broadcast originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe AFC wild card round delivers one of the most exciting quarterback showdowns of the weekend as Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills (12-5, No. 6 seed) travel south to EverBank Stadium to face Trevor Lawrence and the AFC South Champion Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4, No. 3 seed).\n\nThis game pits two of the league's premier signal-callers against each other for the right to advance. While Allen and the Bills bring years of deep playoff experience, they will have to contend with a red-hot Jaguars team that hasn't lost since early November and enters the postseason carrying an impressive eight-game winning streak.\n\nThe wild card tilt carries a fascinating historical footnote as well: the Jaguars are 2-0 all-time against the Bills in the playoffs, securing wins in the 1996 and 2017 Wild Card rounds. However, this is a completely different era, defined by the dynamic, explosive offenses led by superstar quarterbacks. Lawrence, in particular, has elevated his game down the stretch, leading the AFC's hottest team with an MVP-caliber run through the second half of the season, a stretch that saw the Jaguars averaging 34 points per game.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills, despite being the lower seed and playing on the road for the first time in the wild card round since 2019, are looking to finally reach the Super Bowl; with the reigning MVP Josh Allen at the helm.\n\nHere's how to listen to the matchup.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channels 225 (Bills), 226 (Jaguars)\n\nJaguars radio channel: 1010XL / 92.5 FM\n\nThe Bills and Jaguars can be found on nationally on SiriusXM, where listeners can tune into the game from any location. Along with the national channel 88, channel 225 (Bills) and 226 (Jaguars) will provide team specific broadcasts.\n\nThose in the Buffalo area can listen to WGR 550, which carries all Bills football games through the season. In North Florida, Jax Sports Radio 1010XL / 92.5 FM is the home for all Jaguars games.\n\nListen to every NFL Game live on SiriusXM, where new subscribers can start with a free first month. Subscriptions include live play-by-play for the NFL, college football, MLB, NBA, NHL, NASCAR, and more. Get 24/7 coverage with news and analysis from SiriusXM NFL Radio and other sport-specific channels.\n\nTime: 1 p.m. ET | 11 a.m. MT | 10 a.m. PT\n\nThe Bills and Jaguars will begin Sunday's slate of three NFL wild card games.\n\nThe game will kick off at 1 p.m. ET from EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville, Fla.",

    "title": "I've lived in Switzerland for 5 years. Here are the 6 biggest mistakes I see first-time visitors make over and over.",
    "description": "If you're visiting Switzerland for the first time, avoid these common travel and itinerary mistakes that'll cost you money, time, or joy on your trip.",
    "fullText": "Though I'm a US citizen, I've spent the past five years living in Switzerland.\n\nAs a semi-recent transplant, I know there's much more to this amazing country than what visitors typically come to see. It's one best experienced thoughtfully and authentically — not by mindlessly racing through \"Top 10 \" lists.\n\nIn terms of mistakes tourists make, here are a few things I suggest you know — and avoid — before visiting Switzerland for the first time.\n\nZermatt, Lauterbrunnen, Interlaken, and Lucerne are popular, jaw-dropping locations, but they're not the only spots worth visiting in Switzerland.\n\nInstead of only seeing the few places on every tourist's list, consider branching out to smaller, lesser-visited ones for at least a day trip. Fortunately, many are easily accessible by public transportation out of some of the area's main hubs.\n\nFor example, close to Interlaken are the mountain villages of Frutigen, Kandersteg, and Adelboden, which offer gorgeous alpine views combined with fewer crowds and more authentic experiences.\n\nIn Switzerland, dining out can seem expensive — in part because the cost of production, labor, and relevant service charges are typically already included in the price of the meal.\n\nPersonally, I find the prices easier to stomach when I remember you're often paying for high-quality, regional fare, and restaurant staff here are typically earning a fair wage.\n\nAnd although tipping servers 15% to 20% of a bill is standard practice in places like the US, it's not the norm here. If you enjoyed the meal and the service, it's customary to round up a few francs or leave a tip between 5% and 10%.\n\nSwitzerland is a popular travel destination throughout the year, and its major attractions can fill up quickly — especially seats on our world-famous scenic routes.\n\nIf you plan on riding the Glacier Express or Bernina Express, book your train tickets as far in advance as possible.\n\nHowever, don't fret if you realize it's too late to book a seat on a scenic route. You'll be just fine on our \"regular\" trains, which tend to run faster, not book up as quickly, and still offer beautiful views.\n\nWhen traveling by train, it's important to double-check your ticket class and location. (And, if you have a paper ticket, get it validated.)\n\nSignage indicating first or second class can be found both outside and inside each car. Oftentimes, the class is also noted on the headrests of the seats themselves.\n\nTicketing agents on board will not hesitate to issue an on-the-spot fine for tourists seated in the wrong class. In addition to a fine of about 100 francs, you'll also have to pay the difference in price for the ticket.\n\nAlso, pay attention to where your seats are before entering each car so you won't have to lug an oversized suitcase through the entire train.\n\nSwitzerland is one of the smallest countries in Europe, at about 16,000 square miles. However, I've seen tourists mistakenly assume they can just zip through and see everything it has to offer in just three or four days.\n\nFor example, Zurich may seem close to Geneva on a map, but they are actually about three hours apart by train. Sure, you could also opt for a one-hour flight — but my point is that trying to see so many cities in a short period won't allow you to truly get a feel for each.\n\nTravel is about experiencing a place, not just visiting to check it off a bucket list. If you've only got a week in Switzerland, I suggest you limit yourself to exploring two or three cities instead of trying to cram six or seven single-night stays in new places into your itinerary.\n\nSwitzerland is composed of 26 cantons, and each of these administrative regions has its own distinct culture, government, and history. They also don't all speak the same languages.\n\nAlthough you'll find English speakers throughout the country — especially in popular tourist areas — Switzerland actually has four official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh.\n\nIt's helpful to learn a few basic greetings in those major languages and ensure you use them in the appropriate region.\n\nAlso, it's handy to become familiar with some of the commonly used symbols — especially when it comes to trash cans.\n\nThe Swiss are conscientious recyclers, so take a beat to look up the symbols printed on the bins before tossing something in them if you are confused. Your mindfulness will be appreciated",

    "fullText": "Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs has recalled nearly 13,000 passports after a software update caused a printing defect.\n\nThe printing error makes the documents non-compliant with international travel standards and potentially unreadable at automated border gates.\n\nThe government said the affected passports, issued between December 23 and January 6, may fail at eGates and border control systems worldwide, prompting a global alert through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and a mass re-issuance program.\n\n\"The Passport Office has confirmed that 12,904 Irish passports issued between 23 December 2025 and 6 January 2026 [inclusive] may not fully meet international travel standards,\" announced the government.\n\n\"The issue was caused by a software update, which could affect use at border control or eGates.\"\n\nHolders are being asked to return their passport books (and cards, where applicable) for free replacement, with new documents to be issued within approximately 10 working days.\n\n\"This will ensure that you do not face any issues with future travel. You do not need to reapply for a new passport,\" the official notice states.\n\nWhile the Department of Foreign Affairs has not explicitly specified where the missing \"IRL\" appears, the reference to ICAO compliance and potential failures at eGates strongly suggests the error affects the machine-readable zone (MRZ), where the three-letter issuing-state code is mandatory under ICAO Doc 9303.\n\nThe MRZ is the two-line block of text at the bottom of the passport's bio page that is scanned by airline systems, border control kiosks, and eGates. It encodes critical data such as the document type, issuing country, passport number, nationality, date of birth, and checksums used to verify the document's integrity.\n\nIf the issuing-state code \"IRL\" is missing or malformed in this zone, automated systems may reject the passport outright, even if the visual biographical page and embedded chip appear normal.\n\nThose travelling imminently or overseas residents can get in touch wih the Passport Office customer service via email at passportreturn@dfa.ie or call +353 (0) 1 613 1780.\n\nAs MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.\n\nThis free cheat sheet outlines 7 best practices you can start using today.",

    "description": "After the US raid on Venezuela forced flight cancellations, some travelers can't get home for another week and are having to spend thousands extra.",
    "fullText": "Meghan Lescinskas and her husband were nearing the end of their honeymoon in Saint Lucia when the US launched its raid on Venezuela.\n\nTheir JetBlue flight home to New York was among the nearly 1,000 flights to and from the Caribbean that were canceled last Saturday. The region's airspace was closed for around 24 hours due to the military activity.\n\n\"I understand that this was a rare circumstance, so I called JetBlue and was on hold for hours,\" Lescinskas told Business Insider.\n\nAfter reaching JetBlue via its app's live chat, Lescinskas was offered a flight on January 16, nearly two weeks after her original return date, according to screenshots of her conversation that were shared with Business Insider. Struggling to find affordable alternative routes home, she and her husband used a travel agent to find them a flight on Saturday, January 10.\n\n\"Our six-day honeymoon has now turned into a 14-day trip,\" she said. \"I am a teacher and have missed school due to this delay, and we also had to pay for extra nights at our hotel that we had not planned for.\"\n\nWhile airlines have added extra flights to help stranded passengers, some, like Lescinskas, say they are still having to wait another week to get home, spending thousands of dollars on accommodation and alternative flights.\n\nThe Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about how, or whether, people may be compensated or refunded.\n\nOn Saturday, January 3, Warren Doyle, a retired airline pilot, was in St Thomas in the Virgin Islands with his family, a party of six. After checking their flight status all morning, he said it wasn't until around 4:30 p.m. that he received a notification their American Airlines flight home had been canceled.\n\n\"We started hunting for accommodation Saturday afternoon, and there was nothing. There was nothing, nothing, nothing,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nEventually, they were able to find two rooms for a night at a three-star hotel. \"It's a very rough part of town,\" he said, with music from nearby venues playing until 3 a.m.\n\nDoyle said he booked a Spirit Airlines flight home to Charlotte, North Carolina, via Florida, arriving early on the morning of Saturday, January 10 — a full week after he was first supposed to fly home.\n\n\"I can't speak to other islands, but St. Thomas is a mess,\" he told Business Insider. \"American's apathy is unbelievable.\"\n\n\"It's costing us, for six people, almost $1,000 a day,\" he added.\n\nAmerican Airlines did not respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nSince Sunday, American has added more than 50 extra flights to and from the Caribbean, but listed just one out of St Thomas, which departed Sunday.\n\n\"Every time I hear an airplane go over here, I look outside and see what it is. I see a lot of private traffic — loads and loads of corporate jets in and out,\" Doyle said. Flightradar24 data showed 17 business jets departed St Thomas on Monday.\n\nLescinskas said that she was struggling to get a refund for her canceled flight as she was \"going back and forth\" between JetBlue and Sandals, the resort through which her trip was booked.\n\nA JetBlue spokesperson told Business Insider that, after scheduling additional flights, it offered Lescinskas a flight on Friday, but she chose to stay with her new booking on a different airline. \"After confirming their decision, JetBlue submitted the authorization for the travel agent to refund the fare of their JetBlue flight,\" they added.\n\n\"We remain focused on supporting those affected by Saturday's forced closure of Caribbean airspace,\" the spokesperson said. JetBlue has added more than 30 extra flights so far, they said.\n\nIn a statement, Sandals Resorts said its priority is to support guests and said it has offered reduced rates, waived penalties, and let guests extend their stays due to the airspace closure.\n\nDoyle and his family found another place to stay until their flight out on Friday. \"We're fortunately comfortable where we are,\" he said. \"We're just taking it a day at a time.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine being stuck in a position where you have limited funds, or you're running up your credit card account. It runs into thousands of dollars in no time at all.\"\n\nMany of the extra flights have been operating from Puerto Rico, but travelers on other islands have limited options to get there due to high demand and the fact that inter-island flights use small airplanes.\n\n\"How there can be a 10-day kickback of disruption just blows my mind,\" said the former airline pilot. \"It's not like we're in Outer Mongolia, we're in the Caribbean. We're a stone's throw from the mainland of the United States.\"",

Crystal Palace find themselves in a mid-winter slump, having failed to win in their last seven matches, but the Eagles have traditionally dominated Villa at home, winning nine of their 13 Premier League encounters at Selhurst Park.\n\nWith Villa level on points with Manchester City following the Citizens’ recent 1-1 draw with Chelsea, the stakes for this road trip have never been higher for the high-flying Villans. Despite their lofty league position, Villa have conceded 14 goals in their last four games against Palace—as many as they had in the previous 15 meetings combined. Emery will be desperate to break his personal jinx against Oliver Glasner, having never beaten the Austrian in six previous meetings.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nLast Meeting: Aston Villa 0–3 Crystal Palace, 31 August 2025, Premier League\n\nOliver Glasner’s squad depth is being tested to the limit following a bruising encounter at Newcastle. Nathaniel Clyne (abductor) and Jefferson Lerma (concussion) are both ruled out, joining long-term absentees Daichi Kamada, Daniel Muñoz, and Cheick Doucouré on the sidelines. In a significant boost, Chris Richards is set to return to the matchday squad, though he is likely to start on the bench. The Eagles may hand a full debut to club-record signing Brennan Johnson, who joined from Tottenham last week.\n\nThe visitors are sweating on the fitness of defensive mainstays Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres, with both players facing late tests after lengthy injury layoffs. Midfielders Amadou Onana and Ross Barkley remain unavailable, while Evann Guessand is away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast. In their absence, the partnership of Youri Tielemans and Boubacar Kamara is expected to continue in the engine room.\n\nPalace boast incredible home dominance in this fixture, winning six of their last seven home games against Villa. This includes the last three in a row by a combined score of 10-1. Jean-Philippe Mateta remains the man to watch; he has been involved in nine goals against Villa—more than against any other Premier League side. However, the Eagles enter this clash without a win in their last seven outings across all competitions.\n\nVilla have been in sensational form, particularly Ollie Watkins, who has scored six goals since the start of December—more than any other player in the division. A win tonight would take Villa to 45+ points after 21 games for only the third time in their history. Notably, on both previous occasions they reached this milestone (1895-96 and 1898-99), they went on to win the league title.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted XI: Henderson; Canvot, Lacroix, Guéhi; Rodney, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Johnson, Pino; Mateta\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Martínez; Cash, Konsa, Lindelöf, Maatsen; Kamara, Tielemans; McGinn, Rogers, Buendía; Watkins\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports+. Coverage begins at 18:00 GMT, with the game kicking off at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead more- Pep Guardiola reacts to Ruben Amorim sacking by Man Utd\n\nSee Also- Two surprise Man Utd candidates emerge as new manager search underway\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Manchester United travel to Turf Moor tonight while they begin a new chapter under interim head coach Darren Fletcher.\n\nDarren Fletcher takes charge following Ruben Amorim’s departure. Notably, the interim manager abandons the previous tactical setup for a traditional 4-2-3-1 system. Desperately, Fletcher aims to secure a first victory of 2026. Crucially, he must capitalise on Burnley’s poor run of form to aid United’s Champions League push.\n\nFortunately, Darren Fletcher receives an immediate boost. Specifically, club captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount return to the fold. In fact, Fernandes could slot straight back into the starting XI to provide a creative spark. However, United remain without Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo, and Noussair Mazraoui due to AFCON commitments.\n\nUnfortunately, injuries deplete the defensive unit. Specifically, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, and Kobbie Mainoo remain sidelined. Consequently, Ayden Heaven looks set to partner Lisandro Martinez in central defence. In attack, Matheus Cunha will likely support Benjamin Sesko. Finally, Fletcher wants his players to “express themselves” in this freer system.\n\nManchester United predicted XI: Lammens; Dalot, Heaven, Martinez, Shaw; Casemiro, Ugarte; Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha; Sesko\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at Turf Moor on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

    "fullText": "Wolves travel to Liverpool tonight while they seek to build on their first victory of the Premier League season.\n\nRob Edwards finally secured three points with a dominant 3-0 win over West Ham at the weekend, snapping a 19-game winless run. While they remain at the bottom of the table, the victory has injected vital confidence into the squad. Edwards must now address his side’s poor away record, as the Old Gold have yet to win on the road this term.\n\nRob Edwards manages several significant absentees but is boosted by some positive fitness updates. Hwang Hee-chan and João Gomes are both expected to be fit after overcoming knocks sustained in the win over West Ham. However, captain Toti remains sidelined, and Emmanuel Agbadou is away on AFCON duty with Ivory Coast. Rodrigo Gomes and Marshall Munetsi are also nearing returns but are unlikely to start tonight.\n\nThe visitors are expected to name a largely unchanged side following their impressive performance at Molineux. Jhon Arias, who scored his first goal for the club last time out, will likely continue in midfield alongside André and Mateus Mane. Notably, Hwang Hee-chan reached 30 Premier League goal involvements for the club at the weekend and will be the focal point of the attack alongside Jorgen Strand Larsen. Edwards will be relying on this pair to end Wolves’ open-play goal drought away from home.\n\nWolves predicted XI: Sá; S. Bueno, Mosquera, Krejčí; Tchatchoua, Arias, André, Mané, H. Bueno; Arokodare, Larsen\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Hill Dickinson Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026.

    "description": "As a child-free couple with remote jobs, we choose not to spend Christmas and New Year's gathering with family. Instead, we travel somewhere new.",
    "fullText": "When most of us think of the holidays, we picture spending them with family — and that's exactly what my husband and I did for over 20 years.\n\nOur tradition was to stay in Los Angeles to be with my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, who all lived within driving distance of our home.\n\nIt was always fun eating tamales, dancing to traditional ranchero music, and laughing at my dad's nonsensical jokes. However, as time has passed, things have changed.\n\nOld relationships ended, and new ones began, and loved ones passed away, including my dad and grandparents. Life also took a big turn once my husband and I both started working remotely in 2020.\n\nSince then, we've become much more spontaneous and creative about how we spend the holidays. We never really know where we'll be, and that's part of what makes it so exciting.\n\nMy husband and I are close to our families, so sometimes it still feels a little weird not to spend the holidays with them. But they're supportive of our travels, and we see them throughout the year.\n\nBecause we have no children or pets, we try to make the most of our flexibility and freedom. This is especially true during the holidays, when we usually have one to two weeks off from work.\n\nIt's a chance for us to rest (and reset) our minds, and enjoy each other's company without worrying about deadlines and meetings.\n\nFor the first couple of trips on our own, we stayed within driving distance of home.\n\nAfter several days in Phoenix during the 2021 Christmas holiday break, we rented a condo in the Catalina Foothills of Tucson. It had the most magnificent views of the city, and that trip remains one of my all-time favorites.\n\nAside from our daily walks among the saguaro cactuses, we didn't do anything major, which was exactly the point.\n\nIt was enough to take in the views, bask in the sunshine, and visit a couple of fantastic local spots — Coronet, a top-notch restaurant-bar with a charming outdoor patio, and Motosonora Brewing Company, a cool tap room and beer garden.\n\nThe following year, we continued the relaxed desert theme and spent the holidays in Palm Springs and Joshua Tree, where a couple of friends met up with us. We loved the wide-open skies, stunning natural landscapes, and the overall slower pace.\n\nIn 2023, we wanted to go bigger, so we splurged on a 10-day vacation to Isla Mujeres, a tiny island off the coast of Cancún.\n\nThough this wasn't our favorite trip — and we made a few mistakes planning it — swimming in the warm turquoise waters of the Caribbean was incredible, and we don't regret the experience.\n\nMost recently, we spent the 2025 to 2026 holiday season in Paris, a trip we didn't even plan until the last minute.\n\nMy husband grew up on the East Coast and has missed having a wintry Christmas ever since we've been together, so we figured we may as well go to our favorite city.\n\nIt was magical. From the gorgeous store decorations and festive street lights to the outdoor Christmas markets and cafés serving vin chaud (mulled hot wine), it felt like we were living in a holiday movie — one that we didn't want to end.\n\nFortunately, it didn't have to. Although the holidays are officially over, we were able to extend our stay in Paris through February, where we'll continue working remotely.\n\nThough we absolutely love to travel, we're not wealthy, so we're always mindful of our expenses. But when we feel it's worth it, we don't hesitate because we know life is short, nothing lasts forever, and we want to follow our bliss while we can.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kaci Jane Hansen. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning on January 3rd, I was putting my suitcases in the back of an Uber and heading to the airport in San Juan after a Puerto Rican New Year's celebration with friends. They had all left on the 2nd, but my flight was early the next morning.\n\nA text came through to say my flight had been delayed by 360 minutes.\n\nOnce I got to the airport, it was totally chaotic. People were crying, and there was hardly space to move.\n\nI soon realized my flight wasn't just delayed — I wouldn't be getting back to New York that day. It was later confirmed that my flight had been canceled.\n\nI got on the phone with Delta to try to rebook my flight, and was told by an automated voice message that it would be a two-hour wait. When a representative finally came on the line, the call was accidentally ended. I phoned back and was told I would have to wait nine hours to speak with someone.\n\nWhile waiting on the phone, I made my way back to my hotel, where I had a quick sleep because my booking hadn't run over yet. But when I woke, I had to check out. There were people and suitcases in the lobby, everyone trying to get a room.\n\nDelta rebooked my flight for Thursday, January 8th, my birthday, and five days after my original flight was meant to be.\n\nJust out of curiosity, I checked to see how much it would cost to charter a private flight — it was about $22,000, which is clearly too expensive for me to afford.\n\nI managed to book an Airbnb until Thursday. I was really lucky to get somewhere because when I was looking, the availability just kept disappearing.\n\nAlthough I feel very fortunate to have a flight booked and a safe place to stay, I am terrified about how this may impact my work.\n\nFor the last year, I have been auditioning all over the US for a part in a production. I got it. It was going to be my big break. I told everyone about it and planned my life around the filming, which starts on January 6th.\n\nI'll still be stuck in Puerto Rico when filming starts.\n\nThe production team could cut me in two seconds. It would be perfectly justified if they did. That would mean that a year of sacrificing and working endlessly would have been for nothing. And what if I don't get another chance like this ever again, to do a job that I have worked so hard for?\n\nNo one is paying for this — for being stuck in Puerto Rico — except for me.\n\nI've had to shell out at least $3,000 for the extra five days here. That's a lot of money I didn't budget to spend. Everything I'm spending is out of pocket — I'll never get reimbursed.\n\nAnd if they drop me from this role, my next paycheck isn't going to come.\n\nEach time I think about the impact this delay in Puerto Rico could have on the future of my career, I get anxious and tearful. I'm trying, I'm really trying, to have a sense of humor and see some bright side in all this, but I'm struggling right now.",

    "description": "Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport has experienced five days of mass cancellations and huge delays due to snow.",
    "fullText": "Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport has led the world in cancellations over the past few days as snow disrupted travel in the Netherlands.\n\nMore than 2,700 flights were canceled in and out of the Dutch capital between last Friday and Tuesday, as of 4 p.m. per data from FlightAware.\n\nIn that time, the cancellation rate rose from 28% to around half of all scheduled flights.\n\nHandling over 66 million passengers a year, Amsterdam is the fourth-busiest airport in Europe and is a major hub for transcontinental travellers.\n\nAs it has a temperate climate and is near the sea, snow is relatively rare in Amsterdam. As such, when it does happen, it can have an outsize impact on travel. This week, several issues, including the snow, high winds, and a lack of capacity for de-icing planes in the cold weather, have combined to exacerbate the disruption at Schiphol Airport.\n\nData from Flightradar24 showed the chaos on the tarmac on Monday.\n\nA KLM flight was supposed to take off for London at 9 a.m. But after it left the gate, it taxied around the airport twice before going back to the gate after almost two and a half hours.\n\nFlight-tracking data also showed how an Emirates Airbus A380 spent three hours on the tarmac after landing before being able to move to its assigned gate.\n\nIt later flew back to Dubai, seven hours behind schedule.\n\nFor about an hour on Monday morning, some incoming flights had to divert while the weather was at its worst, an airport spokesperson said.\n\nThese included an Air Canada flight that diverted to Frankfurt, Germany; two KLM flights from South America that landed in Paris; and a Garuda Indonesia flight from Jakarta that ended up in Brussels.\n\nFlights that were still able to take off from Schiphol have faced average delays of almost two hours.\n\nWith temperatures below freezing, the delays are, in part, being caused by queues for de-icing. Every plane has to be clear of snow and ice before it can take off.\n\nKLM, the Dutch flag carrier, said it is responsible for de-icing most of the planes at Schiphol. However, it added, stocks of de-icing fluid are running low and its German supplier \"is unable to guarantee timely replenishment.\"\n\n\"This challenge is currently widespread across Europe,\" the airline said. \"KLM is doing everything possible to secure additional supply, for example, KLM will collect the fluid itself in Germany.\"\n\nIt added that its 25 de-icing trucks have all been in continuous use since Friday, and its team of 100 employees has been working \"around the clock.\"\n\nThe Schiphol spokesperson said the airport is \"continuing to monitor the weather situation closely.\"\n\n\"At present, only limited flight operations are possible,\" they added.\n\nAre you caught up in the disruption in Amsterdam?

    "description": "Adapting to the different office etiquette, mealtime norms, and vacation days in France has been tough as someone from England, but I'm glad I moved.",
    "fullText": "In 2017, I quit my job as a paralegal, packed up my life in England, and bought a one-way ticket to Paris.\n\nThe new chapter was full of surprises, and though most of them were positive, I was in for some unexpected challenges in those early months — from navigating the notoriously tricky French bureaucracies (and supremely unhelpful bureaucrats operating them), to the weird and wonderful world of the Parisian soirée.\n\nHowever, the strongest culture shocks came in the workplace, and even now, after eight years in France, I still find aspects of French office culture surprising.\n\nGetting to grips with office etiquette was my first major challenge — and the most urgent to overcome. I was starting a completely new role, in a completely new company, barely three days after arriving in France.\n\nMy title was still paralegal, but even there, my remit couldn't have been more different. To say I had a steep learning curve ahead of me would be an almighty understatement.\n\nI had, at least, anticipated some difficulty addressing people correctly, but that didn't make my (frequent) blunders any less embarrassing.\n\nIn French, there are certain words for \"you\" and different versions of verbs depending on the level of politeness/deference needed. The rules around who you \"tu\" and who you \"vous\" feel nebulous at best — and a total minefield for a (foreign) new recruit.\n\nMeanwhile, social norms I wasn't expecting included greeting everyone who joins you in an elevator, and then wishing them a good day/evening when they/you leave. (People do this in medical waiting rooms here, too. I still haven't gotten used to it.)\n\nIn England, people mostly awkwardly avoid eye contact at all costs in these situations. And if you do accidentally acknowledge someone else's existence, at the very most, you offer them a tight (also awkward) smile.\n\nYou absolutely do not, under any circumstances, talk to them.\n\nIt didn't take me long to realize just how seriously the French take enjoying the enjoyment of mealtimes.\n\nEven my office cafeteria felt like a foodie's dream with a rotating menu of things like duck, salmon, and paella; desserts hand-crafted by a professional pastry chef; fresh bread from the local boulangerie; and literal mounds of cheese\n\nMy lunches were so heavily subsidised by my employer that, unless I wanted a three-course meal or a glass of wine (a girl's got to treat herself occasionally), they were almost always free.\n\nAnd, yes, it's apparently perfectly acceptable to have an alcoholic drink in the middle of the workday in France.\n\nI also quickly learned that mealtimes, like baguettes, are sacred in this country, both for socializing and for savoring.\n\nIt's frowned on to eat at your desk, scarfing down a sandwich while you work (I'm looking at you, England). Here, you sit down around a table, and you enjoy your food.\n\nAccordingly, a two-hour lunch break is also customary; The French are often baffled as to what you're supposed to do with \"only\" an hour.\n\nMy colleagues use their breaks to take or teach classes, exercise, or enjoy a leisurely meal in a restaurant — none of which had ever been possible with the 30 to 60 minutes I'd grown used to back home.\n\nRemember how I said it was acceptable to have a drink with lunch?\n\nApparently, it's also acceptable to have a drink before lunch, after lunch, and at essentially any time of the day, if there's even the smallest occasion to celebrate.\n\nI was served more champagne in my first two months in the office than I had been, cumulatively, in my entire life until that point.\n\nOne time, several bottles were opened for a colleague's going-away breakfast at 11:30 a.m. It was tough going, but I adapted to this particular culture shock as uncomplainingly as I could …\n\nAnother early discovery was that work-life balance is everything in France.\n\nThe culture of competition I'd experienced in England — the peculiar bragging over who was arriving at the office earliest and leaving latest (read: burning out fastest) — was completely absent.\n\nLeisure time feels ferociously protected here, to the extent that employees legally have the \"right to disconnect\" (ignore job-related calls and emails outside work hours) and the French are not shy about enforcing their rights.\n\nAdditionally, when I was informed of my vacation allowance, I was sure I must have mistranslated something: I had over five weeks of annual leave in my first year, and that's not including the 11 public holidays.\n\nIn France, workers are generally required to take at least two consecutive weeks' vacation. These breaks often falls between July and August, and swaths of employees disappear for an entire month.\n\nIt's quite a contrast to the situation I'd left behind in England, where taking two weeks' vacation in a row was considered a real extravagance. This is perhaps unsurprising, given I was never entitled to more than four weeks total annual leave.\n\nThat means everything pretty much grinds to a halt in the summer — pretty inconvenient when you're in the middle of a project and all your colleagues are OOO until September.\n\nBut it also opened my eyes to just how life-changing that kind of balance can be, and has been one of the most incredible parts of relocating to France.\n\nAdapting to such starkly different workplace norms from the ones I'd known in England has been a real roller-coaster ride — but there have definitely been plenty more ups than downs.\n\nUltimately, the experience has been as enjoyable as it has been surprising. Champagne, anyone?",

    "title": "19 reads for when Emily Henry's 'People We Meet on Vacation' gives you a book hangover",
    "description": "Netflix is releasing a film adaptation of Emily Henry's \"People We Meet on Vacation\" on January 9. Here's what to read after you watch.",
    "fullText": "One of the most highly anticipated book-to-screen adaptations of 2026 is undoubtedly \"People We Meet on Vacation\" by Emily Henry.\n\nHenry smashed onto the romance scene in 2020 with \"Beach Read\" and has written five more books since then, each of which has skyrocketed to The New York Times bestseller list.\n\nHenry's summer romance books often approach love with a sense of honesty and fun that the genre needs to thrive. Her characters may be enemies who find themselves living next door to each other or best friends who are scared to risk it all for something more, as is the case in \"People We Meet on Vacation,\" which has been turned into a film set to debut on Netflix on January 9.\n\nWhether you're already a fan of Henry or are just getting to know her work through the movie, \"People We Meet on Vacation\" will likely leave you wanting more. Here are other romance books that might help you fill the void.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is Henry's third summer romance book, and it's both an epic love story and an ode to books themselves.\n\nNora Stephens doesn't think anything is missing in her life. She loves her job as a literary agent, her apartment in New York, and living near her sister, Libby, and her nieces.\n\nWhen Libby asks Nora to escape to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina, for a month, Nora can't say no, especially since Libby is several months pregnant at the time. Libby has big dreams of small-town romance for Nora during their getaway, but instead of finding a local man to have a fling with, Nora keeps running into Charlie Lastra, a grumpy New York editor she's never gotten along with.\n\nDespite their less-than-romantic history, Charlie and Nora keep crossing paths in Sunshine Falls, making the ever-growing list of things they have in common harder to ignore. And when Nora discovers her life as she knows it is about to change, Charlie might be the exact thing she needs.\n\nHenry is at her best in \"Happy Place,\" a novel that ruminates on what it means to fight for love.\n\nHarriet has spent her entire adult life loving Wyn. Their relationship consumes her, and the fact that she met him through her best friends, Sabrina and Cleo, only makes her love him more. Between Wyn and her friends, Harriet found the family she had always wanted in college, and she plans to spend her entire life with them.\n\nWhen Wyn abruptly breaks up with her after she starts her medical school residency, Harriet is heartbroken and terrified she's going to lose everyone she loves. She manages to avoid telling Sabrina and Cleo what happened for five months, planning to burst their bubble on their annual group trip to Maine.\n\nThen, Harriet is shocked to see Wyn when she arrives, and he informs her that they'll have to pretend to be a couple for the duration of the trip, as it's the last vacation the group will ever spend in the house they've loved for years. Harriet doesn't want to cause her friends pain, so she's willing to torture herself for a week.\n\nAll she has to do is stop herself from asking Wyn what went wrong for seven days, but as his displays of fake affection start to feel more and more real, Harriet might have to face her fear of rocking the boat if she wants a true chance at happiness.\n\nHenry's latest book, \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" takes place in the summer and features a love story, but it marks a departure from her typical romances.\n\nJournalist Alice Scott is ready for the biggest challenge of her career to date: convincing the elusive heiress Margaret Ives to let her write her biography.\n\nSunny-dispositioned and thoughtful Alice is sure she can make Margaret comfortable enough to share the story of why she disappeared from public life years ago. However, when she arrives in Little Crescent Island, Georgia, to meet Margaret, she finds she'll be competing against Hayden Anderson, a grumpy and inconveniently handsome writer who happened to win a Pulitzer Prize for his last biography, to tell Margaret's story.\n\nBeating out Hayden for the role might be an uphill battle, but Alice isn't going down without a fight, even after she realizes Margaret is picking and choosing what she tells each of them after getting them to sign strict NDAs. And as they try to unweave Margaret's history, it will become more and more difficult for Alice and Hayden to ignore the heat between them.\n\nBolu Babalola's \"Honey & Spice\" doesn't feel like a debut novel, as she writes romantic chemistry with a deftness Henry herself may envy.\n\nKiki Banjo has made a name for herself at Whitewell University with her radio show \"Brown Sugar.\" She's staked her reputation on her ability to suss out players, warning her peers in the African-Caribbean Society against dating men who aren't worth their time.\n\nThen she risks it all by kissing Malakai Korede in front of everyone after writing him off as \"The Wastemen of Whitewell\" on her show. Kiki is terrified her show is going to slip through her grasp, so she makes a deal with Malakai to pretend to be a couple in the hopes that Kiki can save her show and Malakai can change his reputation on campus.\n\nKiki expects the duration of their fake romance to be torture, but as she and Malakai eat, study, and spend time together, she's unsettled to discover there seems to be more to him than meets the eye. Will Kiki be willing to let go of her preconceived notions for a chance at something real?\n\nLike Henry, Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master at writing about yearning and epic love, as is obvious in \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.\"\n\nMonique Grant's career as a magazine writer is at a standstill when famous — and famously private — film star Evelyn Hugo says she wants to do a tell-all interview with Monique, and only Monique.\n\nMonique doesn't understand why Evelyn would want to work with her of all people, but she can't say no, especially when Evelyn starts opening up to her about her path to fame and the forbidden love that changed the course of her life. Monique feels like Evelyn has handed her the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nWhen she finds out why Evelyn chose her for the tell-all, Monique will have to face truths about their shared history she never expected.\n\nIf you've already read Henry's \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" you'll swoon for \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.\"\n\nLydia Bird's life is turned upside down when the love of her life, Freddie, dies in a car accident. After months of mourning and wanting to go back in time, Lydia begins to move on with the help of her sister and Freddie's best friend.\n\nThen she's given a way to return to her old life with Freddie, a life where the tragedy never occurred. Her heart is pulled in two directions as she struggles to choose between going back to the familiar and embracing the unknown, where someone new wants to love her.\n\nPoignant and fresh, Josie Silver's \"The Two Lives of Lydia Bird\" is a story of love and hope that strikes a similar tone to Henry's works.\n\nOn the night before Drew Nichols is set to be a groomsman in his ex-girlfriend's wedding, he gets stuck in an elevator with the pretty and funny Alexa Monroe, the first bright spot in what he believes will be an unbearable weekend.\n\nImpulse leads him to ask her to be his date to the wedding, and the duo surprises themselves by having more fun together than they bargained for. They plan to part ways after the wedding, neither interested in a long-distance relationship, but fate might have other plans for them.\n\nJasmine Guillory writes about romance with reverence and joy, making \"The Wedding Date\" an ideal read for Henry lovers.\n\nDannie Kohan's plan is on track. In one day, she performs well at the job interview of a lifetime and agrees to marry her long-term boyfriend. Then, when she goes to sleep that night, she wakes up five years in the future, with a different man beside her and his ring on her finger.\n\nDannie only has one hour in the future before she's yanked back to the present, and she tries to push aside the experience as a vivid dream. Then, she meets the man from her dream four and a half years later and discovers he's dating her best friend. Dannie will have to confront what she really wants and find out if she's willing to change her plans to find true happiness.\n\nRebecca Serle's \"In Five Years\" explores time, grief, and all-consuming love, both romantic and platonic, in the same way Henry's books do, challenging the reader to ask themselves how far they would go for true happiness.\n\nAlthough Sally Rooney's beloved \"Normal People\" has a darker tone than Henry's books, the protagonists, Connell and Marianne, have a chemistry and a years-long history that Henry fans will love.\n\nConnell and Marianne meet in high school, when Connell is a popular jock, and Marianne is, well, the opposite. The two bond despite their differences, setting them on a course that will shape their lives, drawing them back to one another over and over again.\n\nRooney's novel shows the inevitability of love, finding words for the often inexplicable reasons people need each other. You can also stream the Hulu series once you finish the book.\n\nLike Henry, Carley Fortune captures the angst and ecstasy of summer love in \"One Golden Summer.\"\n\nAlice can trace back her successful photography career to one photo: a candid shot of three teenagers on a bright yellow speedboat. She captured the shot during the one summer she spent at Barry's Bay with her Nan when she was 17, and it shifted the trajectory of her life.\n\nFifteen years later, Alice should be living her dream as a professional photographer, but six months after a breakup, she feels stuck and uninspired. When Nan breaks her hip, Alice thinks spending another summer at Barry's Bay might be good for them both.\n\nHer vision of a tranquil summer with her grandmother gets upended by Charlie Florek, one of the teens from Alice's famous photo. The glimpse of Charlie that she got across the lake all those years ago was intriguing, but adult Charlie is so devastatingly handsome and thoughtful that he almost scares Alice.\n\nAs they spend the summer together, Charlie heals wounds in Alice that she didn't know were there. If he lets her in, Alice might just do the same for Charlie.\n\nIlya Rozanov and Shane Hollander are supposed to hate each other. Not only have they been competing against each other in hockey since they were 18, but they're also total opposites. Canadian Shane is cautious and focused, while Russian wildcard Ilya isn't afraid to embrace his bad boy reputation on the ice.\n\nThey have one big thing in common, though: the secret hookups they can't seem to resist every time they see each other. If the world found out about their relationship, both Ilya and Shane's careers could be in jeopardy, but they may decide it's worth the risk for a chance at something real with each other.\n\nLike Henry's \"PWMOV,\" Rachel Reid's \"Heated Rivalry\" got adapted, though into a hit TV show instead of a movie, so you can stream the series if you want more from the characters when you finish the book.\n\nChristina Lauren has written dozens of books, but their 2018 novel \"Love & Other Words\" is perfect for fans of \"People We Meet on Vacation\" because of its dual timeline.\n\nMacy Sorensen has been white-knuckling her way through life for nearly a decade, but she's content with the safe world she's constructed for herself. A pediatric resident and newly engaged to a kind man who makes her feel mostly nothing, Macy thinks her heart is safe from the turmoil she experienced in her adolescence — until Elliot Petropoulos literally walks back into her life.\n\nMacy met Elliot as a teen shortly after her mother died, and he quickly became her center of gravity as she visited the small town he called home on weekends. Christina Lauren tells their story from the past and present, showing readers how they became fast friends over books and adolescent secrets, how they fell into life-changing love, and the wreckage they were both left with when it all fell apart.\n\nAfter 10 years of no contact, Macy may finally be ready to tell Elliot why she went radio silent on him after one fateful night. They'll both have to decide if they can move on from the pain of the past for a chance at a joy-filled future, together.\n\nAchingly romantic and surprisingly funny, \"The Seven Year Slip\" by Ashley Poston is about meeting the right person at the wrong time, literally.\n\nClementine West has been adrift since her beloved aunt died. She thought living in the Upper East Side apartment she inherited from her would make her feel closer to her, as the apartment's magic had always drawn her in. Instead, she feels like she's just waiting for her aunt to walk through the door.\n\nThen, Clementine comes home one day to a man she doesn't know standing in her kitchen. Except, he thinks the apartment is his, for the summer anyway. He exists seven years in the past, staying in the apartment over the summer while Clementine and her aunt were in Europe.\n\nClementine isn't ready to be hurt by love again, but she might not be able to keep up her defenses against the sweet chef staying the summer. And if she does let herself fall, will they work together if she finds him again in the now?\n\nJustin and Emma are having the same dating problem. Everyone they date meets their soulmate immediately after they break up with them.\n\nWhen Emma sees Justin's viral Reddit post about his problem, she reaches out, and they decide to go on a date with each other in the hopes of breaking their curse.\n\nEmma, a traveling nurse, plans to stay in Minnesota for the summer and enjoy a fling with Justin during her short stay. The last thing either expects is to get immediately attached, especially when they both have family members counting on them come fall.\n\nDespite their best-laid plans, Emma and Justin's curse might have been leading them to each other all along in \"Just for the Summer\" by Abby Jimenez.\n\nTo the world, romance novelist Eva Mercy and acclaimed literary author Shane Hall have nothing to do with each other. That's because the only two people who know their books are inspired by each other are Eva and Shane.\n\nFor their entire careers, Shane and Eva have been writing secret love letters to each other, as the week they spent as teens glued to each other's sides in a rush of love still haunts them both years later.\n\nThey finally come face-to-face again when they both speak on a Brooklyn literary panel, and despite the years since they've seen each other, their chemistry is undeniable. Eva doesn't trust Shane after the way things went down between them, though, and as a single mom, she can't risk getting hurt again.\n\nStill, Eva has always been curious to know why Shane disappeared, and reuniting with him might be the key to breaking her writer's block.\n\nThe second-chance romance in Tia Williams' \"Seven Days in June\" will hit the spot for Henry's fans.\n\nOf Ali Hazelwood's nine romance novels, the coming-of-age story and yearning in \"Deep End\" are most similar to the themes of \"People We Meet on Vacation.\"\n\nNearly every moment of Scarlett Vandermeer's life at Stanford is accounted for. She spends her days in the pool as a member of the diving team or studying, laser-focused on achieving her goal of getting into medical school.\n\nA relationship or even a fling is the last thing on Scarlett's mind. Then, she finds out Lukas Blomqvist, Stanford's world champion swim captain who thrives on control, has similar interests to her when it comes to intimacy, and she thinks she might be able to make time in her busy schedule for something casual.\n\nLukas and Scarlett agree to explore their attraction together, deciding not to tell almost anyone about their arrangement. Scarlett doesn't think keeping her relationship with Lukas to herself will be a problem until she realizes the last thing she feels about him is casual.\n\n\"Same Time Next Summer\" by Annabel Monaghan offers another take on second-chance romance.\n\nSam's family's beach house on Long Island was her happy place in her childhood. She spent every summer there, and she was never happier than she was with her toes in the sand. Then, at 17, Wyatt broke her heart, and Sam couldn't face a summer there without him. She hasn't been back for more than a long weekend since.\n\nAt 30, Sam is making the trek from the city back to the beach, and she isn't the girl she was at 17. She's determined to succeed at her high-powered job and plan the perfect wedding with her fiancé, Jack, whose tendency to over-schedule their lives has become a comfort.\n\nOnly when she arrives, Sam discovers that Wyatt has returned to the house next door, and the entire adult life she created for herself begins to crumble. As old feelings come rushing back, Sam will have to take stock of who she is, who she wants to be, and who she really wants to live her life with.\n\nWhen Phoebe Stone arrives at the Cornwall Inn in Rhode Island, she's dressed to the nines and doesn't intend to ever check out. Her plans immediately go awry, though, when she discovers the entire hotel has been rented out for a wedding, and the attendees immediately assume she's one of the wedding people.\n\nSoon, Phoebe has no choice but to participate in the wedding festivities, especially because she and the bride keep telling each other their darkest secrets.\n\nAfter months of depression, the fanfare and plot twist of a stranger's wedding might just show Phoebe her own path forward.\n\nSlightly more melancholy in tone than Henry's works but still beautifully romantic, \"The Wedding People\" by Alison Espach is about the surprises life can bring when you least expect it.",

    "title": "I travel for a living. Here are 9 items I always pack in case my flight is canceled, and I get stranded.",
    "description": "Recent travel chaos in the Caribbean confirmed writer Meagan Drillinger's must-have packing list, including a laptop, earplugs, swimsuit, and more.",
    "fullText": "I travel for a living, which means my work and my income depend on the assumption that I can get from one place to another without everything falling apart.\n\nThis weekend's travel chaos in the Caribbean hit close to home. As flights were canceled and people were stranded for days, I was reflecting on more than just missed vacations. I thought about travelers who couldn't get back to work, couldn't get back to their routines, or didn't have the necessary tools to function once the plan unraveled.\n\nI've been close to that edge before. In early 2020, I was in Colombia just days before airports worldwide began shutting down due to the COVID pandemic. There was a very real moment when I wasn't sure I'd be able to leave the country. I wouldn't pretend that having the \"right\" things with me made me relaxed. In fact, relaxed wasn't a word in my vocabulary at all as I meandered the aisles of Colombian grocery stores, stocking up on ramen and toilet paper for whatever lockdown I was facing back in the US.\n\nGetting stranded is terrible when all you want is to go home. But the travel essentials I had with me made one thing clear: life could still go on, even when the world got rocked. That's shaped how I travel ever since.\n\nFor me, the ability to work from anywhere isn't a productivity flex or a digital nomad brag; it's a necessity. It's a safety net. Here's what I always have with me, and why I would never travel without these things, even on trips that are supposed to be about unplugging.\n\nI'd never, ever go anywhere without my laptop, even on a getaway that's meant to be a break from work.\n\nWhen plans unravel, your laptop becomes leverage. It buys you time, flexibility, and options. I've watched travelers stranded without laptops scrambling to borrow devices, sending frantic messages from phones, or explaining to employers why they suddenly couldn't do their jobs. I refuse to add \"unemployed\" to an already stressful situation.\n\nIt also doubles as your entertainment system when you've got an indeterminate amount of hours to kill. On that note, add a VPN to your list so you can access all your streaming services from any ISP address.\n\nWhen flights get canceled, outlets become scarce, and airports turn into makeshift bedrooms. A portable battery bank — one powerful enough to charge a laptop, not just a phone — means I'm not fighting strangers for wall space just to stay online.\n\nI've filed stories from airport floors using a power bank while entire terminals went dark. It's not glamorous, but it works.\n\nI always carry my passport, even when I'm flying domestically. Plans change. Routes get rerouted. Borders get strange quickly. It's one of those items you hope you never need, but absolutely don't want to be without when things stop making sense.\n\nI travel with more medication than I think I'll need: pain relievers, anti-diarrheal meds, Pepto, and electrolytes, all on top of prescriptions. Delays stretch, and pharmacies close. When your body starts failing on top of travel disruptions, everything feels 10 times worse.\n\nWhen travel collapses, food becomes unpredictable fast.\n\nRestaurants close. Airports sell out. Hunger makes decision-making worse. Protein bars won't solve the problem, but they'll keep you steady enough to solve everything else, especially when your only restaurant option is the TGIFridays in the parking lot of whatever airport hotel you're crashing in.\n\nRest becomes currency when you're stuck. Earplugs and an eye mask make it possible to sleep in loud terminals or unfamiliar rooms. When it comes to socks and underwear, always pack more than you think you need. If the trip stretches and laundry access disappears, comfort suddenly matters more than aesthetics.\n\nThis sounds frivolous until it isn't. If you're stuck somewhere longer than planned, access to water can be a grounding experience. Pools, hot springs, beaches, and hotel spas can sometimes be the only places where your nervous system gets a break.\n\nDeadlines don't care about travel delays. I've filed stories from airport floors, hotel lobbies, and — more times than I can count — from the passenger seat of a moving car. On a cross-country road trip, I was constantly taking interviews, answering editors, and filing stories while the prairies of North Dakota and the Canadian Rockies rolled past my window.\n\nA portable WiFi device or a reliable international data plan means I'm not dependent on hotel routers, café passwords, or the hope that WiFi will magically work when I need it most. When travel breaks down, connectivity is the difference between falling behind and staying afloat.\n\nI never travel without insurance. After a travel companion was in a serious motorbike accident in Thailand and spent a week in a Thai hospital — fully covered because we had travel insurance — I stopped thinking of it as optional.\n\nYou don't have to travel for a living to learn these lessons. Whether you're a business traveler, a freelancer, or someone who just wants to make it home on time, disruptions can happen to anyone.\n\nPacking with the assumption that things might go wrong isn't pessimistic — it's practical. When travel breaks down, the ability to keep working, stay healthy, and remain connected becomes more than convenience. It becomes stability.\n\nDo you have any work-related travel tips you'd like to share? Email this editor, Agnes Applegate, at aapplegate@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "After moving from West Virginia to Miami in South Florida a few years ago, I've fallen in love with the great weather and budget travel deals.",
    "fullText": "Throughout my childhood, my family barely strayed from the parts of West Virginia's Appalachia region where I was born and raised.\n\nI spent college two hours away in Ohio, and during those years, I started traveling around the United States and to more distant places in Europe and Latin America.\n\nI love exploring the world, so when it was time to graduate and start a life somewhere new, I applied to jobs all around the country.\n\nI took the first one I could get, and it happened to be in Miami. I'd never been to Florida before, but I quickly found things in Dade County I enjoyed.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of living here, there are three big things I love about living in Miami — and one thing I still miss about West Virginia.\n\nA lot of people have opinions about this one, but as someone who grew up in a colder climate, I much prefer Miami weather.\n\nSummer aside, most weeks are sunny and fairly comfortable with a lot of days between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are pleasantly short, sunny, and warm.\n\nI also struggle with depression, which can be impacted by the seasons, so having the ability to go outside and get some sunshine any time of the year is a major bonus for me.\n\nThough summertime in Miami can be uncomfortably hot and humid and hurricane season is no joke, I still prefer the weather here to any place that experiences a harsher winter.\n\nAs a travel writer, I'm constantly booking trips and visiting new cities and countries. And when I'm not hopping on a plane or road tripping to a different part of Florida, I can still experience a variety of communities and cultures in Miami.\n\nMost people know Miami for its Cuban influence, but the city is also home to a huge variety of expats from other parts of Latin America, like Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.\n\nThere's also a lot of diversity from other parts of the world, too. For example, Miami Beach has one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel, and there's also a huge variety of Bahamian, Jamaican and other Caribbean cultures here.\n\nMiami is constantly growing and changing, and I love that I can learn about so many different cultures without traveling too far.\n\nOne of my favorite perks of living in Miami truly is how easy and convenient it is to travel from the city.\n\nFor starters, there are two major airports nearby — Miami International Airport (MIA) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL).\n\nMiami is also the cruise capital of the world, and there are constantly ships sailing from the ports in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nI'm a budget traveler at heart, and I've scored some incredible travel deals from South Florida. I regularly find flights to Europe for less than $400 from these airports, and I can fly to many places around the US for less than $150.\n\nSince I moved to Florida, I've developed a deep appreciation for the beach. However, I still definitely miss the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nThey're the oldest mountain range in the United States, and these rolling hills are the perfect place for exploring. My favorite time to visit West Virginia is in the late spring or early summer when the trees are at their fullest and brightest.\n\nPalm trees are beautiful, but I definitely miss how serene and peaceful nature can be in West Virginia — especially when compared to how busy and chaotic Miami can feel sometimes.",

    "description": "Christine Sauvé, 55, and husband Alain Noël, 56, were found dead by their son in their Dominican Republic vacation home on the morning of Dec. 26",
    "fullText": "The bodies of Alain Noël, 56, and Christine Sauvé, 55, of Québec, were found by their son at the couple’s vacation home in the Dominican Republic on Dec. 26\n\nHer brother tells PEOPLE that the couple hadn't been feeling well before their deaths and seemed \"exhausted\" when they last spoke the following day\n\nA married couple from Canada were found dead while vacationing in the Dominican Republic last month. As family members await answers about what happened, they're speaking out about the couple's final moments.\n\nChristine Sauvé, 55, and Alain Noël, 56, both of Québec, were found dead by their son in their vacation home located in the El Indio Village residential complex in Villa Riva on Friday, Dec. 26, her brother, Gilles Sauvé Jr., confirms to PEOPLE.\n\nAutopsies have already been performed and Gilles says the family's been told they can expect initial results later this week, but that a final report could take up to 4 months.\n\nWithout any definitive answers just yet, there's been lots of speculation in the local press, including questions about whether the couple were murdered or died by suicide. But, Gilles believes \"that is not true.\"\n\nChristine and Alain were married for over 30 years and raised two kids — Jonathan, 30, and Sabrina, 28 — Gilles says, describing the couple as good people with lots of friends.\n\n\"Alain was a big man but a really big teddy bear. And Christine was amazing,\" her brother says. \"She liked to do a lot of things for the family.”\n\nChristine and Alain arrived in the Dominican Republic — where they got a house they planned to live in after retiring — along with their son Jonathan on Dec. 14 for the start of a month-long vacation.\n\nWhile overseas, Gilles says that Christine began experiencing dizziness and had a fall, which prompted her to go to a hospital on Dec. 25, where she had her blood work done. When she went home later that day, she was not given any prescription for her symptoms, but was told to come back the following day for some scans.\n\nGilles says that Alain had also experienced a little dizziness, but was so caught up in worry about his wife's health that he didn't end up mentioning it to doctors.\n\nAfter coming back from the hospital, the couple FaceTimed their family back in Canada. Gilles says they both appeared to be a \"little bit exhausted,\" but didn't report feeling dizzy at the time.\n\nDuring the conversation, Christine mentioned having no clue what caused the dizziness. She wondered if it might have anything to do with her ongoing health issues — they both had high blood pressure and diabetes — although she couldn't say for sure.\n\n\"It was not clear,\" Gilles says. \"There was nothing really clear about it.\"\n\nAdditionally, they both mentioned having a bit of a \"stomach problem,\" but didn't think they'd eaten any food that upset them.\n\nMostly, they were \"very tired and exhausted,\" but otherwise fine during the call, according to Gilles.\n\n\"Alain showed me his house outside because he did some new little garden things and put lights on and,\" he says, adding that his sister was also \"looking and talking\" well.\n\nThe next morning, when Jonathan woke up around 9:30 a.m., he noticed his parents hadn’t gotten up yet, which was odd because Alain, who worked in the family construction business, was usually an early riser.\n\nGilles says Jonathan brushed it off at the time, thinking they'd slept in because they'd been so tired the night before. However, when they still hadn't woken up an hour later, he went into their room and found them unresponsive in bed.\n\nThe first thing that Jonathan did, says Gilles, was call his sister Sabrina and tell her that their parents were not breathing. Sabrina then told her brother to call the resort manager-owner, who proceeded to contact local authorities.\n\n“Everybody came and they did what they had to do and they searched the house,” Gilles says.\n\nGilles and Sabrina arrived in the Dominican Republic about a day and a half later to be with Jonathan and help communicate with Dominican authorities, which have been difficult due to the language barrier.\n\nCanadian officials reached out to the family four days later to give them the phone number of the funeral home, which they'd already reached out to.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada previously confirmed their deaths to Global News, saying they were in contact with local authorities \"to gather more information\" amid the ongoing investigation, but were not able to release any further information due to privacy considerations.\n\nNeither the Dominican National Police, the National Institute of Forensic Sciences, the Attorney General’s Office in the Dominican Republic nor Global Affairs Canada responded to PEOPLE's request for additional comment.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nMore than a week after the tragedy, Gilles says the family is doing okay, but the deaths of their loved ones have been hard to process.\n\n“It's a big loss,\" he says, noting that losing them both at the same time has made everything harder, especially for their kids.\n\nAs for how he wants Alain and Christine to be remembered, her brother says it's for their legacy of kindness.\n\nSharing an example, Gilles says that when his wife died a year and a half ago from leukemia, his sister stepped up to help take care of his daughter, who also works in the family business. Now, in the wake of his sister's death, he says he'll do whatever he can to be there for her kids.\n\nGilles adds, \"I have two kids, but now I have four kids because I will take care of theirs.”",

    "fullText": "Almost 1,000 flights to and from the Caribbean were canceled on Saturday after the US raid on Venezuela.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration banned commercial aircraft from flying over Venezuelan airspace before expanding restrictions to much of the Caribbean.\n\nPuerto Rico was the most affected, with 400 flights canceled to or from the main airport in San Juan.\n\nThere were also over 140 cancellations in the US Virgin Islands, and 91 in Aruba, which is only about 20 miles off the Venezuelan coast.\n\nUsing data from FlightAware, Business Insider put together this map to show the scale of the disruption. You can hover over an icon to see the number of cancellations at the airport.\n\nAfter airspace restrictions ended early Sunday, airlines added dozens of extra flights to help passengers get where they needed to go.\n\nThe region is a particularly popular destination for vacationers seeking some winter sun over the New Year holiday.\n\nAmerican Airlines added 43 extra flights on Sunday and Monday, with room for 7,000 passengers.\n\nFor the first time in over a decade, it operated interisland flights in the eastern Caribbean on Monday. Namely, to Puerto Rico from Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands.\n\nAmerican's expanded schedule included deploying a Boeing 777-300, the largest model in its fleet, to ferry passengers between Miami and Puerto Rico.\n\nUnited Airlines listed 17 additional flights scheduled for Sunday and Monday, to and from its hubs in Houston, Newark, and Washington, DC.\n\nDelta Air Lines said that it has added space for 2,600 people on Monday. It didn't immediately provide details of the extra flights it has scheduled.\n\nA spokesperson for Southwest Airlines told Business Insider that it has added 21 round-trip flights to Aruba and Puerto Rico between Sunday and Wednesday.\n\nAirlines have waived change fees and fare differences for passengers flying to or from the Caribbean, to rebook for flights later in the month.\n\nHave you been affected by the travel disruption in the Caribbean?

    "description": "Two years ago, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Though it comes with challenges, I won't let it stop me from doing what I love, including travel.",
    "fullText": "It was a bright, sunny day in Tepoztlán, Mexico, when my friends and I trekked to an ancient Aztec temple at the top of Tepozteco Mountain.\n\nBut by the time I made it to the summit, I was greeted with bad news: The ruins were closing in five minutes.\n\nI was too angry to appreciate the splendor around me; the valley spread out below me like a picture book.\n\nIn the photo my friend snapped, I'm frowning like a petulant teenager on the verge of a tantrum. It wasn't my finest moment, to say the least.\n\nTwo years before, that roughly 1.5-mile climb would've been a piece of cake for an experienced hiker like me. But that all changed when I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 39.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. With little or no insulin, the body can struggle to use glucose for energy.\n\nAfter my doctor gave me the news, I was forced to come to terms with a bewildering new reality: injecting insulin multiple times a day, obsessively monitoring my blood sugar, and calculating carb ratios before every meal.\n\nIf I didn't learn how to mimic the work of a human pancreas, there was a chance I could go blind, lose limbs, fall into a coma, or die.\n\nThe disease also came with constant exhaustion, alarming medical costs, and a crippling fear of exercise — I risk a sugar crash if I so much as walk my dog around the block with too much insulin in my system.\n\nI felt like I had been broken into a thousand pieces and had to rebuild my identity from the ground up. But I was determined to rediscover the parts of myself that type 1 diabetes had ripped away, particularly my love of travel and spontaneous adventure.\n\nSo, when my friends proposed a trip to Mexico last December, I jumped at the chance to take my first trip abroad since my diagnosis.\n\nAfter our first day in Mexico City, it became painfully clear that, even if I was on vacation, my disease wasn't.\n\nA simple afternoon of strolling through the city, visiting a museum, and eating unfamiliar snacks sent my glucose on a roller coaster of highs and lows. By the time we got back to our Airbnb, I was so exhausted that instead of staying up late to check out the local bars as I usually would, I collapsed into bed before sunset.\n\nThe day we headed to Tepozteco, I was determined to do a better job of managing my blood sugar. But even with plenty of carbs and protein in my system, my glucose started to plummet after only a few minutes, which meant I had to stop multiple times along the trail to rest and eat carb-heavy snacks.\n\nIt wasn't all bad, though. At a bend in the path, I came across a man selling paletas (fruit popsicles) from a cooler.\n\nAs I sat beside him and looked up at the canopy of trees, sweet strawberry melting in my mouth, I told myself that taking this moment to recharge didn't mean I was weak.\n\nBut when I stood on that temple in the fading afternoon light, I sure felt like I was.\n\nI have to laugh at that picture of me atop Tepozteco now. That grimacing woman, with hunched shoulders and tears of anger streaming under her sunglasses, wasn't able to appreciate that she'd accomplished something remarkable.\n\nIf I could talk to her, I'd tell her to quit beating herself up and take in the splendor around her. I'd tell her that, although her body can never be what it was before, even a chronic disease can't take away the love she has for the world.\n\nI've learned that you never fall into a rhythm with type 1 diabetes. There are dozens of factors that can affect your blood sugar on any given day, from stress to hot weather to hormones, which means your insulin needs are constantly changing.\n\nBut things have started to get a little better. A few months ago, I made the switch from injection pens to a pump, which has taken a lot of the guesswork out of managing my diabetes.\n\nI even put it to the test this June on a hike up Balsam Lake Mountain in the Catskills. And guess what? Thanks to a hearty breakfast, the miracles of medical technology, and a little patience, I didn't crash once.\n\nAt the summit, I took a selfie from the top of a century-old fire tower. It may not have been an ancient ruin 2,000 miles from home, but that isn't the point. What matters is that the woman in that photo is smiling.",

    "description": "McLaren driver Oscar Piastri has revealed he, George Russell and Alex Albon held an “UNO\" World Championship during travel days",
    "fullText": "McLaren driver Oscar Piastri has revealed that he, George Russell and Alex Albon held an \"UNO World Championship\" that took place during travel days between some of the races of the 2025 Formula 1 season. Admitting there were \"questionable rules\" between the trio, he opened up on what he did during his downtime.\n\nTalking on F1's Off The Grid with presenter Lawrence Barretto, the Australian explained that a long-haul flight between races turned from an impromptu game of UNO into something larger.\n\n“You're just chatting, you're sleeping. What’s going on?” Barretto asked about the travel time between races when drivers share flights.\n\n“Myself, George Russell and Alex Albon had an UNO World Championship on the way from Baku to Singapore last year,” Piastri laughed. “There was some questionable rule decisions, and rules that I’d never heard of playing UNO before from some of the others, mainly George.\n\n\"Apparently, they were family rules.\"\n\nBarretto asked whether these rules from the Mercedes driver tipped the scales in his favour.\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" he smiled. \"We’re always competitive at everything, all the drivers. It’s always good fun.”\n\nHis competitiveness predates his career in motorsport. Like many, including seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, he started with RC racing.\n\n\"Been a competitive person since I was really little,\" he said. \"But channelling that into racing and motorsport...Yeah, started with RC cars, won a national championship at nine and then started racing go-karts a year later.\"\n\nPiastri, like a lot of drivers, lives in Monaco.\n\n\"It's convenient when you want to go and play padel or do other things,\" he said on the subject. \"Also makes travelling to the races convenient. Like I'm sure most people have seen, we often travel to races together and stuff on those plane journeys.\"\n\nHe added: “It's pretty cool to come here when the races are done. It's a bit more relaxed when there's no racing.”\n\nAfter a strong start to his career in F1 and a championship contender for 2025, he has suddenly exploded in popularity - something he's still getting to grips with.\n\n“It is still a little bit strange,” he said. “Obviously at the track you expect the attention, but there has been times where you go in the supermarket or whatever, out of nowhere, someone's asking for a photo or an autograph or whatever, or even just asking, 'is that really you?'”\n\nPiastri will be hoping to continue the momentum he's found in his first three seasons into 2026.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "A group of about 20 US investors is already planning to travel to Venezuela in March, following Saturday's news that the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, had been taken into US custody.\n\nCharles Myers, the chairman of the political risk advisory firm Signum Global Advisors and a former vice-chairman of the investment advisory firm Evercore, told Business Insider that the mood among investors he has spoken to is one of \"cautious optimism\" following news of Maduro's ouster.\n\n\"I think the centerpiece of Venezuela's success, looking out 12 months or even 24 months, is foreign investment,\" Myers said. \"A big part of the Venezuela story, starting today, is foreign investment, especially in oil and gas, which is pretty straightforward, but there are massive opportunities in construction, in tourism.\"\n\nMyers said it's not the responsibility of his firm to take a \"moral position\" on whether it was right or wrong for the US to involve itself in Venezuela's government, but rather to help the firm's clients anticipate investment opportunities or mitigate risk due to geopolitical events.\n\nHowever, he added, his firm \"very much expected\" the situation in Venezuela would unfold as it has, and has been preparing investor groups to be ready to travel to the country when the opportunity presents itself. Signum previously hosted similar trips for asset managers and hedge funds to visit Syria and Ukraine.\n\n\"People have seen this coming, especially very smart investors, and many of them have actually bought bonds in anticipation of this,\" Myers said. \"But there's a very strong degree of cautious optimism, even more so than we saw with Syria, just because this is a United States-directed action.\"\n\n\"The United States will play a pivotal role in everything, especially the Venezuelan economy, starting today,\" Myers added, \"So, I think the reaction has been more enthusiastic than perhaps other situations like this.\"",

    "title": "Thousands of travelers stranded as US strikes on Venezuela push airlines out of Caribbean airspace",
    "description": "From outbound vacationers to students returning for the new semester, the US raid on Venezuela disrupted travel across the region.",
    "fullText": "The US raid on Venezuela that netted President Nicólas Maduro and his wife on Saturday has sent surprised travelers into a mild tailspin.\n\nFlightradar24 data shows Venezuela's airspace is empty following the strikes. While US airlines haven't flown there for years, the Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday formally barred operations in Venezuelan airspace, essentially codifying an already de facto no-fly zone.\n\nBut the impact extends beyond Venezuela.\n\nAirlines are also avoiding nearby southern Caribbean airspace due to heightened security risks. Delta, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines said they canceled flights to the Caribbean on Saturday morning following the US strike on Venezuela.\n\nThe cancellations have inconvenienced many travelers, particularly students returning for the start of the new semester.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm doing right now,\" Catalina Rodriguez, a veterinary student at Ross University School of Medicine in St. Kitts and Nevis, said in a video she posted to TikTok. \"One of my flights is good, my other flight is delayed, am I supposed to change my trip?\"\n\nRodriguez, 34, later told Business Insider in a call that she is supposed to start her third semester of veterinary school on Monday. She is scheduled to fly on American Airlines at noon on Sunday, but her flight is now delayed. She said she's also been in touch with several classmates who are stuck in airports due to cancellations and delays.\n\n\"We're just waiting to see what's going to happen,\" she said. \"It's a little stressful for sure.\"\n\nAnother student, who goes by \"dani la doctorcita\" on TikTok, said in a video that her Delta flight to St. Kitts was canceled. \"All US flights have been canceled,\" she said. \"Delta won't fly even from Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that aviation risk-intelligence firm Osprey Flight Solutions — a widely used industry service that tracks safety and security hazards for airlines — recently upgraded its risk assessment for the Southern Caribbean Sea from \"moderate\" to \"high\" amid escalating tensions.\n\nThat higher-risk zone includes places like Puerto Rico, Aruba, Curaçao, the British and US Virgin Islands, Antigua & Barbuda, Saint Thomas, Grenada, Barbados, and parts of Trinidad & Tobago and Guyana. Mass disruptions to and from these destinations have left thousands stranded as airlines reassess safety risks and insurance exposure.\n\nStranded travelers have few options to depart Caribbean nations — and little help from airlines while they wait.\n\nBecause the disruptions stem from government action outside the airlines' control, carriers do not legally owe passengers compensation. That means meals, hotels, and ground transportation are not required under federal law, though airlines may offer assistance as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nOne X user who goes by Nate_F_Thurmond posted a photo of a group of stranded travelers in St. John.\n\n\"Passengers stranded in St John just learning that Caribbean Airspace is closed,\" they wrote. \"American, JetBlue, and Delta canceled flights. People are scrambling to find places to stay. Being told 3-5 days by the airlines. All this because of Venezuela??\"\n\nIn most cases, the only guaranteed option is rebooking, and travelers may struggle to find alternative accommodations while waiting for the next available flight.\n\nSome flights are still operating, but they are taking significant detours to avoid the region. American Airlines Flight 1512 from Georgetown, Guyana, to Miami on Saturday, for example, ditched its usual route east of Venezuela through the southern Caribbean and instead flew west around the area, adding roughly an hour of flight time.\n\nFor travelers who want to cancel or postpone their Caribbean holidays, most airlines — including Delta, United, American, Southwest, and JetBlue — are waiving change and cancellation fees as the situation continues. Some western Caribbean countries, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, are not included on waiver lists.\n\nUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Saturday afternoon that the FAA will lift airspace restrictions over the Caribbean and Venezuela \"when appropriate.\" His update came about 15 hours after the FAA issued an emergency notice in the region.\n\n\"Early this morning in support of the Department of War, the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public,\" Duffy wrote on X. \"When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted. Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.\"",

    "description": "The ultrawealthy are trading in some traditional markers of luxury travel in favor of privacy and seclusion.",
    "fullText": "Classic markers of luxury travel, like five-star hotels and hard-to-get dinner reservations, are no longer enough for some ultrawealthy travelers. Instead, they're increasingly seeking a subtler status symbol: privacy.\n\n\"The privacy factor is higher than it's ever been. In fact, we have some clients who are 'no more hotels,'\" Rob DelliBovi, a luxury travel planner whose clients include celebrities and high-net-worth individuals, said. \"Even the five-star hotel experience is too crowded.\"\n\nAs international travel has grown and destinations have become increasingly crowded, luxury travel planners say their clients' top priority is to get away from everyone else.\n\nThe ultrawealthy are increasingly skipping luxury hotels and turning instead to private villas, private jets, and private chefs. A trend report from Capital One Travel last month found that 86% of luxury travelers said privacy and seclusion were top considerations when choosing where to stay, and 83% said exclusivity of access.\n\n\"The true value of luxury lies in the guarantee of an exclusive experience that cannot be accessed by the general public,\" the report said.\n\nDelliBovi said this kind of travel was always popular with his celebrity clients, \"who have a problem being seen literally anywhere.\" However, since the pandemic, and especially as we head into 2026, demand has skyrocketed among his high-net-worth clients.\n\n\"Now it's some more of our investment banker types,\" he said. \"People who would rent out a penthouse at a Four Seasons are like, 'What are my private home options?' Because even walking through the Four Seasons now can be a bit of a to-do.\"\n\nSeeking out private homes and villas that meet ultrawealthy standards can be challenging. DelliBovi said his team works with international real estate experts and luxury services networks to find properties that aren't actually listed for rent.\n\n\"We have to literally source these private homes and villas from locals. We have to know somebody in-market who's in the know,\" he said, adding they are renting from owners who don't normally lease their home or apartment. When his team calls and offers $50,000 for a week, he says owners often accept.\n\nThose homes then need to be outfitted with hotel-level services and more, including daily cleaning, Michelin-trained private chefs, high-end security, and accommodations for pets. After booking the home, DelliBovi's team will set all that up separately.\n\nFor the Super Bowl last year, he said one client spent a total of around $1.35 million on a house in New Orleans for six days. The home itself cost roughly $1 million, with the rest going toward the planning fee and services.\n\nThe inaccessibility of these homes is part of their appeal. DelliBovi said that some luxury hotels feel less exclusive because they're part of large brands with loyalty programs, allowing less wealthy travelers to stay there by accumulating points.\n\n\"That mix kind of irks some people,\" he said, adding it can feel like a less luxurious experience even if the hotel itself is great.\n\nWhen his clients do opt for hotels, DelliBovi said they prioritize properties built for discretion, like the Hotel Café Royal in London or the Rosewood Villa Magna in Madrid, which has an underground garage with an elevator that takes guests directly to their suites, bypassing public spaces altogether.\n\n\"That type of thing is priceless,\" he said.\n\nNon-disclosure agreements are a standard part of travel for the ultrawealthy, whether they're staying at private homes or luxury hotels. Daria Guristrimba, founder and CEO of Globe7, an ultra-luxury travel agency, said confidentiality isn't a preference but a baseline expectation.\n\n\"The more private it is, the better,\" she said.\n\nGuristrimba said NDAs are often signed at every stage of a trip, including with staff, vendors, and hotels. Her firm even avoids storing clients' names in internal systems, instead using coded identifiers, and sometimes handling payments to hotels or other services on behalf of clients so their travel doesn't leave a financial paper trail.\n\nShe said she routinely asks hotels not to keep any record of her clients, including deleting their information from internal systems. If a hotel requires a client's last name to confirm a booking and the client doesn't want it disclosed, they simply won't stay there.\n\nBecause of the high demand for privacy, Guristrimba said more and more of her clients are choosing fully private islands, where they can ensure there will be no other members of the public — beyond employees who have signed NDAs.\n\nThanda Island in Tanzania, which can be rented by a single group, accommodates 18 guests who are exclusively served by about 35 employees. Meals are served in different locations around the island, and no outside guests are allowed. The cost is about $33,000 per night, and Guristrimba said she's had clients rent out the entire island just as a couple.\n\nTraditional upscale aesthetics and locales are now taking a back seat to the top priority of privacy and not being seen.\n\n\"It's not about marbles anymore. It's not about the Loro Piana textile walls anymore,\" she said, adding, \"They don't want anyone to know where they are going or what they are doing.\"",

    "description": "An equipment outage and flooded roadways led to significant travel disruption at San Diego Airport, affecting over 300 flights.",
    "fullText": "Thousands of people flying into or out of San Diego on New Year's Day had their travel plans disrupted after a rainstorm hit the city.\n\nData from Flightradar24 showed 40 flights headed for San Diego International Airport decided to land elsewhere on January 1.\n\nThere were enough diversions that air traffic control activated a recovery tool to help planes reach their intended destinations.\n\nAnother 53 flights into or out of the airport were canceled, plus nearly 270 were delayed, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThat meant around 40% of the flights were behind schedule.\n\nA spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration told Business Insider it slowed inbound flights \"due to poor visibility and weather conditions,\" and to perform maintenance on an instrument landing system's glide slope.\n\nA glide slope emits a radio signal that helps planes approach a runway from the correct angle and location, which is particularly useful in bad weather or at night.\n\nAn air traffic control advisory also said the disruption was due to an\"equipment outage.\"\n\nIn a post on X, the airport said the weather was causing flight delays, with some nearby roads closed due to flooding. The airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside local working hours.\n\nSan Diego is the third-busiest airport in California. It reported handling over 25 million passengers in 2024.\n\nWhile many of the diverted flights eventually made it to San Diego, it was likely a frustrating day for many travellers.\n\nJapan Airlines Flight 66 had flown about 10 hours from Tokyo to San Diego. After circling around the airport, it diverted to Los Angeles, a 30-minute flight away.\n\nJust over two hours later, the Boeing 787 took off again and completed the short flight down to San Diego.\n\nThe airline didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome Southwest Airlines passengers departing Sacramento had a two-hour flight to nowhere. Flight 3138 spent an hour circling north of Los Angeles before returning to its origin, per flight-tracking data. It later took off again and reached San Diego about five hours behind schedule.\n\nWhile most flights were able to divert elsewhere in California, around a dozen of them diverted to Phoenix.\n\nA Southwest flight from Baltimore spent about an hour circling just west of the Arizona state capital before touching down there.\n\nIt was on the ground for over three hours before continuing on to San Diego, landing roughly five hours later than planned.\n\nA Southwest spokesperson said the airline canceled about 20 flights and diverted some others that later arrived in San Diego.\n\n\"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,\" they added.\n\nTwo private jets, flying from Colorado ski resorts, didn't have to divert too far — they were the only ones able to land at McClellan-Palomar Airport in northern San Diego County, per Flightradar24.",

    "description": "The ultrawealthy are ditching the crowds in places like Florence and Mykonos and visiting these three alternative destinations instead.",
    "fullText": "Even the ultrawealthy aren't immune to the frustrations of overtourism.\n\nAs international tourism grows, many popular luxury destinations once associated with wealth and exclusivity are now packed with large crowds, long lines, and constant noise.\n\nRob DelliBovi, a luxury travel planner whose clients include celebrities and high-net-worth individuals, told Business Insider many of his clients feel crowded out of places that used to feel special. He said there's a \"continuing trend of our clients believing everything is too crowded and they need their own space.\"\n\nAs a result, wealthy travelers are deliberately seeking out destinations that others tend to overlook, or that don't yet have the infrastructure to accommodate swaths of more budget-minded travelers.\n\n\"They want to have their cake and eat it too, in terms of going to the popular places at the popular times, but enjoying peace and quiet and their own kind of experience,\" DelliBovi said.\n\nInstead of abandoning travel to dreamy but popular destinations like Italy and Japan, Dellibovi said his clients are ditching the hottest spots and gravitating toward quieter, alternative cities in countries that are grappling with overtourism.\n\n\"These secondary markets are building infrastructure to accommodate the wealthy and the cool and the rich and the famous,\" he said.\n\nHere are three secondary destinations that luxury travelers are visiting to avoid the crowds.\n\nItaly is one of the most strained countries in the world when it comes to overtourism, with cities like Venice, Rome, and Florence experiencing record numbers of tourists and mounting protests from locals.\n\n\"Italy is a disaster right now\" in terms of crowds, Dellibovi said, adding that ultrawealthy travelers who \"still want to go to Italy and eat like Italy\" are skipping Rome and Florence and heading to Puglia instead.\n\nPuglia, located in the southeastern region of Italy, is known for its whitewashed towns and clear Mediterranean coastlines, and countryside estates, making it an appealing choice for luxury travelers seeking private villas and quieter travel.\n\nWhile Puglia is also experiencing a tourism boom, it's not yet as crowded as some of the better-known travel destinations in Italy.\n\nGreece is also facing issues associated with overtourism and protests, with popular hot spots, like Mykonos and Santorini, often overwhelmed by summer crowds and cruise ships.\n\nDelliBovi said many of his clients are skipping those islands entirely. \"People are going to Paros in Greece as opposed to Mykonos or Santorini,\" he said.\n\nParos, another Greek island in the Aegean Sea, has become an attractive alternative for wealthy travelers because it combines beaches, picturesque villages, and nightlife, but without the crush of people. \"There's not 10,000 people at every restaurant. There's not 5,000 people at every beach club,\" Dellibovi said.\n\nTourism on Paros has increased steadily over the past decade, especially with luxury travelers, but it remains less developed and less chaotic than its more famous neighboring islands.\n\nJapan's status as one of the hottest destinations in tourism has also brought issues, especially in cities like Tokyo and Kyoto, where locals have protested tourism levels that they say are unsustainable.\n\nDellibovi said his clients are increasingly asking for alternatives. \"People are like, 'Okay, we want to go to Kyoto. What other places in Japan are cool, that are high-end, that have this infrastructure for us, but are not like we're going to get run over by a mob of people?'\"\n\nKanazawa, located on the opposite coast of Tokyo, is increasingly appealing to high-net-worth travelers who are looking for a similar cultural experience but with more privacy. The city has been called \"Little Kyoto,\" and is known for its art, dining scene, historic districts, and nature.\n\nTourism to regional destinations like Kanazawa is also growing as the Japanese government has encouraged visitors to explore beyond the country's most popular destinations.",

    "description": "We ranked Emily Henry's romance novels, including \"Beach Read,\" \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" and \"People We Meet on Vacation.\"",
    "fullText": "Any romance reader knows that not all romance novels are created equally: Some leave you swooning, others leave you shrugging, and the worst ones leave you shutting the book and never picking it back up.\n\nEmily Henry, a fantasy-YA author turned romance queen, is easily one of the most beloved romance novelists of the last five years. All six of her romances caused quite a stir on BookTok, and all but one have been optioned for on-screen adaptations.\n\nBut are they all five-star classics? No.\n\nWe've ranked Henry's six adult romances from worst to best — though, if we're being honest, we'd read Henry's grocery list if we could.\n\nUnfortunately, this is Henry's weakest offering — at least, in my opinion. The beauty of Henry's novels is that every permutation of a ranking exists out there. There are some readers whose very favorite is \"Happy Place.\"\n\n\"Happy Place\" marked a shift from her previous three books, focusing on a group of friends rather than a single main relationship. However, I don't think the friend group was given enough time or fleshed out fully for me to care.\n\nInstead, I felt that too much time was taken away from our core couple, Harriet and Wyn, for me to get invested in them, yet somehow not enough time was given to Sabrina and Cleo, or their partners, Kim and Parth.\n\nAlso, I love a ridiculous romance premise as much as the next person — you'll be hearing about five more of them — but neglecting to tell your group of friends that you've gotten divorced and then pretending to still be together on a group trip stretches my credulity just a tad too far.\n\nPerhaps I'll like it better when it's adapted as a Netflix series.\n\nTo speak in internet parlance, when I read \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" all I could think was that it was reheating \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo's\" nachos, but with a dash of Henry flair.\n\nThe book is a dual narrative, split between would-be author Alice Scott and her dreams to write the biography of a reclusive heiress, Margaret Ives, and Margaret's own life story, told through flashbacks.\n\nI greatly preferred the flashbacks of Margaret's life and her relationships with her sister and husband. The contemporary story of Alice competing with another journalist, Hayden, for the chance to write Margaret's story, was less compelling. I also thought that Alice and Hayden's chemistry was a bit forced and a bit \"insta-lovey\" for my taste.\n\nThe book also purports to have a twist ending, but I found it fairly easy to predict after a few chapters.\n\n\"People We Meet on Vacation\" is Henry's most popular book, the one that catapulted her to the top of BookTok, and is also the first to make the jump from page to screen; the movie adaptation hits Netflix in January, starring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth.\n\nPerhaps it's because this book was so hyped up to me before I read it, but I found it to be just fine. I liked the premise — two former best friends and travel buddies meeting up for the first time after a mysterious trip gone wrong — but I didn't really connect to either Poppy or Alex as characters.\n\nI thought their banter was great, though, which is a throughline of all of Henry's books.\n\nI would never call this book bad; it just wasn't one of my favorites.\n\nHere's where it gets hard for me to choose. I love the top three deeply, but, alas, something has to come in third.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is about Nora Stephens, a cutthroat literary agent who describes herself as the mean girlfriend in a Hallmark movie who gets left behind in the big city when her boyfriend returns to his small town and falls in love with the local [insert whimsical job title here]. Already, I was obsessed.\n\nBut when she's convinced by her sister, Libby, to visit a small town herself, she encounters one of her nemeses from NYC: Charlie Lastra, an editor she can't stand.\n\nYou can guess what happens then.\n\nI adored Nora and Charlie's relationship, as well as Nora's relationship with Libby. I also found Henry's descriptions of Sunshine Falls to be evocative, funny, and full of love and care.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is set to be adapted into a film in the future, so I can't wait to see who will bring these characters to life.\n\nIf you thought I loved Nora and Charlie, just wait until you hear about Daphne and Miles.\n\nRemember when I dinged \"Happy Place\" for having a ridiculous premise? \"Funny Story\" also uses a ridiculous trope, but a fun one that I enjoyed reading about, rather than questioning why our two main characters chose to lie to all their friends.\n\n\"Funny Story\" is a classic romance story: Daphne and Miles have both been dumped by their respective significant others, best friends Peter and Petra, after, wouldn't you guess, Peter and Petra decided that they were in love with each other instead.\n\nHomeless and heartbroken, Daphne and Miles decide to move in together — and in an act of desperation, decide to fake date in order to make their exes jealous.\n\nAs I wrote in my Goodreads review for this book, 'There's something about the way Emily Henry writes flirting that scratches my brain.\" Daphne and Miles' banter is (almost) unmatched.\n\nI relate to Daphne, her insecurities, her interests, and her flaws, the most out of all of Henry's main characters. I also just love Miles. He's the sweetest.\n\n\"Funny Story\" has also been optioned to become a movie, with Henry herself writing the screenplay, which makes me very excited.",

    "fullText": "After President Donald Trump expanded the travel ban he put in place during his first term in the White House to 20 more countries and the Palestinian Authority last December, at least three other nations responded in turn with visa bans for Americans.\n\nOn Dec. 26, the West African nation of Niger announced that it was \"completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States.\"\n\nAfter it was included in the list of countries whose citizens are completely banned from entering the U.S. last June, the government of Chad similarly announced that it was acting upon \"principles of reciprocity and suspend[ing] the granting of visas to citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nAs of January 2026, 39 countries now face either a full travel ban or restrictions on various types of visas for entering the United States.\n\nThe latest country to respond is the West African nation of Burkina Faso. A landlocked nation sharing borders with six other countries, Burkina Faso announced that it had put in place \"equivalent visa measures to citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nWhile this currently means a full ban on visas necessary to enter the country, Burkina Faso said it \"remains committed to mutual respect, the sovereign equality of States, and the principle of reciprocity in its international relations.\"\n\nDue to a decades-old history of war coupled with political violence, Western travel into Burkina Faso remains very low; the U.S. State Department currently keeps it at a level four \"do not travel\" advisory over \"organizations [that] continue to plan and conduct terrorist activities.\"\n\nThe latter, along with a high visa overstay rate, were named by the Trump administration as the primary justification for being placed on the travel ban.\n\nSharing a southwestern border with Burkina Faso, Mali has also put in place a reciprocal ban on American travel.\n\nThe country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation released a statement saying that any U.S. citizens will now also be subject to \"the same conditions and requirements as those imposed by the American authorities on Malian citizens entering the United States.\"\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "title": "What it's like visiting the island of St. Barts — a beloved party spot for billionaires and their superyachts",
    "description": "St. Barthelemy, or St. Barts, is a French-speaking Caribbean island with beaches and high-end shops where billionaires like Jeff Bezos vacation.",
    "fullText": "Located in the French West Indies, the small island runs about 11 miles long and 2.5 miles wide.\n\nIt's typically warm and sunny most of the year, with temperatures often in the 70s, 80s, or low 90s, and peak tourist season starts in late fall and lasts through the spring.\n\nAs a French territory, the official language of St. Barts is French, though English is also widely spoken.\n\nThe exclusive-feeling island is home to more than a dozen beaches, where visitors can soak up the sun on smooth, sandy shores and in crystal-clear water.\n\n\"I always say if you want to have your toes in the sand and eat a croissant that feels like you're in Paris, St. Barts is the place for you,\" Elisabeth Brown, the membership director at the luxury concierge service Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider's Madeline Berg.\n\nSurrounded by shallow coral reefs, St. Barts has some top-tier snorkeling spots, such as Grand Cul-de-Sac — home to sea turtles and a range of tropical fish.\n\nLocal natural sights also include mountains and hills formed from volcanic eruptions. That said, there are no active volcanoes on St. Barts.\n\nJeff Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez Bezos, were photographed in St. Barts this week — and the Amazon founder has been spotted in St. Barts on multiple occasions over the years.\n\nNo matter the time of year, though, the island regularly welcomes the wealthy.\n\nCelebrities like Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, and Leonardo DiCaprio have visited in the past, and influential banking families, like the Rothschilds, have famously purchased property there.\n\nIn addition to Bezos' vessel, massive yachts owned by Playrix founder Dmitry Bukhman, Dallas Mavericks owner Miriam Adelson, and entertainment mogul David Geffen also parked in St. Barts during the recent holiday.\n\nWhile the yachts are primarily used for transportation to the island, they're also attractions in and of themselves, featuring amenities such as jacuzzis and movie theaters.\n\nTravelers without private yachts can still reach the island by flying into an airport on a larger Caribbean island, like San Juan. From there, they could take a ferry or private boat to St Barts.\n\nVisitors have several options for accommodations, ranging from villa rentals starting at over $900 a night to luxurious hotels for an even higher price.\n\nThe Eden Rock hotel is just one example. It overlooks St. Jean Bay — home to one of the most popular beaches on St. Barts — and is home to fine-dining restaurants and holistic spas.\n\nDuring holiday seasons like New Year's, a single-night stay at its largest villa can cost upward of €13,000, or about $15,200.\n\nThere's also the Rosewood Le Guanahani resort, located on a private peninsula that's home to two secluded beaches, giving travelers the ultimate getaway far from crowds.\n\nSuch privacy comes at a price, as even its most basic room can run guests thousands of dollars a night.\n\nWith billionaire travelers always on-site, the island's retail scene largely caters to shoppers who can drop thousands at any given moment.\n\nSome of the designer brands that have boutiques on St. Barts include Hermès, Cartier, Dior, and Louis Vuitton.\n\nThe island's also home to luxury retailers like Patek Phillipe, which sells one-of-a-kind timepieces you can't find anywhere else. Some retail for five, six, and even seven figures.\n\nA trip to St. Barts isn't all about relaxation, though. There are plenty of places to party and experience live music.\n\nOne of the most popular spots for this on the island is Nikki Beach, an upscale restaurant and beach club. In past years, big-name musicians like Kygo and Mariah Carey have even performed at its New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nIt's also a go-to for people looking to relax poolside with a drink in hand — though keep in mind that even just renting a lounge chair may cost you over $100.",

    "description": "Can you live well on $100,000 per year in retirement? ChatGPT mapped out the complete budget including travel, healthcare and housing. Here's the reality.",
    "fullText": "Most retirement budgets assume you’re pinching pennies. But what if you saved well and want to actually enjoy retirement? I asked ChatGPT to map out a $100,000-per-year retirement budget for someone who wants comfort without being wasteful. The artificial intelligence’s breakdown was thorough and felt fairly realistic.\n\nThe chatbot designed a monthly spending plan, calculated how much you’d need saved and identified the best places to live on this income level. According to ChatGPT, here’s what a six-figure retirement actually looks like.\n\nChatGPT started by clarifying that $100,000 annually puts you well above average retirees. This budget supports quality healthcare, regular travel, a nice home in a desirable area and room for unexpected expenses. You’re not living extravagantly, but you’re comfortable.\n\nThe AI wrote that this lifestyle requires either strong savings or a combination of savings plus Social Security and possibly a pension.\n\nFind Out: How Much the Average Upper-Class Retiree Spends Monthly at Age 69\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nOne hundred thousand dollars per year equals about $8,333 monthly. ChatGPT broke this down into realistic categories.\n\nHousing costs $2,500 to $3,500 per month. This covers either a nice rental in a high-demand city or a mortgage-free home where you only pay property taxes, insurance and HOA fees. The chatbot gave specific examples: Austin, Texas, runs about $3,200 monthly; Phoenix around $2,600; and Tampa, Florida around $2,400. San Diego pushes toward $3,500 or more.\n\nFood and dining take $1,200 to $1,800 monthly. ChatGPT explained this includes high-quality groceries from stores like Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s plus eating out two to four times weekly. The budget also covers occasional hosting and holiday meals.\n\nTransportation costs $600 to $900 per month. The AI assumed you might have a car payment along with insurance, gas and maintenance. If you live in a walkable city without a car, this drops to $200 to $300 monthly.\n\nHealthcare and insurance run $800 to $1,500 depending on your age and state. ChatGPT broke this down as Medicare Parts B and D, supplemental Medigap or Advantage plans, dental and vision coverage, prescription medications and any specialist visits. The AI warned that people under 65 should budget toward the higher end.\n\nUtilities cost $300 to $500 monthly for electricity, water, gas, trash, internet and streaming subscriptions.\n\nTravel gets a significant chunk at $10,000 to $15,000 annually, which equals $850 to $1,250 monthly. ChatGPT explained this covers one to two major international trips plus domestic getaways, hotels and dining abroad. The AI wrote that travel makes a huge difference in retirement satisfaction.",

    "description": "After Joe Biden was called out on Fox News for going on a holiday vacation, many on social media rallied around the former president.",
    "fullText": "After Joe Biden was called out on Fox News for going on a holiday vacation, many on social media rallied around the former president and slammed host Tomi Lahren for mocking the retired politician.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s broadcast of “Hannity,” Lahren openly mocked Biden for his end-of-year trip, noting, “And you’ll never believe where Joe Biden was spotted. Spoiler alert: He’s on vacation.”\n\nThis moment was clipped and shared on X Tuesday evening — and swiftly went viral, gaining 4 million views in less than 24 hours. Many were confused by Lahren’s dig, given Biden is not currently president and has withdrawn significantly from public life amid his cancer battle.\n\nOne critic responded on X, “quick question @TomiLahren what year do you think it is?” Another chimed in with, “Spoiler alert: he’s not president.” A third added, “Retired man goes on vacation. Hardly a scandal.”\n\nA fourth expressed a more biting sentiment, noting, “I’m pretty sure they call that retirement, you dumb hack.”\n\nAnother X user called out conservatives for giving Biden a hard time for doing exactly what they asked him to do: “Sleepy Joe Biden needs to retire so we can pile on to make fun of him for not working anymore.”\n\nThe irony of Lahren’s comments weren’t lost on other social media users, who pointed out that the conservative commentator was covering for Sean Hannity — who was reportedly absent for being on vacation. Watch the viral moment below.\n\nLahren: And you will never believe where Joe Biden was spotted. Spoiler alert. He's on vacation pic.twitter.com/C4RSpWi7St\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) December 31, 2025\n\nBiden notably exited the 2024 presidential race after concerns surfaced following his performance during a June 2024 debate against Donald Trump.\n\n“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden said in a letter confirming his withdrawal from the race. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”\n\nBiden’s Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in and ran in his place, but ultimately lost to Trump, who was inaugurated for his second term in January.\n\nThe post Fox News Mocked for Ripping Into Joe Biden’s Holiday Vacation: ‘They Call That Retirement’ appeared first on TheWrap.",
