    "fullText": "Thousands of flights were canceled this weekend as Winter Storm Fern brought heavy snow and ice to much of the country.\n\n19,450 flights within, into, or out of US airports were canceled between Saturday and 7 a.m. ET on Monday, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThe majority of those, more than 11,000, occurred on Sunday. That made it the worst day for flight cancellations since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDisruption continued on Monday, with 3,700 flights canceled as of 7 a.m. ET, per FlightAware. At that time, Boston Logan Airport appeared to be the worst affected, with 60% of its departing flights canceled. However, the situation overall was improving.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth International Airport was the worst affected this weekend, with around three-quarters of its scheduled flights canceled. By Monday morning, 3,200 flights in and out of the airport had been canceled.\n\nFour inches of snow fell in 48 hours at the airport, which is American Airlines' main hub, per the National Weather Service.\n\nThe second-most cancellations were seen at Charlotte Douglas, another American Airlines hub, numbering almost 2,000 between Saturday and Monday.\n\nDFW had nearly twice as many cancellations as Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International, Delta Air Lines' primary hub, which ranked third.\n\nThe New York City area's three airports — JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark — each saw about 1,500 cancellations. Close to 10 inches of snowfall was recorded at each location, the local CBS News outlet reported.\n\nUsing FlightAware's data, Business Insider created this map that shows the number of cancellations at the 20 worst-affected airports.\n\nAmerican Airlines was the worst-affected carrier on Sunday with nearly 1,900 cancellations, representing 58% of its schedule, per FlightAware's data.\n\nThe airline said it added 3,200 extra seats on flights in and out of Dallas-Fort Worth, and another 3,000 on flights from Charlotte to Chicago O'Hare.\n\nOn Thursday, it said it was \"repositioning aircraft, aligning crew resources, and reinforcing staffing at key airports\" to help minimize disruption.\n\nAirlines waived change fees for passengers flying to or from cities affected by the weather.\n\nDelta Air Lines, which canceled nearly 1,500 flights, per FlightAware, said it was operating a reduced schedule as freezing rain and ice hit Atlanta.\n\nIt also said it was bringing in additional reserve pilots and flight attendants, plus \"relocating experts from cold weather hubs\" to several airports in the South, to support its de-icing and baggage teams.",

    "description": "As a travel planner, there are a lot of mistakes I tell my clients to avoid when booking all-inclusive vacations, especially when choosing rooms.",
    "fullText": "As a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels, one of my areas of expertise is booking all-inclusive vacations.\n\nThere are a lot of resorts out there with different tiers and offerings, so it's easy to get tripped up if you're new to booking them. And if you're spending a few thousand dollars for a weeklong getaway for two, you want to ensure you're getting your money's worth.\n\nHere are the biggest mistakes people make while booking all-inclusive vacations — and how to avoid them.\n\nWhen choosing an all-inclusive resort, it's important to consider your dream vacation before you even start looking online. Determining a trip bucket list will greatly help to narrow down your search.\n\nI encourage clients to think about things like their budget, nonnegotiable amenities, ideal locations, flight accessibility, desired room features, and resort size.\n\nMany popular all-inclusive resorts are in tropical locations, but there are also some great options in places like Canada, Europe, and Japan.\n\nClub Med offers all-inclusive resorts worldwide. One of its newer offerings is Club Med Québec Charlevoix, which offers an all-inclusive ski experience in the winter and an adventure experience in the summer.\n\nIn all-inclusive travel, you truly get what you pay for.\n\nValue properties often struggle to provide quality food options, comfortable accommodations, and adequate service. I recommend focusing searches on properties with a rating of at least 4.5.\n\nAlthough entry-level rooms are the least expensive, booking them can also come at a price.\n\nThe cheapest rooms can have views of the parking lot or construction sites. Or they're located on the ground floor, which can get musty in humid, tropical climates.\n\nYou can often upgrade to a better room for a minimal extra cost, and I think it's more than worth it. If you're really on a strict budget, shorten your trip by a day or two to allow for a higher-quality experience.\n\nThere are many great kid-friendly, all-inclusive resorts, but taking an adults-only trip is so much fun.\n\nGrab your friends, family, or significant others to rewind for a few days without the kids.\n\nOn one kid-free trip to Le Blanc Spa Resort in Cancún, my husband and I appreciated the time we spent reconnecting, unwinding, and unplugging from work and family responsibilities.\n\nBooking a trip to the Caribbean or Mexico in summer and fall (hurricane season) carries some risk, but prices are usually significantly lower than at other times of the year.\n\nThe weather can be gorgeous, and there's no guarantee your trip will be affected by bad weather. For example, my husband and I honeymooned in the Caribbean in the fall, and the weather was some of the best I have ever had on a vacation.\n\nIf you're concerned, definitely keep an eye on the weather and add travel insurance to your booking.\n\nOne of the best parts of an all-inclusive vacation is enjoying the all-you-can-eat cuisine and top-shelf drink selections.\n\nSpending up to a week at a luxury resort with mediocre food can be an unenjoyable experience. When reading reviews, pay close attention to comments about food quality.\n\nI love the food and drinks at Palace, Sandals, and Beaches resorts and often recommend them to my clients.\n\nOne of the biggest disappointments I hear from clients is that the view from their room didn't live up to their expectations.\n\nSome resorts are more liberal with their categorization of partial-ocean-view and ocean-view rooms — maybe you can see a sliver of blue through the trees if you crane your neck.\n\nIf you want to see the beautiful blue of the sea from your balcony, you generally need to book an oceanfront room.\n\nYour friend might have impeccable taste, but that doesn't mean their favorite resort meets your style or needs.\n\nOne of my clients might love a resort, but another may not enjoy the experience at all. For example, your friend may love lounging by the pool, but you prefer beachfront activities. Maybe they'd rather have mindblowing cocktails, while your priority is being served first-class dinners with bites from around the globe.\n\nRemember, finding the resort that's right for you is a very personal process.\n\nSure, I'm a little biased, but hear me out: Choosing the right destinations and resorts for your all-inclusive vacation can be daunting.\n\nIn Mexico alone, there are hundreds of lodgings to choose from.\n\nMost travel planners offer complimentary services (we get commissions from hotels and other bookings), which can greatly reduce the headache of planning your trip.\n\nI always look for the best pricing and make sure to support my clients before, during, and after their vacations so they can relax.\n\nAs an agent, I also visit resorts to vet them for my clients. Reading online reviews can be helpful, but they can also be confusing, so I like being able to make personal recommendations.\n\nThis story was originally published on May 4, 2024, and most recently updated on January 26, 2026.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jim Rowley, CEO of Crunch Fitness and United States Marine Corps. veteran. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat's interesting about my day is that it's never really routine.\n\nIt's highly dependent on where I'm working from, so if I'm in my main office in Manhattan, the day is quite different than if I'm at home in Lake Tahoe. It's fulfilling to not have the same routine over and over again.\n\nI've been doing this for 34 years, so monotony is a killer for me.\n\nWhere my job gets fun is if I'm on the road, I'm in gyms. My team and get to go to our more than 500 gyms, and I love meeting the members.\n\nLately, we've been spending a lot of time on understanding where AI is going to integrate perfectly with the member experience and the team member experience. We're testing some ideas out in the field.\n\nWhen I'm feeling like I'm in a rut from a strategy standpoint, creatively, I go to the gyms. I think all the answers are in the gyms. So I talk to my teams about what's working, what's not.\n\nPeople think I'm kind of a hard guy, but I think I'm pretty relaxed, especially on the road. There are just a few non-negotiables I have in my regular cadence to stay on track.\n\nTypically, I get up at 5:45 a.m. to 6:30 a.m., depending on the day. My morning is like an old grandpa's. I watch the business news, see how the markets are trending. I usually have my one cup of coffee for the day.\n\nRight now, my morning is special — I had a granddaughter born last June, so she's up really early, my daughter's up really early, so I usually get to chat with them via text or FaceTime before everything has started. Once that's done, I start my emails. The majority of my day is set up around Zoom rodeos, performance updates, executive leadership team meetings, or huddles.\n\nThis may be funny, but when I'm on the road, I need to have a desk or a sitting area so I have space to think and stretch my legs. I can't just be checking emails from bed.\n\nI also need to get a protein shake in the morning, especially when I'm on the road. I'm not going to sit down and have a hotel breakfast or stop anywhere.\n\nI believe fitness is medicine. I'm 58 now, and I'm chasing being happy, healthy, and mobile in my eighties and nineties, so it's really about staying active, keeping moving.\n\nWhen I was in the Marine Corps., I worked out in the morning. Prior to 2020, I worked out at the end of my day.\n\nI'm finding that the midday routine is best for me now, to block out some time.\n\nAt lunchtime, around 1 p.m., I break for exercise. So about 12:45, I wind down my meetings, and I'm either headed to Pilates or the gym.\n\nI can walk to our gym, which is great. It's about a 20-minute walk there and back, so you get 40 minutes of cardio with your weightlifting.\n\nI don't lift for ego anymore. I rarely bench. I used to bench press all the time, and I was very proud of what I could bench press. Now, I don't bench press at all because it's so hard on my shoulders. I do a lot more dumbbell workouts now, a lot more machine lifting.\n\nHaving lifted weights since I was 14, I felt like Pilates was an opportunity for me to try to lengthen, strengthen, and activate some of the smaller muscles.\n\nIt changed my life, to be honest with you. I became much more limber, a lot less tight. At first, I was the only man in the Pilates class, but I've been telling my neighbors and building a little army of Pilates guys.\n\nI've done both yoga and Pilates, and prefer Pilates because there is a little bit of strength with mobility and balance.\n\nAfter the gym, I'll have lunch, and then I'm back at the office for more calls, meetings, and so forth. It's problem-solving, it's answering questions, and then I wrap up my day.\n\nI like to get out of here by 5:30 p.m. to get a walk in, especially this time of year, because it's cold and it's just refreshing.\n\nWe eat dinner around 6:30 or 7 p.m.\n\nMy wife and I aren't big on sitcom television, but we do like series. She likes anything out of England, the BBC. I'm more into military history, US history, or westerns. We settled in the middle with dramatic crime whodunnit type of series.\n\nI do have a passion for \"Survivor\" and \"The Amazing Race.\" People laugh at me, but I just love competition.\n\nThen I read a little bit, and I'm in bed usually by 11.",

    "description": "As a frequent traveler, noise-canceling headphones, a notebook, electrolyte packets, and a tripod are some of the things I never travel without.",
    "fullText": "I've been to all 50 states and have explored everywhere from tiny towns in New England to the mountains of Alaska. Along the way, I've learned that the right travel essentials can make all the difference.\n\nAfter hundreds of flights and road trips, I've boiled my packing list down to 11 things I never leave home without. Whether it's a quick weekend getaway or a cross-country adventure, these are the items I always bring with me.\n\nAs a very frequent traveler, I do everything I can to turn airport chaos into a calmer experience, whether I'm on a packed plane or waiting in a noisy lounge or terminal.\n\nSo, I use noise-cancelling headphones to sleep, listen to music, or just tune everything else out. They've saved more trips than I can count, and I never leave home without them.\n\nNo matter where I'm going, I always bring a small first-aid kit with me.\n\nScrapes, blisters, or minor aches happen on the road, and having basics like Band-Aids and over-the-counter medications means I'm ready for anything.\n\nBetween long hikes, flights, and summer heat, it's easy to get dehydrated while traveling. That's why I always bring electrolytes with me.\n\nA quick powder package or tablet keeps me energized and feeling my best without weighing down my bag. I rarely leave home without them, as they're a small addition that makes a big difference.\n\nThis should go without saying, but hydration is a non-negotiable. That's why I always bring a refillable water bottle when traveling.\n\nI always fill mine up immediately upon entering the airport terminal (after going through security), and it makes it much easier for me to stay hydrated. Plus, it's much more cost-effective than buying airport water.\n\nI always bring cash and multiple credit cards with me when I'm on the road.\n\nCash always comes in handy for tips and hole-in-the-wall vendors that don't accept cards. However, I also pay attention to which credit cards have the best travel benefits and use them to my advantage.\n\nFor example, my American Express Platinum Card gets me into lots of airport lounges and provides a host of other benefits, including rental car theft and damage insurance.\n\nPlus, my United Airlines MileagePlus credit card helps me save on in-flight purchases.\n\nAs a woman traveling solo, I'm always thinking about my safety, so I carry a whistle with me and keep it within arm's reach.\n\nThankfully, I've never needed to use it, but knowing I can quickly draw attention to myself in any situation gives me peace of mind.\n\nAs a solo traveler, I depend on a tripod for photos. I simply place my phone on it and snap photos on a delay.\n\nThis way, I don't have to reply on other travelers — or selfies — to capture the moment.\n\nI spend a lot of time outside when I travel, so sun protection — like sunglasses and a hat — are key.\n\nIt feels obvious, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen people around me scrambling to buy these essentials because they didn't think to bring them.\n\nI love to journal on the road, so I always bring a notebook with me. I often spend nights doodling memories of the day to look back at later.\n\nIt may sound fancy, but I never travel without my large black cashmere scarf. It doubles as a blanket on flights, works well as a shawl over outfits, and adds another layer anytime I need one.\n\nIt's such a versatile item and keeps me at the perfect temperature at all times.\n\nAs a female solo traveler, I always travel with an Addalock — a small, portable device that lets me secure doors from the inside for additional peace of mind.\n\nEven if the main lock feels safe, having this on hand is a tiny addition that makes me feel more secure.",

Young children may like the Salzburg Zoo, and music lovers can explore Mozart's birthplace and residence.\n\nSitting atop a hill, Hohensalzburg Fortress is one of the largest castles in the area and boasts great views of the city. To get another stunning view, take the Untersberg cable car.\n\nJust a few hours from London by train, Liverpool is a must-visit spot for Beatles fans.\n\nAll four band members grew up in the port city. There are many different types of excursions, from short bus rides to full-day private tours that will immerse you in the sights and sounds of the band's legacy.\n\nIn Liverpool, football (or American soccer) is a way of life, and there are two main clubs here: Liverpool and Everton. Fans of the game can take an LFC stadium tour for a behind-the-scenes look.\n\nThe city also houses a slew of theaters, art galleries, and museums — and it's becoming a hot destination for shopping and unique culinary experiences.\n\nCinque Terre is one of my favorite cities — or, more accurately, my favorite collection of five villages.\n\nNestled along the Italian Riviera, Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore are accessible only by train, ferry, or foot.\n\nEach has a distinct style, and hikers flock to this region to enjoy the beautiful scenery.\n\nVernazza, my favorite village, is the gem of this region. I love wandering the cobbled streets to shop, snack, and explore. You can also visit the Castello Doria or the church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochia.\n\nIn the summer months, tourists sunbathe on the beaches of Monterosso or take a dip in the sea. For a history lesson, visit the remains of Castello Fieschi or the Church of St John the Baptist and the Capuchin Monastery.\n\nIn Manarola, take some time to watch locals cliff-jump into the marina. I also suggest taking a wine tour through the town to sample some local specialties. Be sure to try Sciacchetrà, a sweet but strong dessert wine produced in Cinque Terre.\n\nRiomaggiore is also home to a castle and churches dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries. The center of the town is great for wandering, shopping, and eating.\n\nCorniglia is probably the quietest of the five villages. There, climb the Lardarina staircase for beautiful views of the coastline or take a boat tour to fully enjoy the area's beauty.\n\nJust about two hours east of Paris by high-speed train, Strasbourg is a beautiful city along the border of France and Germany.\n\nEvery trip should include a visit to the Gothic Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Strasbourg. Try to plan your day around arriving there at 12:30 p.m. to see the wooden figures dance around the clock.\n\nAfter your cathedral visit, stroll through Petite France, explore cheese shops, and take a break to sip a glass of wine at one of the canal's many cafés.\n\nAt the end of the year, Strasbourg is also home to one of the oldest Christmas markets, dating back to the late 1500s. The Christkindelsmärik is truly magical, with more than 300 vendors selling their holiday best.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 3, 2024, and most recently updated on January 23, 2026.",

    "description": "My friend wanted to plan a Europe trip, but then I got laid off. We went to Montreal instead, and the more affordable vacation was just what I needed.",
    "fullText": "I'm never one to say no to travel, whether it's for work, to visit a friend, or just because.\n\nIn the first half of last year alone, I flew from New York to Palm Springs with friends, planned a London trip around a play I wanted to see, and saw Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour in Los Angeles.\n\nOne of my friends was trying to sell me on one more big vacation — Scotland, maybe, or Paris — that we could take together before 2025 was over.\n\nIt wouldn't have taken much convincing, but then I got laid off right at the end of May. Suddenly, traveling anywhere felt out of reach.\n\nHowever, as the dust settled and summer came and went, the thought kept creeping back into my mind: Transatlantic travel would definitely have to wait until I had steady work again, but maybe it wouldn't be impossible to take one more small trip while I still had severance?\n\nTurns out, it was possible. We went to Montreal for a long weekend in late October, and it turned out to be the perfect trip.\n\nI'd never been to Montreal before, but it was the perfect destination for several reasons.\n\nLogistically, it was a quick, 90-minute flight from New York, making it an easy choice for a weekend trip. Less time in the air meant we could make the most of just a handful of days on the ground.\n\nI was also able to buy my airfare with credit-card points, which helped keep my out-of-pocket costs low.\n\nPracticalities aside, I knew that Montreal, with its cobblestone streets in the Old Port, cozy cafés, and official language (French), would feel like a true \"trip\" — a chance to hit pause on the stress of the last few months and immerse myself in a new place.\n\nWe kept the itinerary for this girls' weekend loose. Apart from making a few dinner reservations, we really just took our time exploring the city.\n\nAs someone who tends to plan jam-packed vacations, this was definitely a departure for me, but I was surprised to find I didn't really care.\n\nIt certainly didn't feel like I was missing anything as we took our time yapping, poking through vintage stores, and taste-testing Montreal-style bagels.\n\nSure, we made time to hike up Mount Royal and checked out the Old Port, but this trip wound up being less about sightseeing and more about just having a good time together. Getting to close my laptop and not think (too much) about work was the biggest gift of all.\n\nInstead, I got to channel my energy into a few days of uninterrupted time focusing on things that brought me joy: spending quality time with a friend I'd never traveled with before, taking in a new-to-me city, people-watching on public transportation, and successfully ordering my daily oat latte in French.\n\nThe past few months had been unsteady and stressful, and I knew those same uncertainties would be waiting for me when the plane touched down. Still, our trip recharged my batteries in a way I didn't know I needed until we got home.\n\nTaking any sort of trip is a privilege, especially when your life is in flux. Those three days, though, wound up being the perfect trip for this moment in my life.\n\nBest of all, there was enough I didn't do or see in Montreal that I'm already excited to visit again, if given the chance.\n\nI know I'll take another European vacation at some point, once things feel a little more settled. In the meantime, while I wait for the next chance to grab my passport and get on a plane, I'll just sit here with my \"Bon Matin\" mug and be glad I took the trip.",

    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "fullText": "As horrific details of the Iranian government’s suppression of protesters emerge — with internal estimates counting more than 10,000 dead — the country’s young, wealthy elite are inciting further rage by continuing to flaunt their lavish lives online as they have for years, as if the nation weren’t on the brink of collapse outside of their privileged bubble.\n\nAmid an enforced internet blackout that allows an oppressive regime to commit “genocide under the cover of digital darkness,” according to one outraged expert, reporters from the Telegraph are said to have observed “rich Iranians” partying at a nightclub in a popular holiday hot spot on the border with Turkey.\n\n“Their lifestyle has enraged the citizens of Iran, specifically Gen Z in their age group, mainly because they see how these rich kids live — with no accountability for anything that they do,” Ella Rosenberg, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Centre for Foreign Affairs, told the Times of London.\n\nMostly the children of Iran’s ruling class, they’ve famously led hedonistic lifestyles for decades, but their jaw-dropping wealth had become more visible in recent years, due to the government’s temporarily loosened grip on the internet and social media, before the current unrest began.\n\n“They’re the equivalent of the Iranian ‘Gossip Girl’: luxury cars, living in opulent high-rises in north Tehran,” Rosenberg said.\n\nThe wealth of Iran’s young elite first came to global attention more than a decade ago, with the Instagram account @richkidsoftehran.\n\n“It depicts seemingly affluent teens flaunting Rolex watches, Porsches and Maseratis, sprawling estates and pricey attire,” The Post reported in 2014.\n\nThe Instagram account has remained active and now boasts 477,000 followers.\n\nGlamorous snaps ceased being shared on the account in 2024 — since Jan. 9, six new posts relating to current events have appeared, referring to the government as a “regime” — but other well-connected and cashed-up Iranians have become influencers in their own right.\n\nAnashid Hoseini, who is married to the son of Iran’s ambassador to Denmark, has more than 1.7 million followers, thanks to envy-inducing photos that show her dripping with jewels and toting designer handbags.\n\nHoseini is reported to live in Niavaran, an affluent neighborhood in northern Tehran, but she has not posted to her account in almost a month.\n\nIt’s unclear whether she remains in Iran amid the unrest, but many have fled the country in recent weeks seeking shelter in Van, a Turkish province about 60 miles from Iran’s border.\n\nSaid to be a popular holiday spot with affluent Iranians, the Telegraph reported seeing well-heeled types gathering in a venue that can easily cost more than $100 for entry and drinks, according to the outlet.\n\n“These people benefit from the regime. They left Iran for now, because they were worried about staying there. Here, they can feel safe,” one Iranian at the club told the paper.\n\nOther young and well-connected Iranians left their home country long ago, but have still incited anger among those less affluent citizens left behind.\n\nSasha Sobhani, the son of a former Iranian ambassador to Venezuela, became a social media star showing off his expat life in Spain, where he moved in 2019.\n\nSnaps show Sobhani surrounded by scantily clad ladies and luxury sports cars, and he has since denounced Iran.\n\nHowever, the country is seeking his extradition after accusing him of money laundering and running illegal websites.\n\nThe current uprising, which exploded Dec. 28, has morphed into the most serious threat to Iran’s clerical rulers since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nThe regime has answered with overwhelming force, deploying the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij militia to crush the unrest, according to rights groups and witness accounts.\n\nSources inside Iran estimate at least 12,000 — and possibly as many as 20,000 — people may have been killed during the unrest, according to CBS News.\n\nTehran has fiercely disputed the numbers, blaming the bloodshed on what it calls “armed rioters” and “terrorists” backed by foreign powers, including the US and Israel.",

Travellers from those countries would need to apply instead for an Esta - an Electronic System for Travel Authorization.\n\nA senior State Department official said the new Fifa Pass system will cut wait times - with applicants in \"over 80%\" of countries now able to schedule a visa appointment in \"less that 60 days\".\n\nIt added: \"At the visa appointment, the applicant must show they qualify for the visa and plan to follow our laws and leave at the end of the tournament.

    "fullText": "With the Trump administration recently expanding its travel ban to 39 countries and suspending visa processing for 75 in total, multiple countries have responded with travel and visa bans for Americans.\n\nThe African nations of Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali have all stopped issuing visas for Americans in what they describe as a reciprocal move, given the treatment of their citizens.\n\nAt the start of the month, Mali's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation put out a statement saying that U.S. citizens will now also be subject to \"the same conditions and requirements as those imposed by the American authorities on Malian citizens entering the United States.\"\n\nThe South Asian nation of Pakistan was included in the list of nations for which the U.S. State Department will pause processing of all immigrant visas as of Jan. 21.\n\nAlthough the move is not immediately tied to the Trump administration's actions, Pakistan is, in turn, making it more difficult for Americans to visit by suspending its \"visa prior to arrival\" program, Visas News reported. The program allowed citizens of 125 countries to apply for permission to enter easily online.\n\nFrom August 2024, citizens of countries like the United States, Canada and most European and Asian nations could apply for a 90-day tourist or business visa for free by submitting their passport information and trip details through a government portal.\n\nTravelers looking to come to the country were the first to notice that the \"Pak ID\" mobile application now directs applicants to select a traditional visa category for which they have to pay $35 USD for a single entry of up to three months (the prior visa allowed for multiple entries) and will take up to seven business days to be processed.\n\nCitizens of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom have to pay a higher $60 fee for reasons not expanded upon. The Pakistani government has not released an official statement on the change or provided any information on whether the simplified application will ever be brought back.\n\nIn August 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif classified \"this easing of the visa regime [as a way to] help make Pakistan an attractive destination for investments and tourism.\"\n\nThe country sees significantly less tourism interest than neighboring India and has over the last half-decade made several efforts to draw in international visitors.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots punched their ticket to the AFC Championship on Sunday, January 18, with a hard-fought 28-16 victory over the Houston Texans. In a game defined by a relentless Foxborough snowstorm, Mike Vrabel’s squad overcame a turnover-heavy first half to secure the franchise's first conference title berth since 2019.\n\nThe matchup lived up to its billing as a defensive slugfest. While the Texans’ top-ranked unit made life difficult for Drake Maye, forcing him into four fumbles, the Patriots’ defense proved even more opportunistic. New England feasted on a record-tying four interceptions from C.J. Stroud, including a crucial Marcus Jones pick-six that swung the momentum for good. Despite the sloppy conditions, Maye’s three touchdown passes provided the necessary spark to push the Patriots past a Houston team that had dominated the Wild Card round.\n\nWith the win, the Patriots now look ahead to a high-stakes trip to higher altitudes next Sunday, January 25. Now, a new generation takes the stage as the Patriots aim to rewrite history and claim the all-time postseason wins record for themselves.\n\nHere is more on who the Patriots play next in the 2026 NFL playoffs.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\nWith the win, the Patriots move on to the AFC Championship, facing the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos squeaked past the Buffalo Bills and Josh Allen, automatically getting home-field advantage for the AFC Championship Game. Mile High is certainly no easy place to play, and Denver earned the right to host by clinching the No. 1 overall seed. Though Denver suffered a brutal blow when starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury.\n\nThe matchup carries heavy foreshadowing. The last time these two storied franchises met in the AFC Championship was exactly a decade ago in January 2016. That legendary \"Mile High\" battle served as the final postseason chapter of the Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning rivalry — a game the Broncos won 20-18 on their way to a Super Bowl title.\n\nThis time around, with a new quarterback at the helm, New England is searching for revenge.",

The Patriots will play the Broncos on Sunday, Jan. 25, at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nCBS will televise the AFC Championship Game, and viewers can also stream it on Paramount+.\n\nThe Patriots finished the regular season third in total offense, but their defense has carried them to double-digit playoff wins. They first sacked Justin Herbert six times in a 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers before locking down the Texans in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nHouston averaged just 3.3 yards per play, gaining a mere 48 rushing yards on 22 carries. Making matters worse, C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions — one returned for a touchdown — and lost a fumble.\n\nThe Patriots will look to improve to 9-0 on the road when playing the Broncos, who survived a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills. But the AFC West champions suffered a huge loss in the process, as quarterback Bo Nix broke his ankle at the end of the game.\n\nThat places former Patriots reserve Jarrett Stidham in line to make his fifth career start.

    "description": "Visits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, in a continued blow to the tourism industry.",
    "fullText": "The US isn't the tourist destination it once was.\n\nVisits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, according to data released earlier this month by the National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nIn 2025, visits to the US were down among 10 of the top 20 overseas tourist-generating countries, including India, Germany, and South Korea.\n\nThe decline is a sustained blow to the travel and tourism industries, which in 2024 supported more than 15 million jobs, and generated about $1.3 trillion in economic output — including $181 billion from inbound international travel.\n\nMajor tourism hubs like Las Vegas are seeing widespread layoffs due to the downturn, forcing workers to get creative with their career pivots. Business Insider reported earlier this month that laid-off hospitality workers contributed to a 55% increase in dancer auditions at a Las Vegas strip club compared to the prior six months.\n\nIt doesn't appear the travel bug has gone anywhere — just that international tourists are avoiding the US.\n\nIn Australia, for example, overseas arrivals and departures data released Friday by the country's Bureau of Statistics shows that international travel returned to pre-pandemic levels just before the lockdowns began in 2020. Australians travelling to Canada rose 4% in the last year, 10% more visited India, and visits by Australians to China and Japan rose 20% and 21%, respectively, but 3.2% fewer booked a trip to the US.\n\nFewer Canadian travelers are visiting the US, as well, opting instead to go further south to Mexico, Business Insider reported last April.\n\nComplicating demand were ongoing trade frictions, tariff battles, and geopolitical unease, which helped fuel grass-roots boycotts of US goods and, in some cases, changes in travel plans.\n\nEuropean travel firms and analysts pointed to tariff-driven consumer backlash and growing anti-American sentiment as factors that contributed to early-year softness in bookings, even as demand showed signs of rebounding later in the summer.\n\nDomestic travel has helped cushion the blow so far, with the US Travel Association projecting that domestic leisure travel was forecast to grow 1.9% to $895 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, if international visitors continue to stay away, destinations that depend on overseas spending — from iconic tourism cities to national parks — could feel growing pressure as the US heads into a high-stakes stretch of global events in 2026 and beyond.",

    "description": "After meeting my future husband at work, we decided to quit and go on a 24,000-mile cycling adventure together across the world. We fell in love.",
    "fullText": "My coworker and I were both single, and I was in the trenches of online dating. Stew and I took lunch at the same time, and over sandwiches eaten from Tupperware, we bonded over our shared love of cycling.\n\nOne lunch, he told me he was going to cycle the highest pass in Wales. My eyes widened, \"I'd love to do that.\" That's when he told me to join him.\n\nHe picked me up that weekend, and we cycled Gospel Pass.\n\nThe next lunch break, Stew asked me out for dinner. I said yes. He stayed over and never went home. The rest, as they say, is history, and what a ride it's been so far.\n\nWe were dating for about a month when Stewart said, \"I've got something to tell you.\" He continued: \"I'm going to quit my job and cycle around the world. Do you want to come with me?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" I said without hesitation.\n\nStew had already planned a 24,000-mile turn-by-turn route across 32 countries.\n\nHe saved enough money that he could ride around the world for 18 months unemployed. His plan was to carry a tent and stay in cheap accommodations, like hostels and Airbnb rooms.\n\nAll I needed to do was save enough money to cover my flights. For a few months, we cut costs, but left ourselves with enough money to enjoy being a young couple; a meal out each month was a non-negotiable.\n\nAs we left our jobs, Stewart also organized the bikes: bright yellow steel-frame touring bikes that could manage long-distance cycling, as well as the additional weight of our luggage.\n\nWhen we left the UK, we waved goodbye to our families at Stewart's mom's house, and we wobbled down the driveway on the heaviest bikes we'd ever ridden.\n\nI will never forget the feeling of freedom. We were unemployed, and everything we needed for the next 18 months was packed into six bright yellow panniers, which fit proudly on our bikes.\n\nI was nervous, excited, and weightless.\n\nThere are many prominent moments as you cycle from one country to another. But the first one was leaving Georgia and arriving in Azerbaijan. The gorgeous greenery of Azerbaijan turned into flat desert landscapes.\n\nAustralia was similar. Across Nullarbor Plain, we rode desert flatlands with kangaroos and Wedge-Tailed Eagles. Service stations were over 100 miles apart. Then we reached New South Wales, home to green mountains and Bulli Pass.\n\nAt the top, there was a wedding venue overlooking the sea. We talked about weddings and all the things we didn't want: first dances, speeches, and the pressure of invitations.\n\nAfter Australia, our next stop was New Zealand. We flew to Queenstown and researched what it takes to get married there. You need a marriage license and a celebrant who will officiate the ceremony in front of two witnesses.\n\nOur celebrant was someone we found online, named Sean. He was a lovely Irish gentleman with a steady voice, a calming presence, and an art for perfectly timed humor. He knew exactly when to drop a joke and when to let a moment breathe. He promised us two witnesses (his wife, Vee, and friend, Chris) for the price of two quality bottles of wine.\n\nAfter one call with Sean, we stepped out into Queenstown, engaged-ish. We booked a date, bought New Zealand-gold wedding rings, and hired wedding attire.\n\nStew surprised me with a proposal and a placeholder ring, and of course, I said yes.\n\nOur next bike ride was 500 miles from Queenstown to Christchurch, so we could marry. I'd love to tell you that it was straightforward, but on a cycling adventure, unforeseen challenges arise. At Haast Pass, there was a landslide. Delays meant we would miss our own wedding.\n\nThe beauty of an elopement? We only had ourselves to please. I called Sean, the hair salon, and the florist to change the date. The landslide was cleared, and we made our way to Christchurch.\n\nWe married at The Sign of the Bellbird in the Port Hills. It was beautiful. Rolling hills with the yellowest of flowers looked stunning against the deep green mountains and gorgeous blue skies.\n\nOn that quiet hill, with only us to please, and nothing but birdsong and sunshine, we spoke our vows and became husband and wife.\n\nThere were no crowds, no pressure, and no expectations. It was just us, which was all we'd known in the year leading up to it as we cycled from the UK to New Zealand. What followed was an eight-month honeymoon cycling home via South America.",

    "description": "In this Saturday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about the best ways to go OOO.",
    "fullText": "As you may have noticed, I wasn't at work last week. (Thanks, Paige, for filling in!) I decided to ease into the year sans meetings, emails, or circling back.\n\nMy intention for taking the first full week of the year off was simple: to be intentional about rest so that I can spend the next two quarters running at full speed. I had planned to do only one joyous activity per day.\n\nI started the week by taking my son to a pottery painting class and then a massage on Tuesday. Wednesday was spent decluttering the garage, followed by doing absolutely nothing but catching up on Netflix series on Thursday. I capped the week off with a Friday facial.\n\nDespite sticking to my one activity per day, I still had to get the kids off to school. I had more time, so I also offered to pick them up, too. I cooked all of my meals (because have you seen this economy?!) and I finally joined Costco. I felt very productive, but also very tired.\n\n\"There is a win. You set good intentions, and you set a plan,\" Bryant, who's also the author of \"Homecoming: Overcome Fear and Trauma to Reclaim Your Whole Authentic Self,\" told me. \"Intention doesn't equal impact.\"\n\nBryant said my mistake was clear. \"You traded labor. You did less of one job and replaced it with more of another job,\" she explained. \"The reason the exhaustion surprises you is because you're like, 'but I didn't do any work this week.' But the driving, the cooking, the baths, these things are work.\"\n\nFor you, it may not be your home life, but the incessant accumulation of small tasks or tiny decisions — whether it's text message triage, planning meet-ups with friends, or caretaking your parents — can eat up ease while on vacation.\n\nIn the future, Bryant suggested that I remember that childcare and home labor are still work, even if they are labors of love. She added that instead of taking on more at home, outsource as much as I can afford.\n\nBryant also left me with this reminder: \"Embrace the truth that 'I'm worthy of rest from it all.'\"",

    "description": "Himal Mandalia was worried about explaining his career break on his resume, but it helped him deal with emotional baggage, accept himself, and finally start to slow down.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Himal Mandalia, 45, who lives in London. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI had a difficult childhood, and I missed a lot of school. When I hit my 20s, I didn't know what I wanted to be, so I floated between jobs. By age 32, in 2012, I'd reached a low point and felt my life was going nowhere.\n\nWhat I achieved in the following 10 years went beyond my wildest dreams.\n\nIn 2013, I landed a job as a software developer for a content marketing agency. I'd been coding as a hobby since I was young, and had relevant volunteer projects under my belt, but this formally kick-started my career in technology. By 2021, I was the head of technology for the UK government's official website.\n\nIn 2022, at age 42, I took a six-month break from work. It turned into 3½ years, and I traveled the world, but I found that I couldn't slow down. It unearthed hard truths about myself that I had to address.\n\nAt first, I was anxious about explaining my career break on my résumé, but I realized that people often take long career breaks to be parents, and I had reparented myself.\n\nIn the process, I learned to accept myself and be more present in the moment, which has been life-changing.\n\nI hadn't planned to work for the government, but when I started doing contract work for a department in 2014, I fell in love with designing services to support people's needs. In 2021, I got the job as the head of technology for GOV.UK, which felt like a huge achievement.\n\nAfter more than a year in the role, I reached a natural point where I needed a break from my career and could comfortably afford one, and left my job in April 2022. I didn't know what I wanted to do next in my role, and also had personal issues related to my difficult childhood to address.\n\nDuring my time off, I wrote my memoir, but realized there was little continuity to the narrative. Plus, even \"successful\" chapters felt hollow. I decided I needed more time to find out why that was.\n\nI hit the road on an open-ended trip to work on my book and myself. I flew to New Zealand and jumped to a new destination every week, including Bangkok, Singapore, and Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nWhat struck me during this time was my need for control. Whenever I sat in a café to relax, I felt compelled to plan my next four weeks in a document. I was exhausted and wondered if I'd become the only person to burn out on their career break.\n\nAfter six months, I made Melbourne my base and slowed down, traveling a little. In mid-2024, at age 44, I drew the line at 18 months of travel and returned to the UK indefinitely.\n\nI'd always felt different from others, and met some neurodivergent people while travelling.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD in October 2024 and autism in May 2025.\n\nThe diagnosis and tendencies associated with ADHD explained many of my lifelong patterns. I was often restless and always had to be on the go. I feel like it's why I pushed myself to travel to new places every week during my break.\n\nI'd also shift from being hyperfocused to disengaged. I could apply extraordinary effort and long hours to something, but it wasn't sustainable. During my career, I developed a drill sergeant in my head that drove me to sometimes work 80 hours a week, even though no one asked me to. I'd eventually get bored and walk away from things.\n\nADHD prevented me from sitting still and having a life of continuity, but it also meant I was always learning new skills, and it helped me become successful. It's not something I can hate.\n\nMedication has helped slow me down, and in early 2025, I started dealing with the emotional baggage that I'd taken around the world. It was like opening a warehouse full of boxes that I was scared to look inside. I had experienced a lot of shame about being different, so I had to forgive how unkind I'd been to myself and get \n\nIn June 2025, I founded a nonprofit called ADHD Pathfinding, focused on improving ADHD care in the UK.\n\nMy journey made me realize that the only thing we really have is the moments. There's a finite number of them, and when they're gone, that's it. There's only one way to make sure you don't miss them, which is to slow down and be present.\n\nI've seen more of the world than most people, but I missed most of it, because I was going too fast. Whatever keeps someone living on fast-forward, whether that's ADHD, unhealed trauma, or something else, understanding it can make it possible to slow down and feel more connected.",

The agent, identified as Tomas Escotto, believed he was on a date with woman while he was blabbing about Vance; the woman turned out to be a reporter for O’Keefe Media Group.\n\nEscotto talked about how the vice president is protected and the security measures agents take. He also told the woman he voted for ex-President Joe Biden and “I hate that sh*t” when talking about President Donald Trump’s ICE raids.\n\nThe agent later texted the woman on Dec. 26 about Vance’s travel plans for the next week, revealing he would be in Ohio and Florida for a handful of days. He also sent the reporter pictures of him aboard Air Force 2 and also pictures that provided metadata on where the president’s convoy was located.\n\nHe knew he was not allowed to share much of the information he was talking about.

    "description": "When my husband was laid off from his tech job, we sold our house and decided to travel for a year in our 40s. It changed how we view happiness.",
    "fullText": "We lived with our two greyhounds in an over-3,000-square-foot home outside Boston that we owned. We were both hustling and climbing the corporate ladder — he in the tech industry, and I at a law practice.\n\nThen, in 2022, Dave got laid off, and we lost our two dogs to cancer.\n\nThat's when we had the harrowing realization that the life we'd spent years building no longer fit us. Our home now felt far too big, and we felt lost and restless. We desperately needed a change — but first, a change of scenery.\n\nSo, we sold our house and decided to spend a year traveling the world as we contemplated our next move.\n\nBefore hitting the road, I figured out a plan to work remotely. That income, plus Dave's severance and the money made from the sale of our home, would allow us to enjoy some time away without financial strain.\n\nOur travel goals were simple — see a lot of places, think about what to do with our lives when we returned to the US, and spend time with animals along the way.\n\nThough we're ambitious, we've always found that spending time around animals forces us to slow down. It's a lesson we'd learned after adopting our dogs, who always seemed happy just to be, sans any hustle.\n\nSo, we started our trip on a farm about an hour south of Dublin, where we were able to really mellow out.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to find a note from Dave that said he was joining the husband-and-wife farmers to scan the bellies of the pregnant sheep on-site.\n\nI cradled a warm cup of coffee in my hands as I stood behind my husband while he helped the farmers. His smile was the biggest I'd seen in a long time.\n\nOver the next nine months, we visited other countries in Europe including Croatia, Portugal, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nWe traveled slowly and established home bases in each place, which allowed us to really relax into the environment. We were able to explore at our own pace, and we also had time to consider what our future looked like back in the US.\n\nWhatever was next, we knew it would involve less hustle and more time in the natural world.\n\nAfter nine months, our hunger for travel felt more than satiated.\n\nWe returned to the US with a clear understanding that the life we'd left behind in the States — with a giant home and a constant desire to climb the corporate ladder — wasn't the one we wanted to cultivate again.\n\nDuring our travels, some of our most cherished memories included spending time on the farm in Dublin and sinking into the hot springs in Iceland. It was moments such as these that helped us realize the life we wanted was slower and more intentional.\n\nSo, we downsized to an 800-square-foot home on a lake in central Massachusetts. We even adopted another greyhound — one who's always eager to sit lakeside with his dads, watching the birds fly by.\n\nA little more than a year after we returned, I retired from my law practice to focus on writing, and Dave left the tech industry behind to start a whole new career at a mom-and-pop company.\n\nIf traveling for that year taught us anything, it's that our joy is better accessed with less stuff, less chasing of bigger-and-better opportunities, and more chances to be with the natural world.\n\nThis story was originally published on June 17, 2025, and most recently updated on January 14, 2026.",

    "fullText": "According to SPORT, Barcelona youngster Pedro ‘Dro’ Fernández did not train in the session prior to the match against Racing Santander and will not travel to Santander for the Copa del Rey tie.\n\nThe 18-year-old midfielder will be unavailable and will not join the squad after it was confirmed that he is carrying physical discomfort that prevents him from competing at full capacity.\n\nThe coaching staff have chosen not to take risks and, pending official confirmation, everything indicates that he will not be included in the matchday squad.\n\nDro’s absence represents a significant setback for Hansi Flick, as everything suggested that he could have been given minutes in tomorrow’s game in the Copa del Rey Round of 16.\n\nIn fact, the Spain Under-18 national team had released the La Masia graduate from the squad, aware of his discomfort. Although there was confidence that he would recover in time, this has ultimately not been the case.\n\nDro out of Copa del Rey clash. (Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images)\n\nDro will now remain in Barcelona throughout the week and focus on a full recovery before returning to the group as soon as possible.\n\nThe objective is for him to be available again in the coming weeks and to resume his normal routine, putting behind him a physical issue that has arrived at the worst possible moment.\n\nBarcelona have been working for some time on renewing Dro’s contract. The player is held in very high regard internally due to his projection and performances.\n\nThe teenager has made a strong impression on Flick since pre-season, with the coach satisfied by his attitude and his fit within the playing model.\n\nWith Dro turning 18 years old earlier this month, Barcelona plan to follow the same strategy that they did with Lamine Yamal and Pau Cubarsi and tie down the academy ace to a new long-term contract at the earliest possible.",

    "description": "Myrtle Beach is moving to give drivers more freedom downtown this summer. Here’s what we know about plans to end Ocean Boulevard flushing.",
    "fullText": "Myrtle Beach drivers could soon see a change in the busy tourist district as City Council moves to end downtown flushing.\n\nAmid a flurry of legislative initiatives on Tuesday’s agenda for Myrtle Beach City Council’s first meeting of the year, a new motion would direct city manager Jonathan “Fox” Simons Jr. to end the Summer Emergency Vehicle Access Plan, or SEVAP, more commonly called flushing.\n\nThe plan – which city police said was intended to improve response times, increase visibility and allow officers to address concerns – seasonally reroutes part of the northbound lane Ocean Boulevard on weekend nights.\n\nIncoming Mayor Mark Kruea said the traffic diversion “visually sends the wrong message,” contributes to declining tourism and hurts local businesses.\n\n“The merchants reported a 40% decline in their revenues last year. If you’re trying to kill tourism, that’s the way to do it. We need to not take that action,” said Kruea.\n\nAlthough the motion would end scheduled flushing, it would still allow staff to utilize traffic control practices.\n\n“Police still have the ability to divert traffic as needed, but the automatic shut the boulevard down at 4:00 on Friday and Saturday serves no good purpose,” Kruea said.\n\nDespite support from businesses and the mayor, the motion isn’t without controversy. Councilman Mike Lowder shared support for SEVAP on behalf of consituents.\n\n“It is amazing how many residents, non-business owners, that I heard from,” said Lowder, “their displeasure, when they go down to the boulevard, they have to be turned off of the boulevard every Friday and Saturday night.”\n\nThe motion directs the manager to end SEVAP “effective immediately,” but a consultant is still finalizing an assessment of the plan. According to the motion language, a draft of the report will be ready in February.",

    "description": "I tested Cadence Capsules, a luxury-grade travel container system. They make it easy to measure out my skincare routine, but cost a fortune.",
    "fullText": "I'm turning 30 this year, and one of my goals for the next decade is to travel more (I know, so original). I just went on my first big international trip last year, though I wish I'd known about Cadence Capsules before I went.\n\nMy Instagram algorithm was a little late on the draw for me to invest in these expensive little pods so close to my trip, but I kept getting ads from polished jet-setter types about how amazing they are. So, I decided to test them out between now and my next adventure and see for myself about the hype.\n\nCadence Capsules are reusable toiletry containers designed to organize pills, lotions, potions, or any other tiny items that can easily get lost in a suitcase mid-travel. They're mostly for storing medications and beauty products, but you can get creative with how you fill them.\n\nA system is made up of matte hexagonal Capsules varying in size, which stack together magnetically (the same way Fenty beauty products do) with a satisfying, ASMR-level click. You can keep easily keep track of what's inside thanks to the several interchangeable magnetic tile labels, which to me look a lot cleaner and more efficient than my smudgy handwriting.\n\nBefore I went home for the holidays, I packed my petal pink Capsule system in its matching petal pink Cadence Parcel. It's a clear, quart-sized bag that meets TSA requirements (and looks good doing it). It's not my favorite travel makeup bag I've ever used, but I like how it functions like a tray when I'm getting ready with limited counter space.\n\nI take magnesium each night before bed so I brought a week's worth, which fit in one Small Capsule. I take a few other medications as needed, so I brought two extra small Capsules as back up.\n\nInstead I ended up using them for my jewelry, and — if we can be real — they work well for storing cannabis buds, too. I'm also thinking ahead on how to use them in summer, and I think they'd be great for storing herbs and spices when camping. They're not technically food-safe (but only because companies can either be certified for ocean-bound plastic or food-safe, not both).\n\nA big reason Cadense Capsules are so expensive is because they're made with recycled plastics. It's a costly, laborious process to source recycled plastic and give it a whole new shape, color, and purpose. Cadence claims it uses 20% ocean-bound plastics to form its TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane), the same of which Nike uses. The AAPI, woman-led company also keeps it fulfillment and design teams local, so you're paying for an ethically-made product.\n\nMy dream for the next big innovation in travel accessories is a method that doesn't waste all my expensive hair products. Cadence offers Adapters (which notably, are also quite expensive) to help pour in fluids without spilling, but I hate the fact that I'm wasting even a minuscule amount of my curl defining cream.\n\nThat said, the Capsules never leaked on me once. Plus, the curved Spatula made it easy to scoop out every hard-to-reach drop of product. And since every Capsule is labeled with its fluid ounce capacity, you can rest assured you're packing according to strict airline requirements.\n\nIf you're a frequent flier who packs a lot of medications, then I say a Cadence Capsule system is worth the splurge. I rarely feel this put-together when I'm traveling, but the sleek, customizable design has put me in control of all my odds and ends. \n\nI didn't find them particularly helpful as someone who struggles the most with packing fluids, but the Cadence Capsules are really satisfying to use and look at. Even though they're pricier than almost any alternative, the aesthetic is unmatched.",

    "fullText": "French Polynesia is one of the world's most romantic travel destinations. However, my trip there was anything but romantic.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I came across a cheap flight deal to Tahiti, we jumped at the opportunity to visit. Yet instead of planning a romantic getaway for just the two of us, we invited his dad to come along.\n\nOur travel group was certainly unconventional, but we were excited to make memories together in such a dreamy destination. Even though we love planning trips with just us, it can be just as (if not more) fun to share the experience with loved ones.\n\nThroughout our trip, we had an incredible time exploring the islands, but also learned a few lessons about traveling with a parent.\n\nIn the end, despite our out-of-the-ordinary travel group, it was one of our best trips yet.\n\nI love searching the web for cheap flight deals. There are countless websites listing low fares (and even some subscription models), but my personal favorite is The Flight Deal.\n\nFrom time to time, I briefly browse the site to see what's available, and it's led to some great savings over the years. Yet in the midst of winter in 2023, I came across my most dream-worthy deal to date: a round-trip flight from San Francisco to Papeete, Tahiti, for $600.\n\nThe flight departed in less than two weeks, and leaving our snowy home behind to enjoy the tropics was enticing. I quickly called my boyfriend to propose the idea. With ample vacation time to spare, he was sold within minutes.\n\nAlthough French Polynesia is known for its romantic atmosphere, the deal felt too good not to share. After securing our flights, we asked family members to tag along, too.\n\nDue to the last-minute nature of the trip, my boyfriend's dad was the only one available.\n\nAt first, we wondered if we should postpone a family trip and just travel as a couple, but ultimately decided it would be a great bonding experience for the three of us.\n\nAfter landing in Tahiti, we spent a night on the island before traveling to the breathtaking island of Mo'orea, where we would spend the next five days.\n\nThe three of us spent our time snorkeling amongst colorful reefs, eating freshly-caught seafood at local food trucks, cycling around the island, and enjoying some of the most stunning sunsets we've ever seen.\n\nWe spent the majority of our time together, but my boyfriend and I still got alone time here and there, whether we visited a beach together or enjoyed a private meal.\n\nSurprisingly, his dad was always the one to suggest this, explaining that he'd stay behind to relax at the pool while we explored.\n\nTraveling with a group is all about balance, and our trip had the perfect mix of both family time and couple time.\n\nSince we booked our trip less than two weeks before departure, accommodation options were limited on the small island.\n\nMost hotels were fully booked, and French Polynesia's iconic overwater bungalows were outside of our budget.\n\nUltimately, we chose a budget-friendly Airbnb. For $100 a night, the rental was mostly perfect. It had an ocean view, small pool, and an outdoor kitchen.\n\nYet there was one major downside with the rental: It had just one bedroom with two beds — not exactly ideal for our travel party.\n\nDuring the week, we couldn't help but laugh at our living arrangement. Here we were, in one of the world's most romantic destinations, sharing a room with one of our parents!\n\nWe had to take what we could find for our last-minute trip, but I'd definitely spend extra for more private, spacious accommodations next time.\n\nIn the end, my boyfriend and I had no regrets about bringing his dad on our trip to French Polynesia.\n\nGoing on a trip with a parent or in-law can come with extra challenges, but the three of us traveled exceptionally well together. We made sure to give each other space when needed, and ultimately loved creating such wonderful memories as a group.\n\nIt may not have been the most romantic trip, but for my boyfriend and I, traveling with his dad made our trip even more special than if we had visited alone.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe AFC wild card round delivers one of the most exciting quarterback showdowns of the weekend as Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills (12-5, No. 6 seed) travel south to EverBank Stadium to face Trevor Lawrence and the AFC South Champion Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4, No. 3 seed).\n\nThis game pits two of the league's premier signal-callers against each other for the right to advance. While Allen and the Bills bring years of deep playoff experience, they will have to contend with a red-hot Jaguars team that hasn't lost since early November and enters the postseason carrying an impressive eight-game winning streak.\n\nThe wild card tilt carries a fascinating historical footnote as well: the Jaguars are 2-0 all-time against the Bills in the playoffs, securing wins in the 1996 and 2017 Wild Card rounds. However, this is a completely different era, defined by the dynamic, explosive offenses led by superstar quarterbacks. Lawrence, in particular, has elevated his game down the stretch, leading the AFC's hottest team with an MVP-caliber run through the second half of the season, a stretch that saw the Jaguars averaging 34 points per game.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills, despite being the lower seed and playing on the road for the first time in the wild card round since 2019, are looking to finally reach the Super Bowl; with the reigning MVP Josh Allen at the helm.\n\nHere's how to listen to the matchup.\n\nNational radio channels: SiriusXM channels 225 (Bills), 226 (Jaguars)\n\nJaguars radio channel: 1010XL / 92.5 FM\n\nThe Bills and Jaguars can be found on nationally on SiriusXM, where listeners can tune into the game from any location.

    "title": "I've lived in Switzerland for 5 years. Here are the 6 biggest mistakes I see first-time visitors make over and over.",
    "description": "If you're visiting Switzerland for the first time, avoid these common travel and itinerary mistakes that'll cost you money, time, or joy on your trip.",
    "fullText": "Though I'm a US citizen, I've spent the past five years living in Switzerland.\n\nAs a semi-recent transplant, I know there's much more to this amazing country than what visitors typically come to see. It's one best experienced thoughtfully and authentically — not by mindlessly racing through \"Top 10 \" lists.\n\nIn terms of mistakes tourists make, here are a few things I suggest you know — and avoid — before visiting Switzerland for the first time.\n\nZermatt, Lauterbrunnen, Interlaken, and Lucerne are popular, jaw-dropping locations, but they're not the only spots worth visiting in Switzerland.\n\nInstead of only seeing the few places on every tourist's list, consider branching out to smaller, lesser-visited ones for at least a day trip. Fortunately, many are easily accessible by public transportation out of some of the area's main hubs.\n\nFor example, close to Interlaken are the mountain villages of Frutigen, Kandersteg, and Adelboden, which offer gorgeous alpine views combined with fewer crowds and more authentic experiences.\n\nIn Switzerland, dining out can seem expensive — in part because the cost of production, labor, and relevant service charges are typically already included in the price of the meal.\n\nPersonally, I find the prices easier to stomach when I remember you're often paying for high-quality, regional fare, and restaurant staff here are typically earning a fair wage.\n\nAnd although tipping servers 15% to 20% of a bill is standard practice in places like the US, it's not the norm here. If you enjoyed the meal and the service, it's customary to round up a few francs or leave a tip between 5% and 10%.\n\nSwitzerland is a popular travel destination throughout the year, and its major attractions can fill up quickly — especially seats on our world-famous scenic routes.\n\nIf you plan on riding the Glacier Express or Bernina Express, book your train tickets as far in advance as possible.\n\nHowever, don't fret if you realize it's too late to book a seat on a scenic route. You'll be just fine on our \"regular\" trains, which tend to run faster, not book up as quickly, and still offer beautiful views.\n\nWhen traveling by train, it's important to double-check your ticket class and location. (And, if you have a paper ticket, get it validated.)\n\nSignage indicating first or second class can be found both outside and inside each car. Oftentimes, the class is also noted on the headrests of the seats themselves.\n\nTicketing agents on board will not hesitate to issue an on-the-spot fine for tourists seated in the wrong class. In addition to a fine of about 100 francs, you'll also have to pay the difference in price for the ticket.\n\nAlso, pay attention to where your seats are before entering each car so you won't have to lug an oversized suitcase through the entire train.\n\nSwitzerland is one of the smallest countries in Europe, at about 16,000 square miles. However, I've seen tourists mistakenly assume they can just zip through and see everything it has to offer in just three or four days.\n\nFor example, Zurich may seem close to Geneva on a map, but they are actually about three hours apart by train. Sure, you could also opt for a one-hour flight — but my point is that trying to see so many cities in a short period won't allow you to truly get a feel for each.\n\nTravel is about experiencing a place, not just visiting to check it off a bucket list. If you've only got a week in Switzerland, I suggest you limit yourself to exploring two or three cities instead of trying to cram six or seven single-night stays in new places into your itinerary.\n\nSwitzerland is composed of 26 cantons, and each of these administrative regions has its own distinct culture, government, and history. They also don't all speak the same languages.\n\nAlthough you'll find English speakers throughout the country — especially in popular tourist areas — Switzerland actually has four official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh.\n\nIt's helpful to learn a few basic greetings in those major languages and ensure you use them in the appropriate region.\n\nAlso, it's handy to become familiar with some of the commonly used symbols — especially when it comes to trash cans.\n\nThe Swiss are conscientious recyclers, so take a beat to look up the symbols printed on the bins before tossing something in them if you are confused. Your mindfulness will be appreciated",

    "fullText": "Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs has recalled nearly 13,000 passports after a software update caused a printing defect.\n\nThe printing error makes the documents non-compliant with international travel standards and potentially unreadable at automated border gates.\n\nThe government said the affected passports, issued between December 23 and January 6, may fail at eGates and border control systems worldwide, prompting a global alert through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and a mass re-issuance program.\n\n\"The Passport Office has confirmed that 12,904 Irish passports issued between 23 December 2025 and 6 January 2026 [inclusive] may not fully meet international travel standards,\" announced the government.\n\n\"The issue was caused by a software update, which could affect use at border control or eGates.\"\n\nHolders are being asked to return their passport books (and cards, where applicable) for free replacement, with new documents to be issued within approximately 10 working days.\n\n\"This will ensure that you do not face any issues with future travel. You do not need to reapply for a new passport,\" the official notice states.\n\nWhile the Department of Foreign Affairs has not explicitly specified where the missing \"IRL\" appears, the reference to ICAO compliance and potential failures at eGates strongly suggests the error affects the machine-readable zone (MRZ), where the three-letter issuing-state code is mandatory under ICAO Doc 9303.\n\nThe MRZ is the two-line block of text at the bottom of the passport's bio page that is scanned by airline systems, border control kiosks, and eGates. It encodes critical data such as the document type, issuing country, passport number, nationality, date of birth, and checksums used to verify the document's integrity.\n\nIf the issuing-state code \"IRL\" is missing or malformed in this zone, automated systems may reject the passport outright, even if the visual biographical page and embedded chip appear normal.\n\nThose travelling imminently or overseas residents can get in touch wih the Passport Office customer service via email at passportreturn@dfa.ie or call +353 (0) 1 613 1780.\n\nAs MCP (Model Context Protocol) becomes the standard for connecting LLMs to tools and data, security teams are moving fast to keep these new services safe.\n\nThis free cheat sheet outlines 7 best practices you can start using today.",

    "description": "After the US raid on Venezuela forced flight cancellations, some travelers can't get home for another week and are having to spend thousands extra.",
    "fullText": "Meghan Lescinskas and her husband were nearing the end of their honeymoon in Saint Lucia when the US launched its raid on Venezuela.\n\nTheir JetBlue flight home to New York was among the nearly 1,000 flights to and from the Caribbean that were canceled last Saturday. The region's airspace was closed for around 24 hours due to the military activity.\n\n\"I understand that this was a rare circumstance, so I called JetBlue and was on hold for hours,\" Lescinskas told Business Insider.\n\nAfter reaching JetBlue via its app's live chat, Lescinskas was offered a flight on January 16, nearly two weeks after her original return date, according to screenshots of her conversation that were shared with Business Insider. Struggling to find affordable alternative routes home, she and her husband used a travel agent to find them a flight on Saturday, January 10.\n\n\"Our six-day honeymoon has now turned into a 14-day trip,\" she said. \"I am a teacher and have missed school due to this delay, and we also had to pay for extra nights at our hotel that we had not planned for.\"\n\nWhile airlines have added extra flights to help stranded passengers, some, like Lescinskas, say they are still having to wait another week to get home, spending thousands of dollars on accommodation and alternative flights.\n\nThe Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about how, or whether, people may be compensated or refunded.\n\nOn Saturday, January 3, Warren Doyle, a retired airline pilot, was in St Thomas in the Virgin Islands with his family, a party of six. After checking their flight status all morning, he said it wasn't until around 4:30 p.m. that he received a notification their American Airlines flight home had been canceled.\n\n\"We started hunting for accommodation Saturday afternoon, and there was nothing. There was nothing, nothing, nothing,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nEventually, they were able to find two rooms for a night at a three-star hotel. \"It's a very rough part of town,\" he said, with music from nearby venues playing until 3 a.m.\n\nDoyle said he booked a Spirit Airlines flight home to Charlotte, North Carolina, via Florida, arriving early on the morning of Saturday, January 10 — a full week after he was first supposed to fly home.\n\n\"I can't speak to other islands, but St. Thomas is a mess,\" he told Business Insider. \"American's apathy is unbelievable.\"\n\n\"It's costing us, for six people, almost $1,000 a day,\" he added.\n\nAmerican Airlines did not respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nSince Sunday, American has added more than 50 extra flights to and from the Caribbean, but listed just one out of St Thomas, which departed Sunday.\n\n\"Every time I hear an airplane go over here, I look outside and see what it is. I see a lot of private traffic — loads and loads of corporate jets in and out,\" Doyle said. Flightradar24 data showed 17 business jets departed St Thomas on Monday.\n\nLescinskas said that she was struggling to get a refund for her canceled flight as she was \"going back and forth\" between JetBlue and Sandals, the resort through which her trip was booked.\n\nA JetBlue spokesperson told Business Insider that, after scheduling additional flights, it offered Lescinskas a flight on Friday, but she chose to stay with her new booking on a different airline. \"After confirming their decision, JetBlue submitted the authorization for the travel agent to refund the fare of their JetBlue flight,\" they added.\n\n\"We remain focused on supporting those affected by Saturday's forced closure of Caribbean airspace,\" the spokesperson said. JetBlue has added more than 30 extra flights so far, they said.\n\nIn a statement, Sandals Resorts said its priority is to support guests and said it has offered reduced rates, waived penalties, and let guests extend their stays due to the airspace closure.\n\nDoyle and his family found another place to stay until their flight out on Friday. \"We're fortunately comfortable where we are,\" he said. \"We're just taking it a day at a time.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine being stuck in a position where you have limited funds, or you're running up your credit card account. It runs into thousands of dollars in no time at all.\"\n\nMany of the extra flights have been operating from Puerto Rico, but travelers on other islands have limited options to get there due to high demand and the fact that inter-island flights use small airplanes.\n\n\"How there can be a 10-day kickback of disruption just blows my mind,\" said the former airline pilot. \"It's not like we're in Outer Mongolia, we're in the Caribbean. We're a stone's throw from the mainland of the United States.\"",

    "fullText": "Fresh from a dramatic weekend in the Premier League title race, Aston Villa travel to Selhurst Park on Wednesday night knowing that a victory could propel them into second place.\n\nUnai Emery’s side recently dispatched Nottingham Forest 3-1 to keep pace with the leaders, but they face a historical “bogey” ground in South London. Crystal Palace find themselves in a mid-winter slump, having failed to win in their last seven matches, but the Eagles have traditionally dominated Villa at home, winning nine of their 13 Premier League encounters at Selhurst Park.\n\nWith Villa level on points with Manchester City following the Citizens’ recent 1-1 draw with Chelsea, the stakes for this road trip have never been higher for the high-flying Villans. Despite their lofty league position, Villa have conceded 14 goals in their last four games against Palace—as many as they had in the previous 15 meetings combined. Emery will be desperate to break his personal jinx against Oliver Glasner, having never beaten the Austrian in six previous meetings.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 7 January 2026\n\nLast Meeting: Aston Villa 0–3 Crystal Palace, 31 August 2025, Premier League\n\nOliver Glasner’s squad depth is being tested to the limit following a bruising encounter at Newcastle. Nathaniel Clyne (abductor) and Jefferson Lerma (concussion) are both ruled out, joining long-term absentees Daichi Kamada, Daniel Muñoz, and Cheick Doucouré on the sidelines. In a significant boost, Chris Richards is set to return to the matchday squad, though he is likely to start on the bench. The Eagles may hand a full debut to club-record signing Brennan Johnson, who joined from Tottenham last week.\n\nThe visitors are sweating on the fitness of defensive mainstays Tyrone Mings and Pau Torres, with both players facing late tests after lengthy injury layoffs. Midfielders Amadou Onana and Ross Barkley remain unavailable, while Evann Guessand is away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast. In their absence, the partnership of Youri Tielemans and Boubacar Kamara is expected to continue in the engine room.\n\nPalace boast incredible home dominance in this fixture, winning six of their last seven home games against Villa. This includes the last three in a row by a combined score of 10-1. Jean-Philippe Mateta remains the man to watch; he has been involved in nine goals against Villa—more than against any other Premier League side. However, the Eagles enter this clash without a win in their last seven outings across all competitions.\n\nVilla have been in sensational form, particularly Ollie Watkins, who has scored six goals since the start of December—more than any other player in the division. A win tonight would take Villa to 45+ points after 21 games for only the third time in their history. Notably, on both previous occasions they reached this milestone (1895-96 and 1898-99), they went on to win the league title.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted XI: Henderson; Canvot, Lacroix, Guéhi; Rodney, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell; Johnson, Pino; Mateta\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Martínez; Cash, Konsa, Lindelöf, Maatsen; Kamara, Tielemans; McGinn, Rogers, Buendía; Watkins\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports+. Coverage begins at 18:00 GMT, with the game kicking off at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead more- Pep Guardiola reacts to Ruben Amorim sacking by Man Utd\n\nSee Also- Two surprise Man Utd candidates emerge as new manager search underway\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Manchester United travel to Turf Moor tonight while they begin a new chapter under interim head coach Darren Fletcher.\n\nDarren Fletcher takes charge following Ruben Amorim’s departure. Notably, the interim manager abandons the previous tactical setup for a traditional 4-2-3-1 system. Desperately, Fletcher aims to secure a first victory of 2026. Crucially, he must capitalise on Burnley’s poor run of form to aid United’s Champions League push.\n\nFortunately, Darren Fletcher receives an immediate boost. Specifically, club captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount return to the fold. In fact, Fernandes could slot straight back into the starting XI to provide a creative spark. However, United remain without Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo, and Noussair Mazraoui due to AFCON commitments.\n\nUnfortunately, injuries deplete the defensive unit. Specifically, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, and Kobbie Mainoo remain sidelined. Consequently, Ayden Heaven looks set to partner Lisandro Martinez in central defence. In attack, Matheus Cunha will likely support Benjamin Sesko. Finally, Fletcher wants his players to “express themselves” in this freer system.\n\nManchester United predicted XI: Lammens; Dalot, Heaven, Martinez, Shaw; Casemiro, Ugarte; Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha; Sesko\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at Turf Moor on Wednesday, 7 January 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:15 GMT.\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League.\n\nRead more- Pep Guardiola reacts to Ruben Amorim sacking by Man Utd\n\nSee Also- Two surprise Man Utd candidates emerge as new manager search underway\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Wolves travel to Liverpool tonight while they seek to build on their first victory of the Premier League season.\n\nRob Edwards finally secured three points with a dominant 3-0 win over West Ham at the weekend, snapping a 19-game winless run. While they remain at the bottom of the table, the victory has injected vital confidence into the squad. Edwards must now address his side’s poor away record, as the Old Gold have yet to win on the road this term.\n\nRob Edwards manages several significant absentees but is boosted by some positive fitness updates. Hwang Hee-chan and João Gomes are both expected to be fit after overcoming knocks sustained in the win over West Ham. However, captain Toti remains sidelined, and Emmanuel Agbadou is away on AFCON duty with Ivory Coast. Rodrigo Gomes and Marshall Munetsi are also nearing returns but are unlikely to start tonight.\n\nThe visitors are expected to name a largely unchanged side following their impressive performance at Molineux. Jhon Arias, who scored his first goal for the club last time out, will likely continue in midfield alongside André and Mateus Mane. Notably, Hwang Hee-chan reached 30 Premier League goal involvements for the club at the weekend and will be the focal point of the attack alongside Jorgen Strand Larsen. Edwards will be relying on this pair to end Wolves’ open-play goal drought away from home.\n\nWolves predicted XI: Sá; S. Bueno, Mosquera, Krejčí; Tchatchoua, Arias, André, Mané, H. Bueno; Arokodare, Larsen\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Hill Dickinson Stadium on Wednesday, 7 January 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 19:30 GMT.\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports F1 and Sky Sports+.

    "description": "As a child-free couple with remote jobs, we choose not to spend Christmas and New Year's gathering with family. Instead, we travel somewhere new.",
    "fullText": "When most of us think of the holidays, we picture spending them with family — and that's exactly what my husband and I did for over 20 years.\n\nOur tradition was to stay in Los Angeles to be with my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, who all lived within driving distance of our home.\n\nIt was always fun eating tamales, dancing to traditional ranchero music, and laughing at my dad's nonsensical jokes. However, as time has passed, things have changed.\n\nOld relationships ended, and new ones began, and loved ones passed away, including my dad and grandparents. Life also took a big turn once my husband and I both started working remotely in 2020.\n\nSince then, we've become much more spontaneous and creative about how we spend the holidays. We never really know where we'll be, and that's part of what makes it so exciting.\n\nMy husband and I are close to our families, so sometimes it still feels a little weird not to spend the holidays with them. But they're supportive of our travels, and we see them throughout the year.\n\nBecause we have no children or pets, we try to make the most of our flexibility and freedom. This is especially true during the holidays, when we usually have one to two weeks off from work.\n\nIt's a chance for us to rest (and reset) our minds, and enjoy each other's company without worrying about deadlines and meetings.\n\nFor the first couple of trips on our own, we stayed within driving distance of home.\n\nAfter several days in Phoenix during the 2021 Christmas holiday break, we rented a condo in the Catalina Foothills of Tucson. It had the most magnificent views of the city, and that trip remains one of my all-time favorites.\n\nAside from our daily walks among the saguaro cactuses, we didn't do anything major, which was exactly the point.\n\nIt was enough to take in the views, bask in the sunshine, and visit a couple of fantastic local spots — Coronet, a top-notch restaurant-bar with a charming outdoor patio, and Motosonora Brewing Company, a cool tap room and beer garden.\n\nThe following year, we continued the relaxed desert theme and spent the holidays in Palm Springs and Joshua Tree, where a couple of friends met up with us. We loved the wide-open skies, stunning natural landscapes, and the overall slower pace.\n\nIn 2023, we wanted to go bigger, so we splurged on a 10-day vacation to Isla Mujeres, a tiny island off the coast of Cancún.\n\nThough this wasn't our favorite trip — and we made a few mistakes planning it — swimming in the warm turquoise waters of the Caribbean was incredible, and we don't regret the experience.\n\nMost recently, we spent the 2025 to 2026 holiday season in Paris, a trip we didn't even plan until the last minute.\n\nMy husband grew up on the East Coast and has missed having a wintry Christmas ever since we've been together, so we figured we may as well go to our favorite city.\n\nIt was magical. From the gorgeous store decorations and festive street lights to the outdoor Christmas markets and cafés serving vin chaud (mulled hot wine), it felt like we were living in a holiday movie — one that we didn't want to end.\n\nFortunately, it didn't have to. Although the holidays are officially over, we were able to extend our stay in Paris through February, where we'll continue working remotely.\n\nThough we absolutely love to travel, we're not wealthy, so we're always mindful of our expenses. But when we feel it's worth it, we don't hesitate because we know life is short, nothing lasts forever, and we want to follow our bliss while we can.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kaci Jane Hansen. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning on January 3rd, I was putting my suitcases in the back of an Uber and heading to the airport in San Juan after a Puerto Rican New Year's celebration with friends. They had all left on the 2nd, but my flight was early the next morning.\n\nA text came through to say my flight had been delayed by 360 minutes.\n\nOnce I got to the airport, it was totally chaotic. People were crying, and there was hardly space to move.\n\nI soon realized my flight wasn't just delayed — I wouldn't be getting back to New York that day. It was later confirmed that my flight had been canceled.\n\nI got on the phone with Delta to try to rebook my flight, and was told by an automated voice message that it would be a two-hour wait. When a representative finally came on the line, the call was accidentally ended. I phoned back and was told I would have to wait nine hours to speak with someone.\n\nWhile waiting on the phone, I made my way back to my hotel, where I had a quick sleep because my booking hadn't run over yet. But when I woke, I had to check out. There were people and suitcases in the lobby, everyone trying to get a room.\n\nDelta rebooked my flight for Thursday, January 8th, my birthday, and five days after my original flight was meant to be.\n\nJust out of curiosity, I checked to see how much it would cost to charter a private flight — it was about $22,000, which is clearly too expensive for me to afford.\n\nI managed to book an Airbnb until Thursday. I was really lucky to get somewhere because when I was looking, the availability just kept disappearing.\n\nAlthough I feel very fortunate to have a flight booked and a safe place to stay, I am terrified about how this may impact my work.\n\nFor the last year, I have been auditioning all over the US for a part in a production. I got it. It was going to be my big break. I told everyone about it and planned my life around the filming, which starts on January 6th.\n\nI'll still be stuck in Puerto Rico when filming starts.\n\nThe production team could cut me in two seconds. It would be perfectly justified if they did. That would mean that a year of sacrificing and working endlessly would have been for nothing. And what if I don't get another chance like this ever again, to do a job that I have worked so hard for?\n\nNo one is paying for this — for being stuck in Puerto Rico — except for me.\n\nI've had to shell out at least $3,000 for the extra five days here. That's a lot of money I didn't budget to spend. Everything I'm spending is out of pocket — I'll never get reimbursed.\n\nAnd if they drop me from this role, my next paycheck isn't going to come.\n\nEach time I think about the impact this delay in Puerto Rico could have on the future of my career, I get anxious and tearful. I'm trying, I'm really trying, to have a sense of humor and see some bright side in all this, but I'm struggling right now.",

    "description": "Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport has experienced five days of mass cancellations and huge delays due to snow.",
    "fullText": "Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport has led the world in cancellations over the past few days as snow disrupted travel in the Netherlands.\n\nMore than 2,700 flights were canceled in and out of the Dutch capital between last Friday and Tuesday, as of 4 p.m. per data from FlightAware.\n\nIn that time, the cancellation rate rose from 28% to around half of all scheduled flights.\n\nHandling over 66 million passengers a year, Amsterdam is the fourth-busiest airport in Europe and is a major hub for transcontinental travellers.\n\nAs it has a temperate climate and is near the sea, snow is relatively rare in Amsterdam. As such, when it does happen, it can have an outsize impact on travel. This week, several issues, including the snow, high winds, and a lack of capacity for de-icing planes in the cold weather, have combined to exacerbate the disruption at Schiphol Airport.\n\nData from Flightradar24 showed the chaos on the tarmac on Monday.\n\nA KLM flight was supposed to take off for London at 9 a.m. But after it left the gate, it taxied around the airport twice before going back to the gate after almost two and a half hours.\n\nFlight-tracking data also showed how an Emirates Airbus A380 spent three hours on the tarmac after landing before being able to move to its assigned gate.\n\nIt later flew back to Dubai, seven hours behind schedule.\n\nFor about an hour on Monday morning, some incoming flights had to divert while the weather was at its worst, an airport spokesperson said.\n\nThese included an Air Canada flight that diverted to Frankfurt, Germany; two KLM flights from South America that landed in Paris; and a Garuda Indonesia flight from Jakarta that ended up in Brussels.\n\nFlights that were still able to take off from Schiphol have faced average delays of almost two hours.\n\nWith temperatures below freezing, the delays are, in part, being caused by queues for de-icing. Every plane has to be clear of snow and ice before it can take off.\n\nKLM, the Dutch flag carrier, said it is responsible for de-icing most of the planes at Schiphol. However, it added, stocks of de-icing fluid are running low and its German supplier \"is unable to guarantee timely replenishment.\"\n\n\"This challenge is currently widespread across Europe,\" the airline said. \"KLM is doing everything possible to secure additional supply, for example, KLM will collect the fluid itself in Germany.\"\n\nIt added that its 25 de-icing trucks have all been in continuous use since Friday, and its team of 100 employees has been working \"around the clock.\"\n\nThe Schiphol spokesperson said the airport is \"continuing to monitor the weather situation closely.\"\n\n\"At present, only limited flight operations are possible,\" they added.\n\nAre you caught up in the disruption in Amsterdam?

    "description": "Adapting to the different office etiquette, mealtime norms, and vacation days in France has been tough as someone from England, but I'm glad I moved.",
    "fullText": "In 2017, I quit my job as a paralegal, packed up my life in England, and bought a one-way ticket to Paris.\n\nThe new chapter was full of surprises, and though most of them were positive, I was in for some unexpected challenges in those early months — from navigating the notoriously tricky French bureaucracies (and supremely unhelpful bureaucrats operating them), to the weird and wonderful world of the Parisian soirée.\n\nHowever, the strongest culture shocks came in the workplace, and even now, after eight years in France, I still find aspects of French office culture surprising.\n\nGetting to grips with office etiquette was my first major challenge — and the most urgent to overcome. I was starting a completely new role, in a completely new company, barely three days after arriving in France.\n\nMy title was still paralegal, but even there, my remit couldn't have been more different. To say I had a steep learning curve ahead of me would be an almighty understatement.\n\nI had, at least, anticipated some difficulty addressing people correctly, but that didn't make my (frequent) blunders any less embarrassing.\n\nIn French, there are certain words for \"you\" and different versions of verbs depending on the level of politeness/deference needed. The rules around who you \"tu\" and who you \"vous\" feel nebulous at best — and a total minefield for a (foreign) new recruit.\n\nMeanwhile, social norms I wasn't expecting included greeting everyone who joins you in an elevator, and then wishing them a good day/evening when they/you leave. (People do this in medical waiting rooms here, too. I still haven't gotten used to it.)\n\nIn England, people mostly awkwardly avoid eye contact at all costs in these situations. And if you do accidentally acknowledge someone else's existence, at the very most, you offer them a tight (also awkward) smile.\n\nYou absolutely do not, under any circumstances, talk to them.\n\nIt didn't take me long to realize just how seriously the French take enjoying the enjoyment of mealtimes.\n\nEven my office cafeteria felt like a foodie's dream with a rotating menu of things like duck, salmon, and paella; desserts hand-crafted by a professional pastry chef; fresh bread from the local boulangerie; and literal mounds of cheese\n\nMy lunches were so heavily subsidised by my employer that, unless I wanted a three-course meal or a glass of wine (a girl's got to treat herself occasionally), they were almost always free.\n\nAnd, yes, it's apparently perfectly acceptable to have an alcoholic drink in the middle of the workday in France.\n\nI also quickly learned that mealtimes, like baguettes, are sacred in this country, both for socializing and for savoring.\n\nIt's frowned on to eat at your desk, scarfing down a sandwich while you work (I'm looking at you, England). Here, you sit down around a table, and you enjoy your food.\n\nAccordingly, a two-hour lunch break is also customary; The French are often baffled as to what you're supposed to do with \"only\" an hour.\n\nMy colleagues use their breaks to take or teach classes, exercise, or enjoy a leisurely meal in a restaurant — none of which had ever been possible with the 30 to 60 minutes I'd grown used to back home.\n\nRemember how I said it was acceptable to have a drink with lunch?\n\nApparently, it's also acceptable to have a drink before lunch, after lunch, and at essentially any time of the day, if there's even the smallest occasion to celebrate.\n\nI was served more champagne in my first two months in the office than I had been, cumulatively, in my entire life until that point.\n\nOne time, several bottles were opened for a colleague's going-away breakfast at 11:30 a.m. It was tough going, but I adapted to this particular culture shock as uncomplainingly as I could …\n\nAnother early discovery was that work-life balance is everything in France.\n\nThe culture of competition I'd experienced in England — the peculiar bragging over who was arriving at the office earliest and leaving latest (read: burning out fastest) — was completely absent.\n\nLeisure time feels ferociously protected here, to the extent that employees legally have the \"right to disconnect\" (ignore job-related calls and emails outside work hours) and the French are not shy about enforcing their rights.\n\nAdditionally, when I was informed of my vacation allowance, I was sure I must have mistranslated something: I had over five weeks of annual leave in my first year, and that's not including the 11 public holidays.\n\nIn France, workers are generally required to take at least two consecutive weeks' vacation. These breaks often falls between July and August, and swaths of employees disappear for an entire month.\n\nIt's quite a contrast to the situation I'd left behind in England, where taking two weeks' vacation in a row was considered a real extravagance. This is perhaps unsurprising, given I was never entitled to more than four weeks total annual leave.\n\nThat means everything pretty much grinds to a halt in the summer — pretty inconvenient when you're in the middle of a project and all your colleagues are OOO until September.\n\nBut it also opened my eyes to just how life-changing that kind of balance can be, and has been one of the most incredible parts of relocating to France.\n\nAdapting to such starkly different workplace norms from the ones I'd known in England has been a real roller-coaster ride — but there have definitely been plenty more ups than downs.\n\nUltimately, the experience has been as enjoyable as it has been surprising. Champagne, anyone?",

    "description": "Netflix is releasing a film adaptation of Emily Henry's \"People We Meet on Vacation\" on January 9. Here's what to read after you watch.",
    "fullText": "One of the most highly anticipated book-to-screen adaptations of 2026 is undoubtedly \"People We Meet on Vacation\" by Emily Henry.\n\nHenry smashed onto the romance scene in 2020 with \"Beach Read\" and has written five more books since then, each of which has skyrocketed to The New York Times bestseller list.\n\nHenry's summer romance books often approach love with a sense of honesty and fun that the genre needs to thrive. Her characters may be enemies who find themselves living next door to each other or best friends who are scared to risk it all for something more, as is the case in \"People We Meet on Vacation,\" which has been turned into a film set to debut on Netflix on January 9.\n\nWhether you're already a fan of Henry or are just getting to know her work through the movie, \"People We Meet on Vacation\" will likely leave you wanting more. Here are other romance books that might help you fill the void.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is Henry's third summer romance book, and it's both an epic love story and an ode to books themselves.\n\nNora Stephens doesn't think anything is missing in her life. She loves her job as a literary agent, her apartment in New York, and living near her sister, Libby, and her nieces.\n\nWhen Libby asks Nora to escape to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina, for a month, Nora can't say no, especially since Libby is several months pregnant at the time. Libby has big dreams of small-town romance for Nora during their getaway, but instead of finding a local man to have a fling with, Nora keeps running into Charlie Lastra, a grumpy New York editor she's never gotten along with.\n\nDespite their less-than-romantic history, Charlie and Nora keep crossing paths in Sunshine Falls, making the ever-growing list of things they have in common harder to ignore. And when Nora discovers her life as she knows it is about to change, Charlie might be the exact thing she needs.\n\nHenry is at her best in \"Happy Place,\" a novel that ruminates on what it means to fight for love.\n\nHarriet has spent her entire adult life loving Wyn. Their relationship consumes her, and the fact that she met him through her best friends, Sabrina and Cleo, only makes her love him more. Between Wyn and her friends, Harriet found the family she had always wanted in college, and she plans to spend her entire life with them.\n\nWhen Wyn abruptly breaks up with her after she starts her medical school residency, Harriet is heartbroken and terrified she's going to lose everyone she loves. She manages to avoid telling Sabrina and Cleo what happened for five months, planning to burst their bubble on their annual group trip to Maine.\n\nThen, Harriet is shocked to see Wyn when she arrives, and he informs her that they'll have to pretend to be a couple for the duration of the trip, as it's the last vacation the group will ever spend in the house they've loved for years. Harriet doesn't want to cause her friends pain, so she's willing to torture herself for a week.\n\nAll she has to do is stop herself from asking Wyn what went wrong for seven days, but as his displays of fake affection start to feel more and more real, Harriet might have to face her fear of rocking the boat if she wants a true chance at happiness.\n\nHenry's latest book, \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" takes place in the summer and features a love story, but it marks a departure from her typical romances.\n\nJournalist Alice Scott is ready for the biggest challenge of her career to date: convincing the elusive heiress Margaret Ives to let her write her biography.\n\nSunny-dispositioned and thoughtful Alice is sure she can make Margaret comfortable enough to share the story of why she disappeared from public life years ago. However, when she arrives in Little Crescent Island, Georgia, to meet Margaret, she finds she'll be competing against Hayden Anderson, a grumpy and inconveniently handsome writer who happened to win a Pulitzer Prize for his last biography, to tell Margaret's story.\n\nBeating out Hayden for the role might be an uphill battle, but Alice isn't going down without a fight, even after she realizes Margaret is picking and choosing what she tells each of them after getting them to sign strict NDAs. And as they try to unweave Margaret's history, it will become more and more difficult for Alice and Hayden to ignore the heat between them.\n\nBolu Babalola's \"Honey & Spice\" doesn't feel like a debut novel, as she writes romantic chemistry with a deftness Henry herself may envy.\n\nKiki Banjo has made a name for herself at Whitewell University with her radio show \"Brown Sugar.\" She's staked her reputation on her ability to suss out players, warning her peers in the African-Caribbean Society against dating men who aren't worth their time.\n\nThen she risks it all by kissing Malakai Korede in front of everyone after writing him off as \"The Wastemen of Whitewell\" on her show. Kiki is terrified her show is going to slip through her grasp, so she makes a deal with Malakai to pretend to be a couple in the hopes that Kiki can save her show and Malakai can change his reputation on campus.\n\nKiki expects the duration of their fake romance to be torture, but as she and Malakai eat, study, and spend time together, she's unsettled to discover there seems to be more to him than meets the eye. Will Kiki be willing to let go of her preconceived notions for a chance at something real?\n\nLike Henry, Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master at writing about yearning and epic love, as is obvious in \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.\"\n\nMonique Grant's career as a magazine writer is at a standstill when famous — and famously private — film star Evelyn Hugo says she wants to do a tell-all interview with Monique, and only Monique.\n\nMonique doesn't understand why Evelyn would want to work with her of all people, but she can't say no, especially when Evelyn starts opening up to her about her path to fame and the forbidden love that changed the course of her life. Monique feels like Evelyn has handed her the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nWhen she finds out why Evelyn chose her for the tell-all, Monique will have to face truths about their shared history she never expected.\n\nIf you've already read Henry's \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" you'll swoon for \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.\"\n\nLydia Bird's life is turned upside down when the love of her life, Freddie, dies in a car accident. After months of mourning and wanting to go back in time, Lydia begins to move on with the help of her sister and Freddie's best friend.\n\nThen she's given a way to return to her old life with Freddie, a life where the tragedy never occurred. Her heart is pulled in two directions as she struggles to choose between going back to the familiar and embracing the unknown, where someone new wants to love her.\n\nPoignant and fresh, Josie Silver's \"The Two Lives of Lydia Bird\" is a story of love and hope that strikes a similar tone to Henry's works.\n\nOn the night before Drew Nichols is set to be a groomsman in his ex-girlfriend's wedding, he gets stuck in an elevator with the pretty and funny Alexa Monroe, the first bright spot in what he believes will be an unbearable weekend.\n\nImpulse leads him to ask her to be his date to the wedding, and the duo surprises themselves by having more fun together than they bargained for. They plan to part ways after the wedding, neither interested in a long-distance relationship, but fate might have other plans for them.\n\nJasmine Guillory writes about romance with reverence and joy, making \"The Wedding Date\" an ideal read for Henry lovers.\n\nDannie Kohan's plan is on track. In one day, she performs well at the job interview of a lifetime and agrees to marry her long-term boyfriend. Then, when she goes to sleep that night, she wakes up five years in the future, with a different man beside her and his ring on her finger.\n\nDannie only has one hour in the future before she's yanked back to the present, and she tries to push aside the experience as a vivid dream. Then, she meets the man from her dream four and a half years later and discovers he's dating her best friend. Dannie will have to confront what she really wants and find out if she's willing to change her plans to find true happiness.\n\nRebecca Serle's \"In Five Years\" explores time, grief, and all-consuming love, both romantic and platonic, in the same way Henry's books do, challenging the reader to ask themselves how far they would go for true happiness.\n\nAlthough Sally Rooney's beloved \"Normal People\" has a darker tone than Henry's books, the protagonists, Connell and Marianne, have a chemistry and a years-long history that Henry fans will love.\n\nConnell and Marianne meet in high school, when Connell is a popular jock, and Marianne is, well, the opposite. The two bond despite their differences, setting them on a course that will shape their lives, drawing them back to one another over and over again.\n\nRooney's novel shows the inevitability of love, finding words for the often inexplicable reasons people need each other. You can also stream the Hulu series once you finish the book.\n\nLike Henry, Carley Fortune captures the angst and ecstasy of summer love in \"One Golden Summer.\"\n\nAlice can trace back her successful photography career to one photo: a candid shot of three teenagers on a bright yellow speedboat. She captured the shot during the one summer she spent at Barry's Bay with her Nan when she was 17, and it shifted the trajectory of her life.\n\nFifteen years later, Alice should be living her dream as a professional photographer, but six months after a breakup, she feels stuck and uninspired. When Nan breaks her hip, Alice thinks spending another summer at Barry's Bay might be good for them both.\n\nHer vision of a tranquil summer with her grandmother gets upended by Charlie Florek, one of the teens from Alice's famous photo. The glimpse of Charlie that she got across the lake all those years ago was intriguing, but adult Charlie is so devastatingly handsome and thoughtful that he almost scares Alice.\n\nAs they spend the summer together, Charlie heals wounds in Alice that she didn't know were there. If he lets her in, Alice might just do the same for Charlie.\n\nIlya Rozanov and Shane Hollander are supposed to hate each other. Not only have they been competing against each other in hockey since they were 18, but they're also total opposites. Canadian Shane is cautious and focused, while Russian wildcard Ilya isn't afraid to embrace his bad boy reputation on the ice.\n\nThey have one big thing in common, though: the secret hookups they can't seem to resist every time they see each other. If the world found out about their relationship, both Ilya and Shane's careers could be in jeopardy, but they may decide it's worth the risk for a chance at something real with each other.\n\nLike Henry's \"PWMOV,\" Rachel Reid's \"Heated Rivalry\" got adapted, though into a hit TV show instead of a movie, so you can stream the series if you want more from the characters when you finish the book.\n\nChristina Lauren has written dozens of books, but their 2018 novel \"Love & Other Words\" is perfect for fans of \"People We Meet on Vacation\" because of its dual timeline.\n\nMacy Sorensen has been white-knuckling her way through life for nearly a decade, but she's content with the safe world she's constructed for herself. A pediatric resident and newly engaged to a kind man who makes her feel mostly nothing, Macy thinks her heart is safe from the turmoil she experienced in her adolescence — until Elliot Petropoulos literally walks back into her life.\n\nMacy met Elliot as a teen shortly after her mother died, and he quickly became her center of gravity as she visited the small town he called home on weekends. Christina Lauren tells their story from the past and present, showing readers how they became fast friends over books and adolescent secrets, how they fell into life-changing love, and the wreckage they were both left with when it all fell apart.\n\nAfter 10 years of no contact, Macy may finally be ready to tell Elliot why she went radio silent on him after one fateful night. They'll both have to decide if they can move on from the pain of the past for a chance at a joy-filled future, together.\n\nAchingly romantic and surprisingly funny, \"The Seven Year Slip\" by Ashley Poston is about meeting the right person at the wrong time, literally.\n\nClementine West has been adrift since her beloved aunt died. She thought living in the Upper East Side apartment she inherited from her would make her feel closer to her, as the apartment's magic had always drawn her in. Instead, she feels like she's just waiting for her aunt to walk through the door.\n\nThen, Clementine comes home one day to a man she doesn't know standing in her kitchen. Except, he thinks the apartment is his, for the summer anyway. He exists seven years in the past, staying in the apartment over the summer while Clementine and her aunt were in Europe.\n\nClementine isn't ready to be hurt by love again, but she might not be able to keep up her defenses against the sweet chef staying the summer. And if she does let herself fall, will they work together if she finds him again in the now?\n\nJustin and Emma are having the same dating problem. Everyone they date meets their soulmate immediately after they break up with them.\n\nWhen Emma sees Justin's viral Reddit post about his problem, she reaches out, and they decide to go on a date with each other in the hopes of breaking their curse.\n\nEmma, a traveling nurse, plans to stay in Minnesota for the summer and enjoy a fling with Justin during her short stay. The last thing either expects is to get immediately attached, especially when they both have family members counting on them come fall.\n\nDespite their best-laid plans, Emma and Justin's curse might have been leading them to each other all along in \"Just for the Summer\" by Abby Jimenez.\n\nTo the world, romance novelist Eva Mercy and acclaimed literary author Shane Hall have nothing to do with each other. That's because the only two people who know their books are inspired by each other are Eva and Shane.\n\nFor their entire careers, Shane and Eva have been writing secret love letters to each other, as the week they spent as teens glued to each other's sides in a rush of love still haunts them both years later.\n\nThey finally come face-to-face again when they both speak on a Brooklyn literary panel, and despite the years since they've seen each other, their chemistry is undeniable. Eva doesn't trust Shane after the way things went down between them, though, and as a single mom, she can't risk getting hurt again.\n\nStill, Eva has always been curious to know why Shane disappeared, and reuniting with him might be the key to breaking her writer's block.\n\nThe second-chance romance in Tia Williams' \"Seven Days in June\" will hit the spot for Henry's fans.\n\nOf Ali Hazelwood's nine romance novels, the coming-of-age story and yearning in \"Deep End\" are most similar to the themes of \"People We Meet on Vacation.\"\n\nNearly every moment of Scarlett Vandermeer's life at Stanford is accounted for. She spends her days in the pool as a member of the diving team or studying, laser-focused on achieving her goal of getting into medical school.\n\nA relationship or even a fling is the last thing on Scarlett's mind. Then, she finds out Lukas Blomqvist, Stanford's world champion swim captain who thrives on control, has similar interests to her when it comes to intimacy, and she thinks she might be able to make time in her busy schedule for something casual.\n\nLukas and Scarlett agree to explore their attraction together, deciding not to tell almost anyone about their arrangement. Scarlett doesn't think keeping her relationship with Lukas to herself will be a problem until she realizes the last thing she feels about him is casual.\n\n\"Same Time Next Summer\" by Annabel Monaghan offers another take on second-chance romance.\n\nSam's family's beach house on Long Island was her happy place in her childhood. She spent every summer there, and she was never happier than she was with her toes in the sand. Then, at 17, Wyatt broke her heart, and Sam couldn't face a summer there without him. She hasn't been back for more than a long weekend since.\n\nAt 30, Sam is making the trek from the city back to the beach, and she isn't the girl she was at 17. She's determined to succeed at her high-powered job and plan the perfect wedding with her fiancé, Jack, whose tendency to over-schedule their lives has become a comfort.\n\nOnly when she arrives, Sam discovers that Wyatt has returned to the house next door, and the entire adult life she created for herself begins to crumble. As old feelings come rushing back, Sam will have to take stock of who she is, who she wants to be, and who she really wants to live her life with.\n\nWhen Phoebe Stone arrives at the Cornwall Inn in Rhode Island, she's dressed to the nines and doesn't intend to ever check out. Her plans immediately go awry, though, when she discovers the entire hotel has been rented out for a wedding, and the attendees immediately assume she's one of the wedding people.\n\nSoon, Phoebe has no choice but to participate in the wedding festivities, especially because she and the bride keep telling each other their darkest secrets.\n\nAfter months of depression, the fanfare and plot twist of a stranger's wedding might just show Phoebe her own path forward.\n\nSlightly more melancholy in tone than Henry's works but still beautifully romantic, \"The Wedding People\" by Alison Espach is about the surprises life can bring when you least expect it.",

    "description": "Recent travel chaos in the Caribbean confirmed writer Meagan Drillinger's must-have packing list, including a laptop, earplugs, swimsuit, and more.",
    "fullText": "I travel for a living, which means my work and my income depend on the assumption that I can get from one place to another without everything falling apart.\n\nThis weekend's travel chaos in the Caribbean hit close to home. As flights were canceled and people were stranded for days, I was reflecting on more than just missed vacations. I thought about travelers who couldn't get back to work, couldn't get back to their routines, or didn't have the necessary tools to function once the plan unraveled.\n\nI've been close to that edge before. In early 2020, I was in Colombia just days before airports worldwide began shutting down due to the COVID pandemic. There was a very real moment when I wasn't sure I'd be able to leave the country. I wouldn't pretend that having the \"right\" things with me made me relaxed. In fact, relaxed wasn't a word in my vocabulary at all as I meandered the aisles of Colombian grocery stores, stocking up on ramen and toilet paper for whatever lockdown I was facing back in the US.\n\nGetting stranded is terrible when all you want is to go home. But the travel essentials I had with me made one thing clear: life could still go on, even when the world got rocked. That's shaped how I travel ever since.\n\nFor me, the ability to work from anywhere isn't a productivity flex or a digital nomad brag; it's a necessity. It's a safety net. Here's what I always have with me, and why I would never travel without these things, even on trips that are supposed to be about unplugging.\n\nI'd never, ever go anywhere without my laptop, even on a getaway that's meant to be a break from work.\n\nWhen plans unravel, your laptop becomes leverage. It buys you time, flexibility, and options. I've watched travelers stranded without laptops scrambling to borrow devices, sending frantic messages from phones, or explaining to employers why they suddenly couldn't do their jobs. I refuse to add \"unemployed\" to an already stressful situation.\n\nIt also doubles as your entertainment system when you've got an indeterminate amount of hours to kill. On that note, add a VPN to your list so you can access all your streaming services from any ISP address.\n\nWhen flights get canceled, outlets become scarce, and airports turn into makeshift bedrooms. A portable battery bank — one powerful enough to charge a laptop, not just a phone — means I'm not fighting strangers for wall space just to stay online.\n\nI've filed stories from airport floors using a power bank while entire terminals went dark. It's not glamorous, but it works.\n\nI always carry my passport, even when I'm flying domestically. Plans change. Routes get rerouted. Borders get strange quickly. It's one of those items you hope you never need, but absolutely don't want to be without when things stop making sense.\n\nI travel with more medication than I think I'll need: pain relievers, anti-diarrheal meds, Pepto, and electrolytes, all on top of prescriptions. Delays stretch, and pharmacies close. When your body starts failing on top of travel disruptions, everything feels 10 times worse.\n\nWhen travel collapses, food becomes unpredictable fast.\n\nRestaurants close. Airports sell out. Hunger makes decision-making worse. Protein bars won't solve the problem, but they'll keep you steady enough to solve everything else, especially when your only restaurant option is the TGIFridays in the parking lot of whatever airport hotel you're crashing in.\n\nRest becomes currency when you're stuck. Earplugs and an eye mask make it possible to sleep in loud terminals or unfamiliar rooms. When it comes to socks and underwear, always pack more than you think you need. If the trip stretches and laundry access disappears, comfort suddenly matters more than aesthetics.\n\nThis sounds frivolous until it isn't. If you're stuck somewhere longer than planned, access to water can be a grounding experience. Pools, hot springs, beaches, and hotel spas can sometimes be the only places where your nervous system gets a break.\n\nDeadlines don't care about travel delays. I've filed stories from airport floors, hotel lobbies, and — more times than I can count — from the passenger seat of a moving car. On a cross-country road trip, I was constantly taking interviews, answering editors, and filing stories while the prairies of North Dakota and the Canadian Rockies rolled past my window.\n\nA portable WiFi device or a reliable international data plan means I'm not dependent on hotel routers, café passwords, or the hope that WiFi will magically work when I need it most. When travel breaks down, connectivity is the difference between falling behind and staying afloat.\n\nI never travel without insurance. After a travel companion was in a serious motorbike accident in Thailand and spent a week in a Thai hospital — fully covered because we had travel insurance — I stopped thinking of it as optional.\n\nYou don't have to travel for a living to learn these lessons. Whether you're a business traveler, a freelancer, or someone who just wants to make it home on time, disruptions can happen to anyone.\n\nPacking with the assumption that things might go wrong isn't pessimistic — it's practical. When travel breaks down, the ability to keep working, stay healthy, and remain connected becomes more than convenience. It becomes stability.\n\nDo you have any work-related travel tips you'd like to share? Email this editor, Agnes Applegate, at aapplegate@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "After moving from West Virginia to Miami in South Florida a few years ago, I've fallen in love with the great weather and budget travel deals.",
    "fullText": "Throughout my childhood, my family barely strayed from the parts of West Virginia's Appalachia region where I was born and raised.\n\nI spent college two hours away in Ohio, and during those years, I started traveling around the United States and to more distant places in Europe and Latin America.\n\nI love exploring the world, so when it was time to graduate and start a life somewhere new, I applied to jobs all around the country.\n\nI took the first one I could get, and it happened to be in Miami. I'd never been to Florida before, but I quickly found things in Dade County I enjoyed.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of living here, there are three big things I love about living in Miami — and one thing I still miss about West Virginia.\n\nA lot of people have opinions about this one, but as someone who grew up in a colder climate, I much prefer Miami weather.\n\nSummer aside, most weeks are sunny and fairly comfortable with a lot of days between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are pleasantly short, sunny, and warm.\n\nI also struggle with depression, which can be impacted by the seasons, so having the ability to go outside and get some sunshine any time of the year is a major bonus for me.\n\nThough summertime in Miami can be uncomfortably hot and humid and hurricane season is no joke, I still prefer the weather here to any place that experiences a harsher winter.\n\nAs a travel writer, I'm constantly booking trips and visiting new cities and countries. And when I'm not hopping on a plane or road tripping to a different part of Florida, I can still experience a variety of communities and cultures in Miami.\n\nMost people know Miami for its Cuban influence, but the city is also home to a huge variety of expats from other parts of Latin America, like Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.\n\nThere's also a lot of diversity from other parts of the world, too. For example, Miami Beach has one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel, and there's also a huge variety of Bahamian, Jamaican and other Caribbean cultures here.\n\nMiami is constantly growing and changing, and I love that I can learn about so many different cultures without traveling too far.\n\nOne of my favorite perks of living in Miami truly is how easy and convenient it is to travel from the city.\n\nFor starters, there are two major airports nearby — Miami International Airport (MIA) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL).\n\nMiami is also the cruise capital of the world, and there are constantly ships sailing from the ports in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nI'm a budget traveler at heart, and I've scored some incredible travel deals from South Florida. I regularly find flights to Europe for less than $400 from these airports, and I can fly to many places around the US for less than $150.\n\nSince I moved to Florida, I've developed a deep appreciation for the beach. However, I still definitely miss the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nThey're the oldest mountain range in the United States, and these rolling hills are the perfect place for exploring. My favorite time to visit West Virginia is in the late spring or early summer when the trees are at their fullest and brightest.\n\nPalm trees are beautiful, but I definitely miss how serene and peaceful nature can be in West Virginia — especially when compared to how busy and chaotic Miami can feel sometimes.",

    "description": "Christine Sauvé, 55, and husband Alain Noël, 56, were found dead by their son in their Dominican Republic vacation home on the morning of Dec. 26",
    "fullText": "The bodies of Alain Noël, 56, and Christine Sauvé, 55, of Québec, were found by their son at the couple’s vacation home in the Dominican Republic on Dec. 26\n\nHer brother tells PEOPLE that the couple hadn't been feeling well before their deaths and seemed \"exhausted\" when they last spoke the following day\n\nA married couple from Canada were found dead while vacationing in the Dominican Republic last month. As family members await answers about what happened, they're speaking out about the couple's final moments.\n\nChristine Sauvé, 55, and Alain Noël, 56, both of Québec, were found dead by their son in their vacation home located in the El Indio Village residential complex in Villa Riva on Friday, Dec. 26, her brother, Gilles Sauvé Jr., confirms to PEOPLE.\n\nAutopsies have already been performed and Gilles says the family's been told they can expect initial results later this week, but that a final report could take up to 4 months.\n\nWithout any definitive answers just yet, there's been lots of speculation in the local press, including questions about whether the couple were murdered or died by suicide. But, Gilles believes \"that is not true.\"\n\nChristine and Alain were married for over 30 years and raised two kids — Jonathan, 30, and Sabrina, 28 — Gilles says, describing the couple as good people with lots of friends.\n\n\"Alain was a big man but a really big teddy bear. And Christine was amazing,\" her brother says. \"She liked to do a lot of things for the family.”\n\nChristine and Alain arrived in the Dominican Republic — where they got a house they planned to live in after retiring — along with their son Jonathan on Dec. 14 for the start of a month-long vacation.\n\nWhile overseas, Gilles says that Christine began experiencing dizziness and had a fall, which prompted her to go to a hospital on Dec. 25, where she had her blood work done. When she went home later that day, she was not given any prescription for her symptoms, but was told to come back the following day for some scans.\n\nGilles says that Alain had also experienced a little dizziness, but was so caught up in worry about his wife's health that he didn't end up mentioning it to doctors.\n\nAfter coming back from the hospital, the couple FaceTimed their family back in Canada. Gilles says they both appeared to be a \"little bit exhausted,\" but didn't report feeling dizzy at the time.\n\nDuring the conversation, Christine mentioned having no clue what caused the dizziness. She wondered if it might have anything to do with her ongoing health issues — they both had high blood pressure and diabetes — although she couldn't say for sure.\n\n\"It was not clear,\" Gilles says. \"There was nothing really clear about it.\"\n\nAdditionally, they both mentioned having a bit of a \"stomach problem,\" but didn't think they'd eaten any food that upset them.\n\nMostly, they were \"very tired and exhausted,\" but otherwise fine during the call, according to Gilles.\n\n\"Alain showed me his house outside because he did some new little garden things and put lights on and,\" he says, adding that his sister was also \"looking and talking\" well.\n\nThe next morning, when Jonathan woke up around 9:30 a.m., he noticed his parents hadn’t gotten up yet, which was odd because Alain, who worked in the family construction business, was usually an early riser.\n\nGilles says Jonathan brushed it off at the time, thinking they'd slept in because they'd been so tired the night before. However, when they still hadn't woken up an hour later, he went into their room and found them unresponsive in bed.\n\nThe first thing that Jonathan did, says Gilles, was call his sister Sabrina and tell her that their parents were not breathing. Sabrina then told her brother to call the resort manager-owner, who proceeded to contact local authorities.\n\n“Everybody came and they did what they had to do and they searched the house,” Gilles says.\n\nGilles and Sabrina arrived in the Dominican Republic about a day and a half later to be with Jonathan and help communicate with Dominican authorities, which have been difficult due to the language barrier.\n\nCanadian officials reached out to the family four days later to give them the phone number of the funeral home, which they'd already reached out to.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada previously confirmed their deaths to Global News, saying they were in contact with local authorities \"to gather more information\" amid the ongoing investigation, but were not able to release any further information due to privacy considerations.\n\nNeither the Dominican National Police, the National Institute of Forensic Sciences, the Attorney General’s Office in the Dominican Republic nor Global Affairs Canada responded to PEOPLE's request for additional comment.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nMore than a week after the tragedy, Gilles says the family is doing okay, but the deaths of their loved ones have been hard to process.\n\n“It's a big loss,\" he says, noting that losing them both at the same time has made everything harder, especially for their kids.\n\nAs for how he wants Alain and Christine to be remembered, her brother says it's for their legacy of kindness.\n\nSharing an example, Gilles says that when his wife died a year and a half ago from leukemia, his sister stepped up to help take care of his daughter, who also works in the family business. Now, in the wake of his sister's death, he says he'll do whatever he can to be there for her kids.\n\nGilles adds, \"I have two kids, but now I have four kids because I will take care of theirs.”",

    "fullText": "Almost 1,000 flights to and from the Caribbean were canceled on Saturday after the US raid on Venezuela.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration banned commercial aircraft from flying over Venezuelan airspace before expanding restrictions to much of the Caribbean.\n\nPuerto Rico was the most affected, with 400 flights canceled to or from the main airport in San Juan.\n\nThere were also over 140 cancellations in the US Virgin Islands, and 91 in Aruba, which is only about 20 miles off the Venezuelan coast.\n\nUsing data from FlightAware, Business Insider put together this map to show the scale of the disruption. You can hover over an icon to see the number of cancellations at the airport.\n\nAfter airspace restrictions ended early Sunday, airlines added dozens of extra flights to help passengers get where they needed to go.\n\nThe region is a particularly popular destination for vacationers seeking some winter sun over the New Year holiday.\n\nAmerican Airlines added 43 extra flights on Sunday and Monday, with room for 7,000 passengers.\n\nFor the first time in over a decade, it operated interisland flights in the eastern Caribbean on Monday. Namely, to Puerto Rico from Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands.\n\nAmerican's expanded schedule included deploying a Boeing 777-300, the largest model in its fleet, to ferry passengers between Miami and Puerto Rico.\n\nUnited Airlines listed 17 additional flights scheduled for Sunday and Monday, to and from its hubs in Houston, Newark, and Washington, DC.\n\nDelta Air Lines said that it has added space for 2,600 people on Monday. It didn't immediately provide details of the extra flights it has scheduled.\n\nA spokesperson for Southwest Airlines told Business Insider that it has added 21 round-trip flights to Aruba and Puerto Rico between Sunday and Wednesday.\n\nAirlines have waived change fees and fare differences for passengers flying to or from the Caribbean, to rebook for flights later in the month.\n\nHave you been affected by the travel disruption in the Caribbean?

    "description": "Two years ago, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Though it comes with challenges, I won't let it stop me from doing what I love, including travel.",
    "fullText": "It was a bright, sunny day in Tepoztlán, Mexico, when my friends and I trekked to an ancient Aztec temple at the top of Tepozteco Mountain.\n\nBut by the time I made it to the summit, I was greeted with bad news: The ruins were closing in five minutes.\n\nI was too angry to appreciate the splendor around me; the valley spread out below me like a picture book.\n\nIn the photo my friend snapped, I'm frowning like a petulant teenager on the verge of a tantrum. It wasn't my finest moment, to say the least.\n\nTwo years before, that roughly 1.5-mile climb would've been a piece of cake for an experienced hiker like me. But that all changed when I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 39.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. With little or no insulin, the body can struggle to use glucose for energy.\n\nAfter my doctor gave me the news, I was forced to come to terms with a bewildering new reality: injecting insulin multiple times a day, obsessively monitoring my blood sugar, and calculating carb ratios before every meal.\n\nIf I didn't learn how to mimic the work of a human pancreas, there was a chance I could go blind, lose limbs, fall into a coma, or die.\n\nThe disease also came with constant exhaustion, alarming medical costs, and a crippling fear of exercise — I risk a sugar crash if I so much as walk my dog around the block with too much insulin in my system.\n\nI felt like I had been broken into a thousand pieces and had to rebuild my identity from the ground up. But I was determined to rediscover the parts of myself that type 1 diabetes had ripped away, particularly my love of travel and spontaneous adventure.\n\nSo, when my friends proposed a trip to Mexico last December, I jumped at the chance to take my first trip abroad since my diagnosis.\n\nAfter our first day in Mexico City, it became painfully clear that, even if I was on vacation, my disease wasn't.\n\nA simple afternoon of strolling through the city, visiting a museum, and eating unfamiliar snacks sent my glucose on a roller coaster of highs and lows. By the time we got back to our Airbnb, I was so exhausted that instead of staying up late to check out the local bars as I usually would, I collapsed into bed before sunset.\n\nThe day we headed to Tepozteco, I was determined to do a better job of managing my blood sugar. But even with plenty of carbs and protein in my system, my glucose started to plummet after only a few minutes, which meant I had to stop multiple times along the trail to rest and eat carb-heavy snacks.\n\nIt wasn't all bad, though. At a bend in the path, I came across a man selling paletas (fruit popsicles) from a cooler.\n\nAs I sat beside him and looked up at the canopy of trees, sweet strawberry melting in my mouth, I told myself that taking this moment to recharge didn't mean I was weak.\n\nBut when I stood on that temple in the fading afternoon light, I sure felt like I was.\n\nI have to laugh at that picture of me atop Tepozteco now. That grimacing woman, with hunched shoulders and tears of anger streaming under her sunglasses, wasn't able to appreciate that she'd accomplished something remarkable.\n\nIf I could talk to her, I'd tell her to quit beating herself up and take in the splendor around her. I'd tell her that, although her body can never be what it was before, even a chronic disease can't take away the love she has for the world.\n\nI've learned that you never fall into a rhythm with type 1 diabetes. There are dozens of factors that can affect your blood sugar on any given day, from stress to hot weather to hormones, which means your insulin needs are constantly changing.\n\nBut things have started to get a little better. A few months ago, I made the switch from injection pens to a pump, which has taken a lot of the guesswork out of managing my diabetes.\n\nI even put it to the test this June on a hike up Balsam Lake Mountain in the Catskills. And guess what? Thanks to a hearty breakfast, the miracles of medical technology, and a little patience, I didn't crash once.\n\nAt the summit, I took a selfie from the top of a century-old fire tower. It may not have been an ancient ruin 2,000 miles from home, but that isn't the point. What matters is that the woman in that photo is smiling.",

    "description": "McLaren driver Oscar Piastri has revealed he, George Russell and Alex Albon held an “UNO\" World Championship during travel days",
    "fullText": "McLaren driver Oscar Piastri has revealed that he, George Russell and Alex Albon held an \"UNO World Championship\" that took place during travel days between some of the races of the 2025 Formula 1 season. Admitting there were \"questionable rules\" between the trio, he opened up on what he did during his downtime.\n\nTalking on F1's Off The Grid with presenter Lawrence Barretto, the Australian explained that a long-haul flight between races turned from an impromptu game of UNO into something larger.\n\n“You're just chatting, you're sleeping. What’s going on?” Barretto asked about the travel time between races when drivers share flights.\n\n“Myself, George Russell and Alex Albon had an UNO World Championship on the way from Baku to Singapore last year,” Piastri laughed. “There was some questionable rule decisions, and rules that I’d never heard of playing UNO before from some of the others, mainly George.\n\n\"Apparently, they were family rules.\"\n\nBarretto asked whether these rules from the Mercedes driver tipped the scales in his favour.\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" he smiled. \"We’re always competitive at everything, all the drivers. It’s always good fun.”\n\nHis competitiveness predates his career in motorsport. Like many, including seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, he started with RC racing.\n\n\"Been a competitive person since I was really little,\" he said. \"But channelling that into racing and motorsport...Yeah, started with RC cars, won a national championship at nine and then started racing go-karts a year later.\"\n\nPiastri, like a lot of drivers, lives in Monaco.\n\n\"It's convenient when you want to go and play padel or do other things,\" he said on the subject. \"Also makes travelling to the races convenient. Like I'm sure most people have seen, we often travel to races together and stuff on those plane journeys.\"\n\nHe added: “It's pretty cool to come here when the races are done. It's a bit more relaxed when there's no racing.”\n\nAfter a strong start to his career in F1 and a championship contender for 2025, he has suddenly exploded in popularity - something he's still getting to grips with.\n\n“It is still a little bit strange,” he said. “Obviously at the track you expect the attention, but there has been times where you go in the supermarket or whatever, out of nowhere, someone's asking for a photo or an autograph or whatever, or even just asking, 'is that really you?'”\n\nPiastri will be hoping to continue the momentum he's found in his first three seasons into 2026.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Charles Myers, chairman of Signum Global Advisors, told Business Insider he is preparing a group of 15-20 investors to travel to Venezuela in March.",
    "fullText": "A group of about 20 US investors is already planning to travel to Venezuela in March, following Saturday's news that the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, had been taken into US custody.\n\nCharles Myers, the chairman of the political risk advisory firm Signum Global Advisors and a former vice-chairman of the investment advisory firm Evercore, told Business Insider that the mood among investors he has spoken to is one of \"cautious optimism\" following news of Maduro's ouster.\n\n\"I think the centerpiece of Venezuela's success, looking out 12 months or even 24 months, is foreign investment,\" Myers said. \"A big part of the Venezuela story, starting today, is foreign investment, especially in oil and gas, which is pretty straightforward, but there are massive opportunities in construction, in tourism.\"\n\nMyers said it's not the responsibility of his firm to take a \"moral position\" on whether it was right or wrong for the US to involve itself in Venezuela's government, but rather to help the firm's clients anticipate investment opportunities or mitigate risk due to geopolitical events.\n\nHowever, he added, his firm \"very much expected\" the situation in Venezuela would unfold as it has, and has been preparing investor groups to be ready to travel to the country when the opportunity presents itself. Signum previously hosted similar trips for asset managers and hedge funds to visit Syria and Ukraine.\n\n\"People have seen this coming, especially very smart investors, and many of them have actually bought bonds in anticipation of this,\" Myers said. \"But there's a very strong degree of cautious optimism, even more so than we saw with Syria, just because this is a United States-directed action.\"\n\n\"The United States will play a pivotal role in everything, especially the Venezuelan economy, starting today,\" Myers added, \"So, I think the reaction has been more enthusiastic than perhaps other situations like this.\"",

    "description": "From outbound vacationers to students returning for the new semester, the US raid on Venezuela disrupted travel across the region.",
    "fullText": "The US raid on Venezuela that netted President Nicólas Maduro and his wife on Saturday has sent surprised travelers into a mild tailspin.\n\nFlightradar24 data shows Venezuela's airspace is empty following the strikes. While US airlines haven't flown there for years, the Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday formally barred operations in Venezuelan airspace, essentially codifying an already de facto no-fly zone.\n\nBut the impact extends beyond Venezuela.\n\nAirlines are also avoiding nearby southern Caribbean airspace due to heightened security risks. Delta, American Airlines, and Southwest Airlines said they canceled flights to the Caribbean on Saturday morning following the US strike on Venezuela.\n\nThe cancellations have inconvenienced many travelers, particularly students returning for the start of the new semester.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm doing right now,\" Catalina Rodriguez, a veterinary student at Ross University School of Medicine in St. Kitts and Nevis, said in a video she posted to TikTok. \"One of my flights is good, my other flight is delayed, am I supposed to change my trip?\"\n\nRodriguez, 34, later told Business Insider in a call that she is supposed to start her third semester of veterinary school on Monday. She is scheduled to fly on American Airlines at noon on Sunday, but her flight is now delayed. She said she's also been in touch with several classmates who are stuck in airports due to cancellations and delays.\n\n\"We're just waiting to see what's going to happen,\" she said. \"It's a little stressful for sure.\"\n\nAnother student, who goes by \"dani la doctorcita\" on TikTok, said in a video that her Delta flight to St. Kitts was canceled. \"All US flights have been canceled,\" she said. \"Delta won't fly even from Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that aviation risk-intelligence firm Osprey Flight Solutions — a widely used industry service that tracks safety and security hazards for airlines — recently upgraded its risk assessment for the Southern Caribbean Sea from \"moderate\" to \"high\" amid escalating tensions.\n\nThat higher-risk zone includes places like Puerto Rico, Aruba, Curaçao, the British and US Virgin Islands, Antigua & Barbuda, Saint Thomas, Grenada, Barbados, and parts of Trinidad & Tobago and Guyana. Mass disruptions to and from these destinations have left thousands stranded as airlines reassess safety risks and insurance exposure.\n\nStranded travelers have few options to depart Caribbean nations — and little help from airlines while they wait.\n\nBecause the disruptions stem from government action outside the airlines' control, carriers do not legally owe passengers compensation. That means meals, hotels, and ground transportation are not required under federal law, though airlines may offer assistance as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nOne X user who goes by Nate_F_Thurmond posted a photo of a group of stranded travelers in St. John.\n\n\"Passengers stranded in St John just learning that Caribbean Airspace is closed,\" they wrote. \"American, JetBlue, and Delta canceled flights. People are scrambling to find places to stay. Being told 3-5 days by the airlines. All this because of Venezuela??\"\n\nIn most cases, the only guaranteed option is rebooking, and travelers may struggle to find alternative accommodations while waiting for the next available flight.\n\nSome flights are still operating, but they are taking significant detours to avoid the region. American Airlines Flight 1512 from Georgetown, Guyana, to Miami on Saturday, for example, ditched its usual route east of Venezuela through the southern Caribbean and instead flew west around the area, adding roughly an hour of flight time.\n\nFor travelers who want to cancel or postpone their Caribbean holidays, most airlines — including Delta, United, American, Southwest, and JetBlue — are waiving change and cancellation fees as the situation continues. Some western Caribbean countries, such as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, are not included on waiver lists.\n\nUS Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Saturday afternoon that the FAA will lift airspace restrictions over the Caribbean and Venezuela \"when appropriate.\" His update came about 15 hours after the FAA issued an emergency notice in the region.\n\n\"Early this morning in support of the Department of War, the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public,\" Duffy wrote on X. \"When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted. Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.\"",

    "description": "The ultrawealthy are trading in some traditional markers of luxury travel in favor of privacy and seclusion.",
    "fullText": "Classic markers of luxury travel, like five-star hotels and hard-to-get dinner reservations, are no longer enough for some ultrawealthy travelers. Instead, they're increasingly seeking a subtler status symbol: privacy.\n\n\"The privacy factor is higher than it's ever been. In fact, we have some clients who are 'no more hotels,'\" Rob DelliBovi, a luxury travel planner whose clients include celebrities and high-net-worth individuals, said. \"Even the five-star hotel experience is too crowded.\"\n\nAs international travel has grown and destinations have become increasingly crowded, luxury travel planners say their clients' top priority is to get away from everyone else.\n\nThe ultrawealthy are increasingly skipping luxury hotels and turning instead to private villas, private jets, and private chefs. A trend report from Capital One Travel last month found that 86% of luxury travelers said privacy and seclusion were top considerations when choosing where to stay, and 83% said exclusivity of access.\n\n\"The true value of luxury lies in the guarantee of an exclusive experience that cannot be accessed by the general public,\" the report said.\n\nDelliBovi said this kind of travel was always popular with his celebrity clients, \"who have a problem being seen literally anywhere.\" However, since the pandemic, and especially as we head into 2026, demand has skyrocketed among his high-net-worth clients.\n\n\"Now it's some more of our investment banker types,\" he said. \"People who would rent out a penthouse at a Four Seasons are like, 'What are my private home options?' Because even walking through the Four Seasons now can be a bit of a to-do.\"\n\nSeeking out private homes and villas that meet ultrawealthy standards can be challenging. DelliBovi said his team works with international real estate experts and luxury services networks to find properties that aren't actually listed for rent.\n\n\"We have to literally source these private homes and villas from locals. We have to know somebody in-market who's in the know,\" he said, adding they are renting from owners who don't normally lease their home or apartment. When his team calls and offers $50,000 for a week, he says owners often accept.\n\nThose homes then need to be outfitted with hotel-level services and more, including daily cleaning, Michelin-trained private chefs, high-end security, and accommodations for pets. After booking the home, DelliBovi's team will set all that up separately.\n\nFor the Super Bowl last year, he said one client spent a total of around $1.35 million on a house in New Orleans for six days. The home itself cost roughly $1 million, with the rest going toward the planning fee and services.\n\nThe inaccessibility of these homes is part of their appeal. DelliBovi said that some luxury hotels feel less exclusive because they're part of large brands with loyalty programs, allowing less wealthy travelers to stay there by accumulating points.\n\n\"That mix kind of irks some people,\" he said, adding it can feel like a less luxurious experience even if the hotel itself is great.\n\nWhen his clients do opt for hotels, DelliBovi said they prioritize properties built for discretion, like the Hotel Café Royal in London or the Rosewood Villa Magna in Madrid, which has an underground garage with an elevator that takes guests directly to their suites, bypassing public spaces altogether.\n\n\"That type of thing is priceless,\" he said.\n\nNon-disclosure agreements are a standard part of travel for the ultrawealthy, whether they're staying at private homes or luxury hotels. Daria Guristrimba, founder and CEO of Globe7, an ultra-luxury travel agency, said confidentiality isn't a preference but a baseline expectation.\n\n\"The more private it is, the better,\" she said.\n\nGuristrimba said NDAs are often signed at every stage of a trip, including with staff, vendors, and hotels. Her firm even avoids storing clients' names in internal systems, instead using coded identifiers, and sometimes handling payments to hotels or other services on behalf of clients so their travel doesn't leave a financial paper trail.\n\nShe said she routinely asks hotels not to keep any record of her clients, including deleting their information from internal systems. If a hotel requires a client's last name to confirm a booking and the client doesn't want it disclosed, they simply won't stay there.\n\nBecause of the high demand for privacy, Guristrimba said more and more of her clients are choosing fully private islands, where they can ensure there will be no other members of the public — beyond employees who have signed NDAs.\n\nThanda Island in Tanzania, which can be rented by a single group, accommodates 18 guests who are exclusively served by about 35 employees. Meals are served in different locations around the island, and no outside guests are allowed. The cost is about $33,000 per night, and Guristrimba said she's had clients rent out the entire island just as a couple.\n\nTraditional upscale aesthetics and locales are now taking a back seat to the top priority of privacy and not being seen.\n\n\"It's not about marbles anymore. It's not about the Loro Piana textile walls anymore,\" she said, adding, \"They don't want anyone to know where they are going or what they are doing.\"",

    "description": "An equipment outage and flooded roadways led to significant travel disruption at San Diego Airport, affecting over 300 flights.",
    "fullText": "Thousands of people flying into or out of San Diego on New Year's Day had their travel plans disrupted after a rainstorm hit the city.\n\nData from Flightradar24 showed 40 flights headed for San Diego International Airport decided to land elsewhere on January 1.\n\nThere were enough diversions that air traffic control activated a recovery tool to help planes reach their intended destinations.\n\nAnother 53 flights into or out of the airport were canceled, plus nearly 270 were delayed, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThat meant around 40% of the flights were behind schedule.\n\nA spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration told Business Insider it slowed inbound flights \"due to poor visibility and weather conditions,\" and to perform maintenance on an instrument landing system's glide slope.\n\nA glide slope emits a radio signal that helps planes approach a runway from the correct angle and location, which is particularly useful in bad weather or at night.\n\nAn air traffic control advisory also said the disruption was due to an\"equipment outage.\"\n\nIn a post on X, the airport said the weather was causing flight delays, with some nearby roads closed due to flooding. The airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside local working hours.\n\nSan Diego is the third-busiest airport in California. It reported handling over 25 million passengers in 2024.\n\nWhile many of the diverted flights eventually made it to San Diego, it was likely a frustrating day for many travellers.\n\nJapan Airlines Flight 66 had flown about 10 hours from Tokyo to San Diego. After circling around the airport, it diverted to Los Angeles, a 30-minute flight away.\n\nJust over two hours later, the Boeing 787 took off again and completed the short flight down to San Diego.\n\nThe airline didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome Southwest Airlines passengers departing Sacramento had a two-hour flight to nowhere. Flight 3138 spent an hour circling north of Los Angeles before returning to its origin, per flight-tracking data. It later took off again and reached San Diego about five hours behind schedule.\n\nWhile most flights were able to divert elsewhere in California, around a dozen of them diverted to Phoenix.\n\nA Southwest flight from Baltimore spent about an hour circling just west of the Arizona state capital before touching down there.\n\nIt was on the ground for over three hours before continuing on to San Diego, landing roughly five hours later than planned.\n\nA Southwest spokesperson said the airline canceled about 20 flights and diverted some others that later arrived in San Diego.\n\n\"Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,\" they added.\n\nTwo private jets, flying from Colorado ski resorts, didn't have to divert too far — they were the only ones able to land at McClellan-Palomar Airport in northern San Diego County, per Flightradar24.",

    "description": "The ultrawealthy are ditching the crowds in places like Florence and Mykonos and visiting these three alternative destinations instead.",
    "fullText": "Even the ultrawealthy aren't immune to the frustrations of overtourism.\n\nAs international tourism grows, many popular luxury destinations once associated with wealth and exclusivity are now packed with large crowds, long lines, and constant noise.\n\nRob DelliBovi, a luxury travel planner whose clients include celebrities and high-net-worth individuals, told Business Insider many of his clients feel crowded out of places that used to feel special. He said there's a \"continuing trend of our clients believing everything is too crowded and they need their own space.\"\n\nAs a result, wealthy travelers are deliberately seeking out destinations that others tend to overlook, or that don't yet have the infrastructure to accommodate swaths of more budget-minded travelers.\n\n\"They want to have their cake and eat it too, in terms of going to the popular places at the popular times, but enjoying peace and quiet and their own kind of experience,\" DelliBovi said.\n\nInstead of abandoning travel to dreamy but popular destinations like Italy and Japan, Dellibovi said his clients are ditching the hottest spots and gravitating toward quieter, alternative cities in countries that are grappling with overtourism.\n\n\"These secondary markets are building infrastructure to accommodate the wealthy and the cool and the rich and the famous,\" he said.\n\nHere are three secondary destinations that luxury travelers are visiting to avoid the crowds.\n\nItaly is one of the most strained countries in the world when it comes to overtourism, with cities like Venice, Rome, and Florence experiencing record numbers of tourists and mounting protests from locals.\n\n\"Italy is a disaster right now\" in terms of crowds, Dellibovi said, adding that ultrawealthy travelers who \"still want to go to Italy and eat like Italy\" are skipping Rome and Florence and heading to Puglia instead.\n\nPuglia, located in the southeastern region of Italy, is known for its whitewashed towns and clear Mediterranean coastlines, and countryside estates, making it an appealing choice for luxury travelers seeking private villas and quieter travel.\n\nWhile Puglia is also experiencing a tourism boom, it's not yet as crowded as some of the better-known travel destinations in Italy.\n\nGreece is also facing issues associated with overtourism and protests, with popular hot spots, like Mykonos and Santorini, often overwhelmed by summer crowds and cruise ships.\n\nDelliBovi said many of his clients are skipping those islands entirely. \"People are going to Paros in Greece as opposed to Mykonos or Santorini,\" he said.\n\nParos, another Greek island in the Aegean Sea, has become an attractive alternative for wealthy travelers because it combines beaches, picturesque villages, and nightlife, but without the crush of people. \"There's not 10,000 people at every restaurant. There's not 5,000 people at every beach club,\" Dellibovi said.\n\nTourism on Paros has increased steadily over the past decade, especially with luxury travelers, but it remains less developed and less chaotic than its more famous neighboring islands.\n\nJapan's status as one of the hottest destinations in tourism has also brought issues, especially in cities like Tokyo and Kyoto, where locals have protested tourism levels that they say are unsustainable.\n\nDellibovi said his clients are increasingly asking for alternatives. \"People are like, 'Okay, we want to go to Kyoto. What other places in Japan are cool, that are high-end, that have this infrastructure for us, but are not like we're going to get run over by a mob of people?'\"\n\nKanazawa, located on the opposite coast of Tokyo, is increasingly appealing to high-net-worth travelers who are looking for a similar cultural experience but with more privacy. The city has been called \"Little Kyoto,\" and is known for its art, dining scene, historic districts, and nature.\n\nTourism to regional destinations like Kanazawa is also growing as the Japanese government has encouraged visitors to explore beyond the country's most popular destinations.",

    "title": "Every Emily Henry romance novel, ranked",
    "description": "We ranked Emily Henry's romance novels, including \"Beach Read,\" \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" and \"People We Meet on Vacation.\"",
    "fullText": "Any romance reader knows that not all romance novels are created equally: Some leave you swooning, others leave you shrugging, and the worst ones leave you shutting the book and never picking it back up.\n\nEmily Henry, a fantasy-YA author turned romance queen, is easily one of the most beloved romance novelists of the last five years. All six of her romances caused quite a stir on BookTok, and all but one have been optioned for on-screen adaptations.\n\nBut are they all five-star classics? No.\n\nWe've ranked Henry's six adult romances from worst to best — though, if we're being honest, we'd read Henry's grocery list if we could.\n\nUnfortunately, this is Henry's weakest offering — at least, in my opinion. The beauty of Henry's novels is that every permutation of a ranking exists out there. There are some readers whose very favorite is \"Happy Place.\"\n\n\"Happy Place\" marked a shift from her previous three books, focusing on a group of friends rather than a single main relationship. However, I don't think the friend group was given enough time or fleshed out fully for me to care.\n\nInstead, I felt that too much time was taken away from our core couple, Harriet and Wyn, for me to get invested in them, yet somehow not enough time was given to Sabrina and Cleo, or their partners, Kim and Parth.\n\nAlso, I love a ridiculous romance premise as much as the next person — you'll be hearing about five more of them — but neglecting to tell your group of friends that you've gotten divorced and then pretending to still be together on a group trip stretches my credulity just a tad too far.\n\nPerhaps I'll like it better when it's adapted as a Netflix series.\n\nTo speak in internet parlance, when I read \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" all I could think was that it was reheating \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo's\" nachos, but with a dash of Henry flair.\n\nThe book is a dual narrative, split between would-be author Alice Scott and her dreams to write the biography of a reclusive heiress, Margaret Ives, and Margaret's own life story, told through flashbacks.\n\nI greatly preferred the flashbacks of Margaret's life and her relationships with her sister and husband. The contemporary story of Alice competing with another journalist, Hayden, for the chance to write Margaret's story, was less compelling. I also thought that Alice and Hayden's chemistry was a bit forced and a bit \"insta-lovey\" for my taste.\n\nThe book also purports to have a twist ending, but I found it fairly easy to predict after a few chapters.\n\n\"People We Meet on Vacation\" is Henry's most popular book, the one that catapulted her to the top of BookTok, and is also the first to make the jump from page to screen; the movie adaptation hits Netflix in January, starring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth.\n\nPerhaps it's because this book was so hyped up to me before I read it, but I found it to be just fine. I liked the premise — two former best friends and travel buddies meeting up for the first time after a mysterious trip gone wrong — but I didn't really connect to either Poppy or Alex as characters.\n\nI thought their banter was great, though, which is a throughline of all of Henry's books.\n\nI would never call this book bad; it just wasn't one of my favorites.\n\nHere's where it gets hard for me to choose. I love the top three deeply, but, alas, something has to come in third.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is about Nora Stephens, a cutthroat literary agent who describes herself as the mean girlfriend in a Hallmark movie who gets left behind in the big city when her boyfriend returns to his small town and falls in love with the local [insert whimsical job title here]. Already, I was obsessed.\n\nBut when she's convinced by her sister, Libby, to visit a small town herself, she encounters one of her nemeses from NYC: Charlie Lastra, an editor she can't stand.\n\nYou can guess what happens then.\n\nI adored Nora and Charlie's relationship, as well as Nora's relationship with Libby. I also found Henry's descriptions of Sunshine Falls to be evocative, funny, and full of love and care.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is set to be adapted into a film in the future, so I can't wait to see who will bring these characters to life.\n\nIf you thought I loved Nora and Charlie, just wait until you hear about Daphne and Miles.\n\nRemember when I dinged \"Happy Place\" for having a ridiculous premise? \"Funny Story\" also uses a ridiculous trope, but a fun one that I enjoyed reading about, rather than questioning why our two main characters chose to lie to all their friends.\n\n\"Funny Story\" is a classic romance story: Daphne and Miles have both been dumped by their respective significant others, best friends Peter and Petra, after, wouldn't you guess, Peter and Petra decided that they were in love with each other instead.\n\nHomeless and heartbroken, Daphne and Miles decide to move in together — and in an act of desperation, decide to fake date in order to make their exes jealous.\n\nAs I wrote in my Goodreads review for this book, 'There's something about the way Emily Henry writes flirting that scratches my brain.\" Daphne and Miles' banter is (almost) unmatched.\n\nI relate to Daphne, her insecurities, her interests, and her flaws, the most out of all of Henry's main characters. I also just love Miles. He's the sweetest.\n\n\"Funny Story\" has also been optioned to become a movie, with Henry herself writing the screenplay, which makes me very excited.",

A landlocked nation sharing borders with six other countries, Burkina Faso announced that it had put in place \"equivalent visa measures to citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nWhile this currently means a full ban on visas necessary to enter the country, Burkina Faso said it \"remains committed to mutual respect, the sovereign equality of States, and the principle of reciprocity in its international relations.\"\n\nDue to a decades-old history of war coupled with political violence, Western travel into Burkina Faso remains very low; the U.S. State Department currently keeps it at a level four \"do not travel\" advisory over \"organizations [that] continue to plan and conduct terrorist activities.\"\n\nThe latter, along with a high visa overstay rate, were named by the Trump administration as the primary justification for being placed on the travel ban.\n\nSharing a southwestern border with Burkina Faso, Mali has also put in place a reciprocal ban on American travel.\n\nThe country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation released a statement saying that any U.S. citizens will now also be subject to \"the same conditions and requirements as those imposed by the American authorities on Malian citizens entering the United States.\"\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "fullText": "Located in the French West Indies, the small island runs about 11 miles long and 2.5 miles wide.\n\nIt's typically warm and sunny most of the year, with temperatures often in the 70s, 80s, or low 90s, and peak tourist season starts in late fall and lasts through the spring.\n\nAs a French territory, the official language of St. Barts is French, though English is also widely spoken.\n\nThe exclusive-feeling island is home to more than a dozen beaches, where visitors can soak up the sun on smooth, sandy shores and in crystal-clear water.\n\n\"I always say if you want to have your toes in the sand and eat a croissant that feels like you're in Paris, St. Barts is the place for you,\" Elisabeth Brown, the membership director at the luxury concierge service Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider's Madeline Berg.\n\nSurrounded by shallow coral reefs, St. Barts has some top-tier snorkeling spots, such as Grand Cul-de-Sac — home to sea turtles and a range of tropical fish.\n\nLocal natural sights also include mountains and hills formed from volcanic eruptions. That said, there are no active volcanoes on St. Barts.\n\nJeff Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez Bezos, were photographed in St. Barts this week — and the Amazon founder has been spotted in St. Barts on multiple occasions over the years.\n\nNo matter the time of year, though, the island regularly welcomes the wealthy.\n\nCelebrities like Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, and Leonardo DiCaprio have visited in the past, and influential banking families, like the Rothschilds, have famously purchased property there.\n\nIn addition to Bezos' vessel, massive yachts owned by Playrix founder Dmitry Bukhman, Dallas Mavericks owner Miriam Adelson, and entertainment mogul David Geffen also parked in St. Barts during the recent holiday.\n\nWhile the yachts are primarily used for transportation to the island, they're also attractions in and of themselves, featuring amenities such as jacuzzis and movie theaters.\n\nTravelers without private yachts can still reach the island by flying into an airport on a larger Caribbean island, like San Juan. From there, they could take a ferry or private boat to St Barts.\n\nVisitors have several options for accommodations, ranging from villa rentals starting at over $900 a night to luxurious hotels for an even higher price.\n\nThe Eden Rock hotel is just one example. It overlooks St. Jean Bay — home to one of the most popular beaches on St. Barts — and is home to fine-dining restaurants and holistic spas.\n\nDuring holiday seasons like New Year's, a single-night stay at its largest villa can cost upward of €13,000, or about $15,200.\n\nThere's also the Rosewood Le Guanahani resort, located on a private peninsula that's home to two secluded beaches, giving travelers the ultimate getaway far from crowds.\n\nSuch privacy comes at a price, as even its most basic room can run guests thousands of dollars a night.\n\nWith billionaire travelers always on-site, the island's retail scene largely caters to shoppers who can drop thousands at any given moment.\n\nSome of the designer brands that have boutiques on St. Barts include Hermès, Cartier, Dior, and Louis Vuitton.\n\nThe island's also home to luxury retailers like Patek Phillipe, which sells one-of-a-kind timepieces you can't find anywhere else. Some retail for five, six, and even seven figures.\n\nA trip to St. Barts isn't all about relaxation, though. There are plenty of places to party and experience live music.\n\nOne of the most popular spots for this on the island is Nikki Beach, an upscale restaurant and beach club. In past years, big-name musicians like Kygo and Mariah Carey have even performed at its New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nIt's also a go-to for people looking to relax poolside with a drink in hand — though keep in mind that even just renting a lounge chair may cost you over $100.",

    "description": "Can you live well on $100,000 per year in retirement? ChatGPT mapped out the complete budget including travel, healthcare and housing. Here's the reality.",
    "fullText": "Most retirement budgets assume you’re pinching pennies. But what if you saved well and want to actually enjoy retirement? I asked ChatGPT to map out a $100,000-per-year retirement budget for someone who wants comfort without being wasteful. The artificial intelligence’s breakdown was thorough and felt fairly realistic.\n\nThe chatbot designed a monthly spending plan, calculated how much you’d need saved and identified the best places to live on this income level. According to ChatGPT, here’s what a six-figure retirement actually looks like.\n\nChatGPT started by clarifying that $100,000 annually puts you well above average retirees. This budget supports quality healthcare, regular travel, a nice home in a desirable area and room for unexpected expenses. You’re not living extravagantly, but you’re comfortable.\n\nThe AI wrote that this lifestyle requires either strong savings or a combination of savings plus Social Security and possibly a pension.\n\nFind Out: How Much the Average Upper-Class Retiree Spends Monthly at Age 69\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nOne hundred thousand dollars per year equals about $8,333 monthly. ChatGPT broke this down into realistic categories.\n\nHousing costs $2,500 to $3,500 per month. This covers either a nice rental in a high-demand city or a mortgage-free home where you only pay property taxes, insurance and HOA fees. The chatbot gave specific examples: Austin, Texas, runs about $3,200 monthly; Phoenix around $2,600; and Tampa, Florida around $2,400. San Diego pushes toward $3,500 or more.\n\nFood and dining take $1,200 to $1,800 monthly. ChatGPT explained this includes high-quality groceries from stores like Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s plus eating out two to four times weekly. The budget also covers occasional hosting and holiday meals.\n\nTransportation costs $600 to $900 per month. The AI assumed you might have a car payment along with insurance, gas and maintenance. If you live in a walkable city without a car, this drops to $200 to $300 monthly.\n\nHealthcare and insurance run $800 to $1,500 depending on your age and state. ChatGPT broke this down as Medicare Parts B and D, supplemental Medigap or Advantage plans, dental and vision coverage, prescription medications and any specialist visits. The AI warned that people under 65 should budget toward the higher end.\n\nUtilities cost $300 to $500 monthly for electricity, water, gas, trash, internet and streaming subscriptions.\n\nTravel gets a significant chunk at $10,000 to $15,000 annually, which equals $850 to $1,250 monthly. ChatGPT explained this covers one to two major international trips plus domestic getaways, hotels and dining abroad. The AI wrote that travel makes a huge difference in retirement satisfaction.",

    "description": "After Joe Biden was called out on Fox News for going on a holiday vacation, many on social media rallied around the former president.",
    "fullText": "After Joe Biden was called out on Fox News for going on a holiday vacation, many on social media rallied around the former president and slammed host Tomi Lahren for mocking the retired politician.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s broadcast of “Hannity,” Lahren openly mocked Biden for his end-of-year trip, noting, “And you’ll never believe where Joe Biden was spotted. Spoiler alert: He’s on vacation.”\n\nThis moment was clipped and shared on X Tuesday evening — and swiftly went viral, gaining 4 million views in less than 24 hours. Many were confused by Lahren’s dig, given Biden is not currently president and has withdrawn significantly from public life amid his cancer battle.\n\nOne critic responded on X, “quick question @TomiLahren what year do you think it is?” Another chimed in with, “Spoiler alert: he’s not president.” A third added, “Retired man goes on vacation. Hardly a scandal.”\n\nA fourth expressed a more biting sentiment, noting, “I’m pretty sure they call that retirement, you dumb hack.”\n\nAnother X user called out conservatives for giving Biden a hard time for doing exactly what they asked him to do: “Sleepy Joe Biden needs to retire so we can pile on to make fun of him for not working anymore.”\n\nThe irony of Lahren’s comments weren’t lost on other social media users, who pointed out that the conservative commentator was covering for Sean Hannity — who was reportedly absent for being on vacation. Watch the viral moment below.\n\nLahren: And you will never believe where Joe Biden was spotted. Spoiler alert. He's on vacation pic.twitter.com/C4RSpWi7St\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) December 31, 2025\n\nBiden notably exited the 2024 presidential race after concerns surfaced following his performance during a June 2024 debate against Donald Trump.\n\n“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden said in a letter confirming his withdrawal from the race. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”\n\nBiden’s Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in and ran in his place, but ultimately lost to Trump, who was inaugurated for his second term in January.\n\nThe post Fox News Mocked for Ripping Into Joe Biden’s Holiday Vacation: ‘They Call That Retirement’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Rodri and Jeremy Doku could both be involved when Manchester City travel to Sunderland on New Year's Day, manager Pep Guardiola said Wednesday.\n\nA key playmaker at the Etihad when fit, Rodri was an unused substitute in Saturday's Premier League win over Nottingham Forest following his latest injury setback.\n\nThe Spaniard missed most of last season with a severe knee problem and his attempts at returning to action have been hampered by several issues, with the latest a hamstring complaint.\n\nDoku, a winger who enjoyed a fine start to the season, has been sidelined for the past four games with a calf injury.\n\nTheir returns could be valuable to a City side who are set to be without several players during a congested January schedule.\n\nCity, including a trip to Tottenham on February 1, face 10 games in the space of 32 days over four competitions.\n\nJohn Stones, Oscar Bobb and Mateo Kovacic are also out injured while Rayan Ait-Nouri and Omar Marmoush are at the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\n\"Rodri has come back,\" Guardiola told a pre-match press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"Maybe he can play a few minutes. I'm looking forward to it. Doku maybe, John and Oscar no.\"\n\nGuardiola added: \"In terms of squad we are not in our best right now for this tight schedule. It's right lately we have played with the same guys but with the schedule we have.\n\n\"We will arrive back (from Sunderland) at 2:00 am (0200 GMT) or 3:00 am and two days later we have Chelsea and then after that we have Brighton –- really tough opponents. We don't have many players to rotate.\"\n\nCity, who will begin 2026 five points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal but with a game in hand, could strengthen their squad during the January transfer window.\n\nGuardiola, however, refused to be drawn on reports linking the club with Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo.\n\n\"I don't have any news about anything right now,\" said the City boss, who also refused to be drawn on rumours Bobb could leave.\n\n\"The winter transfer window is completely closed right now. So, Sunderland…\"\n\nSunderland are seventh in the table having made an impressive return to the top flight following last season's promotion.\n\nCity defeated the Black Cats 3-0 at the Etihad on December 6 but Guardiola expects a difficult encounter at the Stadium of Light.\n\n\"They are so tough,\" he said. \"The crowd is unbelievable. They have beaten Newcastle. Arsenal and Aston Villa could not win there.\n\n\"They have had really good results. It will be completely different there but at the same time we are ready.\"",

    "description": "Americans in the country are advised to return to the U.S. as soon as possible",
    "fullText": "The State Department has updated its travel warning for Americans planning to or who are already visiting Russia. On Tuesday, the agency reissued a Level 4 travel warning for Russia that was announced in May.\n\nAs part of the warning, the State Department urged any Americans already in Russia to leave immediately. The agency cautions that it has limited resources available to assist Americans if they are detained in Russia. Furthermore, Americans who’ve been charged with crimes may not be able to receive help from the U.S. embassy while in custody in Russia.\n\n\"U.S. citizens may serve their entire prison sentence without release. The risk of wrongful detention of U.S. citizens remains high. Even if a case is determined wrongful, there is no guarantee of release.\"\n\nAmericans have reported being detained and questioned without any reason or credible evidence against them.\n\nThe State Department also warns of ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine which “has destabilized security in southwestern Russia.” Martial law has been declared in several areas of Russia further restricting freedoms in the country.\n\nU.S. officials warn that Russia is not recognizing U.S. citizenship for those who have dual citizenship with Russia. The agency goes on to claim:\n\nRussia has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens.\n\nThe Russian government has forced people with dual citizenship to join the military and has stopped them from leaving the country.\n\nIn 2022, Russia started drafting citizens for the war in Ukraine. The military draft is ongoing.\n\nFailure to adhere to Russian laws and regulations on dual citizenship can result in arrest.\n\nAlthough the warning says to leave Russia right away, it may be difficult for some. U.S. issued debit and credit cards are no longer working in Russia and sanctions have made it “nearly impossible” for electronic money transfers to be sent from the U.S.\n\nAir travel is also extremely difficult to secure at the moment and may not be possible on short notice.\n\n“If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time,” the advisory reads.\n\nShould Americans decide to visit or remain in Russia, the State Department advises:\n\nBe ready for the possibility of detention for an unknown amount of time, possibly without a clear reason, and without the ability to contact your embassy or anyone else for help.\n\nAssume all electronic communications and devices in Russia are monitored by Russian security services. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices.\n\nPrepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.\n\nShare important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip.\n\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care and custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\n\nLeave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\n\nDevelop a communication plan with family, your employer or host organization. List how and when you’ll confirm you’re safe (text or call). Specify how often you will do this.",

    "description": "Flu is rising rapidly across the U.S., driven by a new variant of the virus — and cases are expected to keep growing with holiday travel.  In the U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Flu is rising rapidly across the U.S., driven by a new variant of the virus — and cases are expected to keep growing with holiday travel.\n\nThat variant, known as “subclade K,” led to early outbreaks in the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada. In the U.S., flu typically begins its winter march in December. On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported high or very high levels of illness in more than half the states.\n\nThe CDC estimated there have been at least 7.5 million illnesses, 81,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 deaths from flu so far this season. That includes at least eight child deaths — and is based on data as of Dec. 20, before major holiday gatherings.\n\nSome states are particularly hard-hit. New York’s health department said the week ending Dec. 20 marked the most flu cases the state had recorded in a single week since 2004: 71,000.\n\nIt’s far too soon to know if this flu season will be as severe as last winter’s.\n\nBut it’s not too late to get a flu shot, which health experts say can still prevent severe illness even if someone gets infected. While this year's vaccine isn't a perfect match to the subclade K strain, a preliminary analysis from the U.K. found it offered at least partial protection, lowering people's risk of hospitalization.\n\nAccording to the CDC, only about 42% of adults and children have gotten a flu vaccination so far this year.\n\nThe flu virus is a shape-shifter, constantly mutating, and it comes in multiple forms. There are two subtypes of Type A flu, and subclade K is a mutated version of one of them, named H3N2. That H3N2 strain is always harsh, especially for older adults.\n\nSubclade K’s mutations aren’t enough of a change to be considered an entirely new kind of flu.\n\nBut they’re different enough to evade some of the protection from this year’s vaccine, said Andrew Pekosz, a virus expert at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nWill subclade K make people sicker?\n\nThe CDC said it’s too soon to know how severe this season will be.\n\nFlu seasons dominated by any version of H3N2 tend to be bad, with more infections overall and more people becoming seriously ill. But Hopkins’ Pekosz cautioned it will take time to tease apart whether this subclade K version simply spreads more easily or also is more dangerous.\n\nThat question aside, the CDC notes there are some prescription medicines to treat flu — usually recommended for people at high risk of complications. But they generally need to be started a day or two after symptoms begin.\n\nThe CDC and major medical societies all recommend a flu vaccine for just about everyone age 6 months and older. Despite lots of recent misinformation and confusion about vaccines, the flu recommendations haven’t changed.\n\nFlu is particularly dangerous for people 65 and older, pregnant women, young children and people of any age who have chronic health problems, including asthma, diabetes, heart disease and weak immune systems.\n\nThe vaccines are brewed to protect against three influenza strains. Despite concern over that new H3N2 variant, they appear to be a good match against H1N1 and Type B flu that may also circulate this year, Pekosz said.\n\nThere are shots for all ages, as well as the nasal spray FluMist for ages 2 to 49. For the first time this year, some people may be eligible to vaccinate themselves with FluMist at home.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "The No. 4 UConn men’s basketball team returns to action after a 10-day layoff following its 72-54 win over DePaul on Dec. 21. The Huskies are back on the road yet again as they travel to Cincinnati to face Xavier (9-4, 1-1) on Wednesday afternoon at the Cintas Center.\n\nThe Musketeers rank No. 100 in KenPom, with the No. 119 offense in the country, and 116th in the NET. These numbers aren’t great for a program that made two of the last three NCAA Tournaments, including just last season, but new head coach Richard Pitino has done a solid job building a team essentially from scratch that was competitive in non-conference play, perhaps more than a lot of people expected. The Musketeers beat both West Virginia and Cincinnati and lost by just one to Georgia.\n\nAs for UConn, the Huskies sit at No. 7 in KenPom and No. 8 in the NET. They have the fourth-rated defense in the country per KenPom, a continued step in the right direction from last season. The 12-1 Huskies’ only loss was to now- No.1 Arizona by four points in a game where Tarris Reed Jr. and Braylon Mullins were both out with injuries. In their last game, Alex Karaban led the charge with 21 points and three triples against the Blue Demons.\n\nThe Huskies look to start 3-0 in Big East play for the third time in their six seasons since rejoining the Big East, as the team did so in 2022-23 (3-0) and last season (4-0).\n\nDate/Time: Wednesday, Dec. 31, 5:00 p.m. EST\n\nTV/Stream: Peacock, NBC Sports Network (for YouTubeTV subscribers)\n\nRadio: UConn Sports Network, Sirius XM 85, Sirius/XM online streaming\n\nLocation: Cintas Center, Cincinnati OH\n\nKenPom Predicted Score: UConn 79-67\n\nThe Huskies and Musketeers have played 12 times, with the past 10 coming in Big East play. UConn has a narrow 7-5 advantage over Xavier with a 6-4 split in conference action. They last faced off on January 25, 2025, when Xavier beat UConn, 76-72 at the Cintas Center. Solo Ball led four Huskies in double figures with 20 points.\n\nAs of this writing, all players are expected to be available for Wednesday’s game. This includes Solo Ball, who sat out the Huskies’ previous game on 12/21 with a wrist injury. Dan Hurley said he’s been able to practice and will be good to go.\n\nRemember the last time a Top 5 UConn squad traveled on the road on New Year’s Eve to Xavier? It ended in a Musketeer win. The 14-0 Huskies led by Adama Sanogo and Co. suffered their first loss of the year in a game where the Musketeers used a big second half to pull away and hand the Huskies their first loss, more or less starting that infamous January of 2023 where the eventual national champs really struggled.\n\nThat’s not a one-off either. In fact, UConn has lost 3 of 5 games on the road at Xavier since joining the Big East. In addition to that game in 2022 and last year’s matchup while Liam McNeeley was out, the Huskies lost during the 2021-22 season by six points despite a combined 40 points from RJ Cole and Tyrese Martin.\n\nThat Xavier team in 2022 had names like Colby Jones, Jack Nunge, Zach Freemantle, and Souley Boum. The 2025 Musketeers don’t have that, not even particularly close, but somewhere deep in the mind of Dan Hurley, he’s having flashbacks from the past.\n\nWith the new head coach in Pitino, no scholarship players from last year’s Xavier team who played a single minute are back with the program. The lone returner is Roddie Anderson III, but he sat all of last season in a redshirt year. Pitino brought in players from all different levels of college basketball to construct the roster.\n\nLeading scorer Tre Carroll comes over from Florida Atlantic, where he was a key component to that Owls team that made the Final Four in 2022-23. Jovan Milicevic and Filip Borovicanin were both rotational frontcourt pieces for Pitino at New Mexico last year. Anthony Robinson and Pape N’Diaye were both reserve bigs for Virginia and UNLV, respectively, a year ago and retain that role for the Musketeers.\n\nIn the backcourt, All Wright (one of the best names in the sport) comes over from Valparaiso fresh off a great freshman year. Malik Messina-Moore and Isaiah Walker are both seniors from the mid-major level that have a lot of experience and games under their belts. Overall, this group has a good mix of veteran leadership and promising young talent.\n\nXavier has played two completely different games to kick off Big East play this season. In their opener, they hosted a struggling Creighton team that was searching for a big win. The result? A 41 point Bluejay win that saw them knock down 16 threes and shoot 60% from the field. Carroll only scored 7 points, by far his season low. The Musketeers looked lost on both ends of the floor and were down 27 by halftime. It was looking like that eighth place pick in the preseason poll may have ended up being too high.\n\nThen just a few days later the Musketeers traveled to Washington D.C. to take on Georgetown. After losing by over 40 points at home, it only made sense that they picked up a gritty road win on the road later on in the week. Carroll scored 22 points and Borovicanin had a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds in the 80-77 victory over the Hoyas.\n\nWith how well the Huskies have been playing early on in conference play with a pair of 18+ point victories, it’s easy to overlook some players who may be struggling or not playing up to their full potential that they’ve shown in non-con play.\n\nMalachi Smith is averaging 1 PPG and 1 APG through the first two Big East games after closing non-con with back-to-back 9-assist efforts vs. Florida and Texas. The Dayton transfer hasn’t been able to get a good rhythm going yet in league play, but he is averaging fewer minutes (15.5 in BE play, 19.8 in non-con).\n\nEric Reibe was everything UConn could have asked for and \n\nBoth UConn and Xavier do a good job of getting everybody involved in the offense, and it shows. The Musketeers are first in the league in assists per game at 18.6, but the Huskies aren’t far behind at 18.2. Those are on 27.1 and 29.2 made field goals per game, respectively, too, so both sides rack up assists at a rate north of 60%. Borovician and Messina-Moore combine for 8 APG, and Carroll and Anderson each average 2.8. For the Huskies, Silas Demary Jr.’s 5.8 and Smith’s 4.0 carry the load, but Karaban and Reed Jr. each average at least 2 as well.",

    "fullText": "A new year means new opportunities to travel. And if you're anything like me, you're probably already thinking about where to go in 2026.\n\nAfter visiting all 50 states, there are a few places that have really stood out to me. If traveling more is one of your New Year's resolutions, I recommend checking out these nine incredible destinations.\n\nI love visiting Teton Valley, Idaho — the area located on the Western side of the Teton Mountain Range.\n\nDriggs, Victor, and Tetonia are all great little towns in the region. I especially love floating on the Teton River through Driggs and exploring downtown Victor.\n\nThe area is also a great base for day trips to Grand Teton or Yellowstone National Parks, making it a quieter way to enjoy the Tetons without the crowds.\n\nNorthern New Mexico is the place I've come back to the most over the last decade.\n\nThe wide-open skies and landscapes are unlike anywhere else, making every visit feel completely unforgettable and unique. I recommend staying in Taos, Santa Fe, or Abiquiú.\n\nI always enjoy exploring the Ojo Caliente Hot Springs or hiking around Ghost Ranch — a national natural landmark and former home of Georgia O'Keeffe.\n\nMendocino County in California is one of my all-time favorite places to visit. I love hiking through the coastal beauty of Russian Gulch and Mendocino Headlands State Parks, before glamping at Mendocino Grove.\n\nThe town of Mendocino itself is full of charm — colorful storefronts, cozy cafés, and galleries tucked along tree-lined streets with an ocean view. It's the perfect mix of outdoor adventure and slow, small-town California coastal charm.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, is one of those cities I always find myself coming back to.\n\nI love wandering around the historic French Quarter and South of Broad areas, strolling along the Battery, enjoying Lowcountry cuisine, and browsing the boutiques and galleries.\n\nIn my opinion, Charleston is one of the most charming places in the country.\n\nAlthough I think Montana is worth visiting in its entirety, I love spending time in Glacier National Park. The mountains are massive and create the kind of scenes that make you stop and stare.\n\nWhether I'm hiking along alpine trails (I recommend the Highline and Avalanche Lake trails), driving down the iconic 50-mile scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road through the park, or just pausing to take in the views at Lake McDonald, the landscape here never fails to amaze me.\n\nCumberland Island, Georgia, is a wild and peaceful barrier island with 17.5 miles of undeveloped beaches and free-roaming wild horses.\n\nWhen I visited, I biked past the ruins of the 19th century Dungeness Mansion, explored the Plum Orchard mansion, and visited the First African Baptist Church, where John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette were married.\n\nOverall, it's a very unique, seemingly untouched place to visit.\n\nWestern North Carolina is one of my favorite parts of the country. I love exploring the towns around Asheville — Hendersonville, Boone, and Brevard.\n\nThe latter is my favorite, with the Brevard Music Center bringing classical performances to the mountains each summer. Plus, there are plenty of opportunities for outdoor recreation nearby.\n\nBetween the waterfalls, hiking trails, and small-town vibes, it's a part of the state I keep coming back to.\n\nI've visited Alaska many times and it's massive. Because of its size, though, it can sometimes be challenging to navigate, which is why I always recommend using Anchorage as a base.\n\nI love staying at the Wildbirch Hotel downtown, grabbing breakfast at Biscuit Club next door, or having pizza at Moose's Tooth before heading out on adventures.\n\nPlus, one of my favorite scenic drives of all time is just south of Anchorage along Turnagain Arm. I recommend stopping in Girdwood to stretch your legs and grab a beer at Girdwood Brewing.\n\nFrom Anchorage, I've also taken glacier tours out of Whittier, driven out to explore the charming village of Hope, and gone on trips to Katmai and Lake Clark National Parks.\n\nBetween the wildlife, glaciers, and endless landscapes, it's a place that never stops amazing me.\n\nAs someone who's visited all 50 states, coastal Maine will always be on my short list for the most beautiful places in the US.\n\nI love starting my trip in the quaint town of Kennebunkport, visiting the iconic Portland Head Light in Cape Elizabeth, and then making the drive to hike in Acadia National Park.\n\nIf you have time, I recommend following the coast up to Lubec, the easternmost point in the continental US, for a taste of why this rugged, timeless coastline is so unforgettable.",

    "fullText": "ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey and Armenia have agreed to simplify visa procedures as part of efforts to normalize ties, Turkey's Foreign Ministry announced Monday, making it easier for their citizens to travel between the two countries.\n\nRelations between Turkey and Armenia have long been strained by historic grievances and Turkey’s alliance with Azerbaijan. The two neighboring countries have no formal diplomatic ties and their joint border has remained closed since the 1990s.\n\nThe two countries however, agreed to work toward normalization in 2021, appointing special envoys to explore steps toward reconciliation and reopening the frontier. Those talks have progressed in parallel with efforts to ease tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nTurkey supported Azerbaijan during its 2020 conflict with Armenia for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, a territorial dispute that had lasted nearly four decades.\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on social platform X that Ankara and Yerevan agreed that holders of diplomatic, special and service passports from both countries would be able to obtain electronic visas free of charge as of Jan. 1.\n\n“On this occasion, Turkey and Armenia reaffirm once again their commitment to continue the normalization process between the two countries with the goal of achieving full normalization without any preconditions,” the ministry said.\n\nTurkey and Armenia also have a more than century-old dispute over the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians in massacres, deportations and forced marches that began in 1915 in Ottoman Turkey. Historians widely view the event as genocide.\n\nTurkey denies the deaths constituted genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of civil war and unrest. It has lobbied to prevent countries from officially recognizing the massacres as genocide.",

    "fullText": "HOLBROOK, Ariz. (AP) — Investigators declined to reveal the suspected motive in the shooting death of a prominent California farmer’s estranged wife in eastern Arizona, but they said the couple's prolonged divorce case arose in nearly all interviews with family and friends.\n\nMichael Abatti, 63, was arrested last week in El Centro, California, in the shooting death of Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, at her family’s vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.\n\nInvestigators, who discussed the case at a news conference Monday, say Michael Abatti traveled from El Centro to Pinetop on Nov. 20, carried out the killing and returned to California early the next morning. They declined to say what occurred at the Pinetop house in the last days of Kerri Abatti’s life.\n\n“Different theories will come up,” Navajo County Sheriff David Clouse said of the motive. “The only thing that’s glaring that I think everybody already knows is there’s a divorce in place and they weren’t able to come to a resolution. But I can’t speak exactly to what the motive would be.”\n\nOwen Roth, one of Michael Abatti’s attorneys, said his client surrendered to law enforcement, agreed to be extradited to Arizona and remains innocent under the law. “Our client is in his mid-60s and has significant health issues, and we continue to worry about his well-being,” Roth said. “We ask the public to respect his privacy and constitutional rights and reiterate that this case will be decided based on the evidence by a jury.” An autopsy report released Monday said Kerri Abatti’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nThe report said she was found unconscious on the floor near her kitchen by her nephew, who told investigators he heard a loud sound before finding her. When investigators searched the home they found a “circular defect” on a window and determined “a gunshot likely originated from the yard outside the home,” the autopsy report said.\n\nThe Associated Press left a message for the Navajo County Sheriff’s Office for further explanation. The medical examiner’s office in Coconino County, which conducted the autopsy, directed questions about the report to a Navajo County official, and the AP also left a message for the official. A descendant of early Latter-day Saints settlers who helped found Pinetop in the 1880s, Kerri had filed for divorce, with proceedings pending in California at the time of her death.\n\nAuthorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife’s death.\n\nMichael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops. His grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region’s early settlers and his father helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association.\n\nMichael Abatti served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.\n\nThe Abattis, who married in 1992 and had three children, were sparring over finances. Kerri told the court the couple had lived an affluent lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned property in three states, vacationed internationally and sent their children to private school.\n\nKerri initially received $5,000 monthly temporary spousal support. She later sought an increase, citing struggles to maintain her standard of living as well as keep up the Arizona property. She also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney’s fees, court filings showed.\n\nMichael Abatti eventually agreed to raise support to $6,400 monthly, despite having countered in a court filing that poor farming years had reduced his income. He blamed market shifts favoring Ukrainian crops, rising shipping costs and harsh weather.",

    "title": "8 things to pack for a Disney vacation and 3 to leave behind, from a travel planner who's visited the parks over 40 times",
    "description": "As a frequent Disney World visitor and travel planner, there are things I always pack to survive park days, such as ponchos, plus some I never bring.",
    "fullText": "After going to Disney World over 40 times, I've gotten really good at visiting the parks — especially when it comes to optimizing the space in my suitcase.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels specializing in Disney destinations, so my clients often ask me about the most important items to pack for a trip to the parks.\n\nRead on for the essentials I always bring, as well as the things I think you can leave at home.\n\nIf you've spent any time in the Orlando area, you know it will likely rain during your Disney trip.\n\nDon't let that stop you from having fun — just throw on rain ponchos and hit the parks. It's often much cheaper to buy them before you leave rather than inside Disney World.\n\nYou can also wear ponchos if you don't want to get wet on rides like Splash Mountain and Kali River Rapids.\n\nI've tried out every kind of bag you can imagine when visiting the parks. Ultimately, my biggest advice is to bring something small that fits your main essentials.\n\nMy husband's favorite is a cross-body bag, and I love a small backpack, purse, or fanny pack.\n\nYou want something that's easy to take on and off quickly, compact enough to take on rides, and roomy enough that you're not cramming your phone and necessities in.\n\nWhen you head to the parks, you want to travel light, so I like having smaller versions of essentials to carry.\n\nI raid the travel section of my local store before every trip to make sure I have sunscreen, hand sanitizer, aloe-vera gel, sanitizing wipes, a mini first-aid kit, pain relievers, and tissues.\n\nIt's not a Disney trip without the quintessential Mickey or Minnie ears. At this point, I have plenty to choose from based on different seasons, holidays, and moods.\n\nI also pack some of my many Disney T-shirts — one for each day at the parks. We always get one special matching family shirt for each trip, as well.\n\nThis way, we can stay on theme without feeling tempted to spend money on more merchandise while in the parks.\n\nA lot of planning in the parks requires the use of the My Disney Experience app, which is crucial for tasks like checking maps or making dining reservations. Plus, we love snapping lots of photos.\n\nVisiting Disney involves a lot of walking — on many days in the parks, I log over 10 miles. Also, because of frequent rain and water rides, my shoes often get wet.\n\nSo, I bring comfortable, fast-drying shoes to ensure my experience isn't ruined by blisters or sore feet. My husband always wears his Keen sandals, and I switch between my Sanuks and Tevas.\n\nMy family has made it a tradition to send a letter or postcard to someone back home from inside the parks.\n\nYou can always bring souvenir postcards to the front desk of your resort. However, it's more fun to put it in one of the four mailboxes on Main Street USA at Magic Kingdom.\n\nYou can pay for almost everything at Disney World with Disney gift cards, including dining, merchandise, and resort charges.\n\nMany external retailers offer small discounts when you purchase these cards, so buying them ahead of time is a great way to save a little money on your vacation.\n\nTo curb excess spending, we give each of our kids a gift card at the beginning of the trip for souvenirs. Once they use up their card's balance, they're done spending.\n\nAside from Victoria and Albert's at the Grand Floridian Resort, none of the Disney dining locations really expect more than casual dress.\n\nI love this aspect of Disney World because it means there are wonderful dining options with upscale-feeling food that are still super family-friendly.\n\nMy husband and I usually throw one nicer casual outfit in our suitcase if we decide we want to get a little fancy. But, generally, our dress clothes get left in the closet at home.\n\nMy clients often ask me if they need to bring life jackets or towels for their children to enjoy the hotel pools. Fortunately, the answer is no.\n\nAll the Disney resorts provide these items, so you can save space in your suitcase and leave them at home.\n\nIt's nice to have a few quick snacks on hand in the hotel room or in your park bag, but don't waste space in your suitcase. You can have groceries delivered to your Disney resort.\n\nMost national delivery services are available, or Garden Grocer is a local option. These deliveries can be picked up in the lobby at no charge or sent straight to your room for a small fee.\n\nThis story was originally published in January 2022 and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

Outlets, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said the deal is worth $1.2 billion.\n\n\"This investment, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, builds on Blackstone's leading global position in leisure and hospitality, including in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, where it has made significant investments across Australia, Japan, and India,\" Blackstone said in a press release.\n\nBlackstone valued its real estate portfolio, which includes numerous vacation destinations worldwide, at $611 billion as of September 2025.\n\nHere is what Blackstone is getting with its latest purchase.\n\nHamilton Island is part of the Whitsunday Islands chain in Queensland, located off the northeast coast of Australia. The Ngaro people originally lived on the Whitsunday Islands, which are near the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nTourists from Australia's outback and southern region began vacationing at Hamilton Island in the 1920s, according to the Hamilton Island tourism website.\n\nHamilton Island transformed into a resort destination in the 1980s under Keith Williams, who owned and operated the island for two decades, according to the tourism website.\n\nDuring that time, he built Hamilton Island's marina and a resort. The island was later acquired by the family of Bob Oatley, a famous Australian winemaker.\n\nThe Hamilton Island tourism website said the Oatley family spends millions of dollars each year on upgrading the infrastructure, accommodations, and services.\n\nHamilton Island measures 2,800 acres across two islands. There are five hotels, 20 retailers, over 20 restaurants and bars, a marina, a golf course, and a commercial airport.\n\nAbout 70% of the area remains undeveloped, Blackstone said.\n\nHamilton Island is located near the Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As a result, significant efforts are made to preserve the area.\n\nIn addition to sustainable waste disposal, the tourism site said the island has nature-based experiences to educate guests, island-wide erosion and sediment control measures, water treatment plans, liquid composters, and more.\n\nHamilton Island has a range of activities for guests, including ATV riding for children, snorkeling, mountain biking, a golf club, a yacht club, and more.\n\nHamilton Island's position near the Coral Sea makes it an ideal destination for sailing, a popular activity among visitors. In addition to the marina and local yacht club, Hamilton Island has hosted an annual sailing race week for four decades.\n\nThe next race week is scheduled for August 2026.\n\nNearly two decades ago, Queensland's tourism office launched a campaign encouraging people to apply for the \"Best Job in the World\": a six-month stint as a caretaker on Hamilton Island.\n\nQueensland's tourism website said the winner, Ben Southall, beat out over 34,000 applicants from over 200 countries. The BBC reported that the position came with a $150,000 salary and a luxury villa for accommodation.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sharonda Scott, 37, an LA-based stuntwoman. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTwo years ago, at 35, I decided to take what I now call my \"radical sabbatical.\"\n\nMy life in Los Angeles had turned into a whirlwind of auditions, stunts, and constant training. I had been working in the entertainment industry as a stuntwoman and actor since I was 30, but by early 2024, after the writers' and actors' strikes, I hit a wall.\n\nThe industry had slowed to a trickle, my savings were tight, and I realized the way I was living — chasing gigs, enjoying luxury, yet constantly stressed — just wasn't sustainable anymore.\n\nI grew up in Detroit as the youngest of five, raised by a single mom. College took me to the University of Miami, where I switched from pre-med to international studies and spent time in Brazil learning Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nAfter graduation, I worked in prostate cancer research but knew it wasn't my path. I bounced between singing, fashion design, and volunteer work in Rio before moving to LA — where a background acting job unexpectedly led me into stunt work.\n\nMy first big break came when I got hired to be Miranda Bailey's stunt double on \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\nBut by January 2024, the industry was quiet, and I found myself anxious about bills despite careful saving.\n\nI felt trapped. It was a conversation with a close friend that changed everything: \"What do you really want?\"\n\nI wanted to travel and experience the world beyond LA. So I started imagining a sabbatical — not for a few weeks, but for a full year or more.\n\nI didn't have a detailed plan. I wrote down 12 countries I hoped to visit, sold everything in my LA apartment, broke my lease, and found someone to rent my car to cover the payments.\n\nMy friends and family were supportive; they helped me pack and even bought some of my things to help fund the trip. My rule was to spend no more than $500 per plane ticket, which wasn't too hard since most were one-way.\n\nPeople warned me about traveling solo as a woman in India, but from the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed.\n\nWhat I thought would be a short stay became transformative. Two young girls who had experienced trauma arrived the same week, and we quickly became inseparable.\n\nFrom there, the journey unfolded organically. My sister joined whenever she could get time off — she ended up traveling with me to 13 countries. Even my mom, who had feared flying for decades, caught up with me along the way.\n\nWe zip-lined along cliffs in Cape Verde, rode camels in Morocco, and cage-dived with sharks in South Africa. In Zimbabwe, we even cage-dived with crocodiles. We paraglided over Rio during Carnival and danced for hours at a salsa congress in Paris.\n\nBut I also found magic in the quieter moments — sharing meals with locals in Vietnam and Thailand, wandering Moroccan souks, and experiencing festivals and ceremonies through invitations from people I met on the road.\n\nIn the Philippines, I completed my divemaster certification, mastering skills I had been working toward for years. In Scotland, I celebrated a friend's wedding, reconnecting with people I hadn't seen in years.\n\nTraveling solo forced me to problem-solve constantly: exchanging currency, navigating transportation, finding food, and making friends in unfamiliar cultures.\n\nAs an introvert who thrives on connection, I discovered I could build community anywhere, and those relationships shaped my experience as much as the places themselves.\n\nI slowed down, learned to trust the process, and stopped striving for the American dream as defined by society: the house, the car, the white picket fence. My dream became freedom — the ability to move, explore, and experience the world on my own terms.\n\nNow, back in the US, I'm navigating reverse culture shock. Hollywood is pretty much decentralizing itself; auditions are scattered. I'm exploring new projects in travel filmmaking and documentary work.\n\nBut my long-term vision is clearer than ever: I want to live abroad.\n\nLooking back, my advice for anyone considering an adult gap year is simple: don't overthink it. Reduce your financial anchors, embrace flexibility, and trust the process.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "fullText": "4 p.m. window update: The Eagles beat the Bills courtesy of a last second stop on a Buffalo two-point conversion attempt. The Bills loss means the Patriots have clinched the AFC East title. They now will play for the No. 1 seed in Week 18.\n\nGame update: The Patriots’ blowout win over the Jets has New England on the cusp of clinching the AFC East title. If the Bills lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles later today, the Patriots will wrap up the division title.\n\nIf the Bills win that game, the Patriots will have to wait until Week 18 to clinch the division. New England would just need a win over the Miami Dolphins to clinch their first division title since 2019.\n\nNew England’s win also denied the Broncos a chance at wrapping up the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nTwo AFC East rivals meet on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.\n\nOne team has already clinched a playoff spot, but the other would love to play spoiler.\n\nHere is what is at stake Sunday when the New York Jets host the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Buffalo Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. The Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the division back in Week 15 when they blew a 24-7 halftime lead to the Bills, but still remain in the driver’s seat in the division title race. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nWith the Jets already eliminated from the playoffs, this game has no tiebreaker implications between the two teams.\n\nHowever, it could play a role in the chase for the AFC East title. Right now the Patriots have a one-game lead over the Bills, and with the two teams having split the season series, the second tiebreaker is division record. New England has a 3-1 record in AFC East games (with the Jets and Miami Dolphins remaining) while the Bills are 3-2, with the Jets on the schedule in Week 18. A New England loss to the Jets opens the door to the Patriots and Bills finishing with the same division record, which would then move the AFC East title to the third tiebreaker, which is record in common games. Right now the Patriots are 9-1 in those games while the Bills are 9-2, but a loss to the Jets would drop New England to 9-2.\n\nWhich would potentially mean the AFC East title would be decided by the fourth tiebreaker, AFC record. Entering Week 17 the Bills have a better record in conference games, 8-3 versus 7-3.",

    "fullText": "DENVER (KDVR) — Hundreds of flights were delayed at Denver International Airport on Sunday as snow across the country and heavy holiday travel combined to slow operations on one of the busiest travel days of the season.\n\nAirport officials said passenger volume was high as travelers returned home from holiday celebrations, while others arrived in Denver ahead of New Year’s festivities. Long lines formed throughout the airport, from parking shuttles to baggage check and security checkpoints.\n\nSee the latest traffic conditions in Denver on FOX31\n\nSecurity wait times reached about 30 minutes at their peak on Sunday morning. While most travelers moved through the lines without major issues, at least one passenger said the delays caused her to miss a flight.\n\n“I couldn’t get through security, and I had a really nice guy help me get a flight change,” said Kelly Marlor, who was traveling Sunday.\n\nFlightAware reported that more than 480 flights at Denver International Airport were delayed or canceled by 2 p.m. Some travelers also experienced turbulent flights due to windy conditions.\n\n“It was really bad turbulence,” said Sonia Rosenberg, who was visiting friends in Denver. “They couldn’t even give us drinks or snacks on our flight, but it was fine. We made it here. So that’s all that matters.”\n\nDespite the crowds, many travelers said they expected delays and came prepared with extra time. Travelers who spoke to FOX31 said the busy airport was a small price to pay after spending the holidays with loved ones.\n\n“It was a lot of fun,” said Patricia Cunningham, who was traveling home to Albuquerque after visiting her kids for Christmas. “The weather was unusually warm, but we woke up to a little bit of snow today, so that was kind of nice.”\n\nOutside the terminals, reunions played out as friends and family greeted arriving passengers. Risa Nutt and Samantha Freedberg said they were picking up friends they met at summer camp and planned to spend New Year’s together in Denver.\n\n“We’re spending New Year together, so we’re going to take them to all the iconic places,” Nutt said.\n\nAirport officials estimate more than 750,000 passengers traveled through Denver International Airport from Dec. 19 through Sunday.",

    "description": "The US president flies on Air Force One. World leaders in other countries also have their own official aircraft.",
    "fullText": "The Boeing VC-25 is arguably the most famous jetliner in the world, even though most people have never heard of it.\n\nMost do know it, though, by the call sign it's assigned when the president of the United States is on board: Air Force One.\n\nAir Force One is instantly recognizable, both as the president's airplane and as a flying symbol of American military and economic might. With its hand-polished blue, white, and silver livery, Air Force One boldly proclaims the arrival of the leader of the free world.\n\nThe US president is not the only one to have their own presidential jet. A number of prominent international leaders also use some form of executive transport.\n\nThe Boeing 747 jumbo jet is a popular option for many nations, including China, India, and South Korea. The Airbus A330 and A340 are also commonly found in presidential fleets.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the presidents, chancellors, and prime ministers of the world travel.\n\nThe Boeing VC-25A entered service as Air Force One in 1990. At 231 feet long, it can transport 30 crew members and 71 passengers.\n\nThere are two nearly identical Boeing jets that serve as the official transport of the president. Normally, the planes are referred to by their tail numbers: 28000 and 29000. When the commander-in-chief steps on board, they take on the call sign \"Air Force One.\"\n\nNew VC-25B Air Force One planes, based on the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, are now expected to be ready by 2028 after years of delays. Boeing has already lost over $2 billion on the project due to various manufacturing and supply-chain issues.\n\nThe presidential jets are operated by the Presidential Airlift Group out of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.\n\nThe smaller C-32, measuring 155 feet long, normally serves as the US vice president's plane. It is used by the president for travel to smaller airports that don't have the infrastructure for the larger Air Force One jet.\n\nUntil 2015, the UK prime minister chartered commercial jets for state visits.\n\nThe modified Airbus A330 was converted for VIP duties in 2015, but can still serve as a refueling tanker when not on state business. It is outfitted with 58 business-class seats.\n\nIn 2020, its gray Royal Air Force livery was repainted with a new white color and the Union Jack on the tail, a refurbishment that cost £900,000, or around $1.1 million, the BBC reported.\n\nNicknamed \"The Flying Kremlin,\" the Ilyushin Il-96-300 measures over 181 feet long and can hold 262 passengers, The National Interest reported.\n\nThe Russian president has also been known to fly on a fleet of smaller executive aircraft based on the Tupolev Tu-214 airliner. Tupolev TU-214s were designed as the Russian equivalent of Boeing 757s and can hold around 210 passengers.\n\nGerman leaders previously used modified Airbus A340-300 airliners for official travel, but they were withdrawn from service and put up for sale in 2024 after experiencing maintenance issues with German officials on board.\n\nThe German fleet also features several Airbus A320-family-based executive jets.\n\nWhen carrying the president of France, the plane's call sign is COTAM 001.\n\nFrance's presidential fleet also includes several Airbus A310-300s and Airbus A340-200s.\n\nDesignated as B-2479, the plane can fly 14,320 kilometers, or around 8898 miles, without stopping to refuel.\n\nJapan's old Air Force One plane, a Boeing 747-400, was listed for sale on an aviation classifieds site for $28 million in 2019.\n\nThe plane uses the call sign \"Code One\" while carrying the South Korean president. Leased from Korean Air, it began serving as South Korea's presidential aircraft in 2021, AeroTime reported.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil switched from using a luxurious Airbus A319 corporate jet to the more utilitarian KC-30 after the presidential plane experienced a technical issue in 2024 while visiting Mexico, Reuters reported.\n\nBrazil's presidential fleet also features several domestically produced Embraer VIP transports.\n\nThe Canadian government bought the Airbus A-330-200, known as Airbus 02, from Kuwait Airways for $50 million in 2023, CBC reported.\n\nPoland received its first Boeing 737 BBJ2 jet in 2021 featuring the serial number 0111 and nicknamed \"Roman Dmowski\" after the Polish politician, Key.Aero reported.\n\nWhen carrying the prime minister, the plane is known as \"India One.\" It can fly for 13,500 kilometers, or around 8,388 miles, without refueling.\n\nThe fleet includes Airbus A330-200s, Airbus A340-500s, and a Boeing 747-8I private jet reportedly gifted to Turkey by the Qatari government, the BBC reported.\n\nThe plane is nicknamed \"Chammae-1,\" named after North Korea's national bird, AP reported.\n\nIn June, Iran's presidential plane flew to Jordan accompanied by two Airbus A321s, The War Zone reported.\n\nAustralia's KC-30A, a modified Airbus A330, features the gray Royal Australian Air Force livery with a kangaroo design.\n\nThe plane is known as \"Wing of Zion,\" with the registration \"4X-ISR.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published by Benjamin Zhang in April 2019.

    "fullText": "When I tell people I bought a fixer-upper in Vermont with my siblings, the reaction is almost always the same: part envy, part amusement, part horror.\n\n\"That's so exciting, but you must really like your siblings. I could never do that with mine. It would end in disaster,\" they say.\n\nDid I mention the house — tucked deep in the woods — is nearly impossible to find, three stories tall, and has no interior staircases or electricity?\n\nMy brother, sister, and I grew up with a second home that served as a vacation house (and a source of rental income for our parents).\n\nSo, I liked the idea of buying a property and continuing this tradition with my siblings. My brother was immediately on board, and not to be left out, our sister quickly agreed to the venture as well.\n\nTogether, we decided on a few rules for purchasing a property: At least one of us would need to see it in person, and at least two of us would have to agree to make the purchase.\n\nWe also didn't want to buy a place too far from any of our current homes, so we looked for properties in New England.\n\nAfter three years of searching, we settled on a fixer-upper home in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom that was within our budget.\n\nOur house needs a lot of work, but the process has been somewhat slow because all three of us have full-time jobs and the property is between four and seven hours from our respective homes.\n\nMy brother has been there the most often to check in, meet contractors, and mow a path through the often-overgrown grass to the front door.\n\nHowever, the few weekends where we've all worked on the house together feel like an episode of a low-budget renovation show, except more bickering and no production crew.\n\nAs the eldest daughter, I tend to slip into project-manager mode, whether I mean to or not. I create long to-do lists and ask many questions about the plan that my brother attempts to answer — and my sister mediates when we get frustrated with each other.\n\nWe've argued about everything from which of the previous owner's possessions to discard to where the key lock box should go and how to start a generator.\n\nSomehow, we've still managed to get some things done: We created signs to mark the hidden road and driveway, cleared out the house, installed insulation, and started taking quotes for solar panels.\n\nFor now, this process has been 100% worth it, not just because of the future I'm able to imagine here, but for the journey we're taking to achieve it.\n\nOn challenging days, I often wonder what exactly we've gotten ourselves into, but my siblings are smart and kind, and I'm glad I still really like them.\n\nMy brother was originally hoping the home would be mostly livable by the end of the year. However, we still need to install staircases and fix the electricity — among many other things, so I'm not so sure.\n\nMy hope, though, is that within two years we won't be embarrassed to invite people to stay for a weekend, and that one day, this place will be a shared refuge.\n\nI picture it as the backdrop for long summer weekends, big dinners with family and friends, and quiet mornings; a place where we take long walks with our dogs, where our kids run barefoot in the grass, and where we can all catch our breath when the world feels like too much.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham travel to Selhurst Park on Sunday afternoon facing a familiar challenge this season: how to balance tactical continuity with enforced changes. Another London derby arrives at a delicate moment for Thomas Frank, whose side have shown flashes of cohesion and attacking fluency but continue to be disrupted by suspensions and long-term absentees.\n\nThis fixture against Crystal Palace comes with heightened scrutiny, not just because of recent results, but because squad availability is once again shaping selection decisions. With several senior figures ruled out and others edging closer to returns, Tottenham’s predicted lineup reflects both necessity and opportunity as the Premier League calendar reaches its congested winter phase.\n\nTottenham’s defensive structure will look different this weekend after a costly previous outing. Cristian Romero is suspended following his red card, while Xavi Simons will also serve a ban after a separate disciplinary incident. Their absence removes two influential presences from Frank’s preferred XI and forces a reshuffle at the back.\n\nKevin Danso is expected to step into central defence alongside Micky van de Ven, offering physicality and aerial security against a Palace side that remain dangerous from set-pieces. Pedro Porro should continue at right-back, while Destiny Udogie would ordinarily start on the left, but his fitness situation complicates matters.\n\nIf Udogie is not deemed ready, Tottenham may have to adapt again, potentially asking van de Ven to cover wider areas or adjusting their build-up shape to compensate. The defensive line will therefore be under pressure to settle quickly, particularly in an away environment that can turn hostile early.\n\nIn midfield, Tottenham are likely to retain a double pivot designed to provide stability rather than risk. Rodrigo Bentancur is expected to anchor proceedings, offering composure in possession and positional discipline out of possession. He is likely to be partnered by Archie Gray, whose growing influence has been one of the more encouraging developments in recent weeks.\n\nFurther forward, Lucas Bergvall should continue to operate between the lines, tasked with linking midfield to attack and finding pockets of space behind Palace’s midfield block. His intelligence off the ball has become increasingly important in a side that has often lacked a natural rhythm during disrupted spells.\n\nThe absence of Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr, both unavailable due to international commitments, limits Frank’s options and underlines the importance of managing workload carefully across the festive period.\n\nTottenham’s attacking selection is expected to reward recent performances. Richarlison is in line to start through the middle after making a notable impact from the bench last time out. His energy and physical presence offer a different dimension to Spurs’ forward play, particularly against a Palace defence that prefers to hold a compact shape.\n\nOut wide, Mohammed Kudus and Randal Kolo Muani are expected to support the central striker, providing pace and directness in transition. Kudus, in particular, has become a key outlet in one-on-one situations, while Kolo Muani’s movement allows Tottenham to stretch the pitch vertically.\n\nThe emphasis will be on fluidity rather than rigid positional play, with Frank encouraging interchanges across the front four to disrupt Palace’s defensive organisation.\n\nTottenham’s injury list remains a significant factor in planning. Dominic Solanke continues to recover from a persistent ankle issue that has sidelined him since August, while Dejan Kulusevski is still working his way back from a long-standing patella problem. James Maddison is unlikely to feature again this season as he progresses through rehabilitation following a serious knee injury.\n\nUdogie’s hamstring injury is being monitored closely, with a return expected early in the new year rather than this weekend. Elsewhere, Takai also remains unavailable, adding further strain to squad depth.\n\nFrank has consistently played down timelines, preferring to reintegrate players only when they are fully ready. That approach is shaping Tottenham’s predicted lineup as much as tactical preference, with availability dictating selection more than form in several positions.\n\nTottenham are expected to line up in a 4-2-3-1 system, with Vicario in goal; Porro, Danso, van de Ven and potentially Udogie across the back; Bentancur and Gray in midfield; Kolo Muani, Bergvall and Kudus supporting Richarlison.\n\nThis match represents another test of Tottenham’s adaptability. While injuries and suspensions continue to disrupt continuity, there is a growing sense that the underlying structure is beginning to hold. How effectively this predicted lineup performs may go a long way towards defining the tone of Tottenham’s second half of the season.",

    "fullText": "With Donald Trump expanding the travel ban inspired by his first term in the White House to 20 more countries, as well as the Palestinian Authority, on Dec. 16, a total of 39 countries from different corners of the world now face either a total ban or restrictions on entering the United States.\n\nMali, South Sudan, Niger, Burkina Faso, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority have been added to the list of nations whose citizens cannot enter the U.S. at all, first introduced in June.\n\nAngola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were meanwhile added to a list of countries facing a block on student and business visas; the list that Trump put in place in June 2025 previously included Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.\n\nImmediately after their nations were added to the ban, multiple diplomats and heads of state responded with condemnation. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a statement saying that the Caribbean country's government was \"deeply disappointed\" given that the justification accusing it of loose rules for granting citizenship by investment \"does not reflect the present reality of our laws.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the expansion of the ban, the West African nation of Niger has taken the most drastic step of permanently banning any granting of new visas to U.S. visas in a reciprocal measure until the situation changes.\n\n\"Niger is completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States,\" a governmental representative said to the Associated Press.\n\nA landlocked country bordered by Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger is a Muslim-majority nation with a population of just over 25 million people. In the document announcing the travel ban, the White House said the country has a visa overstay rate of 13.41% for business visas and 16.46% for student ones as well as \"terrorists and their supporters [that] are active in planning kidnappings.\"\n\nWhile a history of war and political instability and coups d'états means that travel into Niger from Western countries remains very low (the State Department has kept it at the \"do not travel\" advisory level for years), the latest move from its government is a major escalation in relations.",

    "title": "Immigration lawyers say the H-1B chaos is forcing tough business calls",
    "description": "H-1B visa policy shifts in 2025 cause firms to reconsider staffing, use alternative visas, and update HR travel guidance.",
    "fullText": "Since September, the H-1B visa program has been caught in a whirlwind of changes.\n\nAs a result, companies nationwide are scrambling to determine their next steps, rewriting travel guidance for foreign workers, and lining up backup staffing plans, including shifting some work overseas, according to five immigration attorneys who spoke with Business Insider.\n\n\"Unpredictability is one of the number one enemies for business,\" said Rohit Srinivasa, an immigration attorney based in Los Angeles who works with startups and medium-sized tech companies.\n\nFirst came a $100,000 fee on new applications in September. Then came social media vetting requirements that left visa holders stranded abroad during the holidays. Now, a wage-based lottery system will favor the highest-paid applicants by giving them more chances in the annual H-1B lottery.\n\nImmigration lawyers say the constant policy shifts have companies tightening sponsorship guidelines, re-budgeting for higher costs, and gaming out contingency plans for a program that keeps changing shape.\n\nCompanies are taking a more calculated approach to who they sponsor for work visas and how they do so, attorneys told Business Insider.\n\nDivij Kishore, an immigration attorney at New York-based Flagship Law, which represents clients across various sectors, including tech, healthcare, and energy, told Business Insider that he has seen a 40% to 50% drop in H-1B sponsorship inquiries compared to previous years.\n\nTypically, by this time of the year, clients reach out with lists of employees they'd like to sponsor for the spring lottery, Kishore said.\n\n\"This year, that's not been the case because employers are just not sure what the costs are,\" Kishore said.\n\nOn the other hand, K. Edward Raleigh, a partner at immigration firm Fragomen, which represents some of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, including Apple and Nvidia, told Business Insider that he hasn't seen a material slowdown in H-1B filings overall, as most are renewals for existing workers.\n\nStill, companies are \"tightening up their sponsorship guidelines\" and \"proceeding with caution, understanding that various things could trigger the fee,\" he said.\n\nThis recalculation is occurring despite the $100,000 fee having a narrow scope. It applies to new visa petitions for workers living abroad and does not apply to the vast majority of cases, such as foreign students already in the US switching from an academic visa to a work visa or existing H-1B holders changing employers.\n\n\"One of the main attributes of this administration is that they keep people guessing,\" said Ted Chiappari, who leads the immigration practice at law firm Duane Morris. \"Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back to things on Wednesday.\"\n\nFewer H-1B visas have been issued to Indian IT consulting firms, according to data from the National Foundation for American Policy, an Arlington-based nonprofit research organization focused on immigration and international trade.\n\nInstead, for the first time in the program's history, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google occupied the top four spots for H-1B approvals in fiscal year 2025, a shift that began before the recent policy upheaval. The trend suggests companies were already reassessing tech hiring strategies before the recent policy changes.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Srinivasa believes the H-1B will endure, saying the program is \"so baked in\" to the US economy, he said, that it's undergoing overhaul rather than replacement.\n\nSome sectors saw more impact than others. Universities and nonprofit healthcare organizations that have historically recruited professors and medical workers from abroad have largely stopped filing petitions subject to the fee, Chiappari said. Unlike for-profit companies, these institutions can hire H-1B workers throughout the year without going through the annual lottery.\n\n\"That pipeline is now dried up,\" Chiappari said.\n\nRather than abandoning H-1B sponsorship, companies are exploring alternative pathways and backup strategies.\n\nSrinivasa said interest in O-1 visas for workers with \"extraordinary ability\" has surged, though not everyone qualifies. To qualify, applicants typically need to demonstrate a track record of impact and achievements in their field as evidenced by patents, awards, membership in select associations, and media coverage about them.\n\nSome founders from countries with US trade treaties are turning to E-2 investor visas, which also provide work authorization for spouses. Others are using the EB-1C path, where companies send managers abroad for a year before bringing them back to the US.\n\nCompanies are also increasingly establishing international offices and using L-1 visas to transfer employees to the US, or opting for services like Deel and Rippling that serve as the official employer, handling immigration paperwork on behalf of client companies.\n\nBig Tech, as well as Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have been expanding their operations in Indian cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad.\n\nKishore said some clients are preemptively reaching out to offshore providers to ramp up staffing capacity in case they are unable to bring workers to the US as planned.\n\n\"If they can't spend that same hundred dollars within the US next year, they will spend a hundred dollars outside the US,\" he added.\n\nStarting with the 2026 lottery, visa applications will be weighted based on salary level. Workers offered the highest wages will get four entries in the lottery, while those at the lowest tier get just one. The administration says this will ensure visas are awarded to the most skilled workers.\n\nRaleigh said companies are already thinking about how this will affect their recruitment strategy, \"without the exact terms of how those rules are going to work.\"\n\nThe change will likely benefit large tech companies that can afford to place workers in top salary bands, while creating challenges for smaller companies, nonprofits, and early-stage startups.\n\n\"Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission,\" said Sophie Alcorn, a Bay Area immigration attorney who focuses on startups and entrepreneurs. \"Those same startups may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system.\"\n\nKishore said that a higher salary doesn't always mean more skill. A first-year associate at a major law firm might make $225,000, while an equally qualified associate at a smaller firm makes significantly less. Under the new system, the big-firm lawyer would have much better lottery chances, he said.\n\nSome attorneys are advising clients not to artificially inflate salaries to game the system. Chiappari said the spread between wage levels is typically $20,000 to $30,000 — far less than the $100,000 fee — and companies aren't rushing to increase compensation anyway.\n\nImmigration attorneys previously thought that the $100,000 fee might improve the chances for foreign students already studying in the US by increasing their chances if fewer companies enter candidates in the lottery. Now, the wage-based lottery means that it might not happen.\n\n\"That logic's been turned on its head,\" said Kishore, adding that students, who typically enter the workforce at lower salaries, will get fewer chances at the lottery.\n\nBeyond policy changes, companies are also recalibrating their compliance strategies to avoid triggering fees or violating new rules.\n\nRaleigh said that ensuring workers maintain valid immigration status has become even more critical, as any lapse could force someone to leave the country and return on a new H-1B visa, potentially triggering the $10,000 fee.\n\nCompanies are updating their HR policies, including guidance on social media presence for foreign hires, in response to new vetting requirements, Srinivasa said. Some are advising employees to avoid international travel altogether, even when technically permitted.\n\nChiappari said he still gets constant questions from worried H-1B holders about whether it's safe to travel internationally.\n\n\"Even if I write a three-page affidavit explaining how they're not going to have any trouble coming back to the United States, they're just not going to believe it, and they're staying here,\" Chiappari said. \"They're just not traveling.\"\n\nThe human cost is real: postponed weddings, skipped vacations, and delayed work travel.\n\n\"Employers,\" Kishore said, \"need to be prepared and agile for what's coming in the next few months.\"",

    "fullText": "THEY CALLED HER Gypset. The name, a combination of gypsy and jet set, wasn’t one she’d come up with herself; she’d gotten it from the writer Julia Chaplin, who coined the term in her 2009 book, Gypset Style, to evoke the vibe of bright young things who waft from Sayulita to Tangier to Topanga Canyon, crafting eclectic necklaces and draping yurts with Hermès cashmere. Athletic and glamorously bohemian, with glacial blue eyes and a silver ring in her nose, Gypset embodied her nickname’s ideal, always flying off to go skiing or hang out backstage at a rock show.\n\nHer given name was Lindsey Gleiche. She was 31 and lived in Huntington Beach, California, a short walk to the Pacific surf. Being a gypset is an occupation best suited for the independently wealthy, and Gleiche wasn’t that; she had a normal job, designing websites for Dollar General. But she was beautiful, friendly, and free-spirited.\n\nIn mid-2022, she met a man five years her junior, Riese Lenders, on a ski trip to Mammoth. Lenders was a pilot who was building his flight experience in Cessnas, turboprops, and small jets. He took her on jaunts to Las Vegas to see shows; to Arizona for her birthday; to the Bay Area for more music.\n\nIt was an intense but short-lived relationship. The two called it quits in spring 2023, but they continued to see each other occasionally, as exes sometimes do. On a Friday night in July, Gleiche was in her apartment getting ready to have dinner by herself when her phone rang. It was Lenders. He was about to take a spur-of-the-moment flight to Las Vegas with two older couples. The relationship was personal and professional—Lenders was working for Manuel Vargas, but the two were also friends. Perhaps that’s why Lenders was allowed to ask Gleiche if she wanted to tag along—they could make a night of it, hit some bars, and then fly home. What did she think?\n\nShe said yes right away. It was a nearly two-hour drive across the mountains to get to French Valley, the airstrip Lenders was departing from—a slog, but better than sitting at home on a Friday night.\n\nThe plane, a white Cessna Citation II jet with red and tan speed stripes, took off at 9:18 p.m. from the exurbs on the far side of the coastal mountains. Lenders, the pilot in command, sat in the front-left seat. To his right was his copilot, 32-year-old Vargas. Vargas had a successful real estate and landscaping business and flew helicopters, jets, and prop planes for both business and pleasure. He and his wife, Abby, had five kids, ranging in age from 1 to 14, and lived in a sprawling compound in Temecula. Abby was sitting in the back of the plane with Gleiche and the other couple, Alma, 51, and Abe Razick, 48. The Razicks had seven kids and owned several car dealerships in California and Arizona.",

    "fullText": "More than 60 million people across the U.S. are under winter weather alerts as a powerful storm system targets the Northeast after Christmas, while a separate atmospheric river continues to batter California with flooding rain, high winds and dangerous conditions.\n\nForecasters warn the systems could disrupt flights and road travel as millions of Americans head home after the holidays.\n\nThe severe weather is expected to unfold over several days, with impacts stretching from the West Coast to the Northeast. Forecasters say conditions on the ground could change quickly, affecting everything from short drives to long-distance travel. Here’s what to know about the most affected regions.\n\nThe tristate area is expected to bear the brunt of a major winter storm on Friday, with snow, sleet and freezing rain forecast to create hazardous travel conditions. Accumulating snow is forecast to hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — where a state of emergency has been declared — beginning Friday through early Saturday. Some forecast models suggest that parts of New York and New Jersey will see up to 9 inches of snow, depending on the storm’s track.\n\nThe storm is already disrupting air travel in the region. As of Friday morning, at least 1,300 flights across the U.S. had been canceled, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware, with delays expected to grow as the storm intensifies.\n\nSnowfall totals of roughly 1 to 6 inches are expected across northeastern Pennsylvania, much of New Jersey, large portions of New York state and parts of southern and central New England, with higher amounts possible in elevated areas north and west of New York City.\n\nThe system is also expected to bring sleet and freezing rain to parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and northern Virginia. A wintry mix is likely in cities including Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the West Coast, California is facing dangerous conditions from a powerful atmospheric river system bringing flooding rain, high winds and heavy mountain snow to the state.\n\nWith atmospheric rivers, intense rainfall, and strong winds ahead, I’m declaring a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties to activate emergency authorities and preposition resources to keep our communities safe. pic.twitter.com/C3eLImPkwx\n\n— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) December 24, 2025\n\nThe storm has already turned deadly, with at least three deaths reported in Southern California.\n\nParts of Southern California saw record-breaking rainfall earlier this week, with some locations seeing their wettest Christmas Eve or Christmas-week totals in decades.\n\nThe prolonged rainfall has increased the threat of mudslides, particularly in areas recently burned by wildfires. Officials have urged residents to avoid flooded roadways and to be prepared to evacuate if conditions worsen.\n\nAt higher elevations, the same storm system has delivered dangerous winter weather to the Sierra Nevada, making mountain travel hazardous across parts of California and western Nevada.\n\nAvalanche warnings were issued for parts of the Sierra as heavy snow and strong winds created unstable conditions in the mountains.
