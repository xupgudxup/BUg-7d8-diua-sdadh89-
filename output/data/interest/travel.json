    "title": "The 5 vacation destinations that will be more expensive to visit in 2026 because of tourist taxes",
    "description": "Cities in Japan, Scotland, and Spain are among the destinations that will become more expensive to visit in 2026 because of tourist taxes.",
    "fullText": "Tourists visiting Edinburgh after July 24 next year will be charged an extra 5% on top of their accommodation costs for the first five nights of their stay.\n\nThe City of Edinburgh Council said the charge is intended to raise money that will \"sustain Edinburgh's status as one of the world's greatest cultural and heritage cities.\"\n\nEvery year, Edinburgh's summer festivals — the Edinburgh International Festival, Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo — draw millions of tourists.\n\nThe council said the visitor levy is expected to raise up to £50 million ($67 million) a year by 2029, with the revenue earmarked for things like improving city infrastructure and managing tourism.\n\nTourists love Kyoto for its ancient temples, pagodas, and its cherry blossoms. But from early next year, staying in the Japanese city will become more expensive.\n\nAfter March 1, visitors in Kyoto will face higher overnight taxes on accommodation across the city.\n\nThe tax is tiered according to the nightly cost of accommodation: rooms under 6,000 yen, about $38, a night will remain taxed at 200 yen, or $1.28, while the tax on rooms priced between 6,000 and 20,000 yen a night will double to 400 yen.\n\nThe steepest increases will be applied to high-end accommodations. Rooms costing 50,000 to 100,000 yen a night will see the tax jump from 1,000 to 4,000 yen, and those over 100,000 yen will rise tenfold to 10,000 yen.\n\nKyoto's government estimates the revised tax will generate 12.6 billion yen a year, about $81 million.\n\nBarcelona is one of Europe's most visited cities, famed for its unusual architecture and urban beaches.\n\nTourists staying in five-star hotels and other luxury accommodations in the city now pay a regional tourism tax of 3.50 euros, about $4, a night.\n\nBut under a revised Catalan tax framework, that regional levy on high-end accommodation in Barcelona is set to double to 7 euros.\n\nThe increase was initially scheduled for 2025, but the Catalan government has delayed implementation until at least April 2026.\n\nThe measure comes amid growing anti-tourism sentiment in Spain. In the summers of 2024 and 2025, protesters in Barcelona demonstrated against overtourism and rising living costs.\n\nIn 2023, Thailand's cabinet approved in principle a 300 baht, about $10, entry fee for visitors arriving by air, and half that amount for those arriving by land or sea.\n\nThe fee was originally expected to be implemented in 2025, but it has repeatedly been delayed, partly because of weak tourism numbers.\n\nTourist arrivals from the start of this year to December 21 fell 7.25% compared to the same period a year earlier, according to Thailand's Ministry of Tourism and Sports.\n\nInternational tourism has long been a pillar of Thailand's economy, with visitors drawn to its temples, islands, and elephant treks.\n\nEuroNews reported that the 300 baht fee is now expected to be introduced in mid-2026.\n\nThe Norwegian government has introduced a law that gives municipalities the authority to impose a 3% tax on tourist accommodations, targeting both cruises and overnight stays.\n\nIt will roll out in 2026. It is not automatically in place in all municipalities, and cities struggling with the impact of tourism need to apply to implement the fee.\n\nMunicipalities such as Lofoten and Tromsø, which are renowned for their views of the northern lights, have already opted in, according to travel magazine AFAR.\n\nUnlike Thailand, Norway had a tourism boom this year. June, July, and August each broke records for the number of nights visitors spent in the country, totaling about 17.7 million guest nights across the summer, according to Norwegian tourism statistics.",

    "fullText": "Heavy rain and fierce winds from an atmospheric storm slammed Southern California on Wednesday, flooding roads and triggering mudslides as authorities urged parts of the region to evacuate.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties on Wednesday. Some areas had already received 4 to 8 inches of rain by Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAnother wave of the storm was expected to hit on Christmas Day, with flood and wind advisories for \"life-threatening\" storm conditions from the National Weather Service remaining in effect until Thursday afternoon.\n\nOver 163,000 homes and businesses across California were still without power on Christmas morning, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Redding Police Department reported one storm-related fatality in Northern California. Two more deaths occurred in South Sacramento and San Diego, CNN reported.\n\nThe storms are affecting the entire state, from San Francisco to Los Angeles.\n\nThe storms began on Christmas Eve, with the Weather Prediction Center warning that a \"dangerous scenario\" was on the way.\n\nPer CNN, 15 million people were still in the moderate-risk zone for flooding on Christmas Day.\n\nThe airport saw 3 inches of rainfall on the 24th.\n\nAccording to CNN, emergency crews were pulling people from flooded cars and homes, and some people even had to be rescued from their roofs via helicopter.\n\nSarah Bailey, a resident of the Wrightwood area for two decades, told the Times this was the worst flooding she'd seen.\n\nChristopher Prater, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department, told the outlet they'd received \"dozens\" of rescue calls on Wednesday night.\n\nA Pineapple Express is an atmospheric river, a band of concentrated water vapor. These \"rivers\" are responsible for 30 to 50% of California's rainfall.\n\nThe power outages are focused in Northern California, according to The New York Times.\n\nAny additional rainfall that comes on the 25th and 26th, even if it's less intense, could cause more flooding and debris to wash away, especially in areas that were devastated by the LA wildfires earlier this year.\n\n\"I am urging all Angelenos to stay safe and be extremely careful on the roads if you absolutely must travel,\" Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles said in a statement. \"Please do not take this storm lightly.\"",

    "description": "The family claimed in the lawsuit that the incident \"ruined their family vacation\" and caused embarrassment, inconvenience, and medical expenses.",
    "fullText": "There's no shortage of flight horror stories, but a bed bug infestation sounds particularly unsettling.\n\nThe Albuquerque's, a family of four from Virginia, filed a lawsuit against Delta and KLM on December 18 after they said they experienced a \"bed bug infestation\" on a flight from March 21.\n\n\"While aboard a Delta and KLM flight across the Atlantic, the entire Albuquerque Family was bitten and injured by bed bugs that had infested the cabin of the plane,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe family claimed in the lawsuit that the bites led to \"raised and itchy welts, lesions, and rashes across their torsos and extremities.\"\n\nThe lawsuit said the family wishes to be compensated for the incident, which \"ruined their family vacation\" and caused \"embarrassment, anxiety, discomfort, inconvenience, medical expenses, and loss of clothing and personal items.\"\n\nThe Albuquerque's took a Delta flight from Roanoke to Atlanta, then a KLM flight to Amsterdam, and then to Belgrade, Serbia, according to the lawsuit. The family had planned a vacation to Serbia to visit family and friends, the lawsuit stated.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Delta said that \"the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines.\" The airline added that it will \"review the complaint and respond accordingly in due course.\"\n\nThe filing states the flights were round-trip and business class, purchased through Delta's SkyMiles program, and operated by KLM. The four tickets were worth $8,800 at the time, according to the suit.\n\nRoughly two hours into the flight to Amsterdam, one of the plaintiffs started to feel like she was being bitten by bugs crawling on her, according to the filing. She then realized that bugs were \"crawling on her light-colored sweater,\" the filing stated.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the couple \"immediately\" notified the flight staff and were told to keep their voices down to avoid causing \"panic\" on the plane. The couple took photos and videos of the bugs crawling on the sweater and in the creases of their seats, which were included in the lawsuit.\n\nPrior to landing, the flight attendants urged the couple again not to tell anyone about the infestation because they would miss their connecting flight to Serbia if they did, the filing stated.\n\nA little over a week after the incident, the couple took their children to doctors in Roanoke, Virginia, where it was confirmed that the bites were caused by bed bugs, the lawsuit said. The family was recommended to employ \"bug bombs\" in their home and car, and wash their clothing in hot water, the filing said.\n\nWhile bed bugs are an unusual complaint, this isn't the first time passengers have turned to the courts after a bad flight experience. In September, 16 passengers sued American Airlines after their flight caught fire. Last year, a passenger sued Delta for $1 million, alleging a faulty armrest broke his rib.\n\nKLM did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "The holidays are all about time with family and friends. For some of us, that means pullout couches and six to a bathroom. For others, it's a villa in St. Barts or a ski house in Aspen.\n\nNow that the end of the year is upon us, the uber-wealthy are deploying their private jets and superyachts and heading to expensive destinations to enjoy vacations — and often the company of other billionaires.\n\n\"It's going to places that are exclusively pretty much high net worth,\" Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. \"They want these private resorts away from everyone else.\"\n\nMany of the world's largest yachts have already sailed to warmer waters.\n\nMark Zuckerberg's yacht, Launchpad, is in the Gulf of California, not far from Cabo San Lucas.\n\nOn the other side of the continent, Jeff Bezos's Koru, David Geffen's Rising Sun, and Eric Schmidt's Whisper are among the dozens of yachts floating in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nOnce their billionaire owners are aboard, several of these ships will likely head to St. Barts to celebrate New Year's Eve.\n\n\"I always say if you want to have your toes in the sand and eat a croissant that feels like you're in Paris, St. Barts is the place for you,\" Elisabeth Brown, the membership director at the luxury concierge service Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider.\n\nThose who don't stay aboard their ships can spend upward of $7,000 a night for a room — and well into five figures a night for a suite — at luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by the billionaire Bernard Arnault's LVMH.\n\nThe steep price is part of the appeal.\n\n\"There is nothing mass-market about it,\" Chesterfield said. \"It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy.\"\n\nOther superrich travelers choose to embrace the winter weather.\n\n\"The holidays in the mountains are more of an escape than any other holidays, even escapes to their own remote private islands and things,\" Chesterfield said.\n\nIn Europe, that means the Alps. Gstaad, St. Moritz, Courchevel — which used to be a favorite of Russian oligarchs — and Val-d'Isère are classic choices for the ultrahigh-net-worth set, Chesterfield and Brown said.\n\nReal-estate prices continue to rise in these locations, with homes in Gstaad, the most expensive locale, costing as much as 47,300 euros, or about $55,600, per square meter, according to the property consultancy Knight Frank's 2025 Alpine Index.\n\nStateside, Aspen, Vail, and Carbondale in Colorado are among the most popular ski resorts for the ultrawealthy, Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider.\n\nAspen has the highest density of homeowners worth more than $30 million in the US and the second-highest in the world, behind Monaco, according to a 2025 report by the wealth-tracking firm Altrata.\n\nHedge fund titan Ken Griffin, Walmart heir Rob Walton, and businessman Charles Koch are among the richest of those with second (or third or fourth) homes near the ski resort. Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos are regular visitors.\n\n\"It is the closest you'll get to a European après situation,\" Brown said. \"Great mountains, great skiing, the hotels are top-notch, the restaurants are awesome.\"\n\nThere's a restaurant by the chef Nobu Matsuhisa, designer shops like Gucci and Prada, and private clubs like Casa Tua and the Caribou Club to make the überrich feel at home.\n\nBut skiing is the real draw. The No. 1 interest of Aspen's ultra-high-net-worth homeowners is sports, according to Altrata.\n\nThose with more spiritual interests may prefer a different type of trip — quite literally.\n\n\"They're doing these inward journeys with psychedelics,\" Garcia said of several R360 members doing retreats in places like Peru or Costa Rica.\n\nMaybe a little plant medicine is the secret to families getting along over the holiday.\n\nThis story was initially published in December 2024 and has been updated with new information.",

The release of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the updated rerelease of Super Mario Party Jamboree along with it. This new title in the beloved digital board game series is packed with over 110 minigames and a roster of 22 characters, so there are more options for people to settle for after the no.1 character, Yoshi, is picked.\n\nRead our review of Super Mario Party Jamboree here\n\nWhen work is slowing down for the holidays, friends are home from school, and it's time to relax and let off some steam, Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is here for you. Whether you want to squad up with that same group you've been playing with since the old days or mowing down some zombies with your cousins or siblings, few games can offer quite the same cathartic gunplay as a new CoD game. And if you instead want to just check out a wild story, then hop into campaign mode, where you can play as Milo Ventimiglia, the actor behind Peter Petrelli from the mid-2000s superhero drama on NBC, Heroes.\n\nRead our review of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 here\n\nWith the cold weather settling in and snow coming down, sometimes it can be nice to settle in for a nice, long comfort RPG, and the new Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D Remake is perfect for those cold nights indoors. Following up on last year's Dragon Quest III Remake, DQ I&II are impressive and expansive retellings of the original games that came out nearly 40 years ago. With classic turn-based combat and a run time that can easily last 70+ hours, Dragon Quest I&II HD-2D pairs perfectly with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate.\n\nRead our review of DQ I&II HD-2D Remake here\n\nFew games this year have garnered quite as much discussion and fervor as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. If, for some reason, you haven't had a chance yet to play it, this holiday if you have some time off work or school, do yourself a favor and play this game. From its complex world, captivating characters, and an enthralling soundtrack, if you have friends or family who also play games, play this game; it will give you all plenty of things to talk about.\n\nRead our review of Expedition 33 here.\n\nI've never quite understood the idea of Sonic the Hedgehog driving a car when he could run faster than one, but when a game is as fun as Sonic Racing: Crossworld is, those thoughts flow out of my head. Crossworlds is the best classic cart racer this year with exciting tracks, neat vehicle transformations, and a ton of characters -now from worlds and properties outside of Sonic! Gather around your screen for some local split-screen shananigans or play online with 12 players at once for a truly chaotix time.\n\nRead our review of Sonic Racing: Crossworlds here\n\nIf you are looking for more of a cooperative jaunt, one of the best this year is Split Fiction, from Hazelight Studios, the same team behind the also fantastic It Takes Two. Split Fiction is a split-screen adventure where you and another person will work together through a variety of tricky challenges covering all sorts of game genres all under the umbrella of a wonderful tale of friendship. As an added bonus, only one person needs to own a copy of the game as you can invite another player to play with you online using the free Friend's Pass.\n\nRead our review of Split Fiction here.\n\nThere is something to be said about a game where you can play on the couch, losing hours to it, and Ball X Pit is a game that fits that bill. This clever twist on the classic brick-breaking formula is a rougelike indie game where you unlock new adventurers and descend into a pit to defeat menacing monsters by bouncing a wide variety of special spherical projectiles at them. In addition to being able to upgrade and fuse these powerful weapons, you will also unlock new characters to pick from, a small village-building system, and more as you break the walls of the encroaching enemies. Ball X Pit is a master at giving you that \"one more run\" itch.\n\nRead our review of Ball X Pit here\n\nIf you are \n\nRead our review of Blue Prince here\n\nWould you trust your best friends to help you climb a mountain? What about your family? Well, wonder no longer, as, thanks to indie developer Team Peak, you will now be able to do just that (in a safe, non-real-world scenario) with Peak. This cooperative climbing adventure puts you and your friends in a predicament that requires you to scale a tall mountain in order to survive. With cute visuals, proximity chat, climbing items to help you, and more, all helped push Peak to the top of Steam charts this year, and it is a great time to check out while on break this holiday.\n\nCheck out a bit of the history behind Peak here\n\nWhether it's Ultimate, Brawl, Melee, or any of the other variations, I have never attended a gathering that Super Smash Bros. hasn't improved. The chaos of 8-man multiplayer, the tense edge-of-your-seat sudden death matches, and the exultation of come-from-behind wins help keep Smash Brothers from ever getting old. While the world anxiously waits for the word of a Switch 2 Smash, the old versions are just as fun to revisit, so grab some controllers and prepare to fight!\n\nRead our review of Super Smash Bros.

    "description": "After spending more than 80 days on different cruise lines this year, I rounded up the travel mistakes I'll avoid making when I set sail in 2026.",
    "fullText": "In 2025, I spent about 85 days at sea across several cruise lines, sailing on some of the world's largest mega-ships and smaller vessels with fewer than 200 guests.\n\nI explored the Mediterranean, rode the Rhine River from Amsterdam to Basel, made several runs through the Caribbean, coasted the Mexican Riviera, and visited many places off my bucket list.\n\nAll of the globe-trotting sounds pretty glamorous (and parts of it absolutely were), but now that I'm reflecting on my year, I realize I made several mistakes that left me more exhausted than energized.\n\nHere are mistakes I don't want to repeat in 2026 — and a few smart travel strategies that I plan to continue.\n\nI love going on cruises and am fortunate to do so often for work.\n\nHowever, boarding more than 10 ships in 12 months — including doing a stint of several back-to-back sailings around Europe — was simply too much, even for me.\n\nAll the itineraries started to blend together. Throughout the year, I would scroll through my camera roll and struggle to remember which ship I was on or which port I'd seen three weeks earlier.\n\nI never had enough time to decompress, reflect, or even appreciate where I'd just been before boarding the next vessel.\n\nTravel is supposed to create memories, not erase them through sheer volume. In 2026, I plan to slow down (a bit), so I can really savor my trips.\n\nThe Mediterranean is beautiful, but I wish I hadn't spent several weeks there in July and August — some of the area's hottest, busiest months.\n\nWhile docked in places like Turkey and Greece, temperatures climbed over 80 or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat and humidity put a damper on my trip, sometimes making sightseeing feel like a survival training exercise.\n\nAdditionally, I was one of many tourists visiting these countries during their busiest travel season.\n\nI reached my breaking point in Santorini, which had been on my bucket list for years. Instead of the magical experience I imagined, I spent my time wading through crowds in near-suffocating heat.\n\nAfter standing for over two hours in the direct sun, waiting in a mile-long line just to take the gondola back down to where my ship was docked, I had mentally checked out.\n\nThough these places are incredible, I couldn't fully appreciate them. In the future, I'd like to prioritize traveling during the shoulder seasons for milder weather and fewer crowds.\n\nI made a major tactical error this year: I booked too many port-intensive itineraries that had zero sea days.\n\nThat meant I was \"on\" every single day — exploring, touring, photographing content, and rushing back on board just in time to shower and run to dinner.\n\nThat pace isn't sustainable for anyone, let alone someone who's stacking cruises without a break.\n\nThe real loss is that I barely enjoyed the ships themselves and rarely took advantage of the amenities, such as swim-up bars, spas, and waterslides, that make certain vessels special.\n\nNot having sea days already made it tough to take a break, but constantly giving in to my fear of missing out didn't help.\n\nWhenever I had the chance to explore a city, try a new activity, or join another excursion, I said yes. Repeatedly.\n\nI never carved out time for rest, which is ironic given that cruising is designed to be one of the most relaxing ways to travel. I didn't nap, linger over breakfast, lounge by the pool, or even sit on my balcony with a book.\n\nInstead, I packed my schedule with excursions because I didn't want to miss a thing at each stop. By the time I returned to the ship most evenings, I was just exhausted and desperate for a shower.\n\nHeading into the new year, I'm reminding myself that rest isn't optional; it's a strategy. Being well-rested makes any cruise far more enjoyable.\n\nI consider myself a good packer, but even I struggled this year when my itineraries shifted climates faster than I could keep up.\n\nFor example, while in Europe, I went straight from blistering heat in Greece, Croatia, Montenegro, and Turkey to the cool, rainy Rhine Valley.\n\nI ended up having to stop in Amsterdam to buy a sweater and a rain jacket — which I wore on repeat — just to comfortably get through the river cruise.\n\nNext year, I'll check the weather forecasts for every stop on an itinerary before leaving for a cruise (or any multi-stop trip).\n\nThis experience also served as another reminder to slow down and not overbook myself with back-to-back itineraries.\n\nI didn't get everything wrong this year. In fact, a few strategies paid off that I plan to continue:\n\nStill, heading into 2026, I hope to make a few intentional shifts, from scaling back on excursions to cruising during shoulder seasons whenever possible.\n\nThis time, I'll let myself enjoy the ships as much as the ports — even if that means ordering room service in my robe and doing absolutely nothing for a whole afternoon.\n\nIf 2025 was about seeing everything, 2026 will be about savoring it.",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is gathering with top national security officials on Monday, a meeting that comes as the U.S. Coast Guard steps up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Republican administration's escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan are scheduled to join Trump, who is vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort, for what the White House called a \"major announcement.\" Trump plans to discuss a shipbuilding initiative at the event, according to a White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Trump's gathering of key members of his national security team also comes at yet another inflection point in Trump's four-month pressure campaign on the Maduro government, which began with the stated purpose of stemming the flow of illegal drugs from the South American nation but has developed into something more amorphous.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has started evacuating the families of diplomats from Venezuela, according to a European intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\n\nThe official told The Associated Press the evacuations include women and children and began on Friday. The official said Russian Foreign Ministry officials are assessing the situation in Venezuela in “very grim tones.” The White House and Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday continued for the second day to chase a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration describes as part of a “dark fleet” Venezuela is using to evade U.S. sanctions. The tanker, the official added, is flying under a false flag and is under a U.S. judicial seizure order.\n\nIt is the third ship pursued by the Coast Guard, which on Saturday seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries that U.S. officials said was part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet.\n\nThe Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, seized a sanctioned tanker called Skipper on Dec. 10, also part of the shadow fleet of tankers that the U.S. says operates on the fringes of the law to move sanctioned cargo. That ship was registered in Panama.\n\nTrump, after that first seizure, said the U.S. would carry out a “blockade” of Venezuela. Trump has repeatedly said that Maduro's days in power are numbered.\n\nLast week, Trump demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against sanctioned oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said in a Monday appearance on “Fox & Friends” that the targeting of tankers is intended to send “a message around the world that the illegal activity that Maduro is participating in cannot stand, he needs to be gone, and that we will stand up for our people.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department, under Trump's orders, continues its campaign of attacks on smaller vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that it alleges are carrying drugs to the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.",

    "fullText": "The world's largest technology companies are scrambling to manage a growing crisis affecting thousands of their employees on work visas, as new social media screening requirements trigger delays at US embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and ServiceNow have all sent advisories to visa-holding employees in recent days, warning them against international travel and describing appointment delays stretching up to a year.\n\nThe memos, sent by immigration law firms representing these companies or by their internal legal teams, paint a picture of mounting uncertainty for foreign workers who form a critical part of the tech industry's workforce.\n\nThe warnings come as American embassies have postponed routine visa stamping appointments, leaving some employees already abroad unable to return to work in the US for extended periods.\n\nFor H-1B holders, the primary work visa used by tech companies, the situation creates a particularly difficult bind. If their visa stamp expires and they travel abroad, they must obtain a new stamp at a consulate before re-entering the US. With appointments now being rescheduled months into the future, what would typically be a routine trip home has become a potential career disruption lasting up to a year.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was now conducting \"online presence reviews for applicants.\" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,\" the State Department spokesperson said. Appointments in Ireland and Vietnam have also been postponed, according to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC.\n\nBelow are the full texts of the internal memos sent to employees at these companies, obtained by Business Insider, which reveal how corporate America is responding to the visa processing slowdown.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple and ServiceNow did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBelow is the text of a memo sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (BAL), the immigration firm that represents Google.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Apple's immigration team.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by ServiceNow's Global Mobility Team.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Doug Beachy, 61, upsized to a larger vacation home so his entire family could gather in one place, visit more frequently, and have more fun together.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 61-year-old Doug Beachy, a Cincinnati-based business owner who bought a vacation home with Pacaso in 2022. Pacaso is a platform for fractional ownership of luxury vacation homes. The company allows multiple individuals to co-own a second home and share ownership of the property. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been married to my wife, Jamie, for 37 years. We have four married children and 16 grandchildren. Our oldest grandchild is 12, and our youngest isn't quite one yet.\n\nOnce our kids started having children, they all moved back closer to home in Cincinnati, where we live. We own a five-bedroom home that's about 4,000 square feet. We're empty nesters, so there's plenty of space for us, but when the whole family is over, everyone is on top of each other.\n\nWe've converted one room into a kids' playroom and another into a nursery, and we have a finished basement where the kids can play, but family gatherings are still a bit hectic.\n\nIn the past, to bring everyone together, we would either rent a large beach house or book a cabin-style retreat in the woods here in Ohio.\n\nWe did that about every other year because it's hard to coordinate everyone's schedules — especially with grandkids in school — and seasonal rates for a large home are expensive. It was a big chunk of money for just a week's experience.\n\nHilton Head Island has always been a fun family destination for us. It's an island in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, just outside Savannah, Georgia, with about 12 miles of pristine beaches.\n\nThere's so much to do here from a family activity standpoint, in addition to simply soaking up the sun and going to the beach — it's just a great place to relax and unwind.\n\nHomes here can be expensive, though. The average home is priced in the upper $700,000s, and properties can sell for as much as $10 million. For a while, I thought about buying a second, larger home here, but I'm not retired yet, and I realized that putting that much money into a house where I don't live full time just didn't make sense.\n\nIn early 2022, I started exploring different homeownership options, including shared or fractional ownership. That's when I found Pacaso online and saw they had some homes available in Hilton Head.\n\nWe ultimately settled on an about 5,000-square-foot home with six spacious suite-like bedrooms — five with king-sized beds, large walk-in closets, and private bathrooms, and one with several bunk beds for the children — and seven and a half bathrooms.\n\nAs you can imagine, taking 20 people out to eat all the time is not exactly fun, so we wanted a house with a large, well-stocked kitchen. Our kitchen almost occupies the entire second floor and, by my last count, it can seat 19 or 20 people. It also has a beautiful ocean view.\n\nWhen we bought the home, it was valued at over $5 million. We own a 1/8 share — we made a 50% down payment on our portion of the home — and there are seven other owners, whom we don't know.\n\nOur friends will say, \"It sounds like a timeshare.\" But I think it's much more transparent than a traditional timeshare. There are no extra markups or mystery fees added on top.\n\nI also feel that, unlike a timeshare, which can leave you feeling stuck and lose value over time, this is a long-term investment. Of course, everything depends on the real-estate market, but I feel fairly confident this is an appreciating asset.\n\nI think going this route, instead of buying another second or vacation home, has eliminated all the concerns I had about upsizing — like having to maintain the home ourselves or deal with high HOA fees. We wanted a place we could share with family, and this setup works well for us at this stage of our lives.\n\nPacaso provides a house manager who handles everything. It's essentially a concierge service — the home is clean when we arrive and fully stocked with towels, linens, soaps, and disposable items, such as paper towels and paper plates.\n\nWhen we go, the only thing we really need to think about is what food we want to buy, depending on what we plan to cook — and we have a lot of good cooks in the family.\n\nWe have the home reserved for 44 nights a year, and we use nearly all of that time. Not everyone in the family is there for every stay, but they come as they please.\n\nOur family gets together more often now, about twice a year. In the summer, during the high season when the kids are out of school, we typically reserve the house for a couple of weeks at a time.\n\nThe grandkids look forward to each trip and talk about it all the time. Many of them are around the same age, and they love the opportunity to spend time with their cousins.\n\nThe house came with six beach cruiser bikes, which is perfect because there are plenty of biking trails on the island. It also has a private pool and hot tub, and the grandkids love that it's fully stocked with games and puzzles.\n\nOur favorite things to do with them are spending time in the pool, watching the sunrise, and hanging out on the beach. We also take a lot of bike rides and play pickleball. We just love how much more quality time we're spending together as a family.",

    "description": "I flew Breeze Airways with my family of five over the holidays. I was surprised by the lower fares and easy travel experience with the budget airline.",
    "fullText": "As a family of five who travels a lot, I'm always looking for the best deal because air travel can get expensive very quickly.\n\nWhen we planned a recent trip from Portland, Maine, to Pittsburgh over the holiday break, low-cost flights from Breeze Airways caught my eye.\n\nThey were also the only direct routes available, yet I was hesitant to book with the low-budget airline after reading negative online reviews that mentioned frustrations about delayed flights and hidden fees.\n\nI was already skeptical about traveling with my kids during peak travel season, but, left with no other option that fit our budget, I decided to give Breeze Airways a try. I'm glad I did.\n\nThough our tickets with Breeze Airways weren't cheap — we paid $1,790 for the five tickets plus two carry-ons — they were significantly cheaper than those of other airlines.\n\nOur options with other airlines had at least one stop (which I try to avoid when traveling with kids), and five tickets started at over $2,000.\n\nI purchased our tickets in July and chose the cheapest seats, which also had the most restrictions — no checked luggage, no carry-ons, a fee to select certain seats, and only one personal item allowed per person.\n\nEach carry-on costs us an extra $70 to fly with, so we only brought two — one for each adult.\n\nAll of us were allowed to bring a personal item for free, and for the kids, it was a small backpack filled with entertainment, such as stuffed animals and coloring books.\n\nBecause we were staying with family, I knew I could do laundry during our trip, which allowed us to travel with minimal luggage.\n\nI chose seats in row 24, the first row where you didn't have to pay to choose your seat, and within the \"family seating\" section to ensure that we could sit together at no additional cost.\n\nI was able to grab an entire row — two window seats, two aisles, and one middle. If I had wanted anything closer to the front, seats would've cost an extra $25 (or more) each.\n\nWhen we arrived at the airport for our outbound flight, I panicked because Breeze Airways was not showing on any of the departure screens, and my app said our gate was \"TBD.\"\n\nLuckily, an airport employee helped guide us to a specific gate, where Breeze usually operates. There we found our flight, which was listed as being on time.\n\nBoarding started soon after, and it was far more organized than other airlines I've flown with.\n\nThough families with kids were welcomed to board first, we stuck with our group so the kids could get as many wiggles out as possible before having to be seated for the flight.\n\nLuckily, we had no issues finding overhead space for our bags when boarding in group three.\n\nOnce on board, I was surprised at how new the plane felt. It had smooth leather seats, and the entire cabin appeared to be free from dings and dents.\n\nOur seats were comfortable for a short flight, though they barely reclined at all. We still had small tray tables that came in handy for my kids to color and play on.\n\nThe legroom was fine for me as a 5-foot-6-inch adult, and I was able to fit everyone's backpacks comfortably on the floor by our feet.\n\nThough there were no seatback screens for entertainment, I was prepared with sticker books and stuffed toys to keep our kids happy.\n\nDuring both flights, we were only served cups of water, and the snack cart didn't come out because there was significant turbulence.\n\nSince we were in the cheapest section, we would've had to purchase other drinks and any snacks. We weren't particularly bothered by this since our flights were only 1 hour and 20 minutes long.\n\nWe just packed snacks in the kids' backpacks and grabbed food at the airport before boarding, so everyone would be content.\n\nI've grown accustomed to flight delays in recent years, but both of our flights landed a little ahead of time, which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nMy family has flown with low-cost carriers before, trying both Frontier Airlines and Spirit.\n\nI've had good experiences with Frontier, though its flights often depart at odd hours from our closest airport. Looking back, taking a 5 a.m. flight to Miami with kids was not the best choice.\n\nOn one Spirit flight to Mexico, my husband and I experienced several delays and almost missed our connection, barely making it to the plane on time.\n\nThough I can't say with certainty that Breeze Airways is the best of the three, our one experience was significantly better than previous ones with budget airlines.\n\nThe company only flies from our local airport to about a dozen cities in the US, but I'm happy to consider Breeze Airways for future family travel.\n\nThe low-cost airline will be especially helpful during the holiday season, when we're bound to see our extended family in Pittsburgh.",

    "description": "As a Mexican travel journalist, I have seen tourists make many mistakes when visiting the country, like skipping museums and not trying local dishes.",
    "fullText": "I was born and raised in Mexico and have spent the last 15 years exploring the country as a travel journalist. So, I know it has lots to offer, from incredible biodiversity and beautiful resorts to world-class museums.\n\nHowever, I've seen tourists make plenty of mistakes when visiting my country, from failing to learn any Spanish to missing opportunities to explore.\n\nHere are five things tourists should avoid so that they can get the most out of their trip.\n\nMexico is a huge country. To put it into perspective, the largest state, Chihuahua, is slightly larger than the UK. So, to reduce Mexico to a single stereotype would be to erase its incredible diversity.\n\nIt has everything from tropical beaches and historical cities to snow-capped mountains and deserts.\n\nGetting from one city to another can require long bus rides or flights, so if you hope to travel throughout the country, I recommend trying not to plan too much for one trip.\n\nAlthough Mexico is home to incredible resorts in cities like Cancún and Cabo San Lucas, the country has so much more to offer.\n\nFor example, about two and a half hours outside downtown Cancún lies Chichén Itzá, an archeological site of Mayan ruins and one of the \"New 7 Wonders of the World.\"\n\nOne of the main attractions is El Castillo, also known as the Pyramid of Kukulkán, which stands nearly 100 feet tall and has impressive features. For example, if visitors clap at the base of the pyramid, they'll hear the sound of a quetzal, a sacred bird associated with the god Kukulkán.\n\nMeanwhile, about 30 minutes outside Cabo San Lucas lies San José del Cabo, a charming town with a laid-back vibe full of art galleries and colonial architecture.\n\nIf you're willing to venture a bit further from Cabo San Lucas, I also recommend visiting Todos Santos, home of Hotel California, or Cabo Pulmo, a national marine park perfect for snorkeling and diving among coral reefs.\n\nDuring your visit, I highly recommend trying one of the more than 50 types of mole, a traditional Mexican sauce that's very different from the spicy salsa you might be used to.\n\nIt's made with a wide range of ingredients, such as chiles, chocolate, nuts, seeds, spices, vegetables, and sometimes fruits like raisins or apples. It's usually served with meat or as the base for popular dishes, such as enchiladas de mole.\n\nAnother must-try dish is pozole. Almost every state has its own version of this comforting, flavorful soup.\n\nIt's made with cacahuazintle (a special type of corn), broth, and meat, and comes in various styles, including white pozole (without chile), red pozole (with red chile), and green pozole (with ground pumpkin seeds).\n\nThe spiciness is real, so I recommend starting slow and only trying what locals say is just a little spicy.\n\nMexico City is home to the greatest concentration of museums in the country.\n\nOne unmissable stop is the spectacular National Museum of Anthropology in Chapultepec Park. With more than 20 galleries showcasing pre-Hispanic artifacts and ethnographic treasures, it's worth setting aside several hours — or even an entire day — to truly take it all in.\n\nA short walk away, Chapultepec Castle houses the National History Museum, which showcases Mexico's story from pre-Columbian times to the modern era. As a bonus, you'll also find epic murals by David Alfaro Siqueiros and Juan O'Gorman, two of the most acclaimed Mexican visual artists of the 20th century — plus stunning views of the city.\n\nAnd for fine art lovers, head downtown to MUNAL (the National Museum of Art), located in Plaza Manuel Tolsá. Its collection spans from the colonial period to the mid-20th century and includes works by Diego Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, and María Izquierdo.\n\nAt upscale hotels and restaurants, you'll probably get by just fine in English, but you shouldn't expect to do the same when wandering local streets, exploring markets, or trying street food.\n\nI encourage learning a few Spanish phrases, such as thank you (gracias), good morning (buenos días), and please (por favor). It'll open doors and hearts.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was expanding travel restrictions to an additional 20 countries and the Palestinian Authority, doubling the number of nations affected by sweeping limits announced earlier this year on who can travel and emigrate to the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration included five more countries as well as people traveling on documents issued by the Palestinian Authority to the list of countries facing a full ban on travel to the U.S. and imposed new limits on 15 other countries.\n\nThe move is part of ongoing efforts by the administration to tighten U.S. entry standards for travel and immigration, in what critics say unfairly prevents travel for people from a broad range of countries. The administration suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nPeople who already have visas, are lawful permanent residents of the U.S. or have certain visa categories such as diplomats or athletes, or whose entry into the country is believed to serve the U.S. interest, are all exempt from the restrictions. The proclamation said the changes go into effect on Jan. 1.\n\nIn June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from coming to the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.\n\nAt the time the ban included Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Republican administration announced it was expanding the list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the U.S. to Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria. The administration also fully restricted travel on people with Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents, the latest U.S. travel restriction against Palestinians. South Sudan was also facing significant travel restrictions already.\n\nAn additional 15 countries are also being added to the list of countries facing partial restrictions: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Ivory Coast, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe restrictions apply to both people seeking to travel to the U.S. as visitors or to emigrate there.\n\nThe Trump administration said in its announcement that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had “widespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records” that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the U.S.\n\nIt also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens whom the U.S. wished to deport or had a “general lack of stability and government control,” which made vetting difficult. It also cited immigration enforcement, foreign policy and national security concerns for the move.\n\nThe Afghan man accused of shooting the two National Guard troops near the White House has pleaded not guilty to murder and assault charges. In the aftermath of that incident, the administration announced a flurry of immigration restrictions, including further restrictions on people from those initial 19 countries who were already in the U.S.\n\nThe news of the expanding travel ban is likely to face fierce opposition from critics who have argued that the administration is using national security concerns to collectively keep out people from a wide range of countries.\n\n“This expanded ban is not about national security but instead is another shameful attempt to demonize people simply for where they are from,\" said Laurie Ball Cooper, vice president of U.S. Legal Programs at the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nAdvocates for Afghans who supported the United States' two-decade long war in Afghanistan also raised alarms Tuesday, saying the updated travel ban no longer contains an exception for Afghans who qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa. That’s a visa category specifically for Afghans who closely assisted the U.S. war effort at great risk to themselves.\n\nNo One Left Behind, a longtime agency advocating for the Special Immigrant Visa program, said it was “deeply concerned” about the change. The organization said it appreciated the president's commitment to national security but allowing Afghans who'd served the U.S. to enter the U.S. — after extensive vetting — also contributes to the country's security.\n\n“Though intended to allow for review of inconsistent vetting processes, this policy change inadvertently restricts those who are among the most rigorously vetted in our history: the wartime allies targeted by the terrorists this proclamation seeks to address,” the organization said in a statement.\n\nCountries that were newly placed on the list of banned or restricted countries said late Tuesday that they were evaluating the news. The government of the island nation of Dominica in the Caribbean Sea said it was treating the issue with the “utmost seriousness and urgency” and was reaching out to U.S. officials to clarify what the restrictions mean and address any problems.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to the United States, Ronald Saunders, said the “matter is quite serious\" and he'll be seeking more information from U.S. officials regarding the new restrictions.\n\nThe Trump administration also upgraded restrictions on some countries — Laos and Sierra Leone — that previously were on the partially restricted list and in one case — Turkmenistan — said the country had improved enough to warrant easing some restrictions on travelers from that country. Everything else from the previous travel restrictions announced in June remains in place, the administration said.\n\nThe new restrictions on Palestinians come months after the administration imposed limits that make it nearly impossible for anyone holding a Palestinian Authority passport from receiving travel documents to visit the U.S. for business, work, pleasure or educational purposes. The announcement Tuesday goes further, banning people with Palestinian Authority passports from emigrating to the U.S.\n\nIn justifying its decision Tuesday, the administration said several “U.S.-designated terrorist groups operate actively in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and have murdered American citizens.” The administration also said the recent war in those areas had “likely resulted in compromised vetting and screening abilities.\"\n\nAnika Kentish in Saint John’s, Antigua, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Billions of dollars are about to be spent on upgrading the country's air traffic control system, according to the boss of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe FAA is committing $6 billion on ATC telecom and radar infrastructure, Administrator Bryan Bedford told a House subcommittee on Tuesday.\n\nThe new infrastructure is set to be deployed by the end of 2028, down from a previously planned timescale of 15 years, Bedford said.\n\nIt comes after incidents this year have highlighted the fragility and age of the current system.\n\nHowever, while Congress has so far approved $12.5 billion to upgrade the air traffic control system, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said it will cost $31.5 billion overall.\n\nPassengers around the country have faced disruption this year due to the aging ATC system.\n\nIn April and May, several communications outages occurred at a control center that guides planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\nRadar displays briefly went offline, so the FAA had to slow arrival and departure rates. The airport has also been dealing with runway construction.\n\nAt one point, Newark was limited to an hourly rate of 34 departures and arrivals, less than half the number it typically handled.\n\nThe government shutdown in the fall further exposed the fragility of the ATC system.\n\nControllers were among the federal workers who were told they had to keep working without a paycheck. As the shutdown dragged on, fewer and fewer controllers turned up for work.\n\nIn California, Hollywood Burbank Airport's control tower was left unstaffed for about six hours one day.\n\nEventually, the FAA had to mandate flight cuts at 40 of the country's busiest airports due to staffing shortages.",

    "fullText": "Planning a Caribbean vacation? The US State Department wants you to know how safe your destination is before you board your flight.\n\nThe Caribbean has long been a popular vacation destination thanks to its beautiful natural sights, yearlong tropical weather, and calm turquoise beaches.\n\nWhile traveling to one of the Caribbean's islands and its coasts in South, Central, and North America, tourists can explore historic sites that document the region's colonial and pre-colonial days, enjoy cultural enrichment during carnivals or local holidays, and indulge in an array of cuisines that combine indigenous, African, and European influences.\n\nThe US State Department has issued travel advisories for some countries in the region, advising Americans to exercise caution when visiting. Amid an increased US military presence in the region, travelers may also be wondering if it's wise to travel there.\n\nThe agency uses four levels of travel guidance to know what to expect in each country:\n\nAs of December 12, 21 countries around the world are designated \"do not travel,\" mostly because of ongoing armed conflicts.\n\nIn the Caribbean, only Haiti and Venezuela have an advisory Level 4, along with some parts of Mexico, Jamaica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Colombia.\n\nAcross the Caribbean — which we have defined widely, including every country with a Caribbean coast in South, Central, and North America — levels of safety and resources can vary, and travelers should be aware of the specific conditions of the country or territory they intend to visit.\n\nWe looked at the travel advisories and information for every country in the Caribbean. Here's everything you need to know about your tropical destination before planning your next getaway.\n\nRebecca Harrington and Michelle Mark contributed to an earlier version of this story.\n\nWhile the US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, it advises travelers to exercise caution when driving, as the roads can be in poor condition. Additionally, it notes that medical facilities on the island fall below US standards.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the popular cruise-ship destination, but it advises travelers on the country information page to be \"extremely careful when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads.\"\n\nIt also notes that medical facilities on the island don't meet US standards, and divers facing decompression illness need to be evacuated from the island as it does not have a hyperbaric chamber.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be warned that local \"indecency statutes\" criminalize \"consensual same-sex sexual activity between adult men\" with a maximum sentence of up to 15 years, according to the US State Department. LGBTQ+ couples married outside the island also do not enjoy spousal rights or privileges when visiting Antigua and Barbuda.\n\nThe agency also says that mosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are prevalent in the islands.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch island, but warns that \"access to quality medical care is limited,\" and in cases of decompression sickness, divers need medical evacuation from the island as it does not have a decompression chamber.\n\nMosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are also prevalent in the island, and the CDC recommends the use of \"mosquito repellents and insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\"\n\nWhile crime isn't a particular concern there, theft is the main offense committed against tourists. The department suggests securing personal property in public areas, hotel rooms, and cars.\n\nThe US State Department advises travelers to the island chain to remain cautious, as violent crimes — like armed robberies and sexual assaults — can \"occur anywhere in the Bahamas.\"\n\nIt also notes that a majority of crime occurs in the islands of New Providence and Grand Bahama, and warns to stay alert in the \"Over the Hill\" area in Nassau, south of Shirley Street, where gangs have been reported to have murdered residents.\n\nThe department also warns about unsafe, unregulated tourist watercraft, such as boat tours, and the potential of sexual assault by Jet Ski operators.

The area, defined as Haulover Creek Canal and extending south to Fabers Road, \"does not overlap with the typical tourism areas,\" the agency said.\n\nMuch of the crime in the city, and in the country, is gang-related, and local police don't have resources to look into serious crimes, so most go \"unresolved and unprosecuted,\" the US State Department wrote.\n\nThe department said it also discourages driving at night due to poor road conditions, frequently unavailable road assistance, and unreliable phone reception in remote areas.\n\nDiseases like malaria, dengue, Zika, leishmaniasis, and NWS (New World Screwworm) are also prevalent in the country, and medical care, while generally available in urban areas, can be hard to access in rural and remote areas.\n\nThe agency also warns that many hotels aren't equipped with carbon monoxide detectors, and that US citizens have died from poisoning from the gas.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch islands, which it assesses as low-crime areas with responsible police sources and a high level of social control in its small population. The most common crimes are usually \"non-violent, financially-motivated, and opportunistic in nature,\" like pickpocketing and theft of unattended belongings.\n\nUS travelers are advised to use caution when driving in the islands, as roads can be \"slippery during rainfall,\" wild animals often cross roads, and in Saba, roads can be steep and have sharp turns.\n\nThere is limited access to quality medical care in the islands, and facilities do not always meet US health and service standards.\n\nThe CDC also recommends using mosquito repellents and sleeping under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, but notes that drivers should be attentive on the road as \"speeding and reckless driving are fairly common.\" Nighttime drag racing and livestock crossing are also common.\n\nWhile the British Virgin Islands don't have particularly high crime, crimes of opportunity and violent crimes occur occasionally, and travelers are advised to use the same personal security measures they would in any major US city.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have also been reported.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island chain, which is a British territory, and says the islands have \"low rates of criminal activity affecting tourists,\" although crimes like pickpocketing and purse snatchings still happen occasionally.\n\nZika, chikungunya, and dengue fever are also prevalent, and the CDC recommends the use of insect repellents.\n\nThe US State Department warns of crime, terrorism, unrest, and kidnapping throughout Colombia and asks visitors to reconsider travel to the country. Terrorists operate in some areas, and violent crime is possible, the agency says.\n\nParts of the country are a Level 4 advisory, with the agency recommending Americans don't travel to Arauca, Cauca (except Popayan); Chocó (except Nuquí); Nariño; and Norte de Santander (except Cucuta) because of crime and terrorism.\n\nThe country's border with Venezuela is also at a Level 4 advisory, and the agency advises avoiding the area altogether to prevent accidental crossings into Venezuela, as the border isn't clearly marked. The department says that Americans should not travel to this region \"for any reason,\" since crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict are common in the area.\n\nEven in public and in affluent neighborhoods, well-organized crime can occur, the agency says. Americans are also targeted by terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them, per the State Department.\n\nDating apps and internet romance scams are also common, and the department advises being cautious when meeting with strangers.\n\nTravelers are advised against hailing taxis on the street, and US government employees are prohibited from doing so, as US citizens have been killed during robberies on hailed street taxis.\n\nThe agency also advises against participating in ayahuasca \"spiritual cleansing\" practices using psychedelic drugs illegal in the US, because \"people claiming to be shamans or spiritual practitioners are neither licensed nor regulated,\" and there are risks of robbery, assault, illness, or death while intoxicated.\n\nAdequate healthcare facilities are available throughout the country; the agency warns that healthcare in rural areas may be below US standards, and tap water is not safe to drink in these areas.\n\nCommon diseases include COVID-19, dengue, chikungunya, malaria, Yellow Fever, and Zika. Using mosquito repellents and sleeping under nets is suggested.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread petty and violent crime, like armed robbery, homicide, and sexual assault, affecting tourists, and recommends increased caution when traveling to the country. The agency strongly advises against taking public buses due to the threat of pickpocketing.\n\nIt also warns of dangerous rip currents in Costa Rica and notes that most beaches lack lifeguards or \"warnings about unsafe conditions.\" In July, \"The Cosby Show\" star Malcolm-Jamal Warner drowned while visiting the country.\n\nThe agency also advises against participation in spiritual ceremonies or rituals involving hallucinogens like ayahuasca or kambo, which are \"not regulated by the Costa Rican Ministry of Health and are illegal in the US.\"  The agency says Americans have been victims of \"sexual assault, serious injury, and theft\" while intoxicated with the substances, and recommends using \"extreme caution\" if they choose to participate in such ceremonies.\n\nSome travelers have reported tainted alcohol causing serious health issues, the agency added.\n\nMedical care in San José is \"usually good;\" the department warns that quality services outside the city may be limited. Tap water is often unsafe to drink in the country.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and malaria are prevalent.\n\nCosta Rica is also prone to a variety of natural disasters as an active earthquake and volcanic zone, with three volcanoes that have become more active in recent years. Tsunamis can also occur after significant earthquakes.\n\nFlash floods and severe landslides are common during the rainy season, from April to October, in the Limon, Puntarenas, and Guanacaste provinces.\n\nBetween January and the end of May, wildfires are also common throughout Costa Rica, particularly in Guanacaste and the northern region of the country.\n\nThe US State Department advises that travelers maintain an increased level of caution due to crime and an unreliable power grid. Petty crime, including pickpocketing, purse snatching, and car break-ins, is common, and violent crime like armed robbery, murder, and home invasions is also on the rise, the department said.\n\nUS law also prohibits tourist travel to Cuba, and travelers must comply with OFAC licensing requirements, which establish different categories for permitted travel, such as educational activities, humanitarian projects, or visiting family.\n\nTravelers should avoid demonstrations, as peaceful assembly and free speech are not protected, and protests can often trigger government responses. The agency also warns that the Cuban government has detained US citizens for activities that are not criminal in the US.\n\nScams on dating apps and internet romance schemes are common, it added. Internet and phone communication can also be compromised while visiting the island, as \"there is no expectation of privacy in Cuba,\" per the department, which advises the use of VPNs and avoiding connecting to public WiFi networks.\n\nRoads can be hazardous due to poor lighting, aging vehicles, and unpredictable nighttime conditions, and the department discourages using overcrowded public buses or unregulated taxis.\n\nThe agency warns that ambulances \"are not present throughout the country and can be unreliable where available,\" and they're not usually equipped with up-to-date medical equipment. The agency recommends travelers bring basic over-the-counter medication, as shortages are widespread throughout the island.\n\nAir quality can be poor on the island, and tap water is not safe to drink. The agency recommends opting for bottled water, asking for drinks without ice, washing hands often, and avoiding uncooked or undercooked food.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, COVID-19, Oropouche, hepatitis A, and traveler's diarrhea are prevalent.\n\nTravelers should also be aware that between May and November, the island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch territory, but notes that nonviolent crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, are common in areas like beaches, hotel lobbies, and cars.\n\nInstances of violent crime, although not common, often take place in more isolated areas of the island, like remote beaches or nature areas, where thefts and assaults have been reported.\n\nZika, dengue, and chikungunya are prevalent, and the CDC recommends the use of mosquito repellents and insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for Dominica, but notes that crimes of opportunity, violent, and drug-related crime occur occasionally.\n\nThe department also advises caution when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads, as roads in the country tend to be in \"average to poor condition.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that consensual same-sex conduct is illegal on the island, and local laws do not protect against sexual-orientation-based discrimination.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have been reported on the island.\n\nThe agency also warns that medical facilities on the island do not meet US standards, and there is \"limited ambulance service.\"\n\nThe US State Department warns of violent crime, including armed robbery, homicide, and sexual assault. The agency also says that while the country has its own tourist police force and that resort areas are generally safer, urban areas like Santo Domingo aren't very well-policed, and drugs, weapons, and criminal justice systems are a concern throughout the country.\n\nThe agency advises against wearing expensive jewelry and warns of dating app or internet romance scams.\n\nWhile prostitution under certain circumstances is legal in the country, the agency warns US citizens against hiring prostitutes or escort services, as \"disagreements over price and claims of mistreatment\" can result in police involvement.\n\nPrevalent diseases include dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis, and \"public clinics lack basic resources and supplies,\" the agency said. It also notes that \"many US citizens have suffered serious complications or died during cosmetic or other elective surgeries in the Dominican Republic.\"\n\nTap water in many areas is not safe to drink, and the agency suggests requesting bottled water and no ice in drinks.\n\nThe country has the highest road-crash-related mortality rate in the world, the agency says, and travelers should drive with extreme caution or consider hiring a professional driver. Shared buses are available, but they do not always meet US safety standards.\n\nDue to security concerns, the agency advises against using unregulated taxis and buses, as well as hailing taxis off the street.\n\nThe island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes between May and November, and flooding often occurs without warning during heavy rainfall. The country is also prone to earthquakes.\n\nThe agency also warns of life-threatening currents and advises against swimming alone.\n\nAfter years of higher-risk warnings, the US State Department now lists El Salvador at Level 1, citing a decrease in violent crime and gang activity over the past three years.\n\nThe US prohibits government employees from traveling between cities or departments at night and from using public buses due to concerns over infrastructure and criminal activity.\n\nSince 2022, El Salvador has been under a \"State of Exception\" in response to gang violence, allowing local authorities to arrest anyone suspected of being involved in gang activity — including several US and foreign citizens — and suspending \"several constitutional rights,\" like the right to a fair and speedy trial, the agency notes.\n\nWhile no alerts are active for the country, the agency suggests exercising caution and warns that the \"crime threat level in El Salvador is high,\" citing common crimes like robbery, car theft, and sexual assault. \"Most serious crimes in El Salvador are never solved,\" the department says.\n\nThe country has a police force dedicated to tourists in 19 popular destinations, but the agency advises against remote hikes or hiring guides.\n\nThe agency warns of the risks of surfing in the country's Pacific Coast, which has made El Salvador a popular surfing destination. The currents \"can be dangerous, even for skilled swimmers,\" the department said, and the country has limited search-and-rescue capabilities.\n\nEl Salvador also has severe penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs, which might include THC and CBD products legally sold in the US.\n\nNatural disasters also occur occasionally in the country, which has 21 active volcanoes and experiences frequent earthquakes. Flooding and mudslides are common during the rainy season.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that while same-sex sexual relations aren't restricted in the country, there is \"widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" the department said, including by public officials and police, who have been involved in violence against LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nQuality care is available in San Salvador, but medical care can be limited outside the city, per the agency.\n\nPrevalent diseases include dengue, diarrheal illness, chikungunya, and Zika\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the French West Indies, which include the islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy.

The agency advises travelers to exercise the level of caution that they would in any major US city.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law \"criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activities between men,\" with up to 10 years imprisonment, the agency says. Although prosecutions are rare, Grenadian society is considered to be \"generally intolerant of same-sex sexual conduct,\" it noted.\n\nDuring hurricane season, from June 1 to November 30, travelers are advised to monitor local weather and be prepared for potential threats, including earthquakes and tsunamis, since the island is located in a seismic zone.\n\nVisitors should drive slowly and with caution, as the roads are usually narrow and winding and often lack proper signage, according to the agency.\n\nThe department also notes that medical care in Grenada is \"below US standards\" and that dengue is prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread crime, including violent crime like armed robbery, murder, and gang activity, particularly in Guatemala City, Escuintla, Chiquimula, Izabal, and Petén.

    "fullText": "Manchester City travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace in what promises to be an entertaining Premier League affair later this afternoon.\n\nThe Cityzens will be out for vengeance after falling to the Eagles in the 2024/25 FA Cup final, but Palace have proven they’re no pushovers this season.\n\nNevertheless, City head into the game in remarkable form, having won four consecutive games in all competitions, most recently claiming a 2-1 Champions League win against familiar foes Real Madrid.\n\nLos Blancos got off to a fine start when Rodrygo broke the deadlock just before the half-hour mark, but goals from Nico O’Reilly and Erling Braut Haaland helped City turn the game on its head.\n\nBefore that fixture, City had seen off Leeds United, Fulham, and Sunderland to keep pace with Arsenal at the Premier League summit.\n\nThe Gunners extended their lead with a 2-1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, so it’s up to City to respond, but it may not be straightforward.\n\nCity have a dominant record against Palace. They’ve won four of their last seven league meetings with the Eagles (D3), but the FA Cup final is proof that Palace have what it takes to halt their momentum.\n\nThe last time Pep Guardiola made sweeping changes to his starting line-up, City paid the price with a 2-0 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nSince then, the Spaniard has made it a habit of keeping the core of the squad intact, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he makes just one change to his starting XI against Palace.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma is guaranteed to retain his place in goal ahead of out-of-favour James Trafford, while a back four of O’Reilly, Josko Gvardiol, Ruben Dias, and Mathues Nunes should also remain intact.\n\nThe minor tweak expected should come in midfield, although Nico Gonzalez is expected to keep his place while Rodri continues his recovery.\n\nTijjani Reijnders should come in for Bernardo Silva, who wasn’t at his best against Madrid.\n\nThe 31-year-old’s 6/10 performance might be a sign of fatigue, so Reijnders, who has notched seven goal contributions (two goals and five assists), could get a chance.\n\nThe Dutchman will likely be joined by Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki, and Phil Foden, while Haaland leads the line.",

    "description": "I wanted my family of five to travel more, so I created budgeting strategies to take more vacations. I know when to splurge and when to save.",
    "fullText": "I used to scroll through friends' glamorous-looking vacation photos and feel a familiar pang, knowing there was no way my family could afford trips like that. But I didn't want to stew in jealousy, so I decided to figure out how we could travel more on our budget.\n\nSince some of my favorite travel memories aren't from far-off places but from day adventures or quick weekend trips, I learned to prioritize them in our calendar. Mini vacations are cheaper — no flights, rental cars, time off work, or dog sitters needed, since we generally bring our dog on these trips or leave her with the neighbor.\n\nWe live in Arizona, so we schedule hiking excursions with friends to Sedona's Red Rocks or other scenic areas at least once every few months. We also visit my parents, who live an hour and a half north of us, enjoying their cooler weather and small-town charm.\n\nHowever, I don't want my family to miss out on exploring beyond our little bubble, so my next tactical move was to maximize credit card points.\n\nI'd earned free flights and hotels before, but my friend showed me I had more to learn.\n\nOver the past two years, I've signed up for credit cards when the point offers looked too good to pass up. I often book under my friend's referral link, so we both earn bonuses. My husband then signs up using mine, and we add each other as authorized users, often for extra points.\n\nI currently have nine credit cards. It sounds intimidating, but it's manageable as I never add more than one sign-up bonus at a time. Closing cards can ding your credit score, so I phase them out slowly.\n\nSome, though, I'll keep long-term, like my Sapphire card with its zero foreign transaction fees and great travel partners, and my Southwest card, which allows me to book flights with my Rapid Rewards points and offers one free checked bag for myself and up to eight guests.\n\nBecause the Sapphire card's points can be transferred to Southwest, I was able to combine them and book a flight for my family of five to Washington, D.C., this summer. The flight cost me 130,000 Rapid Rewards points, which is about $1,300. The only thing I paid out of pocket was the $56 in security fees. Then I used 78,914 introductory points from my husband's new Sapphire Chase card, valued at $788, to pay for half of our five-night hotel stay in Georgetown. In total, I saved around $2000.\n\nOne caveat: I always pay my credit cards off monthly. I want to be the one benefiting — not the credit card company.\n\nWe often split hotels or Airbnbs with family or friends. Sharing costs makes trips more economical and usually more fun. We plan meals together, too, when the place we're staying has a kitchen, which further cuts costs.\n\nI discovered that when new properties are listed on Airbnb, the first few stays are often discounted to drive more bookings and garner reviews. We've stayed in some upgraded places using this tactic. On an upcoming trip to Europe, I found a two-bedroom flat in London's city center with only a few reviews, offering a better deal at $970 for four nights, while many nearby properties were $1,300 or more.\n\nWhile in Europe, we plan to take trains to and from a few cities. I was shocked by train costs. That's how I found Omio, which helped me compare, purchase, and store tickets for train, bus, and ferry trips in one place, saving me time and money.\n\nWhen traveling, we rely on public transportation if the city is well-connected, only hopping in a rideshare or taxi if we are worn out. If we do need a rental car, I usually check a few companies to find the best deal, as rates can vary significantly.\n\nOn a seven-day trip to Maui in 2024, I found the best deal by booking directly with Alamo through my Sapphire rewards program. I secured a Chrysler Pacifica for 48,989 points, which equates to around $490.\n\nMy dad's vacation rule: splurge on a nice hotel for a few nights, then switch to budget options. Admittedly, I am scarred by that one cockroach-infested motel he booked when I was 11, so I never go too budget. Still, I like his thinking. If we're traveling to multiple cities, we often take this approach, staying in one nicer place and then offsetting it with something more budget-friendly in the next.\n\nEven with hacks, traveling is an expensive undertaking. Tucking money into a vacation fund every month helps, and staying strategic is key. For me, experiencing new places as a family is worth prioritizing.",

    "fullText": "NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip (AP) — Haneen al-Mabhouh, 34, sits in a wheelchair in her family home in Nuseirat, central Gaza, mourning the loss of her four daughters, including her 5-month-old baby, who were killed in an Israeli strike on her home last year. Al-Mabhouh also lost her leg in the attack and awaits permission to travel abroad for further treatment that could restore her mobility.\n\n“I dream of walking again, of holding a new baby, of rebuilding my family,” she said, her voice heavy with grief. For now, she relies on her parents for basic daily care and cannot even hold a pen.\n\nNearby, 23-year-old Yassin Marouf lies in a tent, his left foot amputated and his right leg severely injured after being hit by Israeli shelling in May. His brother was killed in the same attack, and Marouf struggles with basic movements. Doctors say his right leg may also need amputation unless he receives treatment outside the Palestinian territory.\n\n“If I want to go to the bathroom, I need two or three people to carry me,” he said.\n\nIn Gaza, thousands face similar challenges. Youssef al-Samri, 16, lost both legs while fetching water near his home after an Israeli airstrike in May. Displaced to a kindergarten in the al-Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, he navigates his world on his hands, relying on support to move through the classrooms where children play around him.\n\nTwelve-year-old Fadi al-Balbisi is learning to walk again with a prosthetic after losing his right leg to shelling in April. At Hamad Hospital in Zawaida, he practices with a prosthetic limb under the guidance of specialists, each step a hard-earned milestone toward regaining independence.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 5,000 to 6,000 people in Gaza have become amputees from the Israel-Hamas war, a quarter of them children. Many face long waits for prosthetics or medical evacuations abroad. Local centers, like the Artificial Limbs and Polio Center in Gaza City, are overwhelmed and have only limited supplies to provide artificial limbs.\n\nWhile a recent shipment of essential prosthetic materials has arrived in Gaza, the need remains critical. Patients like al-Mabhouh and Marouf face months-long waits for treatments that could prevent further amputations or restore mobility. Even with ceasefires in place, medical evacuations have been slow, hampered by bureaucratic and logistical barriers.\n\nIn the midst of this crisis, the lives of those affected are frozen in uncertainty. For al-Mabhouh, Marouf, al-Samri, and al-Balbisi, each day is a struggle for movement, dignity, and hope, as they navigate the aftermath of war with resilience and the faint promise of medical help.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "description": "After many arguments with my husband about when to leave for flights, we started arriving at the airport separately. This trick helped our marriage.",
    "fullText": "For the nine years we've been a couple, my husband and I have taken countless flights together.\n\nWe've visited family in the Carolinas, Tennessee, Montana, and Maryland. We've wandered around the Duomo in Florence, enjoyed tacos and tequila in Mexico City, and explored the breathtaking Normandy coastline.\n\nNow that we live in London, travel has ramped up. We're in our late 20s and early 30s, and wedding season has us flying back to the US on a near-monthly basis for our friends' nuptials … in addition to other scheduled trips.\n\nUnfortunately, we would get in a fight — almost every time — about what time to leave for the airport.\n\nAs a chronically early person, I hate rushing and get intense anxiety about cutting things too close.\n\nI'd rather sit in an airport for an extra hour than make a sweaty sprint through the terminal to catch a flight.\n\nMy husband, on the other hand, doesn't like to waste time — and with his demanding, meeting-filled job, he rarely has a moment to spare.\n\nHis perfect travel day involves passing through security as the plane begins boarding. Though that's anxiety-inducing to me, for what it's worth, he's only ever missed one flight.\n\nBecause of this, in the hours before a flight, I'd be huffing around our apartment with bags packed and shoes on. He'd get frustrated that I was rushing him, and I'd get annoyed that he was making us \"late.\"\n\nCue lots of tense moments and grumpy silence in transit.\n\nA few months ago, ahead of yet another long-haul flight to the US, I suggested what I thought was a reasonable time to leave — not too early, not too late. My husband wanted to leave even later.\n\nI decided to just leave when I wanted to avoid the stress and inevitable argument. We were taking public transportation, so the cost was the same either way.\n\nI told him I'd meet him at the gate, gave him a quick kiss, and made my way — happily, unhurriedly — to the airport. He arrived much later, but still on time.\n\nWe proceeded to have the smoothest trip we'd ever had in nine years.\n\nSince we started arriving at the airport separately, we noticed tons of other benefits, too.\n\nMy husband and I have very different work schedules, and this setup helps us both effectively manage our responsibilities. Sometimes, I'll get to the airport extra early to take a call or put finishing touches on an assignment.\n\nWe've also found that there's no financial downside to this system.\n\nObviously, this travel hack works best for city dwellers with easy access to public transport. It's definitely trickier if you live out in the suburbs and either share a car or don't want to park two at the airport.\n\nBecause we've only ever lived together in cities, though, this option is easy for us. Even if we planned to take an Uber together, the added cost of one of us leaving earlier on public transit is generally pretty marginal — in our case, usually no more than about $15.\n\nBest of all, by arriving at the airport when we like, we start our trips on a positive note. The last thing we need on an already stressful travel day is to be fighting or feeling frustrated with or another.\n\nThough this works well for us, we don't always travel separately.\n\nThere are times when our schedules make it more convenient to head to the airport together, or we have enough luggage that it makes more sense to schedule an Uber.\n\nIn those instances, we talk through our schedules the day before to make sure we can clearly communicate expectations so that there are no surprises.\n\nThese days, though, this heading to the airport separately has become our norm. I'll tell my husband which train I'm planning to take, and he tells me which one he's on.\n\nWe know that we'll see each other at the gate, one way or another.",

    "description": "Instead of our usual big holiday celebration with extended family, the four of us spent Christmas traveling and making new traditions on our trip.",
    "fullText": "Christmas is a really, really big deal in our house.\n\nIt's when our close-knit extended family gets together to celebrate, feast, and spend time with one another.\n\nHowever, my husband, two young kids, and I spent last Christmas sitting in our caravan on a remote beach in South Australia, just the four of us.\n\nIt was a far cry from the holidays before. But after years of deliberating, we'd just recently packed up our lives and belongings and headed toward the Australian outback for a yearlong adventure in a small caravan.\n\nComing home for Christmas wasn't an option — but, with a bit of planning, we still ended up having a brilliant (and unique) holiday.\n\nWhen you travel with everything you own packed into a caravan, space is at a premium.\n\nWe would've loved a standard Christmas tree, but we opted for a small, travel-sized version that had been stashed in the back of a cupboard for months as it silently traveled Australia.\n\nAs the holiday season approached, we dug out the tree and our kids decorated with the small selection of trimmings we'd brought with us.\n\nQuickly, the whole caravan turned into a Christmas ornament, with tinsel and fairy lights hanging from every nook and cranny. To our surprise, it was really magical. The kids loved the space so much that the lights stayed up long after December 25.\n\nWe also got creative when planning our Christmas feast, especially since our caravan doesn't have an oven and we'd be miles from any major city on the big day.\n\nInstead of roasting a whole bird, we made nachos with our barbecue and stove and topped them with ground turkey and other fixings.\n\nWhile sitting on a blanket on a beach, we used our best plastic plates and shared our low-stress Christmas-inspired feast. As a bonus, cleaning up after dinner was a breeze.\n\nLike any inquisitive 4-year-old, my daughter asked: \"How will Santa find us?\" She was concerned we didn't have a chimney, a letterbox, or even space for Santa to fit in our van.\n\nOnce again, we did some serious problem-solving. Thanks to the magic of Christmas — and preparations we made months in advance — Santa did find us.\n\nGrandparents also wanted to send gifts, which proved difficult on the road. Since we'd be in a remote area at Christmastime and unable to receive parcels, we arranged for relatives to get their presents to a town we knew we'd be visiting a few weeks prior.\n\nThen, we hid them in the van the best we could until Christmas Day.\n\nThat morning, thanks satellite coverage and modern technology, we were able to video call members our extended family so they could see the kids unwrap their gifts.\n\nOur holiday wasn't traditional, and we'll absolutely remember it for years to come.\n\nBeing on the road forced us to problem-solve and come up with ideas as an extended family. It allowed us to rethink many traditions and leave some behind simply because, logistically, they couldn't happen.\n\nInstead, we created new traditions and memories as a young family, while still staying connected with loved ones over video calls.\n\nWould we do it again? Absolutely. But this year, we plan to celebrate in person with our larger family again … and we might even bring the turkey nachos!",

However, Basel are dangerous, especially at home.\n\nThe Swiss side has alternated between wins and defeats throughout the League Phase (W2, L3).\n\nIt is worth noting that they have won their last seven Europa League home matches, their longest active streak in the competition.\n\nA late defeat to Genk dropped them to 24th, but they still occupy the final play-off spot with three games remaining.\n\nConfidence is rising after back-to-back domestic wins, including a last-gasp 2–1 victory over Winterthur last weekend.\n\nThis will be the clubs’ first meeting in 23 years, since Villa’s 4–1 aggregate victory in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nThe Villans must be wary as Basel have won five of their last 10 matches against English opposition.\n\nBasel have also been flawless at home in this competition, with seven straight wins at St Jakob-Park.\n\nVilla have struggled on the road in Europe recently, winning just one of their last six UEFA Cup/Europa League away games.\n\nHowever, Villa have scored two or more goals in 10 of their last 15 matches, highlighting their firepower heading into this fixture.\n\nDonyell Malen up top will likely carry Villa’s greatest threat with Ollie Watkins rested. Malen has scored three goals in his last two Europa League outings.\n\nTyrone Mings (thigh) and Ross Barkley (knee) remain out, while Evann Guessand is doubtful after missing the Arsenal win.\n\nUnai Emery may rotate. Emiliano Martinez has started the last three European games but could be rested, with Marco Bizot pushing for minutes.\n\nMatty Cash might also drop out, opening the door for Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof or Andres Garcia at right-back.\n\nIf Lindelof does not play wide, he could partner Pau Torres centrally, with Lucas Digne competing with Ian Maatsen on the left.\n\nIn midfield, Boubacar Kamara and Amadou Onana are expected to continue, while Youri Tielemans or Morgan Rogers may be managed due to fixture congestion.\n\nFurther forward, Buendia is pushing for a start after his last-gasp Arsenal heroics. The 28-year-old could get a shot.\n\nHarvey Elliott will likely not play today. Emery confirmed that the youngster, who is a ‘special player’, could return to parent club Liverpool in January.\n\nJadon Sancho and John McGinn are alternative options. Malen is expected to lead the line, with Emery likely to rest Ollie Watkins again.\n\nMarco Bizot; Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof, Pau Torres, Lucas Digne; Boubacar Kamara, Amadou Onana; John McGinn, Emiliano Buendia, Jadon Sancho; Donyell Malen.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa travel to Switzerland on Thursday night looking to extend a magnificent winning run.\n\nThey face FC Basel at St. Jakob-Park in the Europa League. Unai Emery’s side arrive in Basel brimming with confidence after a dramatic 2-1 victory over Premier League leaders Arsenal last weekend. This result extended their winning streak to seven matches across all competitions. The Villans currently sit joint-top of the Europa League standings with 12 points.\n\nThey aim to secure a top-eight finish. However, they face a formidable test against a Basel side that has turned St. Jakob-Park into a fortress. The Swiss outfit have won each of their last seven home Europa League matches. This is the longest current winning home run in the competition.\n\nDate: Thursday, 11 December 2025\n\nHead coach Ludovic Magnin will rely heavily on the experience of captain Xherdan Shaqiri. He has been instrumental this season with 11 goals and 10 assists. The former Liverpool man scored the opener in last weekend’s win over Winterthur and is expected to retain his place in attack. In midfield, Andrej Bacanin is likely to come into the starting XI to replace Marin Soticek. Moritz Broschinski is expected to lead the line. However, there are doubts over the availability of Kaio Eduardo due to injury.\n\nUnai Emery is expected to rotate his squad following the intense victory over Arsenal. Consequently, Matty Cash could be rested after scoring the opener against the Gunners. Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelöf, or the returning Andrés García are contending for the right-back slot. In attack, Donyell Malen is pushing to replace Ollie Watkins. Furthermore, Emiliano Buendía is in contention for a start after scoring the winner against Arsenal. Tyrone Mings and Ross Barkley remain sidelined.\n\nBasel enter this contest knowing their home form is their greatest asset. They are unbeaten in 10 European matches on home soil since 2015. Moreover, they have won five of their last 10 major European games against English opponents. Despite a rocky start to the league phase, they have found domestic rhythm recently. They have won back-to-back games in the Swiss Cup and Super League.\n\nVilla are enjoying a historic year in Europe. They have won eight of their last 10 major European matches. All eight wins came in 2025, which is a club record for a single calendar year. Their style under Emery has been distinct. Indeed, they have played the highest percentage of short passes of any team in the competition. History also favours the visitors as Villa triumphed when these sides met in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nBasel predicted XI: Hitz; Tsunemoto, Adjetey, Daniliuc, Schmid; Metinho, Bacanin; Shaqiri, Leroy, Otele; Broschinski\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Bizot; Bogarde, Lindelof, Torres, Digne; Kamara, Onana; Buendía, Tielemans, Rogers; Malen\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports. Coverage starts at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead- Mainoo preference abroad move over Premier League loan\n\nSee more- Saudi Pro League CEO endorses Mohamed Salah transfer\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "Data from Strava and AllTrails show a surge in new hiking clubs, while National Parks continue to be top travel destinations.",
    "fullText": "The run clubs that took off in the past few years were outpaced by hiking.\n\nThat's according to new data from Strava, a fitness tracking app, and AllTrails, a hiking navigation app.\n\nStrava's end-of-year report, analyzing data from over 180 million users and surveying over 30,000 users and non-users, found that hiking clubs grew sixfold in 2025 — nearly double the pace of run clubs. In 2025, AllTrails saw a 20% increase in users (i.e., people who created an account on the app) to 90 million.\n\nOnline, you can find hiking clubs for seemingly every preference, whether you're a creative in LA looking for a morning workout, a woman who doesn't want to hike alone in North Carolina, or a \"hot girl\" on the hunt for new travel companions.\n\nWhile run clubs are still popular, hiking and walking have an advantage: simplicity. They offer similar health benefits and social perks — without requiring the same stamina or potentially pricey gear.\n\nCOVID lockdowns famously drew people to the outdoors, whether they joined run clubs or sought out nearby hikes.\n\nAnd then there were National Parks, which experienced a surge of visitors since 2020 during the pandemic — and don't seem to be losing their allure. According to the National Parks visitation data, 2024 broke the record for the highest number of visitors of all time at over 331 million, a 28% increase since 2020.\n\nFive years after the pandemic, National Parks continue to be popular destinations. \"When you start looking at that number as feet on the trail, bodies in the visitor's center, cars on the road, you see that the parks have exploded,\" Jason Frye, a hiking writer who most recently published a National Parks guidebook, told Business Insider. Strava reported that hiking was the second most popular reason for traveling, behind winter sports.\n\nCarly Smith, chief marketing officer for AllTrails, said its data shows many hikers search for locations over 200 miles from their home. \"So we know that people are using us for planning travel and then for navigating and exploring National Parks and other destinations,\" she said.\n\nSmith believes part of the reason hiking and National Parks continue to be hot is that, for many, life still hasn't changed all that much since the peak-remote work pandemic years. \"There are more people working remotely than there were in the past,\" she said. \"Hiking clubs in particular can give people a good sense of community in ways that maybe they aren't finding in other parts of their life.\"\n\nRunning isn't the cardio workout for everyone. It's also not the only — or best — way to burn fat.\n\nWhile sprinting at a very fast pace (zone 4 or zone 5) is great for your heart health, it consumes more carbs than fat compared to a brisk walk or light jog.\n\nHiking long distances with a heavy backpack can help hit two goals: shedding fat while building muscle.\n\nThat's partly why rucking, or walking with weights, became a buzzy fitness trend last year. We saw a boom in networking events where people chat shop while breaking a sweat.\n\nPrice-wise, hiking, rucking, and walking also more financially accessible than joining a luxury gym. Weighted vests, the walking accessories du jour, cost about $30-$40 on Amazon — though a backpack from GoRuck, one of the biggest players in this space, starts at $115.\n\nPlus, in many cases, hiking and walking can be interchangeable: not all hikes have to be strenuous to count, making them less physically and financially daunting.\n\nFrye, who lives in Wilmington, North Carolina, near Great Smoky Mountains National Park, said there are many hiking trails nearby that are \"really walks in the woods more than true hikes.\"\n\n\"You can hop out of the car and do it in your flip flops from most of them,\" he said — no high-tech gear needed.\n\nAccording to Strava's report, walking was the second-most tracked activity in 2025, after running. Along with hiking, both activities can feel like a more low-stakes group activity than a seven-mile run.\n\nJonathan Jacobs, who started a men's walking group in LA this year, previously told Business Insider that the accessibility of walking made newcomers more likely to show up.\n\n\"Men who come to the walks repeatedly tell me that the low barrier to entry — no need to sign up or pay a fee to join — makes it easier for them to commit,\" he said.\n\nCity dwellers who partook in walking Manhattan from \"tip to tip\" — another popular TikTok trend of the year — also cited it as a memorable (but still low-key) experience with their friends.\n\nFrye believes the hiking hype is all part of the same phenomenon behind the renewed interest in dumb phones and old-school activities like pickling and crocheting.\n\n\"There seems to be this cultural shift, away from the digital and more toward the analog,\" he said. \"We're looking at these ways to return to easier things, and it doesn't get much easier than hiking.\"\n\nDecember 10, 2025: A previous version of this story stated that the Strava report data came from 30,000 Strava users. It came from 180 million users, as well as an additional survey of 30,000 users and non-users.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest will look to strengthen their Europa League ambitions with another crucial win as they travel to the Netherlands to face Utrecht, keeping one eye firmly on securing a place in the round of 16.\n\nDespite a turbulent domestic campaign, Sean Dyche’s side remain well positioned to progress in Europe. Forest sit in a promising spot heading into the final group fixtures, though they will still need a result against a Utrecht team who, despite sitting 32nd in the league phase standings, cannot be underestimated.\n\nForest had enjoyed a three-match winning run – scoring three goals in each victory over Leeds, Liverpool and Malmö – but their momentum has stalled since.\n\nA dip in results has dragged them back into a mid-season relegation battle, something the club hoped to avoid following Dyche’s appointment in October.\n\nDays after edging past bottom-placed Wolves, the Tricky Trees fell to a comfortable defeat away at Everton, leaving them 17th in the Premier League and just two points above the relegation zone.\n\nAttention now turns back to the Europa League, where Forest sit two points outside the top seven and four off first place. With the league phase tightly congested, every point against those around them is pivotal.\n\nUtrecht, meanwhile, are competing in European football for the first time in 14 years. They are one of only five teams yet to record a win in this season’s competition, having drawn once and lost four. Their solitary point came against Porto before falling to a fourth defeat against Real Betis on matchweek five.\n\nDomestically, however, Ron Jans’ side has been far more consistent. Just five defeats in 15 league matches have pushed Utrecht into the European positions once again as they look to turn what has been an occasional high into a more regular achievement.\n\nThey enter this match as clear underdogs but will hope to channel their steady league form into a much-needed European lift.\n\nUtrecht will be without midfielder Davy van den Berg, who remains sidelined through injury, while goalkeeper Vasilis Barkas is recovering but could return in time to start. Attacking midfielder Victor Jensen (hamstring) and full-back Niklas Vesterlund (knee) will also miss Thursday’s clash.\n\nFor Nottingham Forest, Dyche remains without full-back Ola Aina, midfielder Douglas Luiz (both thigh) and striker Chris Wood (knee), with all three continuing their rehabilitation. Defender Murillo is facing a race against time to return from a hamstring issue and illness, having missed Forest’s last three matches in all competitions.\n\nUTR: Barkas; Horemans, Van De Hoorn, Viergever, El Karouani; Bozdogan, Ongena, De Wit; Rodriguez, Min, Cathline",

    "description": "This summer, I went to Portugal for the music festival Afro Nation. I felt like I didn't get to see the country I'd flown all the way out to visit.",
    "fullText": "Tourism in Portugal has reached record numbers over the past two years, with over 31 million visitors in 2024.\n\nAlthough the coastal wonders of the Algarve region and the historic castles of Sintra are often a selling point for tourists, I took the seven-hour trip for reasons unrelated to wanderlust.\n\nPortimão, Portugal, is the home of Afro Nation, the biggest annual Afrobeats festival in the world — and this summer, I was one of the 40,000 festival-goers in attendance.\n\nThough dancing on the stunning beaches of Portugal to the sounds of Burna Boy and Tems live was definitely a bucket-list experience that I wouldn't have traded for the world, I'm not sure it's one I would repeat.\n\nDon't get me wrong: This realization had nothing to do with a lackluster experience. There is nothing dull about being serenaded by a shirtless Damini, and there was nothing disappointing about Portugal, either.\n\nInstead, I left feeling like I hadn't visited Portugal at all, but rather that I attended an event that just happened to be there.\n\nSomewhere between day two and day three, it hit me: I was in Portugal, but I wasn't really seeing the country.\n\nMy days weren't spent wandering tiled alleyways or eating salted cod by the water. Instead, I spent all my downtime resting at my resort, ordering food, getting dressed, and then heading back onto the beach — not for a swim, but for another 12 hours of music.\n\nThe experience wasn't exactly cheap, either. Aside from the nearly $600 I spent on the festival tickets, food and drinks were expensive at the venue, and rideshare trips cost more than I'd planned on spending, probably due to the crowds.\n\nI don't regret what I spent on the experience, but I did find myself thinking about what it would have been like to spend that money at a Lisbon flea market or on a cooking class, learning how to make pastel de nata from a local.\n\nThe beach could've been in Miami. The resort could've been in Cancún. The only Portuguese thing about my trip was the exchange rate.\n\nI did have two days after the festival ended to explore Lisbon, but it wasn't nearly enough time. I was exhausted after three days of standing on my feet and singing along, and after all of the rideshares we had purchased, both my feet and my wallet needed a break.\n\nOnce I got home, I noticed that my Instagram feed was flooded with other people's Portugal trips: sunsets on sailboats in Portimão, wine in Porto, mist hanging over Sintra's castles.\n\nI felt like they'd gotten to see Portugal. I'd gotten to see a festival that happened to be hosted there.\n\nI don't regret my trip — Afro Nation itself was unforgettable. I loved the music, the chaos, the feeling of being surrounded by a global community all singing Burna Boy under the same sky.\n\nIn an ideal world, I'd be able to go back to Afro Nation with an extra three or four days to actually roam. However, extra days meant extra costs for food, accommodations, and the experiences I was so desperate to have — and unfortunately, I didn't have unlimited PTO.\n\nI learned that my idea of a perfect trip doesn't center on an international festival or specific experience. I don't want to cross an ocean just to stand in a crowd.\n\nMy version of travel definitely includes sun, sand, and bottomless drinks, but also curiosity. I want to wander, learn, and actually see where I am.\n\nI'd say that Portugal is still on my travel bucket list — though I went, I barely touched it. Next time, I'm not going for a stage on the beach. I'm going for the country.",

    "description": "\"Bridgerton\" returns, an Agatha Christie adaptation, and \"People We Meet on Vacation.\"",
    "fullText": "Netflix's January lineup is on the lighter side, but includes the return of period romance series Bridgerton (Jan. 29). Season four centers on Benedict, the second-eldest sibling, and Sophie, who he meets at Lady Bridgerton’s masquerade ball. The first four episodes drop in January, with the remaining four coming at the end of February.\n\nAnother original series worth watching is Agatha Christie's Seven Dials (Jan. 15), an adaptation of crime author's novel The Seven Dials Mystery.

    "fullText": "Since I was a child, receiving holiday cards has been one of my favorite parts of December.\n\nI love seeing the snapshots families choose to represent their year and reading the little updates that I don't get on social media.\n\nWhen I was in my 20s, I wanted to start sending my own, but I felt I had to wait for traditional milestones — like getting married and having kids — before it would feel \"appropriate.\"\n\nIn my mind, holiday cards seemed like a privilege reserved for conventional lives.\n\nAs the years went by, I continued to see stories about unmarried, single, or child-free women sending holiday cards that poked fun at their status. They'd pose with sad faces and wine bottles or include clever quips about being alone once again.\n\nEvery year, without fail, someone would send me these articles as if I could relate, but I couldn't. To each their own, of course, but I never saw my life as something to be made fun of, and I definitely didn't feel sorry for myself.\n\nSo, I created a new holiday card tradition — one that celebrates my beautiful and full life.\n\nAs I neared 30, I started doing a lot of solo traveling and set the goal of visiting all 63 major US national parks on my own by the time I turned 40.\n\nThough I was posting some of my trips on social media, I also wanted to share them more personally with my friends and family.\n\nFinally, I decided to print a holiday card featuring a photo from a summer trip I took to Canada — a simple shot of my backpack overlooking the mountains of Banff National Park.\n\nI hesitated for a while before mailing them, worried that friends and family might find it narcissistic or odd to receive a card with only me in it.\n\nHowever, many who received the card reached out to express their love for the photo and how happy they were to get it in the mail.\n\nI've kept the tradition going ever since — for nearly 10 years now, through my entire 30s, I've sent a card filled with my favorite photos from the year's solo adventures.\n\nFriends and family often ask well in advance if they're still on my mailing list and tell me how much they look forward to receiving them.\n\nFor me, sharing these more personal photos — the ones I cherish most — in a tangible, intimate way has become a highlight of the season.\n\nCreating the cards each year makes me feel empowered, proud of my accomplishments, and confident in the life I've chosen.\n\nMore than anything, it's a reminder that holiday cards can celebrate joy, connection, and the version of life you're proud to live — however unconventional it may be.",

    "description": "After 15 years as a digital nomad, Kaisu Koskela went on her first cruise. She found it both exciting and overwhelming.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kaisu Koskela, 48, a postdoctoral researcher on digital nomads. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a digital nomad for 15 years, so Nomad Cruise had been on my radar for a while. What began a decade ago as a relocation cruise for remote workers has grown into something much bigger — twice-yearly trips that feel like floating community conferences.\n\nAs a researcher and policy advisor on digital nomadism, I was especially curious. After some deliberation, my partner and I booked the 27-day Pacific crossing from Seattle to Sydney.\n\nNeither of us had ever been on a cruise before. It felt exciting, but also overwhelming.\n\nSomething was always happening: talks on life and work, meetups, and workshops. All of that was just the nomad program. The ship added even more, from cabaret shows to talks on local history. We also had full days ashore in places like Honolulu and Samoa.\n\nStarlink WiFi made working easy, and I met people in all kinds of fields, from AI to videography. But it was a long route, and no one was overly focused on productivity, including me.\n\nI'd planned to finish an article but never got to it, and honestly, I didn't mind. I was there for the experience.\n\nThe 230 passengers felt like a true snapshot of the nomad world. The youngest passenger was 23, and the oldest was in their 60s, but the majority were in their 30s.\n\nThe cruise is set up as a peer-learning conference: passengers give talks and share their expertise for free. I spoke about digital nomad visas and helped people one-on-one afterward. In return, before I got onstage a performance coach prepped me for my talk, and a designer explained a confusing part of my chart. Everyone gave something.\n\nI was surprised by how many passengers weren't nomads yet. They'd come for inspiration. Some were so enamored by the idea of location independence that they quit their jobs on the spot, pushed over the edge by burnout and encouraged by others to go freelance and build something of their own.\n\nA common theme kept coming up: Don't stay tied to an employer who's breaking you down.\n\nAs the days passed, we created more together. In the first week, someone formed a choir. I joined, and we rehearsed on every sea day before performing a full concert with professional lights and sound. I've had to sacrifice very little to be a digital nomad, but singing in a choir is off the table. Having one of my hobbies back for a month felt incredible.\n\nMeetups took off just as easily. I posted one for speed puzzling and ended up playing with a group that included someone who'd competed in the World Puzzling Championship. What started as a fangirl moment became real technique training.\n\nThe community was big enough that no matter how niche the interest, someone else shared it.\n\nLife onboard was easy — the staff were wonderful, and the vibe felt warm. But being a \"cruise tourist\" on land felt different\n\nVanuatu, an island archipelago in the South Pacific, was our final stop. It was also a new country for me. There, we were dropped on an otherwise uninhabited island where bars and food stalls had been set up just for us. Technically, I've now been to Vanuatu, but I had no contact with local life. I didn't love that.\n\nCruise stops are short; you're usually back onboard by 4:30 p.m. Early in the trip, after docking in Hawaii, we rushed around Maui trying to see everything. It felt pointless, a YouTube video would've given me the same overview.\n\nWe'd cracked the formula by the time we reached Savusavu in Fiji. It was a real town with a market, and we just wandered, with no agenda. I preferred those stops; even a tiny slice of local life beats racing through a checklist.\n\nThe remoteness of the Pacific was surreal. Seattle to Hawaii took a week; Hawaii to Samoa took another 16 days with no land, no ships — just ocean and the occasional pod of dolphins.\n\nThere was even a Crossing the Line ceremony for first-time equator crossers. We had to kiss a fish and jump into the pool. I loved it.\n\nNomad Cruise was expensive — €4,300, or about $5,000 each — so we thought hard before booking. We chose a basic cabin with a window and ate like royalty.\n\nAlcohol was extra, though happy hour made wine about $6 a glass. Onboard purchases came with an automatic 18% tip, plus a crew appreciation fee of about $17 per day. But reaching these destinations on our own would've cost more, and once we were on the ship, I stopped thinking about money; everything felt free.\n\nLeaving after a month on the cruise felt surreal; the community bubble was hard to step out of. I loved the people, the sunsets, and even the small things like watching the weather and birdlife change across the ocean.\n\nI'm sure I'll cross paths and deepen connections with some of the people I met on board. We shared something special.",
