    "title": "My husband and I always fought about when to leave for the airport. So, we created a travel rule that solved everything.",
    "description": "After many arguments with my husband about when to leave for flights, we started arriving at the airport separately. This trick helped our marriage.",
    "fullText": "For the nine years we've been a couple, my husband and I have taken countless flights together.\n\nWe've visited family in the Carolinas, Tennessee, Montana, and Maryland. We've wandered around the Duomo in Florence, enjoyed tacos and tequila in Mexico City, and explored the breathtaking Normandy coastline.\n\nNow that we live in London, travel has ramped up. We're in our late 20s and early 30s, and wedding season has us flying back to the US on a near-monthly basis for our friends' nuptials … in addition to other scheduled trips.\n\nUnfortunately, we would get in a fight — almost every time — about what time to leave for the airport.\n\nAs a chronically early person, I hate rushing and get intense anxiety about cutting things too close.\n\nI'd rather sit in an airport for an extra hour than make a sweaty sprint through the terminal to catch a flight.\n\nMy husband, on the other hand, doesn't like to waste time — and with his demanding, meeting-filled job, he rarely has a moment to spare.\n\nHis perfect travel day involves passing through security as the plane begins boarding. Though that's anxiety-inducing to me, for what it's worth, he's only ever missed one flight.\n\nBecause of this, in the hours before a flight, I'd be huffing around our apartment with bags packed and shoes on. He'd get frustrated that I was rushing him, and I'd get annoyed that he was making us \"late.\"\n\nCue lots of tense moments and grumpy silence in transit.\n\nA few months ago, ahead of yet another long-haul flight to the US, I suggested what I thought was a reasonable time to leave — not too early, not too late. My husband wanted to leave even later.\n\nI decided to just leave when I wanted to avoid the stress and inevitable argument. We were taking public transportation, so the cost was the same either way.\n\nI told him I'd meet him at the gate, gave him a quick kiss, and made my way — happily, unhurriedly — to the airport. He arrived much later, but still on time.\n\nWe proceeded to have the smoothest trip we'd ever had in nine years.\n\nSince we started arriving at the airport separately, we noticed tons of other benefits, too.\n\nMy husband and I have very different work schedules, and this setup helps us both effectively manage our responsibilities. Sometimes, I'll get to the airport extra early to take a call or put finishing touches on an assignment.\n\nWe've also found that there's no financial downside to this system.\n\nObviously, this travel hack works best for city dwellers with easy access to public transport. It's definitely trickier if you live out in the suburbs and either share a car or don't want to park two at the airport.\n\nBecause we've only ever lived together in cities, though, this option is easy for us. Even if we planned to take an Uber together, the added cost of one of us leaving earlier on public transit is generally pretty marginal — in our case, usually no more than about $15.\n\nBest of all, by arriving at the airport when we like, we start our trips on a positive note. The last thing we need on an already stressful travel day is to be fighting or feeling frustrated with or another.\n\nThough this works well for us, we don't always travel separately.\n\nThere are times when our schedules make it more convenient to head to the airport together, or we have enough luggage that it makes more sense to schedule an Uber.\n\nIn those instances, we talk through our schedules the day before to make sure we can clearly communicate expectations so that there are no surprises.\n\nThese days, though, this heading to the airport separately has become our norm. I'll tell my husband which train I'm planning to take, and he tells me which one he's on.\n\nWe know that we'll see each other at the gate, one way or another.",

    "description": "Instead of our usual big holiday celebration with extended family, the four of us spent Christmas traveling and making new traditions on our trip.",
    "fullText": "Christmas is a really, really big deal in our house.\n\nIt's when our close-knit extended family gets together to celebrate, feast, and spend time with one another.\n\nHowever, my husband, two young kids, and I spent last Christmas sitting in our caravan on a remote beach in South Australia, just the four of us.\n\nIt was a far cry from the holidays before. But after years of deliberating, we'd just recently packed up our lives and belongings and headed toward the Australian outback for a yearlong adventure in a small caravan.\n\nComing home for Christmas wasn't an option — but, with a bit of planning, we still ended up having a brilliant (and unique) holiday.\n\nWhen you travel with everything you own packed into a caravan, space is at a premium.\n\nWe would've loved a standard Christmas tree, but we opted for a small, travel-sized version that had been stashed in the back of a cupboard for months as it silently traveled Australia.\n\nAs the holiday season approached, we dug out the tree and our kids decorated with the small selection of trimmings we'd brought with us.\n\nQuickly, the whole caravan turned into a Christmas ornament, with tinsel and fairy lights hanging from every nook and cranny. To our surprise, it was really magical. The kids loved the space so much that the lights stayed up long after December 25.\n\nWe also got creative when planning our Christmas feast, especially since our caravan doesn't have an oven and we'd be miles from any major city on the big day.\n\nInstead of roasting a whole bird, we made nachos with our barbecue and stove and topped them with ground turkey and other fixings.\n\nWhile sitting on a blanket on a beach, we used our best plastic plates and shared our low-stress Christmas-inspired feast. As a bonus, cleaning up after dinner was a breeze.\n\nLike any inquisitive 4-year-old, my daughter asked: \"How will Santa find us?\" She was concerned we didn't have a chimney, a letterbox, or even space for Santa to fit in our van.\n\nOnce again, we did some serious problem-solving. Thanks to the magic of Christmas — and preparations we made months in advance — Santa did find us.\n\nGrandparents also wanted to send gifts, which proved difficult on the road. Since we'd be in a remote area at Christmastime and unable to receive parcels, we arranged for relatives to get their presents to a town we knew we'd be visiting a few weeks prior.\n\nThen, we hid them in the van the best we could until Christmas Day.\n\nThat morning, thanks satellite coverage and modern technology, we were able to video call members our extended family so they could see the kids unwrap their gifts.\n\nOur holiday wasn't traditional, and we'll absolutely remember it for years to come.\n\nBeing on the road forced us to problem-solve and come up with ideas as an extended family. It allowed us to rethink many traditions and leave some behind simply because, logistically, they couldn't happen.\n\nInstead, we created new traditions and memories as a young family, while still staying connected with loved ones over video calls.\n\nWould we do it again? Absolutely. But this year, we plan to celebrate in person with our larger family again … and we might even bring the turkey nachos!",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa travel to Switzerland aiming to tighten their grip on a top-eight Europa League berth when they face Basel tonight.\n\nVilla arrive in red-hot form, winning 13 of their last 15 matches in all competitions.\n\nUnai Emery’s side claimed a statement win against Arsenal over the weekend, with Emiliano Buendia’s 95th-minute strike sealing a dramatic 2–1 victory.\n\nThe Villans sit third in the Premier League, three points off the top, and with European progress firmly in view.\n\nThey enter matchday six on 12 points (W4, L1), joint-top of the 36-team standings. However, Basel are dangerous, especially at home.\n\nThe Swiss side has alternated between wins and defeats throughout the League Phase (W2, L3).\n\nIt is worth noting that they have won their last seven Europa League home matches, their longest active streak in the competition.\n\nA late defeat to Genk dropped them to 24th, but they still occupy the final play-off spot with three games remaining.\n\nConfidence is rising after back-to-back domestic wins, including a last-gasp 2–1 victory over Winterthur last weekend.\n\nThis will be the clubs’ first meeting in 23 years, since Villa’s 4–1 aggregate victory in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nThe Villans must be wary as Basel have won five of their last 10 matches against English opposition.\n\nBasel have also been flawless at home in this competition, with seven straight wins at St Jakob-Park.\n\nVilla have struggled on the road in Europe recently, winning just one of their last six UEFA Cup/Europa League away games.\n\nHowever, Villa have scored two or more goals in 10 of their last 15 matches, highlighting their firepower heading into this fixture.\n\nDonyell Malen up top will likely carry Villa’s greatest threat with Ollie Watkins rested. Malen has scored three goals in his last two Europa League outings.\n\nTyrone Mings (thigh) and Ross Barkley (knee) remain out, while Evann Guessand is doubtful after missing the Arsenal win.\n\nUnai Emery may rotate. Emiliano Martinez has started the last three European games but could be rested, with Marco Bizot pushing for minutes.\n\nMatty Cash might also drop out, opening the door for Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof or Andres Garcia at right-back.\n\nIf Lindelof does not play wide, he could partner Pau Torres centrally, with Lucas Digne competing with Ian Maatsen on the left.\n\nIn midfield, Boubacar Kamara and Amadou Onana are expected to continue, while Youri Tielemans or Morgan Rogers may be managed due to fixture congestion.\n\nFurther forward, Buendia is pushing for a start after his last-gasp Arsenal heroics. The 28-year-old could get a shot.\n\nHarvey Elliott will likely not play today. Emery confirmed that the youngster, who is a ‘special player’, could return to parent club Liverpool in January.\n\nJadon Sancho and John McGinn are alternative options. Malen is expected to lead the line, with Emery likely to rest Ollie Watkins again.\n\nMarco Bizot; Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof, Pau Torres, Lucas Digne; Boubacar Kamara, Amadou Onana; John McGinn, Emiliano Buendia, Jadon Sancho; Donyell Malen.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa travel to Switzerland on Thursday night looking to extend a magnificent winning run.\n\nThey face FC Basel at St. Jakob-Park in the Europa League. Unai Emery’s side arrive in Basel brimming with confidence after a dramatic 2-1 victory over Premier League leaders Arsenal last weekend. This result extended their winning streak to seven matches across all competitions. The Villans currently sit joint-top of the Europa League standings with 12 points.\n\nThey aim to secure a top-eight finish. However, they face a formidable test against a Basel side that has turned St. Jakob-Park into a fortress. The Swiss outfit have won each of their last seven home Europa League matches. This is the longest current winning home run in the competition.\n\nDate: Thursday, 11 December 2025\n\nHead coach Ludovic Magnin will rely heavily on the experience of captain Xherdan Shaqiri. He has been instrumental this season with 11 goals and 10 assists. The former Liverpool man scored the opener in last weekend’s win over Winterthur and is expected to retain his place in attack. In midfield, Andrej Bacanin is likely to come into the starting XI to replace Marin Soticek. Moritz Broschinski is expected to lead the line. However, there are doubts over the availability of Kaio Eduardo due to injury.\n\nUnai Emery is expected to rotate his squad following the intense victory over Arsenal. Consequently, Matty Cash could be rested after scoring the opener against the Gunners. Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelöf, or the returning Andrés García are contending for the right-back slot. In attack, Donyell Malen is pushing to replace Ollie Watkins. Furthermore, Emiliano Buendía is in contention for a start after scoring the winner against Arsenal. Tyrone Mings and Ross Barkley remain sidelined.\n\nBasel enter this contest knowing their home form is their greatest asset. They are unbeaten in 10 European matches on home soil since 2015. Moreover, they have won five of their last 10 major European games against English opponents. Despite a rocky start to the league phase, they have found domestic rhythm recently. They have won back-to-back games in the Swiss Cup and Super League.\n\nVilla are enjoying a historic year in Europe. They have won eight of their last 10 major European matches. All eight wins came in 2025, which is a club record for a single calendar year. Their style under Emery has been distinct. Indeed, they have played the highest percentage of short passes of any team in the competition. History also favours the visitors as Villa triumphed when these sides met in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nBasel predicted XI: Hitz; Tsunemoto, Adjetey, Daniliuc, Schmid; Metinho, Bacanin; Shaqiri, Leroy, Otele; Broschinski\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Bizot; Bogarde, Lindelof, Torres, Digne; Kamara, Onana; Buendía, Tielemans, Rogers; Malen\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports. Coverage starts at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead- Mainoo preference abroad move over Premier League loan\n\nSee more- Saudi Pro League CEO endorses Mohamed Salah transfer\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "title": "Walk, don't run: The latest workout trend combines the great outdoors with low-stakes socializing",
    "description": "Data from Strava and AllTrails show a surge in new hiking clubs, while National Parks continue to be top travel destinations.",
    "fullText": "The run clubs that took off in the past few years were outpaced by hiking.\n\nThat's according to new data from Strava, a fitness tracking app, and AllTrails, a hiking navigation app.\n\nStrava's end-of-year report, analyzing data from over 180 million users and surveying over 30,000 users and non-users, found that hiking clubs grew sixfold in 2025 — nearly double the pace of run clubs. In 2025, AllTrails saw a 20% increase in users (i.e., people who created an account on the app) to 90 million.\n\nOnline, you can find hiking clubs for seemingly every preference, whether you're a creative in LA looking for a morning workout, a woman who doesn't want to hike alone in North Carolina, or a \"hot girl\" on the hunt for new travel companions.\n\nWhile run clubs are still popular, hiking and walking have an advantage: simplicity. They offer similar health benefits and social perks — without requiring the same stamina or potentially pricey gear.\n\nCOVID lockdowns famously drew people to the outdoors, whether they joined run clubs or sought out nearby hikes.\n\nAnd then there were National Parks, which experienced a surge of visitors since 2020 during the pandemic — and don't seem to be losing their allure. According to the National Parks visitation data, 2024 broke the record for the highest number of visitors of all time at over 331 million, a 28% increase since 2020.\n\nFive years after the pandemic, National Parks continue to be popular destinations. \"When you start looking at that number as feet on the trail, bodies in the visitor's center, cars on the road, you see that the parks have exploded,\" Jason Frye, a hiking writer who most recently published a National Parks guidebook, told Business Insider. Strava reported that hiking was the second most popular reason for traveling, behind winter sports.\n\nCarly Smith, chief marketing officer for AllTrails, said its data shows many hikers search for locations over 200 miles from their home. \"So we know that people are using us for planning travel and then for navigating and exploring National Parks and other destinations,\" she said.\n\nSmith believes part of the reason hiking and National Parks continue to be hot is that, for many, life still hasn't changed all that much since the peak-remote work pandemic years. \"There are more people working remotely than there were in the past,\" she said. \"Hiking clubs in particular can give people a good sense of community in ways that maybe they aren't finding in other parts of their life.\"\n\nRunning isn't the cardio workout for everyone. It's also not the only — or best — way to burn fat.\n\nWhile sprinting at a very fast pace (zone 4 or zone 5) is great for your heart health, it consumes more carbs than fat compared to a brisk walk or light jog.\n\nHiking long distances with a heavy backpack can help hit two goals: shedding fat while building muscle.\n\nThat's partly why rucking, or walking with weights, became a buzzy fitness trend last year. We saw a boom in networking events where people chat shop while breaking a sweat.\n\nPrice-wise, hiking, rucking, and walking also more financially accessible than joining a luxury gym. Weighted vests, the walking accessories du jour, cost about $30-$40 on Amazon — though a backpack from GoRuck, one of the biggest players in this space, starts at $115.\n\nPlus, in many cases, hiking and walking can be interchangeable: not all hikes have to be strenuous to count, making them less physically and financially daunting.\n\nFrye, who lives in Wilmington, North Carolina, near Great Smoky Mountains National Park, said there are many hiking trails nearby that are \"really walks in the woods more than true hikes.\"\n\n\"You can hop out of the car and do it in your flip flops from most of them,\" he said — no high-tech gear needed.\n\nAccording to Strava's report, walking was the second-most tracked activity in 2025, after running. Along with hiking, both activities can feel like a more low-stakes group activity than a seven-mile run.\n\nJonathan Jacobs, who started a men's walking group in LA this year, previously told Business Insider that the accessibility of walking made newcomers more likely to show up.\n\n\"Men who come to the walks repeatedly tell me that the low barrier to entry — no need to sign up or pay a fee to join — makes it easier for them to commit,\" he said.\n\nCity dwellers who partook in walking Manhattan from \"tip to tip\" — another popular TikTok trend of the year — also cited it as a memorable (but still low-key) experience with their friends.\n\nFrye believes the hiking hype is all part of the same phenomenon behind the renewed interest in dumb phones and old-school activities like pickling and crocheting.\n\n\"There seems to be this cultural shift, away from the digital and more toward the analog,\" he said. \"We're looking at these ways to return to easier things, and it doesn't get much easier than hiking.\"\n\nDecember 10, 2025: A previous version of this story stated that the Strava report data came from 30,000 Strava users. It came from 180 million users, as well as an additional survey of 30,000 users and non-users.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest will look to strengthen their Europa League ambitions with another crucial win as they travel to the Netherlands to face Utrecht, keeping one eye firmly on securing a place in the round of 16.\n\nDespite a turbulent domestic campaign, Sean Dyche’s side remain well positioned to progress in Europe. Forest sit in a promising spot heading into the final group fixtures, though they will still need a result against a Utrecht team who, despite sitting 32nd in the league phase standings, cannot be underestimated.\n\nForest had enjoyed a three-match winning run – scoring three goals in each victory over Leeds, Liverpool and Malmö – but their momentum has stalled since.\n\nA dip in results has dragged them back into a mid-season relegation battle, something the club hoped to avoid following Dyche’s appointment in October.\n\nDays after edging past bottom-placed Wolves, the Tricky Trees fell to a comfortable defeat away at Everton, leaving them 17th in the Premier League and just two points above the relegation zone.\n\nAttention now turns back to the Europa League, where Forest sit two points outside the top seven and four off first place. With the league phase tightly congested, every point against those around them is pivotal.\n\nUtrecht, meanwhile, are competing in European football for the first time in 14 years. They are one of only five teams yet to record a win in this season’s competition, having drawn once and lost four. Their solitary point came against Porto before falling to a fourth defeat against Real Betis on matchweek five.\n\nDomestically, however, Ron Jans’ side has been far more consistent. Just five defeats in 15 league matches have pushed Utrecht into the European positions once again as they look to turn what has been an occasional high into a more regular achievement.\n\nThey enter this match as clear underdogs but will hope to channel their steady league form into a much-needed European lift.\n\nUtrecht will be without midfielder Davy van den Berg, who remains sidelined through injury, while goalkeeper Vasilis Barkas is recovering but could return in time to start. Attacking midfielder Victor Jensen (hamstring) and full-back Niklas Vesterlund (knee) will also miss Thursday’s clash.\n\nFor Nottingham Forest, Dyche remains without full-back Ola Aina, midfielder Douglas Luiz (both thigh) and striker Chris Wood (knee), with all three continuing their rehabilitation. Defender Murillo is facing a race against time to return from a hamstring issue and illness, having missed Forest’s last three matches in all competitions.\n\nUTR: Barkas; Horemans, Van De Hoorn, Viergever, El Karouani; Bozdogan, Ongena, De Wit; Rodriguez, Min, Cathline",

    "fullText": "Tourism in Portugal has reached record numbers over the past two years, with over 31 million visitors in 2024.\n\nAlthough the coastal wonders of the Algarve region and the historic castles of Sintra are often a selling point for tourists, I took the seven-hour trip for reasons unrelated to wanderlust.\n\nPortimão, Portugal, is the home of Afro Nation, the biggest annual Afrobeats festival in the world — and this summer, I was one of the 40,000 festival-goers in attendance.\n\nThough dancing on the stunning beaches of Portugal to the sounds of Burna Boy and Tems live was definitely a bucket-list experience that I wouldn't have traded for the world, I'm not sure it's one I would repeat.\n\nDon't get me wrong: This realization had nothing to do with a lackluster experience. There is nothing dull about being serenaded by a shirtless Damini, and there was nothing disappointing about Portugal, either.\n\nInstead, I left feeling like I hadn't visited Portugal at all, but rather that I attended an event that just happened to be there.\n\nSomewhere between day two and day three, it hit me: I was in Portugal, but I wasn't really seeing the country.\n\nMy days weren't spent wandering tiled alleyways or eating salted cod by the water. Instead, I spent all my downtime resting at my resort, ordering food, getting dressed, and then heading back onto the beach — not for a swim, but for another 12 hours of music.\n\nThe experience wasn't exactly cheap, either. Aside from the nearly $600 I spent on the festival tickets, food and drinks were expensive at the venue, and rideshare trips cost more than I'd planned on spending, probably due to the crowds.\n\nI don't regret what I spent on the experience, but I did find myself thinking about what it would have been like to spend that money at a Lisbon flea market or on a cooking class, learning how to make pastel de nata from a local.\n\nThe beach could've been in Miami. The resort could've been in Cancún. The only Portuguese thing about my trip was the exchange rate.\n\nI did have two days after the festival ended to explore Lisbon, but it wasn't nearly enough time. I was exhausted after three days of standing on my feet and singing along, and after all of the rideshares we had purchased, both my feet and my wallet needed a break.\n\nOnce I got home, I noticed that my Instagram feed was flooded with other people's Portugal trips: sunsets on sailboats in Portimão, wine in Porto, mist hanging over Sintra's castles.\n\nI felt like they'd gotten to see Portugal. I'd gotten to see a festival that happened to be hosted there.\n\nI don't regret my trip — Afro Nation itself was unforgettable. I loved the music, the chaos, the feeling of being surrounded by a global community all singing Burna Boy under the same sky.\n\nIn an ideal world, I'd be able to go back to Afro Nation with an extra three or four days to actually roam. However, extra days meant extra costs for food, accommodations, and the experiences I was so desperate to have — and unfortunately, I didn't have unlimited PTO.\n\nI learned that my idea of a perfect trip doesn't center on an international festival or specific experience. I don't want to cross an ocean just to stand in a crowd.\n\nMy version of travel definitely includes sun, sand, and bottomless drinks, but also curiosity. I want to wander, learn, and actually see where I am.\n\nI'd say that Portugal is still on my travel bucket list — though I went, I barely touched it. Next time, I'm not going for a stage on the beach. I'm going for the country.",

    "fullText": "Since I was a child, receiving holiday cards has been one of my favorite parts of December.\n\nI love seeing the snapshots families choose to represent their year and reading the little updates that I don't get on social media.\n\nWhen I was in my 20s, I wanted to start sending my own, but I felt I had to wait for traditional milestones — like getting married and having kids — before it would feel \"appropriate.\"\n\nIn my mind, holiday cards seemed like a privilege reserved for conventional lives.\n\nAs the years went by, I continued to see stories about unmarried, single, or child-free women sending holiday cards that poked fun at their status. They'd pose with sad faces and wine bottles or include clever quips about being alone once again.\n\nEvery year, without fail, someone would send me these articles as if I could relate, but I couldn't. To each their own, of course, but I never saw my life as something to be made fun of, and I definitely didn't feel sorry for myself.\n\nSo, I created a new holiday card tradition — one that celebrates my beautiful and full life.\n\nAs I neared 30, I started doing a lot of solo traveling and set the goal of visiting all 63 major US national parks on my own by the time I turned 40.\n\nThough I was posting some of my trips on social media, I also wanted to share them more personally with my friends and family.\n\nFinally, I decided to print a holiday card featuring a photo from a summer trip I took to Canada — a simple shot of my backpack overlooking the mountains of Banff National Park.\n\nI hesitated for a while before mailing them, worried that friends and family might find it narcissistic or odd to receive a card with only me in it.\n\nHowever, many who received the card reached out to express their love for the photo and how happy they were to get it in the mail.\n\nI've kept the tradition going ever since — for nearly 10 years now, through my entire 30s, I've sent a card filled with my favorite photos from the year's solo adventures.\n\nFriends and family often ask well in advance if they're still on my mailing list and tell me how much they look forward to receiving them.\n\nFor me, sharing these more personal photos — the ones I cherish most — in a tangible, intimate way has become a highlight of the season.\n\nCreating the cards each year makes me feel empowered, proud of my accomplishments, and confident in the life I've chosen.\n\nMore than anything, it's a reminder that holiday cards can celebrate joy, connection, and the version of life you're proud to live — however unconventional it may be.",

    "description": "After 15 years as a digital nomad, Kaisu Koskela went on her first cruise. She found it both exciting and overwhelming.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kaisu Koskela, 48, a postdoctoral researcher on digital nomads. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a digital nomad for 15 years, so Nomad Cruise had been on my radar for a while. What began a decade ago as a relocation cruise for remote workers has grown into something much bigger — twice-yearly trips that feel like floating community conferences.\n\nAs a researcher and policy advisor on digital nomadism, I was especially curious. After some deliberation, my partner and I booked the 27-day Pacific crossing from Seattle to Sydney.\n\nNeither of us had ever been on a cruise before. It felt exciting, but also overwhelming.\n\nSomething was always happening: talks on life and work, meetups, and workshops. All of that was just the nomad program. The ship added even more, from cabaret shows to talks on local history. We also had full days ashore in places like Honolulu and Samoa.\n\nStarlink WiFi made working easy, and I met people in all kinds of fields, from AI to videography. But it was a long route, and no one was overly focused on productivity, including me.\n\nI'd planned to finish an article but never got to it, and honestly, I didn't mind. I was there for the experience.\n\nThe 230 passengers felt like a true snapshot of the nomad world. The youngest passenger was 23, and the oldest was in their 60s, but the majority were in their 30s.\n\nThe cruise is set up as a peer-learning conference: passengers give talks and share their expertise for free. I spoke about digital nomad visas and helped people one-on-one afterward. In return, before I got onstage a performance coach prepped me for my talk, and a designer explained a confusing part of my chart. Everyone gave something.\n\nI was surprised by how many passengers weren't nomads yet. They'd come for inspiration. Some were so enamored by the idea of location independence that they quit their jobs on the spot, pushed over the edge by burnout and encouraged by others to go freelance and build something of their own.\n\nA common theme kept coming up: Don't stay tied to an employer who's breaking you down.\n\nAs the days passed, we created more together. In the first week, someone formed a choir. I joined, and we rehearsed on every sea day before performing a full concert with professional lights and sound. I've had to sacrifice very little to be a digital nomad, but singing in a choir is off the table. Having one of my hobbies back for a month felt incredible.\n\nMeetups took off just as easily. I posted one for speed puzzling and ended up playing with a group that included someone who'd competed in the World Puzzling Championship. What started as a fangirl moment became real technique training.\n\nThe community was big enough that no matter how niche the interest, someone else shared it.\n\nLife onboard was easy — the staff were wonderful, and the vibe felt warm. But being a \"cruise tourist\" on land felt different\n\nVanuatu, an island archipelago in the South Pacific, was our final stop. It was also a new country for me. There, we were dropped on an otherwise uninhabited island where bars and food stalls had been set up just for us. Technically, I've now been to Vanuatu, but I had no contact with local life. I didn't love that.\n\nCruise stops are short; you're usually back onboard by 4:30 p.m. Early in the trip, after docking in Hawaii, we rushed around Maui trying to see everything. It felt pointless, a YouTube video would've given me the same overview.\n\nWe'd cracked the formula by the time we reached Savusavu in Fiji. It was a real town with a market, and we just wandered, with no agenda. I preferred those stops; even a tiny slice of local life beats racing through a checklist.\n\nThe remoteness of the Pacific was surreal. Seattle to Hawaii took a week; Hawaii to Samoa took another 16 days with no land, no ships — just ocean and the occasional pod of dolphins.\n\nThere was even a Crossing the Line ceremony for first-time equator crossers. We had to kiss a fish and jump into the pool. I loved it.\n\nNomad Cruise was expensive — €4,300, or about $5,000 each — so we thought hard before booking. We chose a basic cabin with a window and ate like royalty.\n\nAlcohol was extra, though happy hour made wine about $6 a glass. Onboard purchases came with an automatic 18% tip, plus a crew appreciation fee of about $17 per day. But reaching these destinations on our own would've cost more, and once we were on the ship, I stopped thinking about money; everything felt free.\n\nLeaving after a month on the cruise felt surreal; the community bubble was hard to step out of. I loved the people, the sunsets, and even the small things like watching the weather and birdlife change across the ocean.\n\nI'm sure I'll cross paths and deepen connections with some of the people I met on board. We shared something special.",
