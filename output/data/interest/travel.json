    "fullText": "Planning a Caribbean vacation? The US State Department wants you to know how safe your destination is before you board your flight.\n\nThe Caribbean has long been a popular vacation destination thanks to its beautiful natural sights, yearlong tropical weather, and calm turquoise beaches.\n\nWhile traveling to one of the Caribbean's islands and its coasts in South, Central, and North America, tourists can explore historic sites that document the region's colonial and pre-colonial days, enjoy cultural enrichment during carnivals or local holidays, and indulge in an array of cuisines that combine indigenous, African, and European influences.\n\nThe US State Department has issued travel advisories for some countries in the region, advising Americans to exercise caution when visiting. Amid an increased US military presence in the region, travelers may also be wondering if it's wise to travel there.\n\nThe agency uses four levels of travel guidance to know what to expect in each country:\n\nAs of December 12, 21 countries around the world are designated \"do not travel,\" mostly because of ongoing armed conflicts.\n\nIn the Caribbean, only Haiti and Venezuela have an advisory Level 4, along with some parts of Mexico, Jamaica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Colombia.\n\nAcross the Caribbean — which we have defined widely, including every country with a Caribbean coast in South, Central, and North America — levels of safety and resources can vary, and travelers should be aware of the specific conditions of the country or territory they intend to visit.\n\nWe looked at the travel advisories and information for every country in the Caribbean. Here's everything you need to know about your tropical destination before planning your next getaway.\n\nRebecca Harrington and Michelle Mark contributed to an earlier version of this story.\n\nWhile the US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, it advises travelers to exercise caution when driving, as the roads can be in poor condition. Additionally, it notes that medical facilities on the island fall below US standards.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the popular cruise-ship destination, but it advises travelers on the country information page to be \"extremely careful when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads.\"\n\nIt also notes that medical facilities on the island don't meet US standards, and divers facing decompression illness need to be evacuated from the island as it does not have a hyperbaric chamber.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be warned that local \"indecency statutes\" criminalize \"consensual same-sex sexual activity between adult men\" with a maximum sentence of up to 15 years, according to the US State Department. LGBTQ+ couples married outside the island also do not enjoy spousal rights or privileges when visiting Antigua and Barbuda.\n\nThe agency also says that mosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are prevalent in the islands.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch island, but warns that \"access to quality medical care is limited,\" and in cases of decompression sickness, divers need medical evacuation from the island as it does not have a decompression chamber.\n\nMosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are also prevalent in the island, and the CDC recommends the use of \"mosquito repellents and insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\"\n\nWhile crime isn't a particular concern there, theft is the main offense committed against tourists. The department suggests securing personal property in public areas, hotel rooms, and cars.\n\nThe US State Department advises travelers to the island chain to remain cautious, as violent crimes — like armed robberies and sexual assaults — can \"occur anywhere in the Bahamas.\"\n\nIt also notes that a majority of crime occurs in the islands of New Providence and Grand Bahama, and warns to stay alert in the \"Over the Hill\" area in Nassau, south of Shirley Street, where gangs have been reported to have murdered residents.\n\nThe department also warns about unsafe, unregulated tourist watercraft, such as boat tours, and the potential of sexual assault by Jet Ski operators. US government employees are prohibited from using Jet Skis and watercraft rented from independent operators on New Providence and Paradise islands.\n\nIt also advises travelers to be wary of weather alerts and notes that the island's hurricane season generally runs from June through November.\n\nThe US State Department lists Barbados at Level 1 but warns that \"crimes of opportunity\" and violent crimes occur occasionally, advising the use of the same personal security measures as in any major US city.\n\nIt also notes that travelers should \"exercise extra vigilance at night on party cruises and in the downtown area.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that, while rarely enforced, consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized on the island, and they can be penalized with up to life imprisonment.\n\nMosquito-borne diseases, such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, are also prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department warns of violent crime, including \"sexual assault, home invasions, armed robberies, and murder,\" which it says \n\"are common even during the day and in tourist areas,\" and can be gang-related.\n\nBelize City has a travel advisory Level 3, and the agency suggests that US citizens should avoid traveling to the city, which has historically seen much of the country's violent crime in its south side. The area, defined as Haulover Creek Canal and extending south to Fabers Road, \"does not overlap with the typical tourism areas,\" the agency said.\n\nMuch of the crime in the city, and in the country, is gang-related, and local police don't have resources to look into serious crimes, so most go \"unresolved and unprosecuted,\" the US State Department wrote.\n\nThe department said it also discourages driving at night due to poor road conditions, frequently unavailable road assistance, and unreliable phone reception in remote areas.\n\nDiseases like malaria, dengue, Zika, leishmaniasis, and NWS (New World Screwworm) are also prevalent in the country, and medical care, while generally available in urban areas, can be hard to access in rural and remote areas.\n\nThe agency also warns that many hotels aren't equipped with carbon monoxide detectors, and that US citizens have died from poisoning from the gas.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch islands, which it assesses as low-crime areas with responsible police sources and a high level of social control in its small population. The most common crimes are usually \"non-violent, financially-motivated, and opportunistic in nature,\" like pickpocketing and theft of unattended belongings.\n\nUS travelers are advised to use caution when driving in the islands, as roads can be \"slippery during rainfall,\" wild animals often cross roads, and in Saba, roads can be steep and have sharp turns.\n\nThere is limited access to quality medical care in the islands, and facilities do not always meet US health and service standards.\n\nThe CDC also recommends using mosquito repellents and sleeping under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, but notes that drivers should be attentive on the road as \"speeding and reckless driving are fairly common.\" Nighttime drag racing and livestock crossing are also common.\n\nWhile the British Virgin Islands don't have particularly high crime, crimes of opportunity and violent crimes occur occasionally, and travelers are advised to use the same personal security measures they would in any major US city.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have also been reported.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island chain, which is a British territory, and says the islands have \"low rates of criminal activity affecting tourists,\" although crimes like pickpocketing and purse snatchings still happen occasionally.\n\nZika, chikungunya, and dengue fever are also prevalent, and the CDC recommends the use of insect repellents.\n\nThe US State Department warns of crime, terrorism, unrest, and kidnapping throughout Colombia and asks visitors to reconsider travel to the country. Terrorists operate in some areas, and violent crime is possible, the agency says.\n\nParts of the country are a Level 4 advisory, with the agency recommending Americans don't travel to Arauca, Cauca (except Popayan); Chocó (except Nuquí); Nariño; and Norte de Santander (except Cucuta) because of crime and terrorism.\n\nThe country's border with Venezuela is also at a Level 4 advisory, and the agency advises avoiding the area altogether to prevent accidental crossings into Venezuela, as the border isn't clearly marked. The department says that Americans should not travel to this region \"for any reason,\" since crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict are common in the area.\n\nEven in public and in affluent neighborhoods, well-organized crime can occur, the agency says. Americans are also targeted by terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them, per the State Department.\n\nDating apps and internet romance scams are also common, and the department advises being cautious when meeting with strangers.\n\nTravelers are advised against hailing taxis on the street, and US government employees are prohibited from doing so, as US citizens have been killed during robberies on hailed street taxis.\n\nThe agency also advises against participating in ayahuasca \"spiritual cleansing\" practices using psychedelic drugs illegal in the US, because \"people claiming to be shamans or spiritual practitioners are neither licensed nor regulated,\" and there are risks of robbery, assault, illness, or death while intoxicated.\n\nAdequate healthcare facilities are available throughout the country; the agency warns that healthcare in rural areas may be below US standards, and tap water is not safe to drink in these areas.\n\nCommon diseases include COVID-19, dengue, chikungunya, malaria, Yellow Fever, and Zika. Using mosquito repellents and sleeping under nets is suggested.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread petty and violent crime, like armed robbery, homicide, and sexual assault, affecting tourists, and recommends increased caution when traveling to the country. The agency strongly advises against taking public buses due to the threat of pickpocketing.\n\nIt also warns of dangerous rip currents in Costa Rica and notes that most beaches lack lifeguards or \"warnings about unsafe conditions.\" In July, \"The Cosby Show\" star Malcolm-Jamal Warner drowned while visiting the country.\n\nThe agency also advises against participation in spiritual ceremonies or rituals involving hallucinogens like ayahuasca or kambo, which are \"not regulated by the Costa Rican Ministry of Health and are illegal in the US.\"  The agency says Americans have been victims of \"sexual assault, serious injury, and theft\" while intoxicated with the substances, and recommends using \"extreme caution\" if they choose to participate in such ceremonies.\n\nSome travelers have reported tainted alcohol causing serious health issues, the agency added.\n\nMedical care in San José is \"usually good;\" the department warns that quality services outside the city may be limited. Tap water is often unsafe to drink in the country.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and malaria are prevalent.\n\nCosta Rica is also prone to a variety of natural disasters as an active earthquake and volcanic zone, with three volcanoes that have become more active in recent years. Tsunamis can also occur after significant earthquakes.\n\nFlash floods and severe landslides are common during the rainy season, from April to October, in the Limon, Puntarenas, and Guanacaste provinces.\n\nBetween January and the end of May, wildfires are also common throughout Costa Rica, particularly in Guanacaste and the northern region of the country.\n\nThe US State Department advises that travelers maintain an increased level of caution due to crime and an unreliable power grid. Petty crime, including pickpocketing, purse snatching, and car break-ins, is common, and violent crime like armed robbery, murder, and home invasions is also on the rise, the department said.\n\nUS law also prohibits tourist travel to Cuba, and travelers must comply with OFAC licensing requirements, which establish different categories for permitted travel, such as educational activities, humanitarian projects, or visiting family.\n\nTravelers should avoid demonstrations, as peaceful assembly and free speech are not protected, and protests can often trigger government responses. The agency also warns that the Cuban government has detained US citizens for activities that are not criminal in the US.\n\nScams on dating apps and internet romance schemes are common, it added. Internet and phone communication can also be compromised while visiting the island, as \"there is no expectation of privacy in Cuba,\" per the department, which advises the use of VPNs and avoiding connecting to public WiFi networks.\n\nRoads can be hazardous due to poor lighting, aging vehicles, and unpredictable nighttime conditions, and the department discourages using overcrowded public buses or unregulated taxis.\n\nThe agency warns that ambulances \"are not present throughout the country and can be unreliable where available,\" and they're not usually equipped with up-to-date medical equipment. The agency recommends travelers bring basic over-the-counter medication, as shortages are widespread throughout the island.\n\nAir quality can be poor on the island, and tap water is not safe to drink. The agency recommends opting for bottled water, asking for drinks without ice, washing hands often, and avoiding uncooked or undercooked food.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, COVID-19, Oropouche, hepatitis A, and traveler's diarrhea are prevalent.\n\nTravelers should also be aware that between May and November, the island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch territory, but notes that nonviolent crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, are common in areas like beaches, hotel lobbies, and cars.\n\nInstances of violent crime, although not common, often take place in more isolated areas of the island, like remote beaches or nature areas, where thefts and assaults have been reported.\n\nZika, dengue, and chikungunya are prevalent, and the CDC recommends the use of mosquito repellents and insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for Dominica, but notes that crimes of opportunity, violent, and drug-related crime occur occasionally.\n\nThe department also advises caution when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads, as roads in the country tend to be in \"average to poor condition.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that consensual same-sex conduct is illegal on the island, and local laws do not protect against sexual-orientation-based discrimination.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have been reported on the island.\n\nThe agency also warns that medical facilities on the island do not meet US standards, and there is \"limited ambulance service.\"\n\nThe US State Department warns of violent crime, including armed robbery, homicide, and sexual assault. The agency also says that while the country has its own tourist police force and that resort areas are generally safer, urban areas like Santo Domingo aren't very well-policed, and drugs, weapons, and criminal justice systems are a concern throughout the country.\n\nThe agency advises against wearing expensive jewelry and warns of dating app or internet romance scams.\n\nWhile prostitution under certain circumstances is legal in the country, the agency warns US citizens against hiring prostitutes or escort services, as \"disagreements over price and claims of mistreatment\" can result in police involvement.\n\nPrevalent diseases include dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis, and \"public clinics lack basic resources and supplies,\" the agency said. It also notes that \"many US citizens have suffered serious complications or died during cosmetic or other elective surgeries in the Dominican Republic.\"\n\nTap water in many areas is not safe to drink, and the agency suggests requesting bottled water and no ice in drinks.\n\nThe country has the highest road-crash-related mortality rate in the world, the agency says, and travelers should drive with extreme caution or consider hiring a professional driver. Shared buses are available, but they do not always meet US safety standards.\n\nDue to security concerns, the agency advises against using unregulated taxis and buses, as well as hailing taxis off the street.\n\nThe island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes between May and November, and flooding often occurs without warning during heavy rainfall. The country is also prone to earthquakes.\n\nThe agency also warns of life-threatening currents and advises against swimming alone.\n\nAfter years of higher-risk warnings, the US State Department now lists El Salvador at Level 1, citing a decrease in violent crime and gang activity over the past three years.\n\nThe US prohibits government employees from traveling between cities or departments at night and from using public buses due to concerns over infrastructure and criminal activity.\n\nSince 2022, El Salvador has been under a \"State of Exception\" in response to gang violence, allowing local authorities to arrest anyone suspected of being involved in gang activity — including several US and foreign citizens — and suspending \"several constitutional rights,\" like the right to a fair and speedy trial, the agency notes.\n\nWhile no alerts are active for the country, the agency suggests exercising caution and warns that the \"crime threat level in El Salvador is high,\" citing common crimes like robbery, car theft, and sexual assault. \"Most serious crimes in El Salvador are never solved,\" the department says.\n\nThe country has a police force dedicated to tourists in 19 popular destinations, but the agency advises against remote hikes or hiring guides.\n\nThe agency warns of the risks of surfing in the country's Pacific Coast, which has made El Salvador a popular surfing destination. The currents \"can be dangerous, even for skilled swimmers,\" the department said, and the country has limited search-and-rescue capabilities.\n\nEl Salvador also has severe penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs, which might include THC and CBD products legally sold in the US.\n\nNatural disasters also occur occasionally in the country, which has 21 active volcanoes and experiences frequent earthquakes. Flooding and mudslides are common during the rainy season.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that while same-sex sexual relations aren't restricted in the country, there is \"widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" the department said, including by public officials and police, who have been involved in violence against LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nQuality care is available in San Salvador, but medical care can be limited outside the city, per the agency.\n\nPrevalent diseases include dengue, diarrheal illness, chikungunya, and Zika\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the French West Indies, which include the islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy.

The agency advises travelers to exercise the level of caution that they would in any major US city.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law \"criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activities between men,\" with up to 10 years imprisonment, the agency says. Although prosecutions are rare, Grenadian society is considered to be \"generally intolerant of same-sex sexual conduct,\" it noted.\n\nDuring hurricane season, from June 1 to November 30, travelers are advised to monitor local weather and be prepared for potential threats, including earthquakes and tsunamis, since the island is located in a seismic zone.\n\nVisitors should drive slowly and with caution, as the roads are usually narrow and winding and often lack proper signage, according to the agency.\n\nThe department also notes that medical care in Grenada is \"below US standards\" and that dengue is prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread crime, including violent crime like armed robbery, murder, and gang activity, particularly in Guatemala City, Escuintla, Chiquimula, Izabal, and Petén. The agency advises reconsidering travel to the country.\n\nSome areas, including the departments of San Marcos and Huehuetenango, and parts of Guatemala City like Zone 18 and Villa Nueva, have a travel advisory of Level 4: Do Not Travel due to increased crime.\n\n\"While tourists are not usually targeted, they can still be victims of opportunistic crime,\" the agency says, and local police — which have a dedicated force to protect tourists in popular destinations — often lack the resources to respond effectively.\n\nTourists are advised against wearing expensive jewelry or using cellphones in public. Internet romance and dating app scams are common and can often target US citizens.\n\nRoad travel after dark is discouraged due to poor lighting and a high accident risk. Public transportation, especially \"chicken buses\" and unregulated taxis, can be unsafe, the agency said.\n\nTravelers should also avoid swimming in the Pacific Ocean because the currents and undertow can be dangerously strong, and lifeguards aren't always available.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that discrimination and harassment are common throughout the country.\n\nMedical care in Guatemala City is generally adequate, but facilities elsewhere often lack basic supplies.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria, and COVID-19 are present, and tap water is unsafe to drink, including ice made from non-potable water.\n\nAir pollution is also an issue in major cities, and travelers should monitor for altitude effects in high-elevation areas.\n\nThe US State Department warns of extreme crime, kidnapping, civil unrest, terrorist activity, and a total collapse of public security in the country. The agency emphasizes that it cannot provide emergency assistance in Haiti and advises against all travel to the country. US airlines are not operating commercial flights to Haiti due to the substantial threats to travelers.\n\nIn late August, the country declared a state of emergency across many districts due to gang violence. Kidnapping is widespread and often violent, with US citizens among the victims, the department said.\n\nDemonstrations and roadblocks are frequent and unpredictable, and clashes between gangs and security forces routinely involve gunfire. The agency notes that stray bullets present a significant threat to visitors, even if they aren't involved with armed conflict.\n\nRoad conditions are dangerous, traffic is chaotic, and public transportation is unsafe, according to the agency.\n\nLGBTQ+ individuals and women may face targeted harassment or violence, and consular support is unavailable.\n\nThe State Department warns that medical facilities lack basic supplies, emergency response is nearly nonexistent, and essential resources, including water, fuel, and electricity, are severely limited Diseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria, cholera, and Zika are prevalent.\n\nThe country is also vulnerable to hurricanes during the season that runs from June 1 to November 30, during which roads often become impassable.\n\nThe US State Department warns of violent crime, including homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and gang activity, throughout Honduras. The easternmost department, Gracias a Dios, is a Level 4: Do Not Travel area due to narcotics trafficking, limited security presence, and poor infrastructure.\n\nSince 2022, the country has been under a state of national emergency in response to the high crime rate.\n\nTourist areas like the Bay Islands and Copan Ruins \"have a higher concentration of law enforcement resources,\" the agency said, but drug-related crimes remain a concern in the region.\n\nRoad conditions are hazardous, especially at night, with poor lighting, landslides, and frequent accidents. Carjackings occur along major highways, and the agency warns against using public transportation or hailing taxis on the street.\n\nWhile no laws prohibit same-sex relationships, LGBTQ+ travelers often face discrimination, and crimes committed against LGBTQ+ individuals often go unpunished. The agency advises LGBTQ+ travelers to \"exercise caution, especially when expressing affection in public.\"\n\nMedical facilities \"often do not meet US standards,\" the agency said. Dengue is widespread, and diseases like chikungunya, malaria, and Zika are prevalent. Tap water is not safe to drink, and air pollution can reach hazardous levels during the dry season.\n\nThe country is also vulnerable to hurricanes, heavy rain, and flooding, especially between June and November.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread violent crime — including armed robbery, sexual assault, and homicide — and notes that serious incidents can occur even inside gated resorts. Some neighborhoods in Kingston, Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, and other parishes are at an advisory of Level 4: Do Not Travel due to what the agency calls persistent gang violence.\n\nIt also notes that the country has one of the highest homicide rates in the Western Hemisphere. Tourists tend to experience a lower rate of crime than in other parts of the country, the agency said.\n\nHurricane Melissa also caused significant damage in late 2025, and the agency advises confirming transportation and lodging availability before travel, as services may remain disrupted, especially in areas such as Black River and Montego Bay, which were heavily impacted by the storm.\n\nTravelers should avoid secluded areas, including at resorts, remain in groups, and avoid displaying valuables.\n\nRoad conditions vary widely throughout the island; nighttime driving is hazardous, and carjackings and accidents are common.\n\nEmergency response can be slow, and medical care outside major cities is limited, according to the agency.\n\nScams are common here, the agency says, warning that LGBTQ+ individuals may face targeted violence, including assaults arranged through dating apps.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that local law specifically prohibits \"any kind of physical intimacy between persons of the same sex, in public or in private,\" with up to 10 years in prison, and \"consensual same-sex sexual conduct between men\" is also outlawed. LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination and assault, the agency said.\n\nDiseases like COVID-19, dengue, chikungunya, and HIV are present, and the CDC recommends the use of mosquito repellents and sleeping under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department warns of terrorism, violent crime, kidnapping, and cartel activity throughout Mexico.\n\nStates like Colima, Guerrero, Michoacán, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas are Level 4: Do Not Travel due to extreme violence, roadblocks, and targeted killings. The agency particularly warns against travel to Tamaulipas due to the threat of organized crime activity and kidnapping.\n\nOther states are Level 3: Reconsider Travel, and only the Gulf states of Campeche and Yucatán are Level 1: Exercise normal precautions.\n\nCrimes like armed robbery, extortion, and sexual assault occur in both tourist and non-tourist areas, and the agency notes that \"emergency services may be limited or unavailable in remote or rural areas.\" Travelers should avoid hailing taxis on the street, use only vetted transport, and avoid intercity driving at night due to risks of crime and unreliable road conditions.\n\nScams, including virtual kidnappings, romance schemes, banking fraud, and timeshare scams, are also common.\n\nThe agency also notes that carbon monoxide incidents have resulted in tourist deaths since many hotels and vacation rentals lack detectors.\n\nMexico is also prone to earthquakes and tsunamis, and hurricanes and tropical storms often take place between May and November.\n\nMedical care is generally good in major cities, but complications are frequent in travelers seeking elective procedures, such as plastic surgery.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria, and Zika are present in the country.\n\nThe US State Department warns of \"arbitrary enforcement of laws, risk of wrongful detention, civil unrest, limited healthcare availability,\" and crime. The government, which the agency describes as authoritarian, has detained US citizens, restricted entry or exit without explanation, confiscated property, and monitored digital activity.\n\nViolent crime, including sexual assault and armed robbery, occurs, and roadblocks and paramilitary groups can restrict movement and extort travelers. The Nicaraguan government may also monitor social media accounts for content that is \"critical of the government, controversial, or that might involve illegal activity,\" the agency said.\n\nBeaches can have dangerous currents and undertows, and hiking around volcanoes requires hiring local guides by law. Travelers should maintain emergency supplies, avoid nighttime travel, and only use licensed taxis recommended by trusted sources like airports and hotels due to unsafe conditions on public transportation.\n\nMedical care outside Managua is extremely limited, and even the capital's facilities may lack emergency resources. Ambulance services are unreliable, tap water is not potable, and diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, typhoid fever, pneumonia, leptospirosis, and rabies are present.\n\nThe country is prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, landslides, and volcanic eruptions. Travelers should have emergency plans, as remote locations may lack cellphone coverage.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, but notes that petty crimes and violent crimes still occur occasionally. Travelers are advised to use the level of caution they would in any major US city and stay aware of their surroundings, especially when visiting more isolated areas.\n\nChikungunya and dengue are present on the island.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the islands, but notes that petty theft, break-ins, and incidents of violent and drug-related crime occasionally occur. Travelers should use the personal security measures they would in any major US city.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law criminalizes \"consensual same-sex activity between men\" with a penalty of up to 10 years in prison, although enforcement of this law is relaxed, according to the agency. While the law \"does not prohibit sexual activity between women,\" it also doesn't prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have been reported in the islands.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island, but notes that crimes of opportunity, violent and drug-related crimes occur occasionally, and suggests using the same level of caution as in any major US city.\n\nThe department also notes that medical facilities in the island \"do not meet US standards,\" and that major roads are in \"average to poor condition,\" so travelers should \"be extremely careful when driving.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law criminalizes \"consensual same-sex sexual activity\" with penalties of up to 10 years in prison, and there is no legislation protecting people from \"discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" per the agency.\n\nChikungunya, dengue, and Zika are present.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island chain, but notes that it can be vulnerable to natural disasters.\n\nLocated on the north of Saint Vincent, La Soufriere is an active volcano that the agency says \"poses a constant threat.\" In mid-April 2021, it erupted nearly every day, forcing nearby communities to evacuate.\n\nEarthquakes, which are also often associated with volcanic activity, can occur \"at any time,\" the agency said. The islands can be impacted by hurricanes and storms between May and November.\n\nThe department also notes that medical facilities fall below US standards, and that since there isn't a hyperbaric chamber on the islands, divers suffering decompression illness require evacuation.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law criminalizes \"consensual same-sex sexual activity\" with sentences of up to 10 years in prison, and there is no legislation protecting people from \"discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" the agency said.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are present.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Netherlands territory.

Political rallies occur often and often turn violent as police and security forces use tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against participants.\n\nTerrorist groups often target places frequented by tourists, like hotels and restaurants, shopping centers, and public transportation.\n\nShortages of gasoline, electricity, food, medicine, and medical supplies are widespread, and public hospitals lack basic resources like water, medications, and staff. Even private facilities are strained, and medical evacuation is difficult and expensive.Those who decide to disregard the advisory and travel to Venezuela are advised to prepare a will, consider hiring professional security during their stay, and develop communication plans with family in case of kidnapping or detention, the State Department said.\n\nThe agency emphasizes that there is \"no safe way to travel to Venezuela,\" and notes that the area within 50 miles of the entire Venezuela-Colombia border is \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\nThe agency advises against using public transport and driving defensively on the roads, which are often poorly marked. Traffic jams in Caracas are often exploited by armed motorcycle gangs to rob drivers.\n\nInternet scams, like romance schemes and relative targeting, are common in the country.\n\nTap water is unsafe to drink even in major cities, and shortages in running water are frequent. Diseases like dengue, Zika, chikungunya, malaria, Chagas disease, measles, travelers' diarrhea, and other infectious illnesses are prevalent.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace in what promises to be an entertaining Premier League affair later this afternoon.\n\nThe Cityzens will be out for vengeance after falling to the Eagles in the 2024/25 FA Cup final, but Palace have proven they’re no pushovers this season.\n\nNevertheless, City head into the game in remarkable form, having won four consecutive games in all competitions, most recently claiming a 2-1 Champions League win against familiar foes Real Madrid.\n\nLos Blancos got off to a fine start when Rodrygo broke the deadlock just before the half-hour mark, but goals from Nico O’Reilly and Erling Braut Haaland helped City turn the game on its head.\n\nBefore that fixture, City had seen off Leeds United, Fulham, and Sunderland to keep pace with Arsenal at the Premier League summit.\n\nThe Gunners extended their lead with a 2-1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, so it’s up to City to respond, but it may not be straightforward.\n\nCity have a dominant record against Palace. They’ve won four of their last seven league meetings with the Eagles (D3), but the FA Cup final is proof that Palace have what it takes to halt their momentum.\n\nThe last time Pep Guardiola made sweeping changes to his starting line-up, City paid the price with a 2-0 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nSince then, the Spaniard has made it a habit of keeping the core of the squad intact, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he makes just one change to his starting XI against Palace.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma is guaranteed to retain his place in goal ahead of out-of-favour James Trafford, while a back four of O’Reilly, Josko Gvardiol, Ruben Dias, and Mathues Nunes should also remain intact.\n\nThe minor tweak expected should come in midfield, although Nico Gonzalez is expected to keep his place while Rodri continues his recovery.\n\nTijjani Reijnders should come in for Bernardo Silva, who wasn’t at his best against Madrid.\n\nThe 31-year-old’s 6/10 performance might be a sign of fatigue, so Reijnders, who has notched seven goal contributions (two goals and five assists), could get a chance.\n\nThe Dutchman will likely be joined by Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki, and Phil Foden, while Haaland leads the line.",

    "description": "I wanted my family of five to travel more, so I created budgeting strategies to take more vacations. I know when to splurge and when to save.",
    "fullText": "I used to scroll through friends' glamorous-looking vacation photos and feel a familiar pang, knowing there was no way my family could afford trips like that. But I didn't want to stew in jealousy, so I decided to figure out how we could travel more on our budget.\n\nSince some of my favorite travel memories aren't from far-off places but from day adventures or quick weekend trips, I learned to prioritize them in our calendar. Mini vacations are cheaper — no flights, rental cars, time off work, or dog sitters needed, since we generally bring our dog on these trips or leave her with the neighbor.\n\nWe live in Arizona, so we schedule hiking excursions with friends to Sedona's Red Rocks or other scenic areas at least once every few months. We also visit my parents, who live an hour and a half north of us, enjoying their cooler weather and small-town charm.\n\nHowever, I don't want my family to miss out on exploring beyond our little bubble, so my next tactical move was to maximize credit card points.\n\nI'd earned free flights and hotels before, but my friend showed me I had more to learn.\n\nOver the past two years, I've signed up for credit cards when the point offers looked too good to pass up. I often book under my friend's referral link, so we both earn bonuses. My husband then signs up using mine, and we add each other as authorized users, often for extra points.\n\nI currently have nine credit cards. It sounds intimidating, but it's manageable as I never add more than one sign-up bonus at a time. Closing cards can ding your credit score, so I phase them out slowly.\n\nSome, though, I'll keep long-term, like my Sapphire card with its zero foreign transaction fees and great travel partners, and my Southwest card, which allows me to book flights with my Rapid Rewards points and offers one free checked bag for myself and up to eight guests.\n\nBecause the Sapphire card's points can be transferred to Southwest, I was able to combine them and book a flight for my family of five to Washington, D.C., this summer. The flight cost me 130,000 Rapid Rewards points, which is about $1,300. The only thing I paid out of pocket was the $56 in security fees. Then I used 78,914 introductory points from my husband's new Sapphire Chase card, valued at $788, to pay for half of our five-night hotel stay in Georgetown. In total, I saved around $2000.\n\nOne caveat: I always pay my credit cards off monthly. I want to be the one benefiting — not the credit card company.\n\nWe often split hotels or Airbnbs with family or friends. Sharing costs makes trips more economical and usually more fun. We plan meals together, too, when the place we're staying has a kitchen, which further cuts costs.\n\nI discovered that when new properties are listed on Airbnb, the first few stays are often discounted to drive more bookings and garner reviews. We've stayed in some upgraded places using this tactic. On an upcoming trip to Europe, I found a two-bedroom flat in London's city center with only a few reviews, offering a better deal at $970 for four nights, while many nearby properties were $1,300 or more.\n\nWhile in Europe, we plan to take trains to and from a few cities. I was shocked by train costs. That's how I found Omio, which helped me compare, purchase, and store tickets for train, bus, and ferry trips in one place, saving me time and money.\n\nWhen traveling, we rely on public transportation if the city is well-connected, only hopping in a rideshare or taxi if we are worn out. If we do need a rental car, I usually check a few companies to find the best deal, as rates can vary significantly.\n\nOn a seven-day trip to Maui in 2024, I found the best deal by booking directly with Alamo through my Sapphire rewards program. I secured a Chrysler Pacifica for 48,989 points, which equates to around $490.\n\nMy dad's vacation rule: splurge on a nice hotel for a few nights, then switch to budget options. Admittedly, I am scarred by that one cockroach-infested motel he booked when I was 11, so I never go too budget. Still, I like his thinking. If we're traveling to multiple cities, we often take this approach, staying in one nicer place and then offsetting it with something more budget-friendly in the next.\n\nEven with hacks, traveling is an expensive undertaking. Tucking money into a vacation fund every month helps, and staying strategic is key. For me, experiencing new places as a family is worth prioritizing.",

    "fullText": "NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip (AP) — Haneen al-Mabhouh, 34, sits in a wheelchair in her family home in Nuseirat, central Gaza, mourning the loss of her four daughters, including her 5-month-old baby, who were killed in an Israeli strike on her home last year. Al-Mabhouh also lost her leg in the attack and awaits permission to travel abroad for further treatment that could restore her mobility.\n\n“I dream of walking again, of holding a new baby, of rebuilding my family,” she said, her voice heavy with grief. For now, she relies on her parents for basic daily care and cannot even hold a pen.\n\nNearby, 23-year-old Yassin Marouf lies in a tent, his left foot amputated and his right leg severely injured after being hit by Israeli shelling in May. His brother was killed in the same attack, and Marouf struggles with basic movements. Doctors say his right leg may also need amputation unless he receives treatment outside the Palestinian territory.\n\n“If I want to go to the bathroom, I need two or three people to carry me,” he said.\n\nIn Gaza, thousands face similar challenges. Youssef al-Samri, 16, lost both legs while fetching water near his home after an Israeli airstrike in May. Displaced to a kindergarten in the al-Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, he navigates his world on his hands, relying on support to move through the classrooms where children play around him.\n\nTwelve-year-old Fadi al-Balbisi is learning to walk again with a prosthetic after losing his right leg to shelling in April. At Hamad Hospital in Zawaida, he practices with a prosthetic limb under the guidance of specialists, each step a hard-earned milestone toward regaining independence.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 5,000 to 6,000 people in Gaza have become amputees from the Israel-Hamas war, a quarter of them children. Many face long waits for prosthetics or medical evacuations abroad. Local centers, like the Artificial Limbs and Polio Center in Gaza City, are overwhelmed and have only limited supplies to provide artificial limbs.\n\nWhile a recent shipment of essential prosthetic materials has arrived in Gaza, the need remains critical. Patients like al-Mabhouh and Marouf face months-long waits for treatments that could prevent further amputations or restore mobility. Even with ceasefires in place, medical evacuations have been slow, hampered by bureaucratic and logistical barriers.\n\nIn the midst of this crisis, the lives of those affected are frozen in uncertainty. For al-Mabhouh, Marouf, al-Samri, and al-Balbisi, each day is a struggle for movement, dignity, and hope, as they navigate the aftermath of war with resilience and the faint promise of medical help.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "description": "After many arguments with my husband about when to leave for flights, we started arriving at the airport separately. This trick helped our marriage.",
    "fullText": "For the nine years we've been a couple, my husband and I have taken countless flights together.\n\nWe've visited family in the Carolinas, Tennessee, Montana, and Maryland. We've wandered around the Duomo in Florence, enjoyed tacos and tequila in Mexico City, and explored the breathtaking Normandy coastline.\n\nNow that we live in London, travel has ramped up. We're in our late 20s and early 30s, and wedding season has us flying back to the US on a near-monthly basis for our friends' nuptials … in addition to other scheduled trips.\n\nUnfortunately, we would get in a fight — almost every time — about what time to leave for the airport.\n\nAs a chronically early person, I hate rushing and get intense anxiety about cutting things too close.\n\nI'd rather sit in an airport for an extra hour than make a sweaty sprint through the terminal to catch a flight.\n\nMy husband, on the other hand, doesn't like to waste time — and with his demanding, meeting-filled job, he rarely has a moment to spare.\n\nHis perfect travel day involves passing through security as the plane begins boarding. Though that's anxiety-inducing to me, for what it's worth, he's only ever missed one flight.\n\nBecause of this, in the hours before a flight, I'd be huffing around our apartment with bags packed and shoes on. He'd get frustrated that I was rushing him, and I'd get annoyed that he was making us \"late.\"\n\nCue lots of tense moments and grumpy silence in transit.\n\nA few months ago, ahead of yet another long-haul flight to the US, I suggested what I thought was a reasonable time to leave — not too early, not too late. My husband wanted to leave even later.\n\nI decided to just leave when I wanted to avoid the stress and inevitable argument. We were taking public transportation, so the cost was the same either way.\n\nI told him I'd meet him at the gate, gave him a quick kiss, and made my way — happily, unhurriedly — to the airport. He arrived much later, but still on time.\n\nWe proceeded to have the smoothest trip we'd ever had in nine years.\n\nSince we started arriving at the airport separately, we noticed tons of other benefits, too.\n\nMy husband and I have very different work schedules, and this setup helps us both effectively manage our responsibilities. Sometimes, I'll get to the airport extra early to take a call or put finishing touches on an assignment.\n\nWe've also found that there's no financial downside to this system.\n\nObviously, this travel hack works best for city dwellers with easy access to public transport. It's definitely trickier if you live out in the suburbs and either share a car or don't want to park two at the airport.\n\nBecause we've only ever lived together in cities, though, this option is easy for us. Even if we planned to take an Uber together, the added cost of one of us leaving earlier on public transit is generally pretty marginal — in our case, usually no more than about $15.\n\nBest of all, by arriving at the airport when we like, we start our trips on a positive note. The last thing we need on an already stressful travel day is to be fighting or feeling frustrated with or another.\n\nThough this works well for us, we don't always travel separately.\n\nThere are times when our schedules make it more convenient to head to the airport together, or we have enough luggage that it makes more sense to schedule an Uber.\n\nIn those instances, we talk through our schedules the day before to make sure we can clearly communicate expectations so that there are no surprises.\n\nThese days, though, this heading to the airport separately has become our norm. I'll tell my husband which train I'm planning to take, and he tells me which one he's on.\n\nWe know that we'll see each other at the gate, one way or another.",

    "description": "Instead of our usual big holiday celebration with extended family, the four of us spent Christmas traveling and making new traditions on our trip.",
    "fullText": "Christmas is a really, really big deal in our house.\n\nIt's when our close-knit extended family gets together to celebrate, feast, and spend time with one another.\n\nHowever, my husband, two young kids, and I spent last Christmas sitting in our caravan on a remote beach in South Australia, just the four of us.\n\nIt was a far cry from the holidays before. But after years of deliberating, we'd just recently packed up our lives and belongings and headed toward the Australian outback for a yearlong adventure in a small caravan.\n\nComing home for Christmas wasn't an option — but, with a bit of planning, we still ended up having a brilliant (and unique) holiday.\n\nWhen you travel with everything you own packed into a caravan, space is at a premium.\n\nWe would've loved a standard Christmas tree, but we opted for a small, travel-sized version that had been stashed in the back of a cupboard for months as it silently traveled Australia.\n\nAs the holiday season approached, we dug out the tree and our kids decorated with the small selection of trimmings we'd brought with us.\n\nQuickly, the whole caravan turned into a Christmas ornament, with tinsel and fairy lights hanging from every nook and cranny. To our surprise, it was really magical. The kids loved the space so much that the lights stayed up long after December 25.\n\nWe also got creative when planning our Christmas feast, especially since our caravan doesn't have an oven and we'd be miles from any major city on the big day.\n\nInstead of roasting a whole bird, we made nachos with our barbecue and stove and topped them with ground turkey and other fixings.\n\nWhile sitting on a blanket on a beach, we used our best plastic plates and shared our low-stress Christmas-inspired feast. As a bonus, cleaning up after dinner was a breeze.\n\nLike any inquisitive 4-year-old, my daughter asked: \"How will Santa find us?\" She was concerned we didn't have a chimney, a letterbox, or even space for Santa to fit in our van.\n\nOnce again, we did some serious problem-solving. Thanks to the magic of Christmas — and preparations we made months in advance — Santa did find us.\n\nGrandparents also wanted to send gifts, which proved difficult on the road. Since we'd be in a remote area at Christmastime and unable to receive parcels, we arranged for relatives to get their presents to a town we knew we'd be visiting a few weeks prior.\n\nThen, we hid them in the van the best we could until Christmas Day.\n\nThat morning, thanks satellite coverage and modern technology, we were able to video call members our extended family so they could see the kids unwrap their gifts.\n\nOur holiday wasn't traditional, and we'll absolutely remember it for years to come.\n\nBeing on the road forced us to problem-solve and come up with ideas as an extended family. It allowed us to rethink many traditions and leave some behind simply because, logistically, they couldn't happen.\n\nInstead, we created new traditions and memories as a young family, while still staying connected with loved ones over video calls.\n\nWould we do it again? Absolutely. But this year, we plan to celebrate in person with our larger family again … and we might even bring the turkey nachos!",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa travel to Switzerland aiming to tighten their grip on a top-eight Europa League berth when they face Basel tonight.\n\nVilla arrive in red-hot form, winning 13 of their last 15 matches in all competitions.\n\nUnai Emery’s side claimed a statement win against Arsenal over the weekend, with Emiliano Buendia’s 95th-minute strike sealing a dramatic 2–1 victory.\n\nThe Villans sit third in the Premier League, three points off the top, and with European progress firmly in view.\n\nThey enter matchday six on 12 points (W4, L1), joint-top of the 36-team standings. However, Basel are dangerous, especially at home.\n\nThe Swiss side has alternated between wins and defeats throughout the League Phase (W2, L3).\n\nIt is worth noting that they have won their last seven Europa League home matches, their longest active streak in the competition.\n\nA late defeat to Genk dropped them to 24th, but they still occupy the final play-off spot with three games remaining.\n\nConfidence is rising after back-to-back domestic wins, including a last-gasp 2–1 victory over Winterthur last weekend.\n\nThis will be the clubs’ first meeting in 23 years, since Villa’s 4–1 aggregate victory in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nThe Villans must be wary as Basel have won five of their last 10 matches against English opposition.\n\nBasel have also been flawless at home in this competition, with seven straight wins at St Jakob-Park.\n\nVilla have struggled on the road in Europe recently, winning just one of their last six UEFA Cup/Europa League away games.\n\nHowever, Villa have scored two or more goals in 10 of their last 15 matches, highlighting their firepower heading into this fixture.\n\nDonyell Malen up top will likely carry Villa’s greatest threat with Ollie Watkins rested. Malen has scored three goals in his last two Europa League outings.\n\nTyrone Mings (thigh) and Ross Barkley (knee) remain out, while Evann Guessand is doubtful after missing the Arsenal win.\n\nUnai Emery may rotate. Emiliano Martinez has started the last three European games but could be rested, with Marco Bizot pushing for minutes.\n\nMatty Cash might also drop out, opening the door for Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof or Andres Garcia at right-back.\n\nIf Lindelof does not play wide, he could partner Pau Torres centrally, with Lucas Digne competing with Ian Maatsen on the left.\n\nIn midfield, Boubacar Kamara and Amadou Onana are expected to continue, while Youri Tielemans or Morgan Rogers may be managed due to fixture congestion.\n\nFurther forward, Buendia is pushing for a start after his last-gasp Arsenal heroics. The 28-year-old could get a shot.\n\nHarvey Elliott will likely not play today. Emery confirmed that the youngster, who is a ‘special player’, could return to parent club Liverpool in January.\n\nJadon Sancho and John McGinn are alternative options. Malen is expected to lead the line, with Emery likely to rest Ollie Watkins again.\n\nMarco Bizot; Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelof, Pau Torres, Lucas Digne; Boubacar Kamara, Amadou Onana; John McGinn, Emiliano Buendia, Jadon Sancho; Donyell Malen.",

    "fullText": "Aston Villa travel to Switzerland on Thursday night looking to extend a magnificent winning run.\n\nThey face FC Basel at St. Jakob-Park in the Europa League. Unai Emery’s side arrive in Basel brimming with confidence after a dramatic 2-1 victory over Premier League leaders Arsenal last weekend. This result extended their winning streak to seven matches across all competitions. The Villans currently sit joint-top of the Europa League standings with 12 points.\n\nThey aim to secure a top-eight finish. However, they face a formidable test against a Basel side that has turned St. Jakob-Park into a fortress. The Swiss outfit have won each of their last seven home Europa League matches. This is the longest current winning home run in the competition.\n\nDate: Thursday, 11 December 2025\n\nHead coach Ludovic Magnin will rely heavily on the experience of captain Xherdan Shaqiri. He has been instrumental this season with 11 goals and 10 assists. The former Liverpool man scored the opener in last weekend’s win over Winterthur and is expected to retain his place in attack. In midfield, Andrej Bacanin is likely to come into the starting XI to replace Marin Soticek. Moritz Broschinski is expected to lead the line. However, there are doubts over the availability of Kaio Eduardo due to injury.\n\nUnai Emery is expected to rotate his squad following the intense victory over Arsenal. Consequently, Matty Cash could be rested after scoring the opener against the Gunners. Lamare Bogarde, Victor Lindelöf, or the returning Andrés García are contending for the right-back slot. In attack, Donyell Malen is pushing to replace Ollie Watkins. Furthermore, Emiliano Buendía is in contention for a start after scoring the winner against Arsenal. Tyrone Mings and Ross Barkley remain sidelined.\n\nBasel enter this contest knowing their home form is their greatest asset. They are unbeaten in 10 European matches on home soil since 2015. Moreover, they have won five of their last 10 major European games against English opponents. Despite a rocky start to the league phase, they have found domestic rhythm recently. They have won back-to-back games in the Swiss Cup and Super League.\n\nVilla are enjoying a historic year in Europe. They have won eight of their last 10 major European matches. All eight wins came in 2025, which is a club record for a single calendar year. Their style under Emery has been distinct. Indeed, they have played the highest percentage of short passes of any team in the competition. History also favours the visitors as Villa triumphed when these sides met in the 2001 Intertoto Cup final.\n\nBasel predicted XI: Hitz; Tsunemoto, Adjetey, Daniliuc, Schmid; Metinho, Bacanin; Shaqiri, Leroy, Otele; Broschinski\n\nAston Villa predicted XI: Bizot; Bogarde, Lindelof, Torres, Digne; Kamara, Onana; Buendía, Tielemans, Rogers; Malen\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports. Coverage starts at 19:30 GMT.\n\nRead- Mainoo preference abroad move over Premier League loan\n\nSee more- Saudi Pro League CEO endorses Mohamed Salah transfer\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "title": "Walk, don't run: The latest workout trend combines the great outdoors with low-stakes socializing",
    "description": "Data from Strava and AllTrails show a surge in new hiking clubs, while National Parks continue to be top travel destinations.",
    "fullText": "The run clubs that took off in the past few years were outpaced by hiking.\n\nThat's according to new data from Strava, a fitness tracking app, and AllTrails, a hiking navigation app.\n\nStrava's end-of-year report, analyzing data from over 180 million users and surveying over 30,000 users and non-users, found that hiking clubs grew sixfold in 2025 — nearly double the pace of run clubs. In 2025, AllTrails saw a 20% increase in users (i.e., people who created an account on the app) to 90 million.\n\nOnline, you can find hiking clubs for seemingly every preference, whether you're a creative in LA looking for a morning workout, a woman who doesn't want to hike alone in North Carolina, or a \"hot girl\" on the hunt for new travel companions.\n\nWhile run clubs are still popular, hiking and walking have an advantage: simplicity. They offer similar health benefits and social perks — without requiring the same stamina or potentially pricey gear.\n\nCOVID lockdowns famously drew people to the outdoors, whether they joined run clubs or sought out nearby hikes.\n\nAnd then there were National Parks, which experienced a surge of visitors since 2020 during the pandemic — and don't seem to be losing their allure. According to the National Parks visitation data, 2024 broke the record for the highest number of visitors of all time at over 331 million, a 28% increase since 2020.\n\nFive years after the pandemic, National Parks continue to be popular destinations. \"When you start looking at that number as feet on the trail, bodies in the visitor's center, cars on the road, you see that the parks have exploded,\" Jason Frye, a hiking writer who most recently published a National Parks guidebook, told Business Insider. Strava reported that hiking was the second most popular reason for traveling, behind winter sports.\n\nCarly Smith, chief marketing officer for AllTrails, said its data shows many hikers search for locations over 200 miles from their home. \"So we know that people are using us for planning travel and then for navigating and exploring National Parks and other destinations,\" she said.\n\nSmith believes part of the reason hiking and National Parks continue to be hot is that, for many, life still hasn't changed all that much since the peak-remote work pandemic years. \"There are more people working remotely than there were in the past,\" she said. \"Hiking clubs in particular can give people a good sense of community in ways that maybe they aren't finding in other parts of their life.\"\n\nRunning isn't the cardio workout for everyone. It's also not the only — or best — way to burn fat.\n\nWhile sprinting at a very fast pace (zone 4 or zone 5) is great for your heart health, it consumes more carbs than fat compared to a brisk walk or light jog.\n\nHiking long distances with a heavy backpack can help hit two goals: shedding fat while building muscle.\n\nThat's partly why rucking, or walking with weights, became a buzzy fitness trend last year. We saw a boom in networking events where people chat shop while breaking a sweat.\n\nPrice-wise, hiking, rucking, and walking also more financially accessible than joining a luxury gym. Weighted vests, the walking accessories du jour, cost about $30-$40 on Amazon — though a backpack from GoRuck, one of the biggest players in this space, starts at $115.\n\nPlus, in many cases, hiking and walking can be interchangeable: not all hikes have to be strenuous to count, making them less physically and financially daunting.\n\nFrye, who lives in Wilmington, North Carolina, near Great Smoky Mountains National Park, said there are many hiking trails nearby that are \"really walks in the woods more than true hikes.\"\n\n\"You can hop out of the car and do it in your flip flops from most of them,\" he said — no high-tech gear needed.\n\nAccording to Strava's report, walking was the second-most tracked activity in 2025, after running. Along with hiking, both activities can feel like a more low-stakes group activity than a seven-mile run.\n\nJonathan Jacobs, who started a men's walking group in LA this year, previously told Business Insider that the accessibility of walking made newcomers more likely to show up.\n\n\"Men who come to the walks repeatedly tell me that the low barrier to entry — no need to sign up or pay a fee to join — makes it easier for them to commit,\" he said.\n\nCity dwellers who partook in walking Manhattan from \"tip to tip\" — another popular TikTok trend of the year — also cited it as a memorable (but still low-key) experience with their friends.\n\nFrye believes the hiking hype is all part of the same phenomenon behind the renewed interest in dumb phones and old-school activities like pickling and crocheting.\n\n\"There seems to be this cultural shift, away from the digital and more toward the analog,\" he said. \"We're looking at these ways to return to easier things, and it doesn't get much easier than hiking.\"\n\nDecember 10, 2025: A previous version of this story stated that the Strava report data came from 30,000 Strava users. It came from 180 million users, as well as an additional survey of 30,000 users and non-users.",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest will look to strengthen their Europa League ambitions with another crucial win as they travel to the Netherlands to face Utrecht, keeping one eye firmly on securing a place in the round of 16.\n\nDespite a turbulent domestic campaign, Sean Dyche’s side remain well positioned to progress in Europe. Forest sit in a promising spot heading into the final group fixtures, though they will still need a result against a Utrecht team who, despite sitting 32nd in the league phase standings, cannot be underestimated.\n\nForest had enjoyed a three-match winning run – scoring three goals in each victory over Leeds, Liverpool and Malmö – but their momentum has stalled since.\n\nA dip in results has dragged them back into a mid-season relegation battle, something the club hoped to avoid following Dyche’s appointment in October.\n\nDays after edging past bottom-placed Wolves, the Tricky Trees fell to a comfortable defeat away at Everton, leaving them 17th in the Premier League and just two points above the relegation zone.\n\nAttention now turns back to the Europa League, where Forest sit two points outside the top seven and four off first place. With the league phase tightly congested, every point against those around them is pivotal.\n\nUtrecht, meanwhile, are competing in European football for the first time in 14 years. They are one of only five teams yet to record a win in this season’s competition, having drawn once and lost four. Their solitary point came against Porto before falling to a fourth defeat against Real Betis on matchweek five.\n\nDomestically, however, Ron Jans’ side has been far more consistent. Just five defeats in 15 league matches have pushed Utrecht into the European positions once again as they look to turn what has been an occasional high into a more regular achievement.\n\nThey enter this match as clear underdogs but will hope to channel their steady league form into a much-needed European lift.\n\nUtrecht will be without midfielder Davy van den Berg, who remains sidelined through injury, while goalkeeper Vasilis Barkas is recovering but could return in time to start. Attacking midfielder Victor Jensen (hamstring) and full-back Niklas Vesterlund (knee) will also miss Thursday’s clash.\n\nFor Nottingham Forest, Dyche remains without full-back Ola Aina, midfielder Douglas Luiz (both thigh) and striker Chris Wood (knee), with all three continuing their rehabilitation. Defender Murillo is facing a race against time to return from a hamstring issue and illness, having missed Forest’s last three matches in all competitions.\n\nUTR: Barkas; Horemans, Van De Hoorn, Viergever, El Karouani; Bozdogan, Ongena, De Wit; Rodriguez, Min, Cathline",

    "description": "This summer, I went to Portugal for the music festival Afro Nation. I felt like I didn't get to see the country I'd flown all the way out to visit.",
    "fullText": "Tourism in Portugal has reached record numbers over the past two years, with over 31 million visitors in 2024.\n\nAlthough the coastal wonders of the Algarve region and the historic castles of Sintra are often a selling point for tourists, I took the seven-hour trip for reasons unrelated to wanderlust.\n\nPortimão, Portugal, is the home of Afro Nation, the biggest annual Afrobeats festival in the world — and this summer, I was one of the 40,000 festival-goers in attendance.\n\nThough dancing on the stunning beaches of Portugal to the sounds of Burna Boy and Tems live was definitely a bucket-list experience that I wouldn't have traded for the world, I'm not sure it's one I would repeat.\n\nDon't get me wrong: This realization had nothing to do with a lackluster experience. There is nothing dull about being serenaded by a shirtless Damini, and there was nothing disappointing about Portugal, either.\n\nInstead, I left feeling like I hadn't visited Portugal at all, but rather that I attended an event that just happened to be there.\n\nSomewhere between day two and day three, it hit me: I was in Portugal, but I wasn't really seeing the country.\n\nMy days weren't spent wandering tiled alleyways or eating salted cod by the water. Instead, I spent all my downtime resting at my resort, ordering food, getting dressed, and then heading back onto the beach — not for a swim, but for another 12 hours of music.\n\nThe experience wasn't exactly cheap, either. Aside from the nearly $600 I spent on the festival tickets, food and drinks were expensive at the venue, and rideshare trips cost more than I'd planned on spending, probably due to the crowds.\n\nI don't regret what I spent on the experience, but I did find myself thinking about what it would have been like to spend that money at a Lisbon flea market or on a cooking class, learning how to make pastel de nata from a local.\n\nThe beach could've been in Miami. The resort could've been in Cancún. The only Portuguese thing about my trip was the exchange rate.\n\nI did have two days after the festival ended to explore Lisbon, but it wasn't nearly enough time. I was exhausted after three days of standing on my feet and singing along, and after all of the rideshares we had purchased, both my feet and my wallet needed a break.\n\nOnce I got home, I noticed that my Instagram feed was flooded with other people's Portugal trips: sunsets on sailboats in Portimão, wine in Porto, mist hanging over Sintra's castles.\n\nI felt like they'd gotten to see Portugal. I'd gotten to see a festival that happened to be hosted there.\n\nI don't regret my trip — Afro Nation itself was unforgettable. I loved the music, the chaos, the feeling of being surrounded by a global community all singing Burna Boy under the same sky.\n\nIn an ideal world, I'd be able to go back to Afro Nation with an extra three or four days to actually roam. However, extra days meant extra costs for food, accommodations, and the experiences I was so desperate to have — and unfortunately, I didn't have unlimited PTO.\n\nI learned that my idea of a perfect trip doesn't center on an international festival or specific experience. I don't want to cross an ocean just to stand in a crowd.\n\nMy version of travel definitely includes sun, sand, and bottomless drinks, but also curiosity. I want to wander, learn, and actually see where I am.\n\nI'd say that Portugal is still on my travel bucket list — though I went, I barely touched it. Next time, I'm not going for a stage on the beach. I'm going for the country.",

    "description": "\"Bridgerton\" returns, an Agatha Christie adaptation, and \"People We Meet on Vacation.\"",
    "fullText": "Netflix's January lineup is on the lighter side, but includes the return of period romance series Bridgerton (Jan. 29). Season four centers on Benedict, the second-eldest sibling, and Sophie, who he meets at Lady Bridgerton’s masquerade ball. The first four episodes drop in January, with the remaining four coming at the end of February.\n\nAnother original series worth watching is Agatha Christie's Seven Dials (Jan. 15), an adaptation of crime author's novel The Seven Dials Mystery.

    "fullText": "Since I was a child, receiving holiday cards has been one of my favorite parts of December.\n\nI love seeing the snapshots families choose to represent their year and reading the little updates that I don't get on social media.\n\nWhen I was in my 20s, I wanted to start sending my own, but I felt I had to wait for traditional milestones — like getting married and having kids — before it would feel \"appropriate.\"\n\nIn my mind, holiday cards seemed like a privilege reserved for conventional lives.\n\nAs the years went by, I continued to see stories about unmarried, single, or child-free women sending holiday cards that poked fun at their status. They'd pose with sad faces and wine bottles or include clever quips about being alone once again.\n\nEvery year, without fail, someone would send me these articles as if I could relate, but I couldn't. To each their own, of course, but I never saw my life as something to be made fun of, and I definitely didn't feel sorry for myself.\n\nSo, I created a new holiday card tradition — one that celebrates my beautiful and full life.\n\nAs I neared 30, I started doing a lot of solo traveling and set the goal of visiting all 63 major US national parks on my own by the time I turned 40.\n\nThough I was posting some of my trips on social media, I also wanted to share them more personally with my friends and family.\n\nFinally, I decided to print a holiday card featuring a photo from a summer trip I took to Canada — a simple shot of my backpack overlooking the mountains of Banff National Park.\n\nI hesitated for a while before mailing them, worried that friends and family might find it narcissistic or odd to receive a card with only me in it.\n\nHowever, many who received the card reached out to express their love for the photo and how happy they were to get it in the mail.\n\nI've kept the tradition going ever since — for nearly 10 years now, through my entire 30s, I've sent a card filled with my favorite photos from the year's solo adventures.\n\nFriends and family often ask well in advance if they're still on my mailing list and tell me how much they look forward to receiving them.\n\nFor me, sharing these more personal photos — the ones I cherish most — in a tangible, intimate way has become a highlight of the season.\n\nCreating the cards each year makes me feel empowered, proud of my accomplishments, and confident in the life I've chosen.\n\nMore than anything, it's a reminder that holiday cards can celebrate joy, connection, and the version of life you're proud to live — however unconventional it may be.",

    "description": "After 15 years as a digital nomad, Kaisu Koskela went on her first cruise. She found it both exciting and overwhelming.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kaisu Koskela, 48, a postdoctoral researcher on digital nomads. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a digital nomad for 15 years, so Nomad Cruise had been on my radar for a while. What began a decade ago as a relocation cruise for remote workers has grown into something much bigger — twice-yearly trips that feel like floating community conferences.\n\nAs a researcher and policy advisor on digital nomadism, I was especially curious. After some deliberation, my partner and I booked the 27-day Pacific crossing from Seattle to Sydney.\n\nNeither of us had ever been on a cruise before. It felt exciting, but also overwhelming.\n\nSomething was always happening: talks on life and work, meetups, and workshops. All of that was just the nomad program. The ship added even more, from cabaret shows to talks on local history. We also had full days ashore in places like Honolulu and Samoa.\n\nStarlink WiFi made working easy, and I met people in all kinds of fields, from AI to videography. But it was a long route, and no one was overly focused on productivity, including me.\n\nI'd planned to finish an article but never got to it, and honestly, I didn't mind. I was there for the experience.\n\nThe 230 passengers felt like a true snapshot of the nomad world. The youngest passenger was 23, and the oldest was in their 60s, but the majority were in their 30s.\n\nThe cruise is set up as a peer-learning conference: passengers give talks and share their expertise for free. I spoke about digital nomad visas and helped people one-on-one afterward. In return, before I got onstage a performance coach prepped me for my talk, and a designer explained a confusing part of my chart. Everyone gave something.\n\nI was surprised by how many passengers weren't nomads yet. They'd come for inspiration. Some were so enamored by the idea of location independence that they quit their jobs on the spot, pushed over the edge by burnout and encouraged by others to go freelance and build something of their own.\n\nA common theme kept coming up: Don't stay tied to an employer who's breaking you down.\n\nAs the days passed, we created more together. In the first week, someone formed a choir. I joined, and we rehearsed on every sea day before performing a full concert with professional lights and sound. I've had to sacrifice very little to be a digital nomad, but singing in a choir is off the table. Having one of my hobbies back for a month felt incredible.\n\nMeetups took off just as easily. I posted one for speed puzzling and ended up playing with a group that included someone who'd competed in the World Puzzling Championship. What started as a fangirl moment became real technique training.\n\nThe community was big enough that no matter how niche the interest, someone else shared it.\n\nLife onboard was easy — the staff were wonderful, and the vibe felt warm. But being a \"cruise tourist\" on land felt different\n\nVanuatu, an island archipelago in the South Pacific, was our final stop. It was also a new country for me. There, we were dropped on an otherwise uninhabited island where bars and food stalls had been set up just for us. Technically, I've now been to Vanuatu, but I had no contact with local life. I didn't love that.\n\nCruise stops are short; you're usually back onboard by 4:30 p.m. Early in the trip, after docking in Hawaii, we rushed around Maui trying to see everything. It felt pointless, a YouTube video would've given me the same overview.\n\nWe'd cracked the formula by the time we reached Savusavu in Fiji. It was a real town with a market, and we just wandered, with no agenda. I preferred those stops; even a tiny slice of local life beats racing through a checklist.\n\nThe remoteness of the Pacific was surreal. Seattle to Hawaii took a week; Hawaii to Samoa took another 16 days with no land, no ships — just ocean and the occasional pod of dolphins.\n\nThere was even a Crossing the Line ceremony for first-time equator crossers. We had to kiss a fish and jump into the pool. I loved it.\n\nNomad Cruise was expensive — €4,300, or about $5,000 each — so we thought hard before booking. We chose a basic cabin with a window and ate like royalty.\n\nAlcohol was extra, though happy hour made wine about $6 a glass. Onboard purchases came with an automatic 18% tip, plus a crew appreciation fee of about $17 per day. But reaching these destinations on our own would've cost more, and once we were on the ship, I stopped thinking about money; everything felt free.\n\nLeaving after a month on the cruise felt surreal; the community bubble was hard to step out of. I loved the people, the sunsets, and even the small things like watching the weather and birdlife change across the ocean.\n\nI'm sure I'll cross paths and deepen connections with some of the people I met on board. We shared something special.",
