    "description": "A former legal counsel for TikTok quit her job in 2023 to travel the world on a motorbike, seeking adventure and personal growth with her partner.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on an interview with Nerine Mak, a 33-year-old former senior commercial counsel for TikTok who's traveling the world on a motorbike. It has been edited for length and clarity\n\nI'm the eldest of five children. Our house was full of sibling squabbles, lots of negotiation, and mediation, which is probably why I joined the school debating team. A legal degree was a natural progression.\n\nI moved to Australia for college, then returned to Singapore, where I began working as a legal counsel at Ernst & Young in April 2017.\n\nEighteen months later, I became the regional legal counsel for Sephora. I'd only been there for nine months when, in July 2019, a TikTok recruiter approached me.\n\nI stayed at TikTok until I turned 30, when I quit to travel the world on a motorbike.\n\nI decided to go and meet them for interview practice. I knew TikTok was a social media app, but that was about it. When I found out that ByteDance was a major tech company with educational and B2B products, as well as TikTok, I was seriously impressed.\n\nI interviewed for a legal counsel role that'd support the revenue-generating business in Southeast Asia and Oceania. Within 48 hours, the recruiter called me to say I'd passed the first interview, and my second interview would be the next day.\n\nI started taking the process very seriously.\n\nMy first interview was with the hiring manager, then I was interviewed by three people from different business units, and finally, my last interview was with an HR member.\n\nI was still learning a lot at Sephora and wasn't ready to leave, but the opportunity at TikTok was just so appealing.\n\nWhen I told my parents I was going to work for TikTok, my dad didn't really have that much confidence in the company. Initially, I was nervous about the idea of joining, too, because when I asked about my specific job scope, it was still rather unknown.\n\nI received a welcome pack with backpacks, laptop bags, stickers, and stationery.\n\nAt the time, we were working in a coworking space. In my previous roles at Sephora and EY, we collaborated, but at TikTok, the collabs were more dynamic, frequent, and face-to-face.\n\nMy day-to-day involved more meetings, whereas in my earlier roles, independent work carried greater weight.\n\nEach day, I'd have meetings from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., then I'd still have up to three hours of work left before I finished for the day.\n\nThe most challenging year I had was 2021. One of my projects was to launch the TikTok Shop in Indonesia. It was the first to launch globally, so countries like the UK and the US saw my project as the blueprint.\n\nI burned out at least three times that year. Of course, it was very rewarding once launched and turned out to be very successful. My team grew to 10 lawyers, and we'd have weekly catch-ups on ByteDance's all-in-one platform, Lark.\n\nAt 23, I told myself I'd leave my job by 30 to pursue my own growth and discovery. I knew that traveling the world would give me the kind of life lessons my job couldn't give.\n\nAfter 18 months, I started playing around with the idea of van life. In March 2021, a friend referred me to a mechanic, Haren, whom he knew and who could share some car maintenance tips.\n\nHaren and I started dating and decided to travel together. Within three months, I decided to swap the van for a motorbike, and we agreed to leave our jobs and ride off-road bikes from Singapore to Europe.\n\nI left in November 2023. At first, they tried to talk me out of leaving, but I was transparent about my dream of exploring the world. We made sure we had a solid budget, so we didn't have to worry while traveling.\n\nTwo months before we were about to leave, my father said, \"I've bought a bike and Mummy and I are coming too.\" They decided to ride from Singapore to Germany and meet us on the way.\n\nHaren and I set off on January 20, 2024, at 5:30 a.m. I couldn't sleep the night before. When I woke up, my family prepared a farewell party, and our friends arrived on bikes to ride with us to the border.\n\nMy parents joined us on May 5, 2024, on the border of Laos and China. We traveled through China together and then met up again in Poland to travel through the Baltics before we rode to Norway. They're now back in Singapore.\n\nWe've now ridden off-road from Singapore through China and across Afghanistan.\n\nMy day involves leaving the guest house by 11 a.m., riding for two hours, and going sightseeing during our lunch hour. We usually stop riding just before sunset.\n\nWe try not to be rigid with our plans because a lot of the joy and surprises we get come from interacting with locals. They'll invite us into their homes for dinner or to their farms to ride on their horses.\n\nIt was a very promising role, but I knew I had to do this for myself. One of the biggest lessons I've learned is to be optimistic. Your closest people might have doubts about your plans, but you have to follow your heart.\n\nI've been taking on ad hoc legal work for friends who have small businesses. We plan to travel through February, then park our bikes for the next eight months due to family commitments. I'm also thinking of taking this opportunity to get either full-time or part-time legal work.\n\nI would still like to grow my legal skills. That would be a way to bring in income to fund future journeys as well. The freedom I get on two wheels is my passion and will stick with me for the rest of my life.",

    "description": "As a full-time travel writer who's visited 27 Greek islands, I think Symi and Milos are two of the best to visit. However, I'd skip visiting Mykonos.",
    "fullText": "As a full-time travel writer and content creator, I'm eager to explore as much of the world as possible. And although I often prioritize visiting new destinations, I can't help but return to Greece again and again.\n\nI adore the country, and over the last five years, I've visited 27 islands — some of them multiple times. However, a few just didn't capture my heart in the same way.\n\nHere are three Greek islands I'd return to and two I'd skip in the future.\n\nSymi is easily one of my favorite Greek Islands because it feels more lowkey than some of the more famous spots like Mykonos or Santorini.\n\nFor stunning views overlooking the bay, I recommend hiking up the Kali Strata's hundreds of stairs. I also suggest joining a full-day boat trip with Poseidon cruises or hopping on a water taxi to visit one of the nearby beaches.\n\nIn my opinion, Milos has some of the most stunning beaches in Greece.\n\nOne of the most well-known spots is Sarakiniko Beach, which is famous for its lunar landscape — a series of smooth, white, volcanic rock formations that resemble the surface of the moon.\n\nI recommend renting a car to explore Milos by land, but don't skip a boat trip around the island as well — some of the best swim spots are only accessible from the water.\n\nSeveral tiny fishing villages also add a unique factor to this island. In some of them, traditional boathouses have been renovated into cozy, waterfront villas and hotels. I recommend booking one for a truly immersive experience.\n\nSkiathos is a charming island filled with great local shops and some of the best Greek food I've had during my travels. It also has a lively nightlife scene, with plenty of bars and clubs that stay open late.\n\nDuring the day, you can hop on a boat or a bus to explore the many beaches in the area. In the evening, I recommend taking advantage of lengthy happy hours at the many cocktail bars offering sunset views.\n\nIf you love \"Mamma Mia,\" Open Air Cinema hosts special screenings of the movie — after all, parts of it were filmed on the island. I recommend grabbing tickets early because they sell out quickly.\n\nMykonos is known for its upscale beach clubs, lively bars, and cute old town. It delivers on all of these fronts, but in my opinion, it does so at a cost.\n\nIt's known as one of the pricier Greek islands to visit, and although I enjoyed my time there, it's not somewhere I feel the need to go back to.\n\nInstead, I recommend taking a multi-day Greek Island sailing trip that stops in Mykonos. That way, you can see it and experience some of the hype, but you don't have to stay for more than one night.\n\nGoing into my trip, I knew that Kos was more touristy than other islands I've visited. However, although it's beautiful, I ultimately found it to be underwhelming.\n\nInstead of unique gifts, I found that most of the old town was filled with typical tourist shops. The beaches were OK, but also seemed less picturesque compared to those I've visited on other islands.\n\nSince Kos has an international airport, I think it's best suited as a starting point for reaching other destinations.\n\nThis story was originally published on September 19, 2024, and most recently updated on February 23, 2026.",

    "description": "After cartel violence shut down flights and blocked roads in Puerto Vallarta, Americans are canceling vacations and rethinking future travel plans.",
    "fullText": "Hannah Donovan is four months pregnant. And with two little ones already at home, she and her husband had been banking on one family trip before life got even more hectic.\n\nPuerto Vallarta was meant to be a babymoon — a chance to meet up with family nearby, soak up the sun, and actually relax for a few days.\n\nHowever, less than 24 hours before they were set to head to their airport in Idaho, videos and pictures of burning cars and billowing smoke began circulating on social media.\n\nDonovan said the images she saw online followed reports that Mexican forces carried out an operation on Sunday in Tapalpa, Jalisco, that killed Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera Cervantes, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The incident sparked retaliatory violence across multiple cities in Mexico, including in Puerto Vallarta.\n\nThe Donovans have since canceled their trip to Mexico and will play it by ear on whether they'll try to visit Puerto Vallarta later.\n\n\"We're incredibly grateful we're not there, but we're worried about the people who are, including travelers and our family who live there,\" Donovan, 28, told Business Insider. \"We're definitely a little traumatized by the situation.\"\n\nThe Donovans are among many Americans rethinking trips, moves, and stays in the region after chaos flared across parts of Mexico following the killing of Oseguera Cervantes on Sunday. Four people at the scene were killed, according to authorities. Three others — including Oseguera Cervantes — were wounded and later died, and two people were arrested. Three members of the armed forces were also wounded.\n\nIt comes after President Donald Trump designated the cartel a foreign terrorist organization. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US provided intelligence support for the operation, but stopped short of offering details on how. The administration has prioritized cracking down on Latin American cartels, urging leaders to take a harder line and deploying military force against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean.\n\nIn the hours since, the US and Canadian governments have urged citizens in some areas to shelter in place, and said most domestic and international flights in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta were grounded. On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called for calm in the country, but many of those flights remained canceled.\n\nMexico has become increasingly popular with American tourists, drawn by its vibrant nightlife, strong culinary scene, and affordability compared to other trendy international destinations such as France and Japan.\n\n\"Americans, especially on the West Coast, have long used it as an inexpensive place to go on vacation,\" Robin Ingle, a specialist in travel security, told Business Insider.\n\nMexico has also seen a surge in tourism from people who previously would have traveled to the US but are avoiding the country for various political or financial reasons, he said.\n\n\"A lot of the people I've spoken to over the weekend would have gone to places like Florida, California, Arizona — now they're going to Mexico instead,\" he said of the tourists he's spoken to since cartel violence broke out.\n\nBut as unrest spreads, some Americans who had planned to vacation or relocate there, or who are already in Mexico, are watching those plans unravel.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three of them about what comes next.\n\nDoug Howell, a retired sales and distribution executive from the Spokane, Washington area, bought a rental place in Puerto Vallarta and now spends roughly six months a year there — a routine he's kept up for the past 20 years.\n\n\"It's very vibrant,\" Howell, 63, told Business Insider. \"I like to walk around the neighborhoods, everything is pretty close, or a short bus ride away if you want to check out the beaches or the waterfalls. There's always something to do, and the food is incredible.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Howell said he was standing on his balcony when he started hearing explosions, then saw plumes of smoke rising nearby. Before long, he said, he noticed highways and roads in and out of the area had been blocked off.\n\nHe was scared at first, he said, and hunkered down with neighbors.\"We just stayed inside all day yesterday, and I didn't go anywhere,\" he recalled. \"They actually bombed a store on a corner and a car on the bridge that's not even a quarter of a mile away.\"\n\n\"They're already on it today, and people are supporting each other in the community — that's what I like about it,\" he said. \"One question everybody asks me: Is it safe? And it's like, yeah, it is, unless you go to the wrong place at the wrong time. And that's anywhere in the world.\"\n\nFor now, Howell plans to stay in Mexico, but if things worsen, he said he plans to return to the States.\n\nLinda Armijo and her husband have been visiting Puerto Vallarta for the past 25 years.\n\nIn January, they returned for a three-month stay in the city's Marina Vallarta district, an upscale, waterfront area in northern Puerto Vallarta.\n\nArmijo said that on Sunday, after her husband's massage therapist warned that roads downtown were blocked, she went up to the rooftop terrace of their condo, which overlooks the city. From there, she said she could see five or six plumes of smoke.\n\nSmoke isn't entirely unusual in Puerto Vallarta — controlled burns are common — but Armijo said this was more than she typically sees. \"I came down to our condo and told Anthony, 'There's something going on, there are fires everywhere,'\" she recalled.\n\nArmijo said the city was hit by a series of disruptions, including the blast of an engine as a car was set on fire, interruptions to water service, and highways and roads blocked off. Although the uncertainty has left tourists and locals scrambling, they're relying on each other to get by.\n\n\"I met two girls from LA who are renting a condo upstairs. They were meant to fly out yesterday, and threw away all their food and supplies before learning their flight was canceled. I shared some water with them,\" Armijo said. She added that a building worker told her they were also accommodating those who needed to extend their stay.\n\nArmijo plans to stay put for now and said she isn't especially worried about her safety. Instead, she's thinking about what this could mean for the city.\n\n\"I feel safe in my building, and we have plenty of food and water,\" the Spanish-speaker said. \"It's a minor inconvenience not being able to leave, but my biggest emotions are sadness and concern for the people of Puerto Vallarta.\"\n\nIn the near term, Ingle, the travel security specialist, said he expects to see an impact on the tourism scene.\n\n\"I know there's going to be a blowback in the next month, people deciding not to go, because there's a percentage of the population that doesn't want to take risks,\" he said. \"Governments are putting out warnings, and that affects travel insurance.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the long-term impact, however, Ingle doesn't see this weekend's violence creating a lasting stain on Puerto Vallarta's ability to attract tourists.\n\n\"If all the violence dies down quickly and gets cleaned up, I think this will go away,\" Ingle said. \"Normally, this will take a couple days, and then it will fix itself.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean it's without risk,\" he added.",

    "title": "The best travel purses to use as your personal item on flights, according to a travel writer",
    "description": "As a fashion-forward travel writer, I use a travel purse way more than a carry-on backpack. Here are the most stylish crossbody travel bags I tested.",
    "fullText": "I'll admit, I'm one of the reasons the airport security line is moving so slowly. Once I reach the TSA agent, even if I've rehearsed the interaction for last 30 minutes, I always end up rummaging furiously through my travel tote, where my plane reads, passport, and random lip balms have all mixed.\n\nFinally, I switched over to a designated travel purse. I've found it to be much more useful than a travel backpack because I can wear it throughout my whole trip, rather than just at the airport. The best travel purses I tested have better storage options for a passport, phone, keys, and wallet, offering convenient access in a cute, wearable little package.\n\nFor more on the best personal items we love to travel with, see our guide to the best weekender bags and best carry-on luggage.\n\nTo find the stylish travel purses for staying organized, I tested 10 bags and wore each for at least 5 hours. I wore them in crowded urban areas, on road trips, and through hiking trails. I took note of how heavy they felt and how long it took me to grab things when I needed them, particularly at cash registers and while going through customs. Our team of editors have tested dozens of other crossbody bags on international flights and backcountry road trips, the best of which we added below.\n\nThe genius zippered vertical side pocket keeps everything organized. I wore this medium-sized crossbody bag for errand-filled city excursions, beach days, and a weekend cabin getaway. No other purse I tested felt so well-suited to such a range of environments.\n\nThe interior pockets are helpfully mesh-lined so I could see where everything was the moment I opened the bag. It's hard for me to choose a favorite pocket — there are so many smart ones, including the built-in card holder. \"My favorite part is its vertical zippered side pocket, where I can pull out my phone without taking the bag off my shoulder,\" writes senior associate style editor Gabrielle Chase.\n\nIt's lightweight, buttery soft, and comfy to carry all day. In addition to looking high-end, the leather feels silky-smooth and gentle on my skin. Even when I had the bag stuffed to maximum capacity, the wide adjustable strap lands really comfortably and evenly, never digging into my shoulder or back. It only weighs 10.8 ounces, which is impressive given the amount of storage options.\n\nIt can convert into three different bags. The adjustable, removable strap clicks into the body of the bag, allowing you to wear the Aoyama as a shoulder bag or even a clutch. Having one beautiful, adaptable bag that keeps me organized from the airport to a fancy dinner saves space in my suitcase. This kind of versatility makes the $248 price tag a bit more justifiable. There's also a nylon version that costs $178.\n\nRead \n\nIt's low-maintenance and machine-washable. Made of a durable-feeling recycled nylon, the fabric isn't what you might call \"luxury\"—rather, it's sporty and lightweight, which is far more important to me when I'm lugging suitcases and spilling coffee. Best of all for a messy, outdoorsy traveler like myself is that this Baggu is machine-washable.\n\nThe storage is simple and roomy. The Cargo Crossbody doesn't have as many specialized compartments as the other options I tested. Instead, there's just two exterior pockets and one interior zippered pocket. But the fact that the roomy interior is open gives me the option for all the other stuff I inevitably acquire while traveling. It can comfortably fit a wallet, sandwich, can of Diet Coke, a Nintendo switch, phone and a book, as I learned from my picnic in the park.\n\nIt comes in a variety of cute colors. Mine is a French blue, which adds a fun pop of color to any outfit (just because a bag is utilitarian and practical doesn't mean it has to be plain).\n\nI no longer have to root around in my bag for my phone. Before Bandolier, I'd yet to find an accessory that offers easy, fumble-free, repeated access to my phone, which I use constantly while traveling — checking reservations, looking at Google Maps, or filming my pasta like I'm an influencer.\n\nBandolier's sturdy leather phone case, which has a handy envelope for cards, upgraded my entire life. I can wearing my phone elegantly as a purse, with the crossbody strap clasped directly to the leather phone case. This made it so easy to grab and then \"put away,\" i.e. drop so it simply drapes across my body. The case clasps easily into Bandolier's expanded pouch, which can fit tickets, a thin wallet, a passport, keys, and a lip balm.\n\nThe materials and design feel expensive. Also, it is expensive. Both made of 100% leather, the Expanded Pouch is $98, and the Lily Duet (which is crossbody and wristlet phone case duo) costs $148. The sturdy pouch is a nice addition for a bit of extra storage, but you don't necessarily need to buy both: the phone case and detachable strap are enough.\n\nThe phone case itself is amazing. The back pocket card holder has a snap closure that keeps my credit card and ID secure and hidden. It's much safer than the exposed card holders I had before. I've made this my permanent phone case, whether traveling or not.\n\nThere are so many security features. The locking clasp straps are secure — they even take me a moment to undo when I'm just alone in my house, so I can't imagine how a thief would pull it off. I wore this bag through Times Square to get to a gynecologist appointment, and not for a second did I fear for the precious contents inside it (which included my anti-anxiety meds). Arden Cove makes it with \"slash-resistant lining\" and a hidden back zip pocket where I put my passport.\n\nIt can be worn in four ways. This Bum Bag's adjustable straps let me wear it as a belt bag, fanny pack, chest bag, or crossbody, which is ideal for crowded, high-traffic areas when I want my belongings as close to me as possible. The structure of the bag itself is less flexible than other options, but it allows you to keep everything close to the chest.\n\nThe storage is elite. I'm obsessed with its storage options, which includes two card holders that are perfect for subway cards, business cards, credit cards, IDs, and small tickets.\n\nIt's really comfortable. Away's simple design offers just the right amount of structure and slouch. It's made from a water-repellant polyester till feels cushiony and almost quilted. Even when I filled the bag with snacks, a big book, a Fuji camera, and my notebook, the padding around the strap prevented the bag from digging into my shoulders.\n\nIt has an impressive capacity. The Featherlight Crossbody weighs just over half a pound, yet has a storage capacity of 10 liters. I wore the bag on a bike trail along the Hudson River, to a Phillies game, and to Brighton Beach, where water and sand slid right off. It's also machine washable.\n\nThere are super useful hidden exterior pockets. I used the tiny one on the strap, which is perfect for AirPods or keys, and the other that's ideally sized for a passport and phone. These helped me avoid rummaging around in my bag in front of hotel receptionists and baristas.\n\nThere are so many ways to store things. I especially loved the convenience of the exterior magnetic-closure phone pocket. It has special compartments like card slots and pen loops, with loads of interior and exterior pockets for easy access to everyday items. I found myself constantly using the little loops for pens — a Godsend as mine are always scribbling on the bottom of my bags.\n\nIt looks cool. The Micah crossbody has a really distinctive, athletic look, with fun, chunky zippers. I felt really cool wearing it to yoga class and to the dog park. The 100% vegan material is made from 7 recycled plastic bottles, and it feels durable and sturdy.\n\nIt's lightweight and comfortable. It's can easily fit all the items I want while traveling — like documents, tablets, pens, books, and large headphones — but not something as large as a water bottle (for that, we suggest Dagne Dover's Sloan Sling instead).\n\nIt has a slim profile with a deceptively spacious main compartment. \"I toted it for a long day in New York City, and I appreciated that all my items were secured, but I knew exactly where to find them when I needed to,\" writes style contributor Talia Ergas.\n\nThere are eight pockets total, \"with organizational features galore designed with neat freaks like me in mind,\" says Talia. \"On the exterior, it has a front U-shaped pocket that offers a perfect compartment for stowing my cash and credit cards (in the leather card pocket), keys (via an easy access key leash), a pen (which stays secure thanks to a leather pen loop), and other quick-access items like a passport or tickets.\"\n\nIts lightweight design packs flat. Say you're wearing a backpack on the plane, but still want your Tumi Tyler Crossbody once you reach your destination. You can simply empty out the contents and the water resistant nylon exterior won't crumple, even if you have to smoosh it beneath the rest of your belongings.\n\nIt makes a trendy handbag into a practical purse. East-West bags — the long, skinny silhouette popularized by Alaia's $2,950 Le Teckel — can be horribly impractical. The slim body might be the trendiest shape right now, but I can't imagine squeezing travel essentials like sunscreen or snacks into a purse built like a pencil case. But the Gabrielle Shoulder Bag from Parisa Wang makes this purse trend practical. Not only is it supremely roomy, but it also has lots of functional features like quick-access pockets and handles that feel comfortable enough on your shoulder for all-day wear.\n\nThe elongated shape makes the purse incredibly spacious. I fit a hard-shell sunglass case, a 3.4-ounce bottle of sunscreen, a granola bar, a wallet, a pack of Band-Aids, two lipsticks, a claw clip, and all my little essentials like keys and AirPods in the purse with lots of room to spare. It also has two exterior pockets on either side of the bag, which are perfect for storing quick-access items like tickets or travel documents.\n\nIt works from day trips to dinner reservations. Lots of practical purses tend to lean too heavily into function at the cost of form. But this bag, with its smooth leather and minimalist look, would be chic enough for a stop at a Parisian wine bar after your walking tour. We all know the look of a tourist with their many-pocketed fanny pack, but this purse won't make you look like you came straight from a survivalist retreat. — Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nMaria Yagoda, travel writer and style contributor: Maria is based in Brooklyn, where she covers travel and culture. It's where these two fields intersect that she's witnessed the latest style trends from across the globe. Whether she's flying to Italy or venturing upstate, Maria is intuiting which travel accessories are a worthy investment for most people in terms of convenience, comfort, and aesthetics.\n\nLearn how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes, and accessories at Business Insider.\n\nStorage capacity: You want a travel purse that's small enough to not add bulk, but still has room inside for an umbrella, book, or souvenirs you pick up along the way. I found the ideal liter capacity for travel purses to be around 10 liters.\n\nSecurity features: Look for RFID-blocking compartments to protect your credit cards, and zippered closures. Crossbody bags offer a more secure fit that's harder to swipe off your person.\n\nWeight and adaptability: The more lightweight a travel purse is — and the more ways you can adjust its wide strap to distribute the weight — the more comfortable you'll be throughout your trip. Look for travel purses that weigh between 8 to 10 ounces.\n\nDurability: Look for machine washable, water-resistant materials (like nylon) especially if you'll be doing outdoorsy stuff.\n\nCompartments: Look for travel purses with horizontal and vertical zippered pockets on its interior, exterior, or even carrying strap.\n\nKAAI Rebel Crossbody ($575) This sporty, luxury-grade sling bag has a cool asymmetrical shape and is lined with a beautiful blue suede. Unfortunately it was too narrow and structured to fit anything bulky.\n\nQuince Italian Leather Convertible Crescent Shoulder Bag ($119) This is a well-made Italian leather purse that looks a lot like the very trendy Clare V. Moyen Messenger ($435). It's comfortable to wear, but the internal organization is somewhat minimal.\n\nCuyana Mini Paloma Bag ($398) It's elegant, compact, and has good organizational features, but was just a bit too small for my everyday carry. This one's better suited to minimalist travelers.\n\nCaraa Nimbus ($190) Design-wise, this bag has a very distinctive, cool look. It's kind of fluffy and cloud-like, so it could be used as a travel pillow if you're desperate. The storage space is really flexible and can accommodate quite a lot, but it only has three interior pockets.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "After burning out, I left medical school to live in a van and travel full-time. RV life isn't always easy, but it's worth the incredible perks.",
    "fullText": "At 24, I was living the life I thought I wanted. Surrounded by anatomy notes, six cups of coffee, and a stack of certifications and academic achievements, I was in my first year of med school and on my way to becoming a doctor.\n\nMy life had become a revolving door of lectures, cadavers, and exams that brought me to tears. I worked 12 to 16 hours a day, barely took any breaks, and felt guilty for spending even 30 minutes cooking dinner.\n\nAt first, this all felt worth it for the title, eventual paycheck, and comforting belief that I was helping people. But something inside me whispered: \"This isn't where you're meant to be.\"\n\nBefore starting medical school, I had been working as a first responder during the COVID-19 pandemic. While transporting patients, I'd often strike up conversations to pass the time.\n\nInspired by my own love for travel, I'd ask them about their favorite destinations, and occasionally, I'd get some inspiring stories. More often than not, though, they'd tell me they'd had an entire bucket list planned before they realized how easily life can slip by.\n\nAs I worked tirelessly in school, I realized my patients were right about how terrifyingly easy it is to get sucked into the never-ending cycles of life.\n\nWithin a single year, it felt like I had completely forgotten who I was. The things that once brought me joy — photography, travel, and creativity — were gone. I wasn't living. I was surviving.\n\nSo, after many tears, sleepless nights, and conversations with myself I didn't want to have, I quit school. The decision wasn't easy, and I worried about what my family and friends would think. Most importantly, though, I was scared I'd be letting myself down.\n\nHowever, I knew the lifestyle wasn't sustainable for me, and deep down, I knew I needed a change.\n\nGrowing up in Colorado, I always loved camping. As a kid, I would geek out seeing all the fancy RVs, and I loved speaking with full-time travelers.\n\nI always dreamed about traveling full-time, and living in a van seemed like the most convenient way to do it. After all, your house literally moves with you.\n\nUnfortunately, I labeled that lifestyle a fantasy because of the demanding hours and location-dependent nature of working in healthcare. Once med school was off the table, however, I decided to follow my heart and purchase an RV from a local dealership.\n\nAt first, I didn't have a perfect plan in place for what I'd do next — just a deep craving for adventure and a willingness to figure things out as I went.\n\nWhat I didn't anticipate, however, was how steep the learning curve would be or how deeply it would test me in many ways.\n\nFinancially, the transition was brutal. I juggled multiple remote jobs, freelance contracts, and odd side hustles just to stay afloat while slowly building my own blogging and photography business. Even now, my income comes from multiple streams, and adaptability isn't optional.\n\nPhysically, RV life demanded even more. RVs break all the time. There's no landlord to call, and insurance is frustrating to coordinate because I'm never in the same location for too long.\n\nI've spent nights screaming into my pillow while navigating fixes that cost thousands of dollars, but those instances are balanced by the mornings I practice yoga outside the RV to gorgeous backdrops.\n\nRV life and solo entrepreneurship aren't easy. They require humility, grit, and constant problem-solving. But they've also given me access to over 15 national parks, hundreds of miles of trails, thousands of photographs, and a life that finally feels like my own.\n\nThere are times when I've questioned myself, especially when things go wrong, but I've never questioned my decision to pursue what I love. If anything, I mostly regret losing the financial stability I could've had as a healthcare provider — especially when I'm shelling out money to fix my RV.\n\nWhenever that happens, though, I remind myself that life is hard no matter what path you choose. The beauty is that you get to choose your \"hard.\"\n\nPlus, I take solace in knowing I'm still helping others, just in a different way. These days, healing might look like standing on top of my RV with a cup of tea, watching the sun set over the mountains, and reminding others that they can do the same.\n\nI may not be treating cancer, but through my work, I can help people reconnect with curiosity, creativity, and a sense of aliveness they may have lost. This gives me more purpose than medical school ever did.",

    "description": "Nearly 9,000 flights have been canceled as a winter storm pummels the northeast, alongside a partial government shutdown and cartel violence.",
    "fullText": "Weather, violence, and political quarrelling have combined to make a real headache for American travelers this week.\n\nNearly 9,000 flights were canceled within, into, or out of the US on Sunday and Monday, according to data from FlightAware.\n\nThe vast majority of those came as a winter storm pummeled the northeast. More than 90% of flights out of Newark Liberty, Boston Logan, and LaGuardia Airports were canceled on Monday, with 89% canceled at JFK, per FlightAware.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and issued a travel ban. It was also the city's first blizzard warning for nine years.\n\nWith huge amounts of snow falling and bad weather expected to continue until at least Wednesday, disruptions are likely to be ongoing.\n\nMeanwhile, anybody hoping to find some winter sun in Mexico may have had their hopes dashed.\n\nCartel violence erupted in parts of the country on Sunday after its military killed \"El Mencho,\" the leader of the Jalisco New Generation drug cartel.\n\nPuerto Vallarta, in Jalisco, is a particularly popular destination for US and Canadian tourists. Cars and stores were set on fire there, while airlines canceled 139 flights in and out of the resort town.\n\nOn Monday morning, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a press conference that the situation had de-escalated, saying that an extra 2,500 armed personnel had been sent to the state since the violence began.\n\nWith US citizens in Jalisco and other parts of Mexico advised to shelter in place, many tourists may be rethinking their plans. Some airlines waived change fees for flights to Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara through Wednesday.\n\nIf your flight isn't canceled this week, it's possible that getting to your gate could be more difficult than normal.\n\nThe partial government shutdown is also causing delays and confusion at airport security. Trouble began on February 14 after Democrats and the White House reached a stalemate over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nFederal officials said both TSA PreCheck and Global Entry would be suspended starting Sunday morning.\n\nHowever, the Transportation Security Administration then said PreCheck — which lets travelers move through security faster — would actually still be available.\n\nLos Angeles International Airport had posted on social media that it was diverting all PreCheck customers to general screening lanes, but later removed the post.\n\n\"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly,\" the DHS said in a statement.\n\nGlobal Entry, which speeds up customs screening for fliers entering the US, is still suspended. DHS said officers assigned to process these travelers will be reassigned to process others.\n\nThe shutdown looks set to last longer still.\n\nRepublicans want an extra $64.4 billion in funding for DHS — including $10 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Democrats want reforms in the wake of the turmoil in Minneapolis, as two people there were killed by ICE last month.",

    "description": "I traveled to Africa and South America after high school. The gap year taught me more about adulthood than college ever did.",
    "fullText": "After spending two months watching women and girls fetch water from the village tap and then walk home with the enormous containers balanced on their heads, I had become increasingly determined to try to help with this daily task. I had admired the women's strength before, but as my neck muscles ached and my scalp bruised under the weight, my admiration had only grown.\n\nGambian women's lives were very different from my life in Long Island, New York — and that was exactly the point of my gap year between high school and college.\n\nThe trip consisted of teaching English in Gambia, exercising and caring for the resident horses on a private wildlife reserve in Namibia's Kalahari Region, teaching English in Patate, Ecuador, volunteering at both an elderly care center and an animal rescue in Quito, Ecuador, and exploring the Galápagos Islands.\n\nEighteen years later, I can confidently say that my gap year played a significant role in shaping the person I have become, and that's why I am encouraging my little sisters, who are 18 and 13, to take a gap year after high school as well.\n\nStarting my trip in the Gambia was like being thrown into the deep end of the adulting pool. The only ATM in the country that accepted my debit cards was a six-hour round-trip from the village where I was staying, and it had a daily withdrawal limit.\n\nOvernight, I went from being a financially clueless teenager who asked my parents for a top-up when I needed it, to getting a crash course on setting and sticking to a budget. I quickly learned the value of money.\n\nMy relationship with time was as lackadaisical as my relationship with money. But having people and animals relying on me forced me to develop a sense of time management. This was especially true in the Kalahari Desert, where it was imperative that every worker, visitor, volunteer, and domesticated animal be inside before the sun was directly overhead to avoid heat stroke.\n\nLearning budgeting and time management served me well in college and my career. But these were small nuggets of wisdom compared to the bigger lessons I learned about racism, privilege, and the freedom of life lived offline.\n\nAs a white-presenting Colombian American living in the Gambia, it was only the second time in my life when I looked different from everyone else around me. People stared when I walked through Serrekunda Market, and kids would excitedly yell \"toubab\" (the Mandinkan word for \"white person\").\n\nI did not fault them for their reactions; instead, I did my best to absorb the experience of being treated differently because of the color of my skin. It has since helped me better identify when my unconscious biases arise.\n\nI stepped into my freshman year calm, confident, technologically detoxed, and refreshed after my academically rigorous high school experience.\n\nWhere some of my peers self-medicated their separation anxiety, social anxiety, or overwhelm with binge drinking, I had already had a year to process these emotions and learned to adapt. The result was a smoother transition into academic life, a high GPA at the end of my freshman year, and a maturity that caught the attention of internship hiring managers.\n\nMore importantly, though, it gave me freedom, awareness, compassion, and a global lens through which I still process life.\n\nThis is what I really want for my sisters. I want them to know a life away from the noise and pressure of the digital world. I want them to have the space to learn from and be shaped by different people and cultures. I want them to have a year where they are not pushing themselves to excel academically or professionally, but instead can just learn who they are and what they want to do with their lives.\n\nCollege has become an oppressive financial burden. If they pursue it, I hope they are as mentally and emotionally prepared as possible so they get the most out of their financial investment.\n\nMy sisters would undoubtedly have their own experiences that leave unique imprints on their minds. If that helps them collect themselves before journeying into the messy, confusing world of adulthood, that sounds like a year well spent.",

    "description": "When Lisa Lucas and her husband told their kids about the plan to travel, the youngest daughter cried. They promised it would only be a year.",
    "fullText": "We were racing to keep up with our packed family schedule. Days blurred into school, work, gymnastics, birthdays, and dinner parties — energizing in theory, exhausting in reality. We were scraping by.\n\nI remember peak multitasking: listening to my 6-year-old read aloud while making breakfast, and trying to finish putting on eyeliner while the eggs finished cooking in the pan.\n\nMy husband and I longed for wide-open days to actually connect, but school holidays were never long enough to decompress. We could see how easily the years might slip by, buried in logistics, until suddenly the kids were packing for college.\n\nWe wanted to freeze time. So we hatched a plan to leave our \"normal\" life for a year and have a wild adventure together as a family.\n\nIn July 2024, we rented out our London home, stored our belongings, and took the bus to Heathrow with two backpacks and a carry-on.\n\nWe weren't wandering aimlessly. We planned to live in three locations, traveling for five weeks before and after each stop.\n\nI pivoted my marketing consultancy toward travel writing and speaking, while my husband's academic research guided our shortlist of places we wanted to live. His research enabled legal residency which allowed the girls to attend school. We chose Japan, the US, and the Netherlands, staying three to four months in each.\n\nWe picked Tsukuba, Japan, to immerse ourselves in a completely unfamiliar culture; Great Neck, New York, near where we're both from, to give our daughters a taste of American life and spend rare time with family; and Leiden, the Netherlands, to experience its bike- and water-centered lifestyle.\n\nResidency came with a lot of admin.\n\nFor Japan, we had originally planned to homeschool. Our 8-year-old surprised us by asking to attend a local Japanese school, despite only knowing a few phrases she had picked up during the three weeks we spent traveling around the country.\n\nThe school welcomed both girls. Like their classmates, they walked to school alone, changed into indoor shoes, helped serve lunch, and cleaned the classrooms.\n\nIn New York, we lived with family outside the city. The girls rode a yellow school bus for the first time, while my husband commuted by train. It was a stark contrast to London — no uniforms, more complicated mornings, and the sobering reality of active-shooter drills.\n\nIn Leiden, the girls attended a small international school. Students biked along canals and tended their own garden plots as part of a Dutch gardening program.\n\nLiving out of backpacks forced minimalism. I loved escaping the endless to-do list of home life and focusing on actually living.\n\nI wore a single black maxi dress almost every day in Asia — biking through alleys or hiking through the jungle — and it somehow worked.\n\nIf anything, I'd bring even less next time. With fewer possessions, our mental bandwidth expanded. We could focus on fun, without guilt.\n\nWhen we first told the girls about our plan, our youngest cried. They loved their friends, their teachers, and the rhythm of school. They couldn't imagine leaving and not coming back. We tried tempting them with volcanoes and snorkeling in Indonesia.\n\nThey came around, somewhat. They loved most moments, but they also always wanted to go home. We promised it would only be a year.\n\nOur priority was making them feel safe and secure. We talked about adaptability as a life skill, but we also held them close and reminded them they were loved.\n\nMost days, we'd say, \"We're still on the trip,\" and it made us feel like a team. The girls learned how to be the new kid, make friends, and settle into unfamiliar rhythms. They learned you can reinvent your life more than once.\n\nThe intensity bonded us. We had waterfalls to ourselves, watched wild snow monkeys, and made friends who invited us to visit them in Cozumel. I celebrated my usually grim January birthday on a Thai beach.\n\nIn the US, we were present for heavy family moments, including my grandfather's passing.\n\nReturning to London after 13 months felt surreal. Our 6-turned-7-year-old kissed the ground at Heathrow.\n\nThe trip changed us. It gave us shared memories — Hokkaido cream, a road trip from New York to Miami, sunsets from an Alpine hut — but more importantly, it clarified what matters: slow time together, not renovations or packed calendars.\n\nWe're happy to be home, blender included. But we're already dreaming about our next extended adventure.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share? Get in touch with the editor: akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "The Monday morning commute won't be messy in New York City. It will be nonexistent.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared a state of emergency and a travel ban during a press conference on Sunday as a giant winter storm bore down on much of the Northeast.\n\nThe National Weather Service said to expect blizzard conditions and up to 20 inches of snow over the next 24 hours. Parts of New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts could get up to 25 inches.\n\n\"The state of emergency closes the streets, highways, and bridges of New York City for all traffic,\" Mamdani said. The travel ban begins at 9 p.m. Sunday and lasts until 12 p.m. on Monday. DoorDash, notably, also said it was suspending deliveries Sunday night.\n\nUS airlines, meanwhile, are canceling and delaying thousands of flights. As of Sunday afternoon, airlines had canceled over 3,000 flights and delayed over 2,900, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nNew York City's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports have the highest number of cancellations, followed by Newark Liberty International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Boston Logan International Airport.\n\nAnyone hoping to catch a flight in the region on Monday can also expect major disruptions, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. At LaGuardia Airport, for example, 82% of flights scheduled for Monday have been canceled.\n\nAdding to what will likely be a chaotic 48 hours for travelers, the Department of Homeland Security announced Saturday night that it was suspending TSA PreCheck and Global Entry due to the partial government shutdown.\n\nDespite the announcement, however, TSA Precheck and Global Entry lanes remained open at major airports on Sunday. In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration said it is evaluating the situation \"case-by-case.\"\n\n\"At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,\" a spokesperson said. \"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly.\"\n\nThe federal government entered a partial shutdown earlier this month, delaying funding for some agencies, like DHS. TSA agents are essential workers, so they're still working — for now. During the full government shutdown earlier this year, TSA agents and air traffic controllers went 43 days without a paycheck.",

United have collected four wins and a draw under his guidance, reviving hopes of a top-four finish and a return to the Champions League.\n\nEverton remain in the mix for a Conference League berth and could close the gap on United with a victory. However, they are searching for their first home league win since December, a run that has stalled momentum in the race for a top-six position.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League from 6:30 pm GMT. Subscribers can also stream via the Sky Go app.\n\nDavid Moyes has most of his squad available for the reunion with his former club. Jack Grealish, currently on loan, is sidelined following surgery and is not expected back this season. Jake O’Brien is suspended after his recent dismissal.\n\nFor United, Mason Mount is set to return to the matchday squad after recovering from a minor knock. Matthijs de Ligt remains unavailable with a back issue, while Patrick Dorgu is sidelined with a hamstring injury and is not expected to return until April.\n\nBoth teams enter the game well rested after early FA Cup exits earlier this month. Everton’s recent home struggles contrast with United’s improving momentum under Carrick.\n\nThese are fixtures United must navigate successfully to maintain control of their Champions League ambitions.

They’re a team in tremendous form.\n\n“We all know how difficult a trip to El Sadar is for Real Madrid. I only won one of my trips there as a player.\n\n“We’re very aware of the tough battle ahead, of the opponent’s level, and of the excellent work of their coach. We’re going to prepare in the best possible way, knowing that the three points would be extremely important.”\n\nThe 43-year-old praised the development he has seen from his side since taking charge in January, explaining that “the team has grown a lot in recent weeks.\n\n“We are aware of the demands of this club and we want to keep working. The league season is very long but for me, it has barely even begun.\n\n“We have a very difficult away match, as they all are, and our objective now isn’t to relax because to win every match, you have to be at 100%,” he said.\n\nArbeloa also issued updates on Kylian Mbappé’s fitness, revealing that the Frenchman is “feeling better every day” after returning from a knee injury.\n\nThe former PSG forward featured in Real Madrid’s Champions League meeting with Benfica, and Arbeloa confirmed that “his knee is much better. It’s not completely gone away, but he is feeling better every day.”\n\nOsasuna v Real Madrid kicks off at Estadio El Sadar at 17:30 GMT on Saturday 21 February, with los Blancos able to move five points clear of Barcelona with a win.",

    "fullText": "There was a backlash when No 10 invited online content creators inside its doors. But in a fast-changing media landscape, this solves two problems at once\n\nLast year, No 10 took an unprecedented step: it invited content creators to cross the threshold of Downing Street.\n\nNaturally, the creators all filmed themselves outside the famous door. Once inside, their most treasured possessions, their phones, were taken from them and exchanged for government-approved devices, so they could continue to take photos and record video without breaching security guidelines. At the reception, creators from areas as wide as science, education and travel took part in a networking session at the heart of government.\n\nThis was one of a number of events in 2025. There were also off-the-record breakfasts to talk about how creators might collaborate with the government to reach new and younger audiences. A large part of the work being done by No 10’s New Media Unit was aimed at working with financial education creators to help share new policies being launched by the Treasury.\n\nFinancial content creators were invited to speeches and briefings for the biggest political events of the year. When Anna Brading, a personal finance content creator, entered the No 10 briefing room for the spring statement, she could hardly believe it. Having three kids at a young age meant that she spent her time raising a family and making ends meet by tutoring maths on the side. As she managed her family’s money, she began posting tips online for other mums. Now she was in the room that public health experts had updated the public from during the pandemic. “The day I walked in that room, I had to take a minute,” she says.\n\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\n\nThere was, of course, a backlash as some journalists felt that these creators didn’t have the expertise or clout to hold the government to account, but this may be one of the few areas in which No 10 is getting it right. The unit is attempting to address two unavoidable truths: one, people don’t trust politicians; two, more people are now getting their news from content platforms. Using highly trusted content creators to share news of policies addresses both of these issues at once.\n\nFinancial educator Rotimi Merriman-Johnson, known as Mr MoneyJar, has recorded videos for policies such as changes to the minimum wage for young people. He began making content before training as a financial adviser, and is keen to emphasise that it’s not just about relaying any old information. It’s about consistently sharing quality information that makes a difference to people’s pockets. “Every additional year you spend as a content creator, you become more trusted … It’s not just about the information, it’s about the person sharing the information.”\n\nPolitical journalists, known as lobby journalists, have been permitted to work in parliament since the 1870s, sit in the press gallery watching the Commons floor, and receive briefings from the prime minister’s communication staff. The walls of the room where these briefings happen are lined with now-defunct telephone booths designed to allow reporters to file their copy down the phone. Desks in the members’ lobby, the room in which MPs gather before entering the Commons chamber, are pitted with now-dry ink wells. The bowels of Westminster are knotted with internet cables that sit – quite precariously – on top of old steam pipes. Inviting creators into the heart of government is yet another iteration of British politics and its institutions responding to technological innovation.\n\nSince their introduction more than 20 years ago, social media sites have evolved into “content platforms”. Once, Myspace, Facebook et al were spaces to connect with friends; with the advent of Instagram, they became places to follow lifestyle “influencers”; now they are platforms that host a never-ending stream of “content”. Some of the best creators lean hard into specialisms and niches, and present themselves as experts in specific areas. According to Diane Banks, the chief executive of talent management agency Northbank Talent: “We are in the age of the expert content creator.”\n\nIn many ways, these expert creators are the perfect interlocutors for the Starmer government: they are technocratic and emphatically apolitical. As creator Cameron Smith says: “When I go into these rooms I’m representing my audience’s interests, not the interests of these political parties.” In fact, being non-ideological is integral to the business model. Talent management agencies shy away from polemicists as they are difficult to monetise. Brands don’t like to work with opinions. In this sense, the UK is treading a different path from the US, as the White House has seen an exodus of mainstream reporters who are being replaced by regime-friendly influencers and commentators.\n\nOf course, the creators acknowledge the tension between pushing politicians on issues their audiences may be facing and needing to maintain access. This is especially pressing at a time when so many people feel knots tighten in their stomachs whenever they check their bank balances. There are more than a dozen major news publications in the UK, but millions of individual creators. It’s hard for a government to ignore – to pick an example out of nowhere – the Guardian for long, but easy to cast aside a creator who isn’t playing ball.\n\nCreator Mat Gay says: “It’s a difficult question because while I would love to push a bit harder and talk a little bit more about the things that people are worrying about, to me it’s more important to just get them to the table.” Gabriel Nussbaum believes things are shifting. “They were a little bit rigid at the start,” he says. “They said: ‘Can you submit five questions that you’d want to ask Rachel Reeves?’, for example. And then they’d come back and say: ‘Do you mind not asking question four and five?’” But now, he finds he is given the freedom to question politicians. A government spokesperson said: “We are engaging with content creators, as well as journalists to reach new audiences, ensure we are held to account in a changing media landscape and keep the public better informed about government policies.”\n\nTalking to these creators, I get the sense that they’re diligent and dutiful to their audiences, focused on the policy rather than the politics. Rather than political journalists, they seem to have \n\nKirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the Guardian",

    "fullText": "Newcastle United aim to take a major step towards the round of 16 when they travel to face Qarabag in the first leg of their Champions League knockout phase play-off tonight.\n\nThe Magpies arrive in confident mood following an impressive domestic cup victory, but face a Qarabag side enjoying their best-ever European campaign.\n\nWhile Newcastle are favourites to reach the last 16, the Azerbaijani champions are eager to continue their remarkable journey, setting up a high-stakes European encounter.\n\nNewcastle head into the clash boosted by their recent 3-1 comeback victory over Aston Villa in the FA Cup, with Sandro Tonali delivering a standout display with two goals.\n\nThat victory continued a promising run of results for Eddie Howe’s side as they attempt to balance domestic and European ambitions.\n\nThe Magpies finished 12th in the Champions League league phase to reach the play-offs. Only Arsenal FC conceded fewer goals during that stage of the competition.\n\nNewcastle’s attacking threat has largely come from wide areas, with Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes playing pivotal roles.\n\nThe duo have combined for 70% of the club’s goals in the competition and will again be key figures in breaking down Qarabag’s defence.\n\nMeanwhile, Qarabag have already made history by becoming the first Azerbaijani club to reach this stage of the Champions League.\n\nDespite a heavy defeat to Liverpool during the league phase, they produced impressive results earlier in the campaign and have been dangerous on home soil.\n\nThe hosts rely heavily on forward Camilo Duran, who has scored four goals in the competition and remains central to their attacking strategy.\n\nThis will be Newcastle’s longest-ever away journey in European competition, travelling over 2,500 miles to face Qarabag.\n\nQarabag have conceded 21 goals in the competition, one of the highest totals among teams still in the competition.\n\nThe Geordies will back themselves to score against the home side.\n\nNewcastle have lost just one of their last six European fixtures, while Qarabag have won just one of their last six European matches but boast a strong home scoring record.\n\nHowe faces several injury concerns heading into the fixture, with midfield lynchpin Bruno Guimaraes sidelined with a hamstring problem.\n\nDefenders Tino Livramento and Fabian Schar are also unavailable, while Joelinton, Lewis Miley and Yoane Wissa will be assessed ahead of kick-off.\n\n‘Outstanding goalkeeper’ Nick Pope is expected replace Aaron Ramsdale and start between the posts.",

    "fullText": "When people picture Olympians, they often imagine full-time athletes whose lives revolve entirely around training, travel, and competition. The reality, however, is far more complex — and often far more relatable. For many American Olympians, elite sport does not come with the kind of financial stability people assume. Sponsorships can be limited, prize money inconsistent, and training expenses constant. As a result, many athletes build parallel careers that look surprisingly ordinary — or, in some cases, completely unexpected.\n\nSome balance technical professions that demand intense mental focus, while others work hands-on jobs that require physical endurance very different from their sport. A few take on roles connected to their athletic world, but many step into industries that seem worlds away from Olympic arenas. From engineering labs and finance offices to artistic studios and equipment workshops, these day jobs reveal a side of Olympians rarely seen during televised competitions.\n\nWhat makes these stories compelling is not just the contrast, but the discipline required to sustain both worlds at once. Training schedules, recovery routines, and international travel must coexist with deadlines, customers, and professional responsibilities. In many cases, these careers are not temporary stopgaps but meaningful pursuits that provide stability, identity, and long-term direction beyond sport.\n\nLooking at the surprising day jobs of 15 American Olympians offers a powerful reminder: behind the extraordinary performances are individuals navigating very practical realities — working professionals who chase excellence both on the clock and on the world stage.\n\nRyan Cochran-Siegle helps run his family’s maple syrup farm in Vermont when he’s not racing down mountains. The physical, hands-on nature of farm work mirrors the endurance and discipline he needs in alpine skiing. It’s a grounded lifestyle that keeps him connected to family traditions even while competing on the world stage.\n\nKorey Dropkin works in real estate, helping clients buy and sell homes while also competing internationally in curling. He’s described juggling two full-time commitments — negotiating deals off the ice and chasing medals on it. The flexibility of real estate makes it one of the few careers that can adapt to Olympic-level travel.\n\nCory Thiesse works in a wastewater testing lab, analyzing chemicals as part of environmental monitoring. Her scientific job provides stability and helps fund her training schedule. Balancing precision in lab work with precision on the curling sheet shows just how structured her daily life must be.\n\nPark City's Paige Jones ski jumps in mixed team at the Milano Cortina Olympics https://t.co/DHb1ctesFQ pic.twitter.com/ymsMhCMEjE\n\n— TownLift (@TownLiftNews) February 13, 2026\n\nPaige Jones is pursuing a degree in biomedical engineering alongside Olympic ski jumping. She has said academics help her mentally reset from the intense focus of competition. Her studies also hint at a long-term career path beyond sport, showing how Olympians often prepare for life after the Games.\n\nMorelle McCane has worked several jobs, including performing as a children’s birthday party clown. It’s a striking contrast to her fierce persona in the boxing ring. The mix of gigs reflects the hustle many athletes rely on to finance their Olympic dreams.\n\nBradley Wilson sells artwork to help pay for his skiing career. What began as a creative hobby during the offseason turned into a genuine income stream. His artistic side offers both financial support and a mental break from the intensity of competition.\n\nChris Plys runs his late father’s food brokerage business while competing in curling. Managing a company requires leadership and decision-making — skills that translate well to high-pressure matches. His dual role shows how family responsibilities and elite sport often overlap.\n\nLea Ann Parsley works as a firefighter, a job that demands strength, composure, and quick reactions. Those same qualities are essential in skeleton racing, where split-second decisions matter. Her career embodies a literal commitment to service both on and off the track.\n\nSusan Dunklee works in environmental science, focusing on issues related to conservation and ecology. Her profession aligns naturally with her outdoor sport, which depends on pristine winter landscapes. It reflects a personal investment in protecting the environments where she trains and competes.\n\nTabitha Peterson works in pharmacy, helping patients manage medications and health care needs. The attention to detail required in dispensing prescriptions mirrors the precision of elite curling. Her medical career provides both financial security and meaningful work beyond sport.\n\nTara Peterson practices dentistry while competing internationally. The technical skill and steady hands needed in dental work parallel the control required in curling strategy and delivery. Her career shows how athletes can maintain highly specialized professions alongside elite competition.\n\nAlex Deibold works as a snowboard wax technician, preparing boards so they perform optimally in changing snow conditions. The job keeps him deeply connected to the technical side of the sport, even when he’s not competing. His expertise with equipment gives him an insider’s understanding of performance that many athletes never fully develop.\n\nKimi Goetz works part-time as a processor at a finance company, handling paperwork and transactions between training sessions. The role demands accuracy and focus — skills that translate directly to the precision required in elite speed skating. Her office work helps provide steady income while she pursues competition at the highest level.\n\nKeely Cashman works as a barista at her family’s coffee shop. The job keeps her grounded in everyday routines when she’s not racing internationally. It’s a reminder that even elite athletes often return to ordinary work between competitions.\n\nAustin Florian works as an aerospace engineer, applying advanced physics and engineering principles in a highly technical professional environment. His analytical mindset and problem-solving skills mirror the precision and control required in skeleton racing. Balancing a demanding STEM career with Olympic training highlights the intellectual and physical discipline he maintains year-round.\n\nThese athletes remind us that Olympic greatness doesn’t exist in isolation from everyday life. Their day jobs reveal resilience, adaptability, and determination that extend far beyond competition. Whether managing businesses, working technical roles, or supporting communities, they embody the idea that excellence can thrive in multiple arenas at once. Their stories make the Olympic journey feel not just inspiring, but deeply human.\n\nOLYMPICS: 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings entering February 16\n\nNFL Draft: 3 shocking 2026 NFL Combine snubs, full list of prospects attending\n\nNFL: Tennessee Titans’ new logo leaked in Fanatics mishap?\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Logan Paul’s Pikachu Illustrator sale price sets Guinness World Record\n\nNEWS: Nancy Guthrie kidnapping case reportedly gets DNA breakthrough\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post Surprising day jobs of 15 American Olympians appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "A powerful Valentine’s Day storm destroyed a centuries-old seaside arch in southern Italy long associated with romance, dealing a blow to local tourism and highlighting concerns about coastal erosion ...",
    "fullText": "An Italian coastal beauty spot known as “Lovers’ Arch” because of its popularity with courting couples collapsed during heavy storms on Valentine’s Day in what one local official called “a blow to the heart.”\n\nFaraglioni di Sant’Andrea, the site of an arch in the stone cliffs on the coast of Salento — the heel of Italy’s “boot’ — has drawn romantically inclined visitors for centuries, with lovers traditionally proposing marriage, stealing first kisses or celebrating unions. Those who kissed under the arch were destined for eternal love, according to local legend.\n\nBut when a powerful storm swept across southern Italy over the weekend, the arch’s fragile structure gave way, reducing it to a pile of rubble.\n\nIts collapse has dealt a “devastating blow to the image of Salento and to tourism,” Maurizio Cisternino, mayor of the town of Melendugno, near the fallen arch, told CNN. “It’s a blow to the heart.”\n\nThe arch was formed by centuries of harsh wind and high seas grinding away at the Calcarenite stone cliffs of Italy’s Puglia region, on the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea. The site, once a strategic lookout used to warn of pirates, became a magnet for lovers during the late 18th century.\n\nInstagram photos have drawn thousands more couples to the arch in recent years, Cisternino said. Because it’s free and open to the public, it’s impossible to know exactly how many, he added.\n\nLorenzo Barlato, a local resident, proposed to his wife on the clifftop overlooking the arch more than 40 years ago and the pair often returned for anniversaries.\n\n“I couldn’t wait to return,” he posted on Facebook after Saturday’s collapse. “Now, unfortunately, all I have left are the many beautiful photos I took of that piece of paradise.”\n\nThe area is so popular that hotels and resorts — many named for the arch — have sprung up to accommodate visitors.\n\nWarmer sea temperatures as a result of climate change are seen as a factor in driving the extreme weather that battered the arch, which had already been damaged by Cyclone Harry in January.\n\nBut concern over the landmark’s fragility goes back years.\n\nIn 2024, local authorities applied for a $4.5 million grant to fund a preservation project to combat coastal erosion, but failed to secure the money, according to Cisternino.\n\n“It’s a tragedy we knew was inevitable, we just didn’t expect it to happen so soon,” he told local media on Sunday.\n\nHe told CNN that “nature has reclaimed the arch, just as it created it,” and said that resources were needed to tackle the situation along the coast.\n\n“Nature has been transformed: what was there 30 years ago is no longer there.”\n\nThe collapse follows weeks of violent storms across southern Italy. In Sicily, a landslide recently saw houses fall into a ravine in the town of Niscemi. Widespread flooding has taken the lives of several people, including a man who died when his home collapsed near Rome last week.\n\nNow gone, the remnants of the arch will be left to wash out at sea, the municipality says. “It’s like a funeral,” Puglia tourism councillor Francesco Stella said Sunday of what was once one of the happiest places in Italy.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — British and Canadian citizens can enter China without a visa starting Tuesday, bringing to 79 the number of countries granted visa-free access in a bid to boost tourism and business.\n\nChina has expanded eligibility for the program significantly in the last two years. Visitors can stay for up to 30 days for business, tourism, exchange programs and to visit family and friends.\n\nMost Europeans qualify for visa-free entry, along with some from select countries in other regions including Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.\n\nCitizens of a few other countries, including the United States and Indonesia, can enter for 10 days if they are in transit — meaning they have a ticket departing for a different country than they arrived from.\n\nBusiness executives and tourists have welcomed the change, as the China visa application process can be a relatively cumbersome one.\n\nThe U.K. and Canada are being added following visits to China last month by their prime ministers, Keir Starmer and Mark Carney. Both are relatively new leaders who are trying to revamp ties with Beijing after a downturn in recent years.\n\nFor most countries, the visa-free access expires at the end of this year, but it has been extended in the past.",

    "fullText": "Brentford travel to face non-league Macclesfield on Monday night while they aim to avoid becoming the latest victim of the competition’s ultimate giant-killers.\n\nThe Bees moved into the top seven of the Premier League after a string of impressive results, including a recent 1–1 draw against leaders Arsenal. Manager Keith Andrews oversaw a comfortable 2–0 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the third round to reach this stage. Notably, there are 122 league places between these two sides. A victory tonight would see Brentford reach the fifth round for only the second time in nearly two decades.\n\nKeith Andrews navigates a demanding schedule that necessitates rotation. Notably, he is likely to name talisman Igor Thiago among the substitutes to preserve fitness. Consequently, 19-year-old Kaye Furo is poised to lead the attack. This could mark his professional debut. Nathan Collins returns to the heart of the defence after a period on the bench. Conversely, Kevin Schade misses out through suspension. Long-term absentees Fábio Carvalho and Josh Dasilva also remain unavailable.\n\nHakon Valdimarsson starts in goal. He provides Caoimhín Kelleher a well-earned rest after recent Premier League heroics. Nathan Collins partners Ethan Pinnock in a formidable central defensive pairing. In midfield, Yehor Yarmolyuk and Jordan Henderson control the tempo alongside Mikkel Damsgaard. Further forward, Romelle Donovan and Reiss Nelson provide the threat from wide areas. Notably, Brentford have never faced non-league opposition as a top-flight side in the FA Cup.\n\nBrentford predicted XI: Valdimarsson; Hickey, Collins, Pinnock, Henry; Yarmolyuk, Henderson, Damsgaard; Donovan, Furo, Nelson\n\nThe FA Cup fourth-round tie takes place at the Leasing.com Stadium on Monday, 16 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 19:30 GMT.\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports 1 and TNT Sports Ultimate.

    "fullText": "The cancellation of the official House delegation to the annual Munich Security Conference has drawn pushback from Democrats who still plan to attend, even as it’s upended a decades-long tradition of robust bipartisan participation in the high-profile global policy forum.\n\nA House leadership aide told The Hill that cancelling congressional delegations (CODEL) is standard operating procedure during the shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nBut House Democrats have sharply criticized Republicans for the cancellation, arguing that attending the conference is critical to restoring the United States’ standing with allies amid the Trump administration’s aggressive foreign policy approach.\n\n“Because of the Republican shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, because Republicans refuse to make any compromises or any changes to ICE after the deadly murders of Alex Pretti and Renee Good, we have a shutdown, and therefore, we cannot go on official CODELS. I’ve decided, along with a number of my Democratic colleagues, to go anyway,” Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.) said in a video statement on Thursday.\n\nAnsari said she wants to make clear that Trump “does not define the United States, that we are committed to our allies, to NATO, to U.S. credibility and leadership around the world.”\n\nRep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), who also attended the conference, told NBC News on Friday that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had ordered the hotel reservations, military flights and credentials lawmakers had for the conference to be cancelled.\n\nCrow called it the “wrong move,” NBC reported, saying that U.S. officials other than Secretary of State Marco Rubio need to be present at the event.\n\nWhile lawmakers aren’t prohibited from going and House Democrats are still widely planning to attend the conference on their own dime, it is unclear whether any House Republicans will be present. Unlike Johnson’s move to cancel the delegation, several bipartisan Senate delegations will still be attending the conference.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will be attending in her “personal capacity” as a member of the Munich Security Conference Advisory Council, her spokesperson Ian Krager told The Hill in a statement.\n\n“Her presence reflects decades of leadership on transatlantic collaboration and underscores the importance of sustained U.S. partners at a moment of profound geopolitical uncertainty,” Krager said. “Speaker Pelosi remains committed to strengthening partnerships that advance collective security, economic prosperity and democratic governance.”\n\nSome of the other House Democrats present at the conference include Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and Sarah McBride (D-Del.).\n\n“Some of us are going over anyway on our own dime to reassure and thank our allies,” Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, had posted on X.\n\nOcasio-Cortez used a panel discussion at the conference on Friday to prop up the working class and accuse Trump of tearing “apart the transatlantic partnership.”\n\n“One of the reasons why not just myself, but … many Democrats that are here as well, is because we want to tell a larger story, that what is happening is indeed very grave, and we are in a new era, domestically and globally,” Ocasio-Cortez said on the panel, when asked about the significance of her representing the U.S. at the conference.\n\nRep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), a senior member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Politico that it’s a “shame” lawmakers could miss the key conference.\n\nHowever, he added that: “It’s a very responsible position by the Speaker which matches the irresponsibility of the Senate Democrats to shut down the government. And so the responsible act is to be ever available to end the shutdown.”\n\nThe White House and Democrats have been at an impasse over a deal to fund DHS. A stopgap measure that temporarily funds the department for two weeks expired on Feb. 13.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have been demanding sweeping reforms to the White House’s immigration tactics, including an overhaul of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, after agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minnesota. While the White House sent a counterproposal to Democrats on their DHS demands, the minority leaders have argued that the offer falls short.\n\nThe Senate left Washington on Thursday without reaching a deal and DHS shut down at midnight.",

So what did Death Stranding 2 originally look like?

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A former high-ranking official in the New York Police Department has been charged with accepting $35,000 in cash, luxury travel perks and other bribes from a Florida businessman seeking to sell panic buttons to the city’s public schools and police.\n\nIn an indictment Thursday, federal prosecutors said Kevin Taylor attempted to steer an $11 million contract toward the company, SaferWatch, while serving as the commanding officer of the NYPD’s School Safety Division. The company markets its product as a “mobile panic alert system” used for mass shootings and other emergencies.\n\nIn exchange, the company’s founder, Gene Roefaro, showered Taylor and his romantic partner with gifts — including luxury hotels and airfare to the Bahamas and Las Vegas, helicopter tours, tickets to Broadway musicals and a “medieval-themed dinner theater” — along with multiple cash payments, prosecutors said.\n\nTaylor pleaded not guilty to bribery and wire fraud charges on Thursday. An emailed inquiry to his attorney was not returned.\n\nRoefaro is also facing charges, including bribery and wire fraud. He has not yet entered a plea. An attorney for Roefaro said it was “puzzling and deeply concerning that the United States Attorney’s Office has chosen to pursue charges against Geno, while at the very same time, alleging — and seeking to prove — that he was the victim of an extortionate shakedown.\"\n\nThe charges are the latest allegations of corruption and favor-trading lodged against officials appointed by the city’s former mayor, Eric Adams, who faced his own indictment in a separate bribery scheme that also involved luxury travel gifts.\n\nWhile the case against Adams was later abandoned by the Trump administration, at least some of the probes into his inner circle remain active, including an ongoing bribery case involving his former chief advisor. In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have announced bribery charges against two other NYPD officers and a former housing official under Adams.\n\nThe investigation into SaferWatch first emerged in September 2024 as part of a sprawling federal probe into the Adams administration. The company was one of several to hire a consulting firm run by the brother of two top Adams officials, both of whom resigned after their homes were searched by federal authorities.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that in 2023 Taylor helped secured a no-bid contract to pilot Roefaro’s products within the command center of the NYPD’s school safety division. But as the police official struggled to expand the program, Roefaro grew frustrated, at times describing himself as a “sugar daddy” who had “made a MAJOR investment and zero return,” according to the indictment.\n\n“It’s been fun, but it’s not fun or funny anymore,” Roefaro allegedly texted Taylor in late 2023. “Our company (ME) needs to report something real and significant that is in place prior to end of year.”\n\nDays later, Taylor tried to put together a press conference to announce his division would be procuring a tip line from Roefaro's company, prosecutors said. But that event was later cancelled.\n\nDuring roughly the same time, Taylor was also attempting to solicit $75,000 in bribes from two businessmen involved in a company that sold bullet-resistant vests to police, according to the indictment. Both men declined his solicitations, prosecutors said.",

    "fullText": "The Scottish Premiership title race continues to deliver fascinating twists and turns, while the battles for European spots, top-six places and to pull clear of the bottom remain hugely compelling.\n\nHeart of Midlothian's late Edinburgh derby triumph on Tuesday, coupled with Rangers' draw in Motherwell, kept the Tynecastle side beyond touching distance of either Old Firm side.\n\nFalkirk have strengthened their grip on a top-six berth, while Livingston lost further ground on Kilmarnock and Dundee above them.\n\nHere are some of the key things to look out for on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nRangers out to apply pressure as Hearts aim to 'annoy'\n\nDocherty to assist as Aberdeen prepare for summer appointment\n\nO'Neill urges Celtic to buy Saracchi - gossip\n\nA last-gasp goal from Stephen Welsh, on loan to Motherwell from Celtic, denied Rangers the opportunity to unseat Hearts at the league summit when they head to Ibrox on Sunday.\n\nThe 1-1 draw at Fir Park leaves Danny Rohl's side five points adrift of the pace-setters from Gorgie.\n\nTime and again, Hearts' mettle has been questioned. And, at every turn, they have come up with the answers.\n\nHaving lost to St Mirren, they faced a Hibernian side thirsting to inflict more damage on their rivals' title bid but found their way to another derby winner in the dying embers.\n\nHearts continue to heap pressure upon the Glasgow two. They have beaten Rangers and Celtic at Tynecastle and in their respective strongholds at the other end of the M8.\n\nA draw would do for Derek McInnes and his team. However, Hearts know, and have shown, they have what it takes to prevail in Govan.\n\nRohl has resurrected a sinking ship at Ibrox and his January additions look well chosen.\n\nThis will be the sternest test yet of Rangers' championship credentials and, more pointedly, their capacity to handle the mental burden.\n\nCeltic signings have made a habit of fanfare this season.\n\nKelechi Iheanacho, Junior Adamu and, now, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have netted late winners on their debuts.\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain is the highest profile of the lot. The former England midfielder had not played a competitive match since his final outing for Besiktas in May before bending in a fabulous strike to sink Livingston in the 92nd minute on Wednesday.\n\nThe 32-year-old has clear pedigree. \"A very, very, very, very fine player,\" was interim manager Martin O'Neill's assessment.\n\nQuestions were asked about his readiness to contribute amid familiar ire about the Celtic board's transfer strategy.\n\nWhile Oxlade-Chamberlain can do little to address the latter gripe, he certainly calmed the former.\n\nWhat role, and for how long, O'Neill gives his new signing on Kilmarnock's artificial pitch remains to be seen, but his class and experience could yet prove pivotal at the pointy end of the campaign.\n\nJust two months ago, Dundee United dispatched Wilfried Nancy's Celtic at Tannadice to move within four points of fifth place. Things were looking up after an oscillating first half of the campaign.\n\nIn the seven league games since, Jim Goodwin's side have won a single match, against basement dwellers Livingston.\n\nIn fact, those victories against the champions and the bottom side are United's only triumphs since late October, a run of two wins in 15 matches.\n\nTheir assignment on Saturday is among the toughest in the top flight - a trip to high-flying Falkirk, who already look to have earned an unassailable foothold in the top six.\n\nCeltic, Hearts and St Mirren are the only teams to emerge with three points from the Falkirk Stadium this season.\n\nGoodwin and his players are in danger of being mired in a relegation fight, perched as they are five points clear of 11th-placed Kilmarnock, albeit with two games in hand.\n\nSt Mirren and Dundee are two points behind United having played a game more. Only the bottom two have conceded more goals.\n\nGoodwin did not mince his words after watching his team's late collapse to Hibs at Easter Road last Wednesday, a 2-1 lead dissolving into a 3-2 defeat in stoppage time, with both goals the product of balls into the box.\n\n\"Defensively pathetic at times,\" was the manager's verdict.\n\nWith the midweek visit of Aberdeen postponed, Goodwin has had a few more days to stew on that defeat.\n\nHe, and his charges, need a reaction.",

    "fullText": "Amid President Donald Trump's repeated targeting of the country with threats and insults, Canadian travel to the U.S. has remained at record low levels. This is despite early analyst predictions that the initial nosedive, occurring when Trump introduced 25% tariffs in February 2025, would reverse.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2026, Canadian airlines are still running 10% fewer seats on flights to the U.S. than they had in 2025, while statistics from the Canadian government show that the number of car trips from Canadians crossing the border to return home has hovered at more than a 20% decrease for months.\n\nCanadian airlines Air Canada, WestJet, Flair Airlines, and Air Transat have also responded by significantly reducing their network of flights to smaller U.S. airports.\n\nA Montréal-based carrier flying Canadians to many popular vacation destinations, Air Transat will now completely cut all U.S. service by phasing out its flights to Florida from Montréal and Québec City by June 2026, Travel Weekly reported.\n\nThe airline's flight between Montréal-Trudeau International Airport (YUL) and Orlando International (MSO) will run for the last time on May 4, and the flight from Québec City (YQB) and Fort Lauderdale (FLL) will end on May 30. The last flight between Montréal and Fort Lauderdale will run on June 13.\n\n\"This decision is part of a strategic review of our program aimed at focusing our resources on markets where we are well positioned and that allow us to optimize the deployment of our resources,\" spokesperson Marie-Eve Vallières Vallières said in a statement to Canadian outlet Travelweek. \"Florida represents a market where our exposure remains very limited and that is more fragile in the current context.\"\n\nAir Transat has not yet confirmed whether another two of its seasonal routes to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU) in Puerto Rico from Montréal and Toronto will return in December.\n\nAir Transat's main market still comes from resort cities such as Cancun and Punta Cana, but in the last year, it has significantly expanded its network to new destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. It is also launching new routes to more faraway countries such as Senegal, Albania, and Iceland.\n\n\"Air Transat's presence in the United States remains very marginal today, representing only 1% of our available seat‑kilometer capacity for the summer,\" Vallières said further.",

    "fullText": "Some parts of the US might still be in the peak of winter, but down in the sunnier states, people are already bringing out their bathing suits.\n\nAs a Florida local of nearly a decade, some of my favorite days are the ones when I slow down, bask in the sun, and breathe in fresh air while tubing down a crystal-clear spring, surrounded by the peaceful sounds of nature.\n\nUnlike the rowdy tourist beach towns or overcrowded theme parks, this is the Florida I've come to know and love.\n\nAway from tourist hot spots such as Disney World or Miami Beach, Florida offers hidden gems for all tastes, whether you're more nature-inclined or want to explore towns that will make you feel like you're in Europe.\n\nAfter living in the state for nearly a decade, I found that the best travel destinations in the state are far from the most famous.\n\nWhether you're escaping from cold weather or planning a summer trip to Florida, here are seven towns you should visit.\n\nWhen picturing a Florida beach vacation, you might think of Miami Beach or maybe Clearwater Beach if you're aiming for the Gulf Coast. If you're looking to avoid tourists, however, I recommend visiting the beaches near Jacksonville.\n\nThe North Florida shores in Ponte Vedra are mostly lined with single-family houses along the A1A road and can be far from downtown areas, making it the perfect escape if you're looking to relax rather than party.\n\nMany of these houses, which are often winter homes for their owners, can be rented as Airbnbs, making them ideal for family or group vacations.\n\nThe Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve, a 73,000-acre stretch of wild nature, is also the perfect spot to hike and kayak saltwater marshes while exploring Florida's wildlife.\n\nThe oldest town in the US, St. Augustine, was founded in 1565 by Spanish settlers. Today, the city offers a picturesque destination for those looking for history and charm.\n\nWhether you're enjoying its nearby beaches or immersing yourself in medieval Spanish culture in the city's historic district, St. Augustine offers a wide range of activities for families and history enthusiasts.\n\nDuring your time here, make sure to tour the Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, the oldest fort in the US, and walk along the cobblestoned streets of the historic downtown, like St. George Street, which features a 1716 schoolhouse and dozens of restaurants and boutiques.\n\nEvery holiday season, from November to January, the historic district is illuminated for the city's \"Nights of Lights\" showcase. Walking through it feels like strolling through a Christmas postcard, only with palm trees and Spanish castles instead of snow.\n\nOriginally settled in the 1840s, this tiny community in Florida's Nature Coast — the stretch of the Gulf Coast between Tampa and Pensacola — may not be on your travel radar, but if you enjoy fresh seafood and less crowded areas, it should be.\n\nCedar Key is a small island located about a 2 1/2-hour drive from Orlando and is one of the largest producers of farm-raised clams in the country. You can enjoy fresh, delicious seafood while sitting on the shore of Florida's undiscovered coast.\n\nThe quiet town is often compared to the more touristy Key West, which was Jimmy Buffett's home and inspiration. In Cedar Key, you can also enjoy some of the signature Key West attractions — such as key lime pies and small local boutiques — without dealing with the crowds.\n\nAs a foodie myself, I can only tell you how amazing the seafood in Cedar Key is. The rest you will have to experience for yourself.\n\nIf you're more of a nature person, head over to Ocala to enjoy clear freshwater springs and Florida forests.\n\nThe springs near Ocala are amazing for kayaking or just for taking a dip. While kayaking in the river streams, you might spot some alligators, manatees, and even monkeys.\n\nAdditionally, the area is home to one of America's only elephant rescue farms, Two Tails Ranch, and the longest ziplines in the state at the Canyons Zip Line and Adventure Park.\n\nSome of the best beaches in Florida — and the world — are in Sarasota.\n\nSiesta Key, which has been named as the best beach in the US and fourth best in the world, is a pristine white-sand, turquoise-water beach perfect for families or for relaxing.\n\nThe city also offers a variety of art sightseeing, such as Ca' d'Zan, the Mediterranean-inspired mansion at the Ringling Museum.\n\nIf you're driving from Tampa, prepare to cross the tallest bridge in the state, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. At its peak height, I felt like I was flying on an airplane looking down.\n\nNear the space-themed attractions at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral is Cocoa Village, a small historic downtown filled with local vendors and plenty of art.\n\nThe small coastal town also has a variety of food spots for every occasion, including an English tavern, a French bistro, and a fully vegan New American restaurant.\n\nAnd if you're looking for a unique experience, you can kayak or paddle the bioluminescent waters of the Indian River Lagoon — you might see a few dolphins, too.\n\nIf you're making your way down the Florida Keys, you may as well stop to visit a couple of its gorgeous beaches.\n\nWhile Key West deserves the hype it receives as a travel destination, some of the other spots in the Florida Keys are often overlooked.\n\nSouth of Marathon Key and north of Key West is Sombrero Beach, one of the most underrated beaches in the US. On this white-sand beach, you can enjoy some of the calmest waters in Florida, perfect for families or for relaxing.\n\nIt's also a turtle-nesting spot, so you might even see a few loggerhead turtles during nesting season.\n\nFor a fun historical sight, head a few minutes down the Overseas Highway, and you'll see some of the remnants of the once-active Overseas Railroad in Bahia Honda Key.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal travel to Brentford on Thursday night, aiming to preserve their six-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.\n\nThe Gunners have moved into February with immense momentum, following four consecutive victories that have solidified their title charge. Manager Mikel Arteta oversaw a dominant 3–0 success over Sunderland last weekend, ending the day nine points clear before Manchester City’s late comeback at Anfield. Arsenal arrive in West London seeking a fourth consecutive clean sheet, a defensive feat they last achieved during a record-breaking streak in late 2024.\n\nMikel Arteta navigates fitness concerns regarding several key creative figures. Notably, a persistent hip injury keeps Bukayo Saka on the sidelines. Furthermore, Martin Ødegaard remains a major doubt after missing the last two matches with a minor muscle issue. Consequently, Kai Havertz likely retains his place in a deeper midfield role. Leandro Trossard adds to the headache; he limped off against Sunderland with a calf injury.\n\nDavid Raya starts in goal. Riccardo Calafiori likely features in the defensive line ahead of him, though Piero Hincapie offers a viable alternative. In midfield, Declan Rice and Martin Zubimendi aim to dictate the tempo. Up front, Viktor Gyökeres returns to the starting lineup. He scored twice off the bench last weekend. Gabriel Martinelli and Noni Madueke support him in a revamped attack.\n\nArsenal predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday, 12 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nLive television coverage will be available in the UK on TNT Sports 1. Extended highlights will be shown on Match of the Day on Friday night.\n\nArsenal predicted lineup vs Brentford.

    "fullText": "Premier League leaders Arsenal travel to the Gtech Community Stadium on Thursday night, aiming to banish a peculiar midweek curse and maintain their six-point advantage at the top of the table.\n\nThe Gunners arrive in West London having “banished their January blues,” recording four consecutive wins across all competitions, including a clinical 3–0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday. However, Mikel Arteta’s side faces a historical hurdle: despite an impressive overall midweek record, Arsenal have failed to win—or even score—in any of their last three Premier League games played specifically on a Thursday. Standing in their way is a high-flying Brentford side that has emerged as the season’s “surprise package”. Under Keith Andrews, the seventh-placed Bees have won their last two matches, including a dramatic 3–2 triumph at St James’ Park last weekend.\n\nDate: Thursday, 12 February 2026\n\nVenue: Gtech Community Stadium, London\n\nLast Meeting: Arsenal 2–0 Brentford (2 Dec 2025), Premier League\n\nKeith Andrews remains without Kevin Schade, who serves the second of a three-match suspension for violent conduct. Reiss Nelson is ineligible to face his parent club, while long-term absentees Fabio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo, and Josh Dasilva continue their recoveries. After a strong showing in Newcastle, the Bees are expected to remain largely unchanged, though Yehor Yarmolyuk is pushing for a start in midfield.\n\nMikel Arteta faces several late fitness calls. Bukayo Saka (hip) and Martin Ødegaard (muscle) both missed the Sunderland win and remain doubtful for the derby. Leandro Trossard is also a major doubt after sustaining a calf issue late against the Black Cats. However, Viktor Gyökeres is poised for a recall to the starting XI after his decisive brace off the bench last weekend.\n\nThe Gunners have maintained a high level of performance in local fixtures. Notably, Arsenal have lost just one of their last 23 Premier League London derbies (W17 D5). Defensively, they arrive in peak condition, having kept three consecutive clean sheets in all competitions heading into Thursday’s clash. However, the “Thursday curse” remains a concern, as the team has failed to score in their last three league outings on this specific day.\n\nThe Bees have turned their home ground into a nightmare for visitors. Notably, Igor Thiago has been in sensational form, netting nine goals in his last 10 home matches—a tally bettered only by Erling Haaland this season. Brentford also boast a clinical edge, with an xG per shot of 0.16, the best by any Premier League team in the last five seasons. While they are winless in eight against the Gunners, their current form suggests they are more than capable of an upset.\n\nBrentford Predicted XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Van den Berg, Ajer, Henry; Janelt, Henderson; Ouattara, Jensen, Lewis-Potter; Thiago\n\nArsenal Predicted XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Havertz, Zubimendi, Rice; Madueke, Gyokeres, Martinelli\n\nThe match will be televised live in the UK on TNT Sports 1, with coverage starting at 19:00 GMT ahead of the 20:00 kick-off. Fans in the United States can stream the action exclusively on Peacock Premium.\n\nRead more- Lineker jokes that Mainoo should sue former Man United boss Amorim\n\nSee Also- Every Premier League team ranked by their five-year net spend\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick faced the media on the eve of a massive Copa del Rey semi-final clash against Atletico Madrid at the Metropolitano.\n\nThe Blaugrana travel as defending champions, but the challenge ahead is clear, with Diego Simeone’s side known for their intensity and organisation in knockout ties.\n\nFlick began by confirming that Marcus Rashford will not be part of the squad for the first leg, dealing a blow to Barcelona’s attacking options.\n\nSpeaking about the English forward’s condition, the manager said,\n\n“Rashford isn’t ready. He took a knock. It’s not good news, but I believe in my team. The situation isn’t easy. We’re playing against a fantastic team.\n\n“I saw the cup game against Betis, and it was impressive. Cholo [Diego Simeone] is doing a great job at Atletico. I really appreciate what I saw. It’ll be a tough game tomorrow.”\n\nThe German coach also revealed that Raphinha is unlikely to feature, stressing the need to protect the Brazilian from further issues.\n\nRaphinha and Rashford will miss this match. (Photo by Judit Cartiel/Getty Images)\n\nProviding an update on the winger, Flick explained, “Step by step. We have to take care of him. He’s a player who gives his all with great intensity.\n\n“If he feels something, we have to be careful. That’s the situation. I’m not happy because we need him, just like Pedri, Gavi, Andreas, and Marcus.\n\n“He’s feeling something in his muscles and we have to take care of his body. We have to support him and keep an eye on him.”\n\nLooking ahead to the two-legged tie, Flick emphasised the importance of managing the full 180 minutes rather than just the first leg in Madrid.\n\n“These two games will decide who goes through to the final. That’s the goal for both teams. Last season was tough. We played at home first.\n\n“It’s two games, 180 minutes, and we’re ready to go to the final.”\n\nWith both Rashford and Raphinha unavailable, questions were raised about the left-wing position.\n\nFlick kept his cards close to his chest, saying, “We have a very clear idea of who will play and who is doing well.”\n\nWhen asked about the difficulty of playing Atletico away, the Barcelona boss insisted his focus remains only on the upcoming match.\n\nHe responded, “I’m just focusing on the game against Atlético, I don’t like to look at other things. Statistics are fine for you guys, but I don’t think about them.\n\n“Atletico deserves respect because they’re a fantastic team, coach and club. We like to test ourselves against these opponents.”\n\nThe coach also made headlines when he was asked about Barcelona’s route to the semi-final.\n\nHe chose to reference Real Madrid’s shock defeat to Albacete, simply stating, “Ask Real Madrid,” in response to suggestions that Barcelona had an easier path.\n\nHe later clarified his remarks, stressing the need to respect lower-division sides. Flick said,\n\n“It doesn’t help me to talk about Real Madrid. I thought it was the right response because we have to respect the Second and Third Division teams in the Cup, who have had a fantastic Cup run.\n\n“It’s about respecting your opponents. The other teams have qualified, they have the quality and they have shown that they can beat First Division teams.\n\n“That’s all there is to it. I just have to focus on my club, my team, my fans, and that’s all I’m interested in. The rest is just a waste of energy.”\n\nFlick shared his thoughts on Araujo’s situation. (Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images)\n\nThe manager also spoke about Ronald Araujo, highlighting the defender’s mental strength after opening up about his struggles.\n\nFlick explained, “We know the situation with Ronald. He has opened up, and we have supported him as much as we can.\n\n“Opening up like that means you are strong. In football, it’s all about mentality and focusing on winning. Someday I’ll talk about everything.\n\n“When he says he was like that for a year and a half, it’s important to take care of the players.\n\n“You have to think about it. As a coach, you have to take responsibility for all the players. You have to think about more than just what’s good for you.”\n\nOn Jules Kounde, Flick praised the defender’s mentality and fighting spirit. He said,\n\n“Jules is a fighter. We’re human and maybe you can’t have the best day, but he’s always fighting. Even when he doesn’t start well.\n\n“I appreciate what he’s doing. He has a top mentality. Tomorrow he’ll prove it. It will be a difficult game for everyone. I like what I see from Atlético, with a clear philosophy.”\n\nFinally, the German coach reserved special praise for teenage sensation Lamine Yamal, who continues to grow in importance for the team. Flick noted,\n\n“I’m very happy with everything I see from him. On the pitch, he’s always capable of deciding games in the right direction.\n\nHe’s a great player and has everything we like in football: dribbling, one-on-one.\n\n“He’s very good to watch. I’m very happy with what I see. In training, he always wants to improve, and that’s good.\n\n“He has to improve, and he can improve a lot in the coming years,” he concluded.",

    "fullText": "Joanelle Cobos began actively job hunting in January after being laid off by Amazon in October.\n\nAfter three prior layoffs, she'd prepared financially for a fourth — which came at Amazon.\n\nThe financial cushion let her relax after the layoff, but the pressure is now setting in.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Joanelle Cobos, a 38-year-old job seeker who lives in Las Vegas. She previously worked for Amazon as a design manager until being laid off last October. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLast October, I was getting ready to head to the office when I noticed two text messages from Amazon that looked like spam, asking me to click a link or check my email. I soon learned that after nearly four years with the company, I'd been laid off — my third layoff since 2019 and the fourth in my career.\n\nSince I'd dealt with job losses so many times, I don't think this layoff affected me emotionally as much as it did some of my coworkers. The idea of having so much free time ahead of me was exciting.\n\nNow, my job search feels like a ticking time bomb, but I'm not in a rush to jump into another large corporation.\n\nBusiness Insider is speaking with workers who've found themselves at a corporate crossroads — whether due to a layoff, resignation, job search, or shifting workplace expectations.\n\nShare your story by filling out this form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29.\n\nAfter dealing with nine months of unemployment during my previous layoff, I'd started planning my life around the possibility of losing my job.\n\nI was also preparing to be laid off at Amazon, because my tenure had been plagued by whispers of voluntary resignation programs and job cuts, basically once a year. My job never felt particularly secure.\n\nBecause of the financial cushion I'd built, the paychecks I would receive from Amazon during my continuation period, the severance that followed, and my experience dealing with layoffs before, I didn't feel immediate financial pressure.\n\nRather than jump into the job hunt, I decided to take a pause from October through the end of the year. This time period felt a little like a paid vacation, and given that it overlapped with the holidays, it was almost the perfect time to get laid off.\n\nThen January came. I'd done some research in the prior months to help inform my next career move, but I knew I'd have to ramp up my job search.\n\nI've started actively applying for jobs — including creative project management and creative operations management roles — but I haven't had much success landing interviews yet. I'm not too stressed for now, but I know my paychecks and severance won't last forever; I'll eventually need additional income to stay afloat financially. Accounting for my severance and emergency fund, I have about 10 to 12 months before I run out of funds.\n\nI've had a hard time staying employed at large corporations for any extended period of time. I've been either laid off or left because the pay and benefits weren't good enough. For now, I'm targeting roles at smaller companies that may not be able to pay as much as a larger company, but where I wouldn't feel like just a \"number\" and the job security might be better.\n\nSmaller companies might also offer more work-from-home flexibility. Prior to the layoff, I'd been required to work from the office five days a week, which was about 45-to-50 minutes each way of commuting. I was still the only one in my office on my team, so there was no in-person collaboration for me to benefit from.\n\nI'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business, though I'm not sure what this would be yet. If my job search drags on, I'd be open to exploring more freelance and contract roles.\n\nAfter my previous layoff, I landed a job at Amazon in part because I had a relative who worked there. I doubt my résumé would have been seen without an employee referral. I'm still looking for my break this time around.\n\nTo boost my chances, I've been using generative AI tools to help with résumés, cover letters, and identifying roles I might be qualified for. It's made the job search far less stressful. What used to take a full day now takes just a few hours.\n\nI have two main pieces of advice for others who have been laid off, including other affected Amazon employees. First, take the time to be upset, but don't stay in that headspace too long because that doesn't help you. Layoffs aren't personal — they're a business decision.\n\nSecond, before looking for a new job that is very similar to your prior role, consider whether it's the best fit for you. If you can swing it financially, take some time to think about where you want to go and what you want to do.\n\nWhile job searching can be frustrating, it's also given me the opportunity to reexamine what I want in my career. If there's anything good that's come from the layoff, it's that it's forced me to take time to reflect.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Parents who owe a significant amount of child support soon could lose their ability to travel internationally as the Trump administration expands and steps up enforcement of a 30-year-old law that allows the federal government to revoke American passports until payments are made, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press.\n\nWhile passport revocations for unpaid child support of more than $2,500 have been permitted under 1996 federal legislation, the State Department had in the past acted only when someone applied to renew their travel document or sought other consular services. In other words, enforcement depended on the person approaching the department for assistance.\n\nStarting soon, however, the department will begin to revoke passports on its own initiative based on data shared with it by the Health and Human Services Department, according to the U.S. officials familiar with the plan. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the change has not yet been publicly announced.\n\nThe number of people who could be affected was not immediately clear, but it is believed to be in the thousands. Because of the potentially large universe of those owing child support who currently hold passports, the State Department will make the change in tiers, the officials said.\n\nThe first group to be affected will be passport holders who owe more than $100,000 in past-due child support, the officials said. One of the officials said fewer than 500 people meet that threshold and could avoid having their passport revoked if they enter into a payment plan with HHS after being notified of the pending revocation.\n\nThe official acknowledged, though, that if and when the threshold is lowered to a smaller past-due amount, the number of those affected will rise significantly. The official could not say when any further changes would take effect or estimate how many people might then lose their passports.\n\nIn an emailed response to the AP's queries about the change, the State Department said it \"is reviewing options to enforce long-standing law to prevent those owing substantial amounts of child support from neglecting their legal and moral obligations to their children.” It added: “It is simple: deadbeat parents need to pay their child support arrears.”\n\nSince the Passport Denial Program began with the 1996 passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, the initiative has taken in nearly $621 million in past-due child support payments, with nine collections of more than $300,000, according to the Office of Child Support Enforcement at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS did not respond to questions about how many people are in arrears.",

    "fullText": "Cuba has warned airlines that it has no jet fuel, forcing some carriers to cancel flights, add refueling stops, or carry extra fuel.\n\nCuban aviation authorities issued a monthlong advisory on Monday that said jet fuel is unavailable at all of the country's international airports.\n\nThe country relies heavily on Venezuela for much of its jet fuel, but supplies have been hit by US sanctions that have constrained Venezuelan oil exports. President Donald Trump has also threatened tariffs on countries that sell oil or petroleum products to Cuba.\n\nBecause of this, the country is running out of jet fuel, and therefore, airlines cannot refuel their planes on the island.\n\nFrom the US, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Southwest Airlines all operate direct flights to Cuba.\n\nAmerican and Delta said they are operating as usual. In a statement to Business Insider, Southwest said that it was requiring any aircraft flying there to also carry enough fuel to reach its next destination.\n\nSome Canadian airlines are canceling flights entirely.\n\nAir Canada, which had operated 32 flights a week to and from Cuba before, said it would suspend service to the country on Monday.\n\nIt will send empty planes to pick up some 3,000 customers who have already traveled to the island. These flights will be loaded with extra fuel, although the airline said refueling stops on the return leg may also be necessary.\n\nCanadian airlines WestJet and Air Transat also said they would operate empty aircraft to help their customers. Air Transat said it would suspend flights to Cuba until at least April 30.\n\nSeveral international airlines serve Cuba, and many of them are still operating flights. However, some of these will have to stop to refuel elsewhere.\n\nAir Europa, a Spanish airline, said its flights from Havana to Madrid would stop in Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic, about two hours away.\n\n\"We apologise for any inconvenience this situation, which is beyond Air Europa's control, may cause you,\" it said in a travel alert.\n\nIberia, the Spanish flag carrier, Air France, and Turkish Airlines also fly to Cuba. They did not immediately respond to requests for comment, although it seems likely the distance would necessitate a refuelling stop.",

Prior to the layoff, I'd been required to work from the office five days a week, which was about 45-to-50 minutes each way of commuting. I was still the only one in my office on my team, so there was no in-person collaboration for me to benefit from.\n\nI'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business, though I'm not sure what this would be yet. If my job search drags on, I'd be open to exploring more freelance and contract roles.\n\nAfter my previous layoff, I landed a job at Amazon in part because I had a relative who worked there. I doubt my résumé would have been seen without an employee referral. I'm still looking for my break this time around.\n\nTo boost my chances, I've been using generative AI tools to help with résumés, cover letters, and identifying roles I might be qualified for. It's made the job search far less stressful. What used to take a full day now takes just a few hours.\n\nI have two main pieces of advice for others who have been laid off, including other affected Amazon employees. First, take the time to be upset, but don't stay in that headspace too long because that doesn't help you. Layoffs aren't personal — they're a business decision.\n\nSecond, before looking for a new job that is very similar to your prior role, consider whether it's the best fit for you. If you can swing it financially, take some time to think about where you want to go and what you want to do.\n\nWhile job searching can be frustrating, it's also given me the opportunity to reexamine what I want in my career. If there's anything good that's come from the layoff, it's that it's forced me to take time to reflect.",

    "fullText": "Leeds United will look to continue their exciting run of form when they travel to face resurgent Chelsea on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Whites arrive in a confident mood following an impressive victory at Elland Road over the weekend.\n\nHowever, Leeds face a significant test against a Chelsea side enjoying a perfect Premier League record under new boss Liam Rosenior.\n\nWhile the hosts are pushing for Champions League qualification, Leeds are focused on pulling further clear of the relegation battle, setting up a clash with plenty at stake.\n\nLeeds have shown clear signs of progress in recent weeks, winning three of their last five league matches.\n\nTheir latest outing saw them claim a commanding 3-1 triumph over Nottingham Forest in West Yorkshire.\n\nDaniel Farke’s side raced into a three-goal lead through Jayden Bogle, Noah Okafor and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, with the latter continuing his productive campaign.\n\nLeeds currently sit 16th in the table and hold a six-point cushion above the relegation zone.\n\nAnother positive result against Chelsea would significantly strengthen their survival hopes as the season moves towards its final stretch.\n\nMeanwhile, Chelsea have rediscovered momentum under Rosenior. The Blues have won each of their four Premier League fixtures since his arrival.\n\nOver the weekend, they claimed an eye-catching 3-1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers, powered by Cole Palmer’s historic first-half hat-trick.\n\nThe West London side sits fifth in the standings and remains firmly in the race for a top-four finish.\n\nHowever, Chelsea have struggled in midweek fixtures this season and will be wary of Leeds, who already beat them 3-1 earlier in the campaign.\n\nChelsea are unbeaten in their last seven home league games against Leeds, winning the previous six meetings at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe Whites last recorded a victory at the ground in 1999.\n\nLeeds are chasing a league double over Chelsea for the first time since their title-winning 1991/92 campaign.\n\nChelsea are winless in their three midweek Premier League fixtures this season.\n\nLeeds have lost seven of their 12 league matches away from home this term, collecting just seven points on their travels.\n\nFarke is expected to keep faith with the side that impressed over the weekend. The German tactician has largely benefited from a near fully-fit squad heading into the clash.\n\nAnton Stach, 27, remains Leeds’ main injury concern as he continues to struggle with a hip problem.\n\nDan James has returned to the matchday squad and is pushing for his first start since November after recovering from a hamstring injury.\n\nCalvert-Lewin is set to spearhead the attack once again, supported by Okafor, who should retain his place in the XI.\n\nLauded by Farke as a player with ‘special ability’, Okaford could prove decisive in West London.\n\nKarl Darlow; Joe Rodon, Pascal Struijk, James Justin; Jayden Bogle, Brenden Aaronson, Ethan Ampadu, Ilia Gruev, Gudmundsson; Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Noah Okafor.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United will travel to face West Ham United tomorrow evening following a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe Red Devils have played the Hammers 157 times in their history, winning 74 matches.\n\nWest Ham have won 50 matches, and there have been 33 draws between the two sides.\n\nHere are three storylines to look forward to.\n\nManchester United struggled against most sides last season as they slumped to a 15th-place finish in the league.\n\nThe BBC reports, “West Ham did the double over Manchester United last season, and drew 1-1 at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture this season.”\n\nIn addition, “only once have they avoided defeat in both league meetings with the Red Devils in consecutive campaigns, doing so in 1932-33/1933-34.”\n\nThe Red Devils have also lost four of their last six matches against the Hammers.\n\n“Having lost two of their first three Premier League away games this season, Manchester United have now lost just one of their last nine on the road (winning four and drawing four).\n\nMore specifically, they have also won their last two league games away at London sides.\n\nThe Red Devils have not won three times in a row in the capital in the same season since January/February 2019.\n\nThere is no doubt that United’s increased competency on the road has been a significant factor in their much improved Premier League results this season.\n\nThe Brazilian has been one of the best signings in the league this season.\n\nAlongside Bryan Mbeumo, he has completely transformed United’s attack and has scored against Arsenal and Fulham in recent matches.\n\nThe BBC reports that, “Matheus Cunha has had a hand in four goals in his last five away Premier League appearances for Manchester United (three goals, one assist).”\n\nSurprisingly, though, he has never scored in five Premier League games versus the Hammers, only facing Manchester City more without scoring (six matches).\n\nHe will certainly be looking to rectify this on Tuesday night.\n\nFeatured image Matt McNulty via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "Why more CEOs and boards are worrying about security: 'The risk is everywhere.'",
    "description": "Threats to executives are pushing companies like Starbucks and Disney to boost CEO security and mandate the use of corporate jets for personal travel.",
    "fullText": "For decades, executive security followed a familiar playbook: Most CEOs traveled freely at home, accepted protection only in high-risk foreign countries, and treated personal safety as a private concern rather than a boardroom imperative.\n\nMentions of exec security protocols are popping up in more proxy filings, and companies like Starbucks are changing corporate jet policies due to what it calls \"significant heightened security concerns.\"\n\nThese moves follow the December 2024 killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City and a shooting at a Park Avenue office building about eight months later.\n\nBoth instances shattered long-held assumptions that corporate leaders were at least somewhat insulated from the types of violence more often associated with politicians or celebrities, several security executives told Business Insider.\n\nThere isn't a distinction between low-, medium-, or high-risk anymore, said Dale Buckner, head of the security firm Global Guardian, which works with Fortune 1000 companies.\n\n\"The risk is everywhere,\" he said.\n\nThe news of the disappearance of \"Today\" co-host Savannah Guthrie's mother, Nancy, has only added to a sense of unease for high-profile leaders, several of these execs said.\n\nBuckner, a retired US Army colonel who served for more than two decades, said his firm has briefed more boards in the past 11 months than in the previous 14 years combined. Increasingly, Buckner said, boards view CEOs and other C-suite members as assets that must be protected, even if some leaders are leery of perceived constraints on their freedom.\n\n\"The board is overruling the CEO who is going, 'I don't need this,'\" he said.\n\nIn regulatory filings, companies have begun to spell out their decisions. Starbucks said last month that, following a security review, it recommended that CEO Brian Niccol use company aircraft for both personal and work travel. While it's made that recommendation before, the company lifted a spending cap it had in place for personal travel and will instead review those costs each quarter.\n\nUnlike in its previous proxy a year earlier, Starbucks also cited \"the existence of credible threat actors.\"\n\nThose concerns extend beyond the coffee chain.\n\nDisney requires Bob Iger, who is set to step down as CEO next month, to use company aircraft for both business and personal travel. A security consultant identified \"bona-fide, business-related security concerns\" for Iger, Disney said in a January filing. That language didn't appear in the company's prior filing.\n\nMeatpacking giant Tyson Foods said it hired a consultant during its fiscal year that ended in September to review risks associated with its senior management team \"based on the evolving security environment for corporate executives.\" One resulting change: requiring certain execs to use company aircraft for both business and personal travel.\n\nProxy filings by large US public companies that mention \"executive security\" or \"corporate security\" rose from 69 in 2023 to 87 in 2025, according to an AlphaSense analysis.\n\nRepresentatives from Starbucks, Disney, and Tyson Foods didn't respond to Business Insider's requests for comment on the nature of the threats executives face.\n\nWhile high-profile CEOs have long had protection in high-risk zones, Buckner said what's grown more common is keeping executives under a 24/7 safety umbrella.\n\nBuckner said that the protocol for one of his protectees, a Fortune 500 CEO, includes 18 armed agents, camera surveillance of the executive's home, and monitoring of its WiFi network. A former garage on the property now serves as an \"op center,\" he said.\n\n\"I have two to four roving armed agents around their home, 24 hours a day,\" Buckner said.\n\nIt can be a challenge to determine whether something that starts as disapproval over a company or leader could morph into something more nefarious, security veterans said.\n\nA threat might start out as a joke in poor taste, and a group targeting a company might pick it up. Then, all of a sudden, it becomes a real risk, said Lisa Kaplan, founder and CEO of the risk-intelligence firm Alethea.\n\nCaleb Gilbert, founder of White Glove Protection Group, a security firm serving large companies and family offices, said the range of people who feel threatened has widened over the past six months.\n\n\"The reality of risk is resonating with more people. And that's different than I've seen in the last 30 years,\" he said.\n\nOne reason is that the cadence of high-profile incidents — from the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in 2024 to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September — hasn't seemed to slow, Gilbert said. While attacks on business leaders remain rare, many nonetheless feel rattled, he said.\n\n\"It used to be where something bad would happen, there'd be time in between, and the executives would forget about it,\" Gilbert said. Now, \"with the security-minded glasses that they put on, it's brought everything into focus.\"\n\nThe cost of protection is part of that view. A small protective detail can cost about $1 million a year, while a full-scale operation can reach $30 million, he said.\n\nIn some cases, Gilbert said, even without a board's prodding, executives are \"willing to give up personal liberties that they cherished before for the sake of feeling safe.\"\n\nThe apparent kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie could lead to demand from executives to detect threats against parents, Kaplan said. Typically, she receives requests from executives to monitor risks to their children.\n\nBuckner said he recently spoke to a group of CEOs in Washington, DC, on security threats. Many reported feeling unnerved, he said.\n\n\"It's palatable,\" he said. \"They're scared that they're in a new world order. They're not quite sure how to navigate it.\"",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace travel to the South Coast on Sunday, aiming to end a dismal nine-match winless run in the Premier League.\n\nThe Eagles have moved into a precarious position, sitting 15th and on the brink of the relegation zone. Manager Oliver Glasner oversees a side that has struggled for goals recently. Palace have underperformed their Expected Goals (xG) by over eight goals since mid-December. However, they remain resilient in derbies, having drawn seven of their last 13 meetings with Brighton. A result today is vital to ease mounting pressure on the squad.\n\nOliver Glasner manages a squad bolstered by the return of its primary midfield anchor. Notably, Adam Wharton is available to start after serving a one-match suspension. However, Eddie Nketiah is set to miss out through injury. Consequently, the manager is expected to rely on Ismaïla Sarr to provide the goals. Sarr has nine goals this season and scored twice on his last visit to the Amex.\n\nDean Henderson will start in goal behind a defensive back three featuring Maxence Lacroix. Daniel Muñoz and Tyrick Mitchell will provide the width from wing-back positions. In midfield, Wharton will partner Will Hughes to provide defensive stability. Yeremy Pino and Brennan Johnson will support Sarr in a flexible front three. Palace must find a clinical edge to avoid becoming the league’s lowest scorers since Matchday 16.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted XI: Henderson; Richards, Lacroix, Riad; Munoz, Hughes, Wharton, Mitchell; I. Sarr, Pino, Johnson\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the American Express Stadium on Sunday, 8 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 14:00 GMT.\n\nUK fans can watch the match live on Sky Sports Main Event.

    "fullText": "Manchester City travel to Anfield on Sunday, aiming to complete their first league double over Liverpool since 1937.\n\nThe Citizens have moved within touching distance of the top spot. However, manager Pep Guardiola oversees a side that has historically struggled at this venue. City won the reverse fixture 3–0 in November. They arrive in Merseyside seeking to break a curious scoring drought in 2026. While they have not conceded in the first half this year, they are yet to score a second-half goal. A victory today is essential to keep pressure on league leaders Arsenal.\n\nPep Guardiola manages a squad nearing full strength as key senior figures return to training. Notably, Rúben Dias and John Stones are both back in contention for a starting spot. However, Bernardo Silva remains a doubt following a knock sustained last week. Consequently, Tijjani Reijnders could occupy a central role. Rayan Cherki remains their primary creative outlet, creating three chances per 90 minutes.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma will start in goal behind a defensive line featuring Marc Guéhi. Nathan Aké and Rayan Aït-Nouri will provide the width from full-back roles. In midfield, Rodri will anchor the side alongside youngster Nico O’Reilly. Erling Haaland is expected to return to the starting XI after being rested midweek. Haaland faces a personal challenge, as Anfield is one of only two grounds where he has never scored.\n\nManchester City predicted XI: Donnarumma; Nunes, Guehi, Ake, Ait-Nouri; Rodri, O’Reilly; Cherki, Reijnders, Semenyo; Haaland\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at Anfield on Sunday, 8 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 16:30 GMT.\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event.

    "description": "A couple started The Box Hop, a shipping container vacation home business. They are making $1 million in revenue but have decided not to expand.",
    "fullText": "There are several reasons to visit Hocking Hills, a foliage-rich region in the Appalachian foothills of Ohio: the majestic views, year-round outdoor adventures, and the chance to escape overwhelming city life.\n\nThe six shipping container homes dotting the region are another.\n\n\"Right now, I feel like the big push is experiential hospitality for people. It's no longer just staying at an Airbnb,\" Emily, 38, told Business Insider. \"What does it look like? What does it feel like? What's the experience like when you're there?\"\n\nWhile shipping containers might conjure visions of warehouses or loading docks, Seth and Emily Britt believed they could create a successful business transforming the storage units into modern vacation destinations. They earned over $1 million in revenue last year through their business, The Box Hop, which launched in 2018.\n\n\"When Emily and I were dating, I mentioned to her that someday I want to build a house out of shipping containers,\" Seth, 36, told Business Insider. \"Then she actually brought it back up in 2017, like, 'Hey, why don't we do that and chase that dream down?'\"\n\nNow, they have six vacation rentals and a wedding venue called The Seventy Five Venue. The couple also expanded their services to include construction, interior design, and cleaning.\n\nHowever, building their real estate portfolio involved making tough calls, including making the decision to downsize.\n\n\"I thought by now we would have a lot more properties, but I'm really glad we're where we're at because you can grow so much that you implode,\" Seth said.\n\nScaling a business is a tricky feat that has stumped major companies like WeWork, let alone small, family-owned operations trying to do the same thing.\n\nThey built their first rental home in 2018 by placing two shipping containers side by side and setting a third container on top, with the third facing the opposite direction. The three-bedroom, two-bathroom home has a rooftop patio, hot tub, full kitchen, and access to 18.5 acres of land.\n\n\"As soon as we built The OG, we were booked 100% every night for two years, and we booked out in advance a year,\" Seth said. \"We quickly realized we needed to increase the supply just to try to keep up with the demand.\"\n\nBuilding more vacation rentals in Hocking Hills was a natural step, but Emily and Seth also set their sights on new horizons: North Carolina and Michigan. The couple purchased the properties in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n\n\"We're dreamers and were ready to jump into the next thing headfirst,\" Emily said.\n\nPreparing to scale took several steps, including applying for a loan, purchasing the properties, and gaining approval to move forward with the projects. While most business owners might have cheered and gone full steam into the expansion, Seth and Emily hesitated.\n\n\"The only thing that stopped us was the fact that the interest rates were so high,\" Emily said. \"It would almost be a wash for the business. There wasn't a lot of profit there, so it would have to run extremely lean, and it would not be for a huge amount of return.\"\n\nPlus, Emily and Seth live in Ohio, meaning they would likely have to pay other companies to maintain their properties, squeezing the budget and profits even more.\n\nWhen business owners get caught at a crossroad like this, Seth said it's important to start with the question \"why?\"\n\n\"Is it just to make more money? What's the point? \" Seth asked.\n\nAs enticing as branching out seemed, they ultimately sold the North Carolina property in 2023 and the Michigan property in 2025.\n\n\"We were super proud that we got it that far and had the option to continue, but in order to pace properly and not bite off more than we could chew, we said, 'Okay, it's not the time for that approach. We're in a critical time to save and profit.'\"\n\nAlthough Emily and Seth stepped back from those two projects, they've continued to push The Box Hop forward.\n\n\"People always joke about rentals being passive income. It's not passive, but there's a lot of freedom, fun, and beauty in what we do. She's stuck with me all the time, so it's been good,\" Seth said, referring to Emily.\n\nIn addition to more vacation rentals, the couple now wants to offer their interior design and construction services to short-term rental owners across the country.\n\n\"We have a business partner that we've been working tirelessly for two years to figure out how do we take The Box Holp and expand it,\" Emily said. \"People from all over the nation and all over the world are saying, 'How do we get one of these?'\"\n\nShe added: \"We'll play more of the middleman role by bringing all of the pieces of the puzzle together and figuring out how to do it.\"\n\nManaging their business is a full-time job, but Emily and Seth wouldn't want it any other way.\n\n\"My workweek now is a heck of a lot harder than it was working 40 hours a week in a manufacturing facility, but we have more freedom,\" Seth said. \"We're not missing our kids' sporting events, and we're able to be present. That's been huge.\"",

    "description": "Wales travel to Twickenham and the usual tight finish does not seem likely. Can Steve Tandy turn expectations on their head?",
    "fullText": "A prod, a nudge and the memories spilled out.\n\nFor England hooker Jamie George, it was Tom Jones, Scott Gibbs, 1999 and all that.\n\nA Wales team relocated to Wembley and, with eight-year-old George's godfather Kevin Bowring recently on their coaching staff, staged a glorious late heist.\n\nTeam-mate Alex Coles' mind went back to 2017 - Jonathan Davies' shanked kick, Owen Farrell's long pass and Elliot Daly sliding in for another galloping, grandstand finale.\n\nThe past five Six Nations meetings between England and Wales at Twickenham have been decided by two, four, three, six and four points respectively.\n\nNot always as memorable as 1999 or 2017, but always tight.\n\n\"It's hostile, there's confrontation, they are tough games,\" remembered George, when asked about the nature of England's matches against Wales.\n\n\"You feel it in the stadiums that you play at - at the Principality, at Allianz - there's a different energy in the crowd.\"\n\nBut the energy last March was different, in a different way\n\nEngland ran amok in Cardiff. Ten tries, a record 68 points against Wales, and a run on the scoreboard that crashed confidence in one of the most reliable contests in the calendar.\n\n\"There's not many Test matches you get to sit in late and smile, enjoy and take in without thinking of a message, a decision, or a substitution that might be needed,\" said Richard Wigglesworth, England's senior assistant coach, of last year's victory.\n\nThat he should be afforded that luxury in Cardiff was once unthinkable.\n\nThe bookmakers predict a similarly leisurely final quarter for Wigglesworth and his team on Saturday, though.\n\nTheir best guess of England's winning margin is 30 points - a difference, 2025 apart, not seen in a competitive meeting between England and Wales for 20 years.\n\nThey were world number ones in 2019. They were Six Nations champions in 2021.\n\nBut, with a stellar generation of players heading into retirement, they have lost 11 straight Six Nations matches, with successive wooden spoon finishes to show from 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe form on the Test arena has been accompanied by a reorganisation of the domestic game that has opened old wounds and inflicted fresh ones, with no resolution in sight.\n\nThe combination has sent Welsh public belief plummeting to uncharted depths.\n\nAt the time of writing, 43% of respondents to a BBC Sport poll predict another Six Nations whitewash for their side.\n\nThousands of Principality Stadium tickets - once devoured in a daffodil-clad frenzy - remain unsold.\n\nRobin McBryde, who represented Wales as both a coach and player, provided the most devastating diagnosis, back in February 2025.\n\n\"It seems rugby has lost it's soul in Wales,\" he said. \"I don't think anyone is enjoying themselves, there's not a lot of people watching the game. It's just very sad.\"\n\nAnd things are even more grim 12 months on.\n\nPower, width & barnstorming Earl - how England attack sparked into life\n\nWales have belief to pull off shock - Wainwright\n\nRees-Zammit and the question we're all asking\n\nEngland v Wales - your guide to the Six Nations date\n\nSteve Tandy is the man attempting to mould something out of the mess.\n\nThe 46-year-old, who represented Neath and Ospreys - the tradition most under threat as the Welsh Rugby Union streamline their regional system - became Wales head coach in September.\n\nHis reputation was built on forging suffocating defences for teams to build from. Scotland and the British and Irish Lions have both benefited.\n\nLeicester have too. Tandy came in for a short stint while Wigglesworth was coaching there.\n\n\"He seemed like a really good bloke and very switched on for what he did,\" said Wigglesworth.\n\n\"I've always been really impressed with the teams he's been involved in. All the coaches who have worked with him as well, speak highly of him - he's a good coach.\"\n\nEngland have predicted that, as such, Tandy will attempt to level the pitch by taking to the skies.\n\nHead coach Steve Borthwick suggested as many as 50 contestable kicks could be coming the way of his back three.\n\nA lot of them would need to fall Wales' way for the visitors to emerge victorious on Saturday, though.\n\nIf they do, it would rank as arguably the biggest shock in the fixture's 145-year history.\n\nIf, more feasibly, England - with title aspirations - inflict another thrashing, those nip-tuck, nose-to-nose inferno finishes of years gone by would seem even more distant.\n\nDamage limitation instead of dreams of victory occupy the minds of most Wales fans.\n\nGeorge says he has no fears over the long-term competitiveness of the rivalry.\n\n\"I don't think it'll be a problem,\" he said.\n\n\"I think Wales are going to be a good team moving forward. I think they're going to be a good team on Saturday.\"\n\nGood enough? By the high standards set by this match in the past? That still seems some way off.\n\nSaturday, 7 February, 16:40 GMT\n\nListen to full match commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and on the BBC Sport website and app alongside live text commentary\n\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "title": "Canadians are staying away from the US — and the drop in travel is getting hard to ignore",
    "description": "Statistics Canada data show fewer Canadians traveling and returning from the US, amid ongoing border fears, tariffs, and the \"Buy Canadian\" movement.",
    "fullText": "Canadians aren't visiting the US as much as they used to.\n\nData from Statistics Canada up to November showed that fewer Canadians returned from the US — indicating fewer visited the US — than in the past couple of years.\n\nJulian Karaguesian, a visiting lecturer in the economics department at McGill University in Montreal and former special advisor in the International Trade and Finance Branch in the Department of Finance Canada, told Business Insider that several factors are contributing to reduced Canadian travel to the US, including an immigration crackdown and President Donald Trump's rhetoric on both trade and turning the country into the 51st US state.\n\n\"We started to see from summer onwards, a lot of protests, a lot of activity by ICE, rhetoric and talk about calling in the National Guard to clean up cities,\" Karaguesian said. \"I think that scared away a lot of tourists.\"\n\nThe number of Canadians returning from the US plunged during the pandemic, and never truly recovered to its pre-pandemic average. After some recovery, it took a massive slip in early 2025 and is down about a quarter from a year ago in November. Statistics Canada data also showed that US residents entering Canada haven't had as large a drop from the start of the year as Canadian residents returning did.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadians are doubling down on what Canada has to offer. Statistics Canada said domestic travel in the second quarter of 2025 was 10.9% higher than a year ago. Over a third of the domestic travel was characterized as holiday, leisure, and recreation trips.\n\nKaraguesian expects Canadian travel to the US to continue to cool due to the \"Buy Canadian\" movement, political instability, the trade war, and recent violence in the US.\n\nPrioritizing Canadian goods was one of the ways Justin Trudeau, now the former prime minister, encouraged residents after the trade war between the US and Canada began. Discouraging US travel was another.\n\n\"We're going to choose to not go on vacation in Florida or Old Orchard Beach or wherever,\" Trudeau said. \"We're going to choose to try to buy Canadian products and forgo bourbon and other classic American products.\"\n\nThe decline in Canadian tourists can affect US businesses that rely on them to prosper.\n\nA report from the Democratic members of the Congress Joint Economic Committee included different business owners describing how the fall in Canadian tourism to the US has affected them.\n\n\"We spoke with Canadian customers who told us point-blank that they were hesitant to cross due to the current political tension,\" Kyle Daley, owner of supermarket Soloman's Store in New Hampshire, said in the report. \"The joy of the 'shopping day trip' has been replaced by anxiety over border enforcement and tariffs.\"\n\nDaley added that \"When our neighbors stay away, our margins disappear and in groceries those margins are vanishingly small to begin with.\"\n\nU.S. Travel Association said Canada is the main driver for the expected 3.2% drop in international inbound travel spending from 2024 to 2025.\n\nKaraguesian said the effects would be felt more by local economies. That can include Michigan, Vermont, and other areas along the border.\n\n\"The longer-term ramifications are that our economy will suffer and that businesses will close and people will lose their jobs, which is just terrible,\" Becca Brown McKnight, a city councilor in Burlington, Vermont, previously told Business Insider. \"We are really lucky in Vermont to have a robust small business economy; a lot of these are mom and pop shops, and this is people's entire livelihood.\"\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that the state and Canada's \"economies are intertwined\" in response to a question at a fireside chat about why Canada should trust the state \"in the midst of a chaotic tariff policy.\"\n\nSandy Levine, the owner of some restaurants in the Detroit area, said in a WDET article published in June that \"We certainly still see people from Canada and from other countries, but it's not nearly to the degree that it was maybe like six months ago or a year ago.\"\n\nKaraguesian thinks that if the White House had simply focused on arguing for tariffs to rebuild the US manufacturing sector without harming Canada, then the administration \"could achieve the same thing and not have put off so many Canadians through a mixture of pride and fear.\"",

    "description": "Taiwan's Starlux is one of the few aviation startups to tackle the full-service air travel market, and is introducing the A350-1000 to its fleet.",
    "fullText": "Taiwanese airline Starlux is set to fly a new Airbus A350 variant that will expand its number of business-class seats by over 50%.\n\nThe seven-year-old startup is introducing 18 new A350-1000s to its fleet, with the first delivered in January.\n\nIts A350-1000 configuration offers 40 business-class seats, up from 26 on Starlux's current A350-900s.\n\nThe new aircraft adds 30 economy-class seats, bringing the total to 270 in coach. The rest of its A350-1000 offerings are unchanged from the A350-900, with 36 premium economy seats and four first-class suites.\n\nStarlux showcased its new plane at the Singapore Airshow this week, and Business Insider went aboard for a look.\n\nIt's known regionally for selling business-class tickets on short and medium-haul flights at roughly $1,500.\n\nSome of its longer routes, such as San Francisco to Taipei, can offer regular round-trip business-class fares as low as $2,600.\n\nSince launching flights in 2020, the Taiwanese airline has increasingly leaned on premium seat offerings, a trend among full-service carriers as market prices for economy seats have generally fallen.\n\nThe light under the passenger seat number changes from green to red when do-not-disturb mode is activated.\n\nCabin crew typically open and close the doors for passengers, but an emergency latch on the inside also allows the sliding panel to come loose.\n\nEssentially, that means the seat elevates the head and feet over the rear for better posture, so the passenger's body resembles a \"W.\"\n\nIf a passenger has two windows next to their seat, they can dim the second with a remote.\n\nThese seats have no overhead luggage compartments; instead, they feature a personal closet for each passenger. They're lined with leather, while business class seats are made of fabric.\n\nThere is no curtain or wall separating Starlux's business and first-class areas.\n\nIn-flight entertainment is available for every seat, with an extendable screen for those sitting in the front rows.\n\nChatting with a passenger across the aisle may prove more difficult on the A350-1000.\n\nThe new plane is also scheduled to begin flying Starlux's Phoenix route this summer. Starlux flies to 31 destinations, with five routes to the US.",

    "description": "Even though I was an expert in burnout, I didn't recognize the signs in myself — even though I was running on fumes while on vacation.",
    "fullText": "When I arrived at Vista Verde Ranch in late October for a mini-vacation, I was running on fumes. My excitement to take part in a three-day horsemanship clinic and experience all this luxury dude ranch offered provided enough adrenaline to carry me.\n\nThe truth was, my light had been dimming since the third quarter began at my consulting job. \"If I can just make it until the end of the year,\" I kept telling myself, \"at least I'll have more vacation time.\"\n\nMy life had become a series of \"If I do X, then I can,\" rules. I had learned early to pretend everything was fine, and over time, I became so good at it that I failed to acknowledge my job no longer fit my life.\n\nOn the last day of my trip, something happened that was the final wake-up call. I was experiencing burnout.\n\nI had researched and published on burnout in USA Swim coaches during my MS in sport psychology at CU Boulder.\n\nWe had posited that burnout was more than just stress by exploring the phenomenon of entrapment experienced by coaches who remain committed despite rising personal costs, diminishing joy, and the feeling of being stuck in a job.\n\nAt the time, I thought burnout was something that happened to other people — not me. But I fit the profile of an entrapped professional exactly.\n\nI recently dreamed I was trying to land a jet without doors or windows on a tight runway surrounded by water. I skidded to a stop just before sliding into the sea. My subconscious was trying to get my attention.\n\nMy body heard the message too. Blood pressure, which had been well managed, began to climb. At work, I was irritable, and my emotional buffer wore thin. All I wanted to do was sleep, yet I kept pushing.\n\nI continued to work out, maintained a home, built my writing portfolio, and stayed in a dead-end job. I had always done the responsible thing and was waiting for the right moment to finish the important projects at my job. I couldn't just quit.\n\nThis growing realization followed me to the ranch. Surrounded by mountains, a herd of 115 horses, and the kindness of an incredible staff, I expected to feel restored.\n\nInstead, I was restless, the ache in my soul growing louder.\n\nI then met several successful women my age — all at very different but similar crossroads. Six of us had traveled without partners, and we shared meals at communal tables, watched the herd run in at sunrise, and forged new friendships. We talked about what had brought each of us there and about what still felt unfinished.\n\nI spoke about \"Please See Me,\" the online literary magazine I launched in 2019, and planned to expand it \"when I had time.\" Their encouragement reenergized my commitment to keep building what mattered.\n\n\"You need to leave your job,\" one woman told me gently, a sparkle in her blue eyes, having recently been laid off herself.\n\nOn the last day of the trip, a magnificent Percheron horse named Gilbert fell into an irrigation ditch behind my cabin and died the morning I was to leave the ranch.\n\nI had a sudden realization: If an animal so strong can be running with the herd on Monday and dead by Wednesday, I'm not invincible either. I couldn't keep fighting and pushing the way I had been.\n\nI was eventually laid off from my consulting job, but not before I accepted that I was burned out.\n\nI'm building differently now. This year, I'm resting more, listening carefully, and designing a life that is flexible, financially sustaining, and authentic.\n\nMost importantly, I get to plan the next chapter of my professional life full-time.",

    "description": "Personally, I'd probably take a nice, long vacation, buy a new Corvette, and then return to work.",
    "fullText": "When factory worker TJ Sabula called President Trump a \"pedophile protector,\" during a visit to a Ford plant in Dearborn, Michigan last month, Ford suspended him. At the time, though, it wasn't clear whether Sabula's suspension would ultimately lead to Ford firing him. He had the United Auto Workers Union's support, but even if he wasn't fired, would he even want to come back? That remains to be seen, but according to industry reporter Phoebe Wall Howard, the sources she's spoken with say Sabula's suspension has been lifted.\n\nIn a recent post on Substack, Howard reports her sources say that, not only is Sabula no longer suspended, he's also still \"a member of UAW Local 600 in Dearborn and employed by Ford.\" Whether he's already back on the job or still taking some time off isn't clear, though, and she was unable to reach Sabula to talk about his plans. Personally, I choose to believe he didn't return her call because he's on a beach somewhere, sipping cold, fruity drinks and not answering his phone, but that's more headcanon than a fact supported by evidence.\n\nWhen Howard contacted Ford for a statement, the representative declined, saying \"the company does not comment on personnel matters.\" Meanwhile, Laura Dickerson, a UAW vice president who oversees the union's Ford division, said the UAW still supports Sabula and has done its best to ensure he's treated fairly according to the terms of the contract, but she also said she couldn't comment further. That said, multiple unnamed sources reportedly told Howard that the contract Ford signed with the UAW would allow Sabula to take personal leave if he wanted to\n\nAs Howard points out, technically, Sabula was already on paid leave during his suspension while Ford tried to figure out what to do with him. Apparently, multiple sources \"...close to the situation\" told her that \"[a] secondary concern involved drama related to the employee's return to a politically diverse work environment,\" because \"[a] significant number of UAW members supported Trump on Election Day.\"\n\nWhether Sabula chooses to return to his job or not, the good news is, he shouldn't have to worry about money for a while. In response to Sabula showing more bravery than the supposed leaders of the Democratic Party, supporters started two separate GoFundMe campaigns to help Sabula out financially. Those GoFundMes ended up being so successful that, not only did they raise nearly $800,000, he also paused the campaigns and asked supporters to donate to other good causes.\n\nEven if Sabula doesn't plan to retire early in a foreign country with a low cost of living, after taxes, that's still a nice chunk of change that should give him plenty of options, including the ability to get more deeply involved in political organizing or advocacy. Personally, I'd probably take a nice, long vacation, buy a new Corvette, and then return to work, just to make everyone who supports the man who was best friends with Epstein uncomfortable, but I'm also petty and that may not be his style. Wherever Sabula goes, though, I hope he never has to pay for a single drink again.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "Newcastle United travel to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, aiming to secure a historic comeback and keep their Carabao Cup title defence alive.\n\nThe Magpies face a defining challenge tonight as they attempt to overturn a 2–0 aggregate deficit against Manchester City. Eddie Howe demands his side replicate the spirit that delivered the trophy last year. However, they must achieve this feat at a venue where they historically struggle. Having seen their 10-game cup winning streak snapped by City in the first leg, the visitors now battle to avoid becoming only the third holders to exit at the semi-final stage.\n\nEddie Howe navigates a severe injury crisis across the pitch. Significantly, captain Bruno Guimarães misses out after failing to recover from an ankle knock. He joins Joelinton and Tino Livramento in the treatment room. Consequently, Sandro Tonali and Jacob Ramsey must shoulder the midfield burden.\n\nOn a positive note, Sven Botman passes his fitness test to lead the defence. Nick Pope retains his place in goal, protected by a backline featuring Malick Thiaw and Dan Burn. Furthermore, Joe Willock steps into the engine room to replace Guimarães. In attack, Anthony Gordon remains vital on the wing alongside Harvey Barnes. Yoane Wissa is expected to lead the line as the Magpies target early goals to unsettle a City defence that has displayed vulnerability in 2026.\n\nNewcastle predicted XI: Pope; Trippier, Thiaw, Burn, Hall; Willock, Tonali, Ramsey; Barnes, Wissa, Gordon\n\nThe Carabao Cup semi-final fixture takes place at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, 4 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event. Coverage begins at 19:00 GMT on both television and the Sky Go app.\n\nRead more- The most expensive Premier League deals in the January transfer window\n\nSee Also- Declan Rice: Arsenal have ‘desire and fire’ to finally win trophies\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "A couple in Vancouver transitioned from corporate careers in fashion and tech to cofound No Reception Club and create travel products for parents.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Gemma Ng, 39, and Daniel Ng, 38, the husband-and-wife cofounders of No Reception Club, who are based in Vancouver. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGemma: We've been together since we were 19, when we were both studying international business at different universities. We met during an internship program.\n\nI spent a decade in fashion at companies like Ralph Lauren, Theory, and Banana Republic, working as a merchant and a buyer.\n\nDaniel started in finance as an investment banker and private equity investor, then pivoted into tech after his MBA. He worked at Yelp, One Kings Lane, and Cherish.\n\nNow, we run a company together called No Reception Club.\n\nGemma: We felt challenged, and we were working in industries we admired. I once thought it'd be so cool to be VP of merchandising at a retailer I love. Daniel had ambitions in tech leadership.\n\nWe weren't miserable, but 10 years in, we started asking: Where is this path going? What does it look like in another five or 10 years?\n\nThe reality is, the higher you go in corporate America, the less you do of the thing that drew you there. We both loved building products — mine were physical, his were digital.\n\nWhen you look up the ladder, success looks more like managing 40 or 50 people, sitting in meetings all day, navigating politics, and less about creating. That didn't appeal to us.\n\nDaniel: Over the years, we'd tinker with side hustle ideas, but nothing ever stuck.\n\nThat changed after our son was born in 2019. When he was seven months old, we took a five-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, and it was a disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. We were miserable, and honestly, angry at each other.\n\nSitting on that plane, we thought, Why isn't anyone making this easier? There are travel brands and parenting brands, but there was nothing at the intersection.\n\nGemma: On that same trip in Hawaii, we had a long dinner conversation and decided we were going to give it a go. Practically, that meant I'd quit first. My background in creating physical products was more directly relevant in the early days, and we wanted to be product-first.\n\nI gave notice at my job a month later and started working on our business full time in March 2020. Daniel stayed at Yelp, working nights and weekends on our business. We were both earning six-figure salaries in our last corporate roles.\n\nDaniel: For two years, we balanced it that way. Gemma led product development while I kept my day job.\n\nDaniel: The campaign ran for 33 days over July and August of 2021. We reached our initial funding target of $30,000 in less than three days, and the campaign went on to raise nearly $67,000.\n\nWe did it by posting extensively in family travel Facebook groups about our products to get feedback and share about the campaign. We also reached out cold to publications and influencers who might be interested in our products.\n\nDaniel: In 2021, we launched our first product, the Getaway Bag, the first travel-specific diaper bag.\n\nI still remember the thrill of sitting there with our kid when we went live, and wondering, Is anyone going to show up? Or will this be like Halloween, with the lights on and nobody knocking?\n\nThen we got our first sale, then 10, then 100. It was exhilarating.\n\nIt was also exhausting. Our first inventory shipment arrived while Gemma was nine months pregnant with our second child.\n\nWith COVID-19 supply chain delays, the timing couldn't have been worse. We were working nonstop, packing orders ourselves, running to the post office, and barely sleeping.\n\nI hit a breaking point. I went for a run to clear my head and came back knowing I needed to quit Yelp. It wasn't because our startup income had replaced my salary — it hadn't.\n\nDaniel: I didn't want to regret not betting on us. I told myself I'd give it a year. If it didn't work, I could always go back to tech. That leap of faith paid off. The business now fully supports our family.\n\nBuilding a company together while raising kids brings its own challenges. At first, we thought the secret would be clear boundaries: Gemma owns physical, I own digital. In practice, we're in each other's worlds constantly.\n\nWe consult on everything, which actually comes from a place of trust and respect. There's always a clear owner who takes it to the finish line, but we value each other's perspectives. It's not unusual to see both of us in the same meeting, rolling our chairs over to join.\n\nGemma: It's very easy for every moment to become a work moment. Early on, Daniel had a habit of asking me business questions right before bed, which kept me from sleeping because my brain was spinning.\n\nWe've learned to be intentional. We carve out at least an hour at night for no work — just watching a show or reading.\n\nGemma: We give each other veto power to say, \"not now,\" and we've gotten better at reading the moment.\n\nHaving an office in our home has also helped. For a long time, our desks were in the dining room, the living room, and even the bedroom. Now at least we can shut the door, even if our kids still press their faces against the glass.\n\nThe home office is the only office our business uses, and we're the only full-time employees. We have contracted part-time support for customer service.\n\nDaniel: In a corporate setting, your coworkers only know your office self. As partners, we know everything that's going on — it's the first week of school, a parent is sick, the kids are extra needy. We can adjust priorities with a full understanding of the bigger picture.\n\nGemma: Working with your spouse can be complicated, but for us, the benefits outweigh the challenges. There's no one I'd rather be building this with.",

    "description": "Disney reported \"headwinds\" in international visitation to its American parks as foreign travelers continue to avoid the US.",
    "fullText": "Looks like even \"The Most Magical Place on Earth\" isn't enough to entice foreign travelers who are skipping the US.\n\nDisney is facing some \"international visitation headwinds\" at its parks in the US, which include Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California, the Walt Disney Company said in its first-quarter earnings report on Monday.\n\nDespite the slowdown in international visitors, the company reported growth in its experiences segment, with visitation at its domestic parks up 1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nHugh Johnston, Disney CFO, told analysts on a call that the company has less visibility into international visitor trends than domestic because foreign travelers tend to stay in non-Disney hotels, but that there were other indicators international visitation was down.\n\n\"As a result of that, we pivoted our marketing and sales efforts, promotional as well as marketing efforts to a more domestic audience, and we're able to keep attendance rates high from that perspective,\" he said.\n\nDisney's just the latest American company to feel the slowdown in foreigners traveling to the US.\n\nInternational visitation was down for the eighth straight month in December, according to data from the National Travel and Tourism Office. As of October, the number of international visitors to the US was down 5.5% in 2025 compared to a year prior.\n\nAmir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International, a market research consultancy that specializes in the travel tourism industry, said visits from Canada especially declined, but that there were also significant declines in visits from countries like Germany, France, and India.\n\nCanadian visits to the US were down 22% year-to-date as of October compared to a year prior, according to NTTO data.\n\n\"We have an image problem right now with our Canadian neighbors to the North and, as evidenced with some other countries, we have an image problem in some of our key international feeder markets as well,\" Eylon told Business Insider.\n\nHis firm's research has found a majority of Canadians say American trade policies and political rhetoric are deterring them from visiting the US in the next 12 months. Many also say they do not feel like the US is a safe place to visit.\n\nCanadians also typically make up a significant portion of international travel to Florida, so Eylon said Disney likely isn't the only destination in the Sunshine State feeling the slowdown.\n\nTravelers seeking to avoid the US also have other options when it comes to experiencing Disney. Disneyland Paris is fully owned by the Walt Disney Company, while the company has minority ownership in the Disney resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Disney has no ownership in Tokyo Disneyland, which operates under a licensing agreement.\n\nDisney also benefited from consistent demand in domestic leisure travel, with Americans continuing to prioritize travel, Eylon said.\n\nAnna Abelson, an adjunct professor at New York University's Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality, said the slowdown in international visitors to Disney underscored a broader industry shift.\n\n\"Even 'bucket list' icons are navigating significant macroeconomic volatility, ranging from currency fluctuations to shifting geopolitical sentiments,\" Abelson told Business Insider.\n\nHave a story to share about travel to the US?

    "description": "No arrests have been made nearly a month after accomplished Philadelphia scientist Omar Padilla Vélez was shot by nearly a dozen gunmen while he was driving with his fiancé and a friend",
    "fullText": "Omar Padilla Vélez died on Jan. 22, three weeks after he was shot during an early morning drive\n\nHis fiancé Kelly Crispin says the shooters at some point sounded like they made a mistake\n\nOne of the attackers then directed them on how to get out of the neighborhood safely\n\nA Pennsylvania couple was met with a horrific fate while on a Caribbean vacation in early January, the surviving fiancé says, according to several news outlets.\n\nOmar Padilla Vélez and Kelly Crispin, of Philadelphia, were visiting family in San Juan, Puerto Rico visiting family when they were attacked, Crispin said, according to the The Philadelphia Inquirer, NBC Philadelphia and FOX 29.\n\nEarly in the morning of Jan. 3, the couple, accompanied by a friend in the backseat, were returning to Vélez's family's home after dinner at a friend's place, Crispin says, FOX 29 and the Inquirer reported.\n\nThey then turned onto a side street, initially thinking it led to the highway, Crispin told the Inquirer.\n\nThat's when about a dozen men carrying AR-15-style rifles surrounded their car. When Padilla Vélez tried to drive away, they began shooting. As bullets riddled the car, amid the chaos of glass exploding and pain in her shoulder, Crispin heard Padilla Vélez say he'd been shot.\n\nHe had been shot in the head, and would die three weeks later on Jan. 22, NBC Philadelphia reported.\n\nNo person of interest has been named and no arrests have been made nearly a month since the shooting.\n\nCrispin alleged to the Inquirer that San Juan police did not visit the scene until five days after the crime, and did not interview her until Jan. 21.\n\nSan Juan police did not respond to several calls for comments on Friday.\n\nQuestions still linger in the investigation.\n\nCrispin says at one point during the ordeal, she heard some of the attackers yell at others to stop shooting because there was a woman in the car, giving her the impression that they may have made a mistake.\n\nThey searched her purse, took nothing and returned her phone, she told the Inquirer.\n\nPerhaps most surprising of all, she says one of the attackers gave them directions to get out of the neighborhood while Crispin tended to the victim.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nPadilla Vélez was an accomplished scientist with publications in various prestigious science journals and platforms.\n\nIn a moving tribute on Facebook, Crispin mourned the future that was snatched away from them.\n\n\"So much was stolen from us in just a moment. Our promise of marriage, children, and growing old together,\" she wrote. \"But what can never be stolen from us is the beautiful life we built together, full of laughter and love.\"",

    "description": "The man parked his car in a parking facility at the Columbia Metropolitan airport. Upon returning days later, he was surprised to find this.",
    "fullText": "Clive Campbell, like many travelers, parked his car at a Midlands airport before boarding a plane over the Christmas holiday. When he returned days later, he was surprised to find that his car was gone.\n\nHis 2022 Nissan Pathfinder, which he’d parked at a long-term parking facility at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport, had been repossessed on Dec. 28, 2025 by West Columbia Recovery & Towing Company at the behest of Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\nThe problem? The Pathfinder was paid in full and free of any liens, according to a certificate of title Campbell attached to a lawsuit he filed against the towing company and Navy Federal.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday, raises questions about whether the Columbia Metropolitan Airport Police Department routinely grants towing access to private tow companies to airport parking facilities, whether such access is governed by a contractual relationship, and whether lien status is verified prior to removal of vehicles left in long-term parking by traveling passengers, Campbell told The State in an email.\n\nA spokesperson with the airport police department said she would look into the matter and get back with The State.\n\nNavy Federal declined to comment on the case.\n\nWhen Campbell realized his car was missing, he contacted airport police, who confirmed the vehicle had been repossessed. Campbell then reached out to the towing company and provided a New York State Certificate of Title reflecting no recorded lien against the vehicle, according to the suit.\n\nDespite documentation, the towing company refused to release the vehicle to Campbell, while still continuing to rack up storage fees, the suit said.\n\nCampbell was then prompted to file a Temporary Restraining Order against the company as well to secure a police report.\n\nThe report, which was attached to the lawsuit as an exhibit, shows the tow was initiated based on information allegedly provided by Navy Federal Credit Union; law-enforcement database checks revealed no active lien; documentation reviewed appeared to show the lien had been satisfied and released; and the towing company nevertheless refused to release the vehicle, according to the suit.\n\nCampbell’s request for a Temporary Restraining Order remains pending, according to court records.\n\nMeanwhile, when asked whether the towing company needs confirmation of an active lien before repossessing a car, a manager with the company told The State “to call Navy Federal.”\n\nIt’s the same thing they advised Campbell after he’d provided proof that he owned the car free and clear.\n\nThe towing company “did not dispute the absence of a lien or court order and instead directed (Campbell) to ‘call Navy Federal,’ a party with no enforceable interest,” the suit said.\n\nCampbell claims that Navy Federal and the towing company are guilty of, among other things, conversion, trespass to chattels, civil conspiracy and unjust enrichment.\n\nHe has asked the court for compensatory and punitive damages along with an order that the towing company release his vehicle free of any towing and storage fees, according to the suit.",

    "title": "These are the 21 most dangerous countries for US travelers, according to the State Department",
    "description": "The US State Department warns Americans not to travel to these 21 countries due to risks like terrorism, kidnapping, and limited embassy support.",
    "fullText": "Overseas travel can be an immensely enriching experience, from learning about different cultures to seeing some of the world's greatest sights, but in some countries, it can also come with risks.\n\nThe US State Department ranks 21 countries around the world as a travel advisory level four, \"Do Not Travel\" due to risks like terrorism and kidnapping.\n\n\"All countries will rank destinations slightly differently,\" Alan Fyall, a professor of tourism at the University of Central Florida, told Business Insider.\n\nWhile they frequently overlap, the US and the UK don't have identical lists, for example. Historical and cultural ties, proximity, and level of familiarity may all play a role in shaping these lists, he said.\n\nFor some of these countries, the US has suspended embassy operations. That makes it difficult for it to assist travelers when they're in trouble, and that's part of the reason the warnings can be stringent, said Fyall.\n\n\"Do you really want to go and rescue your citizens from a country that, really, they're not that advised to go to in the first place?\" he said.\n\nThe US and UK governments also issue warnings for specific areas in some countries, such as near the Thailand-Malaysia border, the Western Desert in Egypt, or parts of Israel. In July 2025, the US State Department changed Israel and the West Bank's travel advisory from a \"do-not-travel\" to a \"reconsider travel\" country, but the level four advisory has remained for Gaza as well as the Israeli regions near the Lebanese, Syrian, or Egyptian borders.\n\nWhile some risk-takers travel to these countries for a thrill, others visit family or for business.\n\n\"Some people think the perceived risk is overstated,\" Edward Dramberger, a University of South Carolina tourism and hospitality professor, told Business Insider.\n\nFor those who travel to level-four countries, the US State Department often offers routine advice, including staying aware of your surroundings, keeping your travel documents on hand, drafting a will before travel, creating a plan to leave the country without the aid of the US government, and monitoring local news for emergency situations.\n\nNations and regions can change travel advisory levels on the US' list based on changing circumstances, but these are the 21 countries the State Department considers \"do-not-travel\" zones as of January 2026.\n\nSitting between Iran and Pakistan, mountainous Afghanistan has rugged terrain and an arid climate.\n\n\"People perceive Afghanistan as just a desolate, mountain desert country with no attributes, no culture, which is wrong,\" Dramberger said.\n\nDecades of coups, civil wars, and invasions have made the country difficult for travelers to get to know, except via the news.\n\nThe US State Department lists crime, civil unrest, terrorism, wrongful detention, health, and kidnapping among the safety concerns when traveling to Afghanistan. Medical care may be more difficult to obtain in rural areas.\n\nIn 2021, the US Embassy in Kabul closed its operations in the country.\n\nThe agency recommends that American visitors keep a low profile while in the country.\n\nOnce part of the Soviet Union, Belarus maintains close ties with its neighbor, Russia. From Gothic architecture to rare near-endangered species, Belarus has attractions for castle seekers and nature enthusiasts.\n\nIn recent years, Belarus has allowed Russia to use some of its territory to invade Ukraine.\n\nThe risk of civil unrest makes visits to Belarus unwise, according to the State Department. The US Embassy suspended operations there in 2022.\n\nAmericans traveling to Belarus should exercise the usual precautions for visiting high-risk countries and consider leaving their phones, computers, and other electronic devices behind. The State Department also recommends not accessing social media accounts while in Belarus because they may be monitored.\n\nOuagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, is a West African hub of culture and arts, and the country also has an incredible wildlife refuge, Réserve de Nazinga, near its border with Ghana.\n\nDespite the country's positive attributes, the US State Department advises that travelers avoid visiting the country.\n\nThe country's government has declared a state of emergency for several regions.\n\nTerrorism, crime, and other threats have displaced over 2 million residents, as reported by the United Nations. While the displacement crisis has been slowly decreasing, the country still finds itself engulfed in a deep humanitarian crisis.\n\nSince 2015, several citizens of countries like the US have been kidnapped in Burkina Faso, according to the US Overseas Security Advisory Council, which classifies the situation in the country as \"critical.\"\n\nWhile the US Embassy still operates in Ouagadougou, government employees are unable to travel to many parts of the country due to safety concerns, which include the threat of terrorist violence.\n\nIn January 2026, the US government began suspending visas and limiting entry for citizens of 39 countries, including Burkina Faso. As a response measure, the West African country also suspended visas for US citizens.\n\nThe US government's recommendations for lowering risk while traveling in Burkina Faso include avoiding areas where Westerners typically travel and not resisting if someone attempts to rob you.\n\nThe Central African Republic touches several other level-four countries, including Sudan and South Sudan, and is home to incredibly rich biodiversity in its national parks, including Dzanga-Sangha National Park and Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park.\n\nMany of the country's species are endangered, and its citizens have faced decades of instability, according to the United Nations.\n\nRecently, armed groups have targeted Muslims and refugees.\n\nThe US State Department considers CAR a dangerous travel destination due to threats of terrorism, crime, civil unrest, unexploded land mines, and kidnapping, as well as health concerns. US citizens can expect limited help from the US Embassy in Bangui, CAR's capital.\n\nDue to the threat of kidnapping, the US' travel advisory website suggests travelers leave DNA samples with their doctor and establish proof-of-life protocols with family or friends so they can assist you if you're abducted. The State Department also suggests keeping a low profile, avoiding travel to rebel-controlled areas, and not resisting robbery attempts.\n\nThe Caribbean country of Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. The country, which won its independence from France in 1804, maintains some of its historic monuments, like its Citadelle Laferrière.\n\nIn recent years, the country has fallen under a state of emergency. In July 2023, the US ordered government employees to leave the country, and since 2025, the US government has enforced a ban on flights to Port-au-Prince, its capital, due to gang violence. The ban has since been extended to March 2026, and the country's capital remains cut off from US travel.\n\nIn addition to the flight ban, the country is also under a travel ban to the US, meaning that its citizens cannot enter the country, and that new visas are not being issued.\n\nIn the capital city of Port-au-Prince, local authorities have enforced curfews and \"shelter-in-place\" advisories since the beginning of the state of emergency.\n\nThe State Department has warned that armed robberies, sexual assaults, and kidnappings are among the reasons to reconsider travel to Haiti.\n\nAnyone who does go should avoid walking in the streets when possible, travel in groups, and keep vehicle doors and windows locked when driving, according to the State Department.\n\nOne way to see over 800 miles of this Middle Eastern country is the Trans-Iranian Railway, which runs from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf. Tehran, the capital, lies along the route.\n\nSome of the country's natural wonders include dormant volcanoes and the stunning limestone formations of Badab-e Surt.\n\nRight now, it's not safe for US citizens to travel to the country, according to the State Department.\n\nFollowing protests in 2022, thousands of people were arrested and tortured by Iranian authorities, according to Amnesty International.\n\nSince December 2025, massive anti-government protests have broken out in the country yet again and have recently resulted in violent crackdowns by state actors, with thousands of deaths and arrests in the tens of thousands. The Iranian government has also imposed an internet blackout in efforts to censor information about the protests.\n\nThe US government has cautioned that Iranian officials may wrongfully and arbitrarily detain or imprison US nationals and other foreigners.\n\nThe travel advisory also warns of terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping throughout the country.\n\nThe US doesn't have a physical embassy in Iran. The American government's travel advisory site states that visitors should have a means of leaving Iran that doesn't depend on its assistance, as it cannot provide consular support or facilitate departure from the country.\n\nFrom the Tigris and Euphrates to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Iraq holds sites that many remember from their ancient history textbooks. Sadly, some of its artifacts were lost to looting during the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\nSince the US invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Iraq has faced threats from terrorist groups such as ISIS.\n\nTerrorism, kidnapping, and civil unrest are enough of a risk that the State Department considers Iraq a level-four country.\n\nAs of August 2025, ISIS was still active in parts of Iraq, according to OSAC. Armed conflict and terrorist threats are dangerous at the northern borders, per the State Department.\n\nThe State Department also warns that US travelers should avoid the country's northern border and consider making arrangements with a professional security organization for any visits. US employees in the country are also forbidden from using Baghdad International Airport for travel due to security concerns.\n\nAt just over 4,000 square miles, Lebanon is just a bit bigger than Puerto Rico.\n\nA lengthy civil war from 1975 to 1990 left scars in its capital city of Beirut and beyond. In recent years, an economic crisis has taken a toll. Meanwhile, conflicts in neighboring Israel and Syria have also affected Lebanon.\n\nThe US government has said that terrorist groups operating in Lebanon put travelers at risk. There have been suicide bombings, and a gunman opened fire at the embassy in Beirut in June 2024.\n\nThe country's level four travel advisory warns of crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, armed conflict, and unexploded land mines.\n\nThe State Department also warns that US citizens should especially avoid Southern Lebanon, the country's border with Syria, and refugee settlements, urging them to depart if they are there.\n\nVisitors should take the advised security measures for high-risk countries and have a kidnapping protocol in place with family members, per the State Department.\n\nSituated between Egypt and Algeria, Libya has a coastline along the gorgeous Mediterranean Sea. Roman emperor Septimius Severus was born in Leptis Magna, an UNESCO World Heritage site with striking ruins of large, impressive buildings.\n\nViolence, including two recent civil wars, has marred the country. Armed groups have attacked hotels and airports in Tripoli, Sruman, and other cities, according to the State Department. The US Embassy hasn't been active in Tripoli since 2014.\n\nThe State Department warns of violent crime, terrorism, unexploded land mines, civil unrest, widespread kidnapping, and armed conflict throughout the country, and suggests that US citizens draft a will and consult with a professional security organization if traveling to the country.\n\nThe agency urges US citizens in the country to depart as soon as possible via commercial means, even though US commercial flights aren't allowed to operate within the country's airspace.\n\nCenturies-old mosques can be found in Mali's Timbuktu, symbols of its history as a seat of Islamic culture and learning. Its marketplace drew travelers and traders during the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nTo the southwest of Timbuktu is Bamako, Mali's capital. Outside the city and in other parts of the country, terrorists and kidnappers target foreign visitors in the hopes of getting a ransom, according to OSAC. US personnel aren't allowed to visit nightclubs or attend concerts for safety reasons.\n\nThe State Department's advisory warns of terrorism, civil unrest, inadequate health services, and violent crime, including kidnapping, throughout the country.\n\nSome advice for traveling in Mali includes avoiding walking deserted streets at night, carrying minimal cash, not leaving valuables in your hotel, and looking for a well-lit area when stopped by police.\n\nUS citizens are also advised to avoid travel outside Bamako and to have a plan to leave an emergency plan that doesn't require help from the US government.\n\nLocated on the Bay of Bengal in Southeast Asia, Myanmar boasts a fascinating mix of architecture, from pagodas and palaces to colonial hotels and government offices. One stupa, or pagoda, the Shwedagon, is the country's most sacred Buddhist site.\n\nA coup in 2021 sparked demonstrations. The military detained protestors and used force against them and bystanders, according to the State Department.\n\nThe risk of continued civil unrest and wrongful detentions, and arbitrary arrests, as well as poor health infrastructure, land mines, and crime, makes it unwise to travel to the country, according to the US State Department travel advisory.\n\nSome armed groups have used improvised explosive devices in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, while NGOs have reported land mines in Shan State, Chin State, and Kachin State.\n\nVisitors to the landlocked African country of Niger can explore the ancient mud-brick mosque of Grande Mosquée d'Agadez and the storied old town of Agadez, as well as see the Sahara Desert and the country's unique wildlife.\n\nIn October 2025, the US authorized that all government employees leave the country due to widespread safety concerns. Parts of the country have been under a state of emergency for over a decade, and local authorities \"require military escorts for any foreigners\" traveling outside the capital, Niamey, per the US State Department.\n\nThe agency warns of violent crime, civil unrest, terrorism, limited health services, and kidnapping throughout the country.\n\nIf they choose to visit anyway, US citizens are advised by the government to draft a will and have an emergency plan that doesn't depend on support from the US Embassy.\n\nOne of the world's most mysterious and isolated countries, North Korea shares borders with South Korea, China, and Russia. Kim Jong-Un took over the presidency in 2011, continuing a family dynasty that's been in power since the 1950s.\n\nIn 2025, North Korea reopened to Western tourists for the first time since the pandemic. The State Department warns that US nationals may be arrested and held for extended periods.\n\nIt warns that it cannot provide emergency services to its citizens who are detained, as the two countries do not have diplomatic relations.\n\nRussia's cities contain dazzling buildings, and its landscape is breathtaking. Siberia's Lake Baikal is the planet's oldest and deepest. The world's last woolly mammoths lived and died out on Wrangel Island, where polar bears, musk oxen, and walruses now congregate.\n\nDue to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US State Department has declared it unsafe for US citizens, who may face harassment or detention. The US State Department urges every US citizen in the country to leave immediately, and notes that authorities might not inform the US government if an American is arrested.\n\nThe US' travel advisory also cited drone attacks and explosions in Moscow, St. Petersburg, locations near the Ukrainian border, and other areas.\n\nThe State Department notes there may be risks for those with dual US-Russian nationality. Because the situation is volatile, travelers should stay informed about the latest local news while visiting.\n\nDigital communications also pose a risk, and the agency advises US citizens to reconsider bringing any electronic devices into the country, as the Russian government's security services closely monitor electronic communications and can use them to arrest foreign nationals.\n\nThose who still choose to travel to the country are advised by the government to prepare for wrongful detention, draft a will, and leave DNA samples with a medical provider.\n\nLocated in the Horn of Africa, Somalia's lengthy coastline borders the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. Somali archaeologist Sada Mire has called the capital, Mogadishu, an \"unbreakable pearl,\" tracing its history as a trade center back to the first century AD.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Somalia experienced famine and civil war. Instability continued in the form of terror attacks, including a suicide bombing on a popular beach in 2024.\n\nDue to the possibility of kidnapping, terrorism, and civil unrest, the US has issued a do-not-travel advisory. The State Department notes that the US also has very limited consular services in the country and that health services in Somalia can be limited and absent in rural areas.\n\nThe State Department also advised against sailing near Somalia's coast due to piracy.\n\nIt was only during the 21st century that South Sudan declared its independence and was recognized as a sovereign state. Its neighbors include Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIts short history was dominated by a civil war, and a new conflict is brewing between the military and an opposition force, which clashed near the Ethiopian border. NGOs, the UN, and others have found it difficult to accurately assess crime levels, but firearms easily cross the border from Sudan, according to OSAC.\n\nThe US State Department warns of civil unrest, violent crimes, kidnapping, unexploded land mines, and limited health services in the country and urges US citizens not to travel to the country for any reason.\n\nAnyone traveling in South Sudan should avoid its border areas and adhere to restrictions around public photography and videography, the State Department says.\n\nKhartoum, Sudan, is where the Blue and White Niles meet. Meroë is further north, where ancient Kushite rulers lived and were buried in pyramids. Some date back to the third century BCE; several have collapsed but others retain decorative carvings.\n\nCivil war threatens not only the archaeological history but locals and travelers. Officials at the US Embassy hastily evacuated Khartoum in 2023, soon after the conflict broke out. Various groups frequently engage in violent fighting, the State Department says.\n\nThe Darfur, Khartoum, and Kordofan regions have all been sites for kidnappings, according to OSAC. The Khartoum International Airport is closed.\n\nThe State Department warns of widespread violent crime, kidnapping, terrorism, unrest, unexploded land mines, and extremely limited health services in the country.\n\nThe US travel advisory suggests travelers be aware of their surroundings, especially in locations where Westerners typically visit, and that they draft a proof-of-life protocol with loved ones in case of kidnapping.\n\nNot only is Damascus the capital of Syria, but it's also the seat of cultural history. Established over 2,000 years ago, it's one of the oldest cities in the Middle East. Evidence of its Roman and Byzantine past exists alongside important Islamic monuments such as the Umayyad Mosque.\n\nDespite the allure of these ancient sites, the US doesn't recommend travel to Syria. A lengthy civil war broke out in 2011, with efforts to oust Bashar Assad from power. Since Assad resigned at the end of 2024, violence has continued to erupt in parts of western Syria.\n\nThe State Department has also warned that terrorism, kidnapping and hostage-taking, and unjust detention are risks in Syria, saying that \"no part of Syria is safe from violence.\"\n\nThe agency recommends visitors set up proof-of-life protocols with loved ones, among other precautions, before and during travel.\n\nMuch like Istanbul's Hagia Sofia, for which it was named, the Saint Sophia Cathedral serves as an eye-catching landmark in Kyiv. It's just one of the Ukrainian capital's architectural treasures.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and years of fighting have ensued, mainly in the east, where the border lies. Belarusian troops are also present along its border with Ukraine.\n\nThe ongoing conflict is the principal reason the US government cautions against visiting. Areas that aren't on the frontline of fighting could still experience drone and missile attacks, the State Department notes.\n\nDrafting a will, coordinating a security plan, and creating a communication protocol with loved ones are just a few of the steps suggested on the travel advisory website.\n\nWith its dizzying height of over 3,000 feet, the Salto Ángel waterfall has drawn tourists for decades, though it's notoriously tricky to access. It's found in the southeast of Venezuela, in the Canaima National Park, in the Amazon rainforest near the border with Brazil and Guyana.\n\nThe country is in the midst of an economic and political crisis. Heavily reliant on oil for income, it suffered years of recession. In 2024, the US and several other countries refused to recognize the results of its presidential election, calling it fraudulent, BBC News reported at the time.\n\nSince then, the US has launched a multifaceted military presence that has increased naval posture and tensions in the Caribbean and led to the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro by US military forces in January.\n\nThe US Embassy ceased operations in Caracas in 2019 amid the country's deep economic crisis. The State Department has issued warnings about arbitrary detentions and unpredictable enforcement of local laws. In 2023 and 2025, Venezuela released several Americans, some of whom were \"wrongfully detained,\" according to the US government.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory emphasizes the \"extreme danger to US citizens living in or traveling to Venezuela\" and urges all US citizens and lawful permanent residents to leave the country immediately.\n\nThe travel advisory warns of wrongful detention and torture, arbitrary law enforcement, civil unrest, widespread violent crime, including kidnapping, and poor health services throughout the country.\n\nTravelers who still choose to visit the country may want to hire a professional security team during their stay and prepare a will before their trip, according to the US travel advisory site.\n\nBeautiful gypsum patterns adorn red fired-brick buildings in the Old City of Sana'a. People have lived in this area of Yemen for over 2,500 years. The country is located on the Arabian Peninsula next to Saudi Arabia and Oman.\n\nYemen's civil war started over a decade ago and continues today. The threat of armed conflict continues, according to OSAC. Detained US citizens have not been allowed to contact their families or the embassy, which suspended its operations in 2015.\n\nThe US travel advisory says US citizens should avoid travel to the country due to the threat of terrorism, civil unrest, unexploded land mines, crime, including kidnapping, and health risks.\n\nThe State Department warns against visiting the Yemeni island of Socotra. Some travel companies have offered trips there with unofficial visas, which puts travelers at risk, according to the travel advisory website.",

    "description": "Whenever I'm traveling solo, I turn to dating apps like Hinge to source recommendations from locals. I've found that most matches are happy to help.",
    "fullText": "Being spontaneous and going with the flow when traveling might sound romantic and adventurous, but I believe the best experiences come with a bit of prep work.\n\nSaving a list of places to visit on Google Maps gives me a sense of orientation when I arrive somewhere new — but when those pins come from algorithm-fed videos, influencers, and glossy listicles, I find they often miss the mark.\n\nCreators and I rarely share the same definition of what's worth seeing or eating, and media roundups can sometimes lack a personal touch.\n\nThat's why trusted insider tips remain my favorite way to get recommendations. Unfortunately, not every destination I travel to comes with a friend ready to share their carefully curated list of local gems.\n\nSo, I use dating apps. A few days before a trip, I change my Hinge location to a cool neighborhood in the city I'm visiting and ask locals for suggestions.\n\nThrough a mix of profile curation and the questions I ask my matches, I make my intentions clear from the start. And usually, people are happy to provide recommendations.\n\nRecently, while planning a trip to Istanbul, I set my location to Kadıköy. Within an hour, I had more than 50 locals ready for a chat.\n\nA quick, \"Hey, it's my first time visiting the city. Do you have any tips?\" is often enough to get the conversation going.\n\nTo make things even easier, I sometimes change one of my profile prompts to something that invites recommendation-giving. From Hinge's long list, there are plenty that work:\n\nFrom their responses — and their profiles (age, occupation, interests) — it's easy to tell if our tastes align and know who to ask for specific recommendations.\n\nFor example, I can ask an architect about a local building he thinks is underrated or a runner about the best nearby park for a morning run.\n\nIf the conversation flows, the person genuinely piques my curiosity, and I've got time in my itinerary, I sometimes meet my virtual guides in person.\n\nWhen I do, my usual dating safety rules apply: We meet in public (preferably in daylight), I share my location with someone I trust, I don't drink too much, and I always watch my drink.\n\nRomance is never completely off the table — who says you can't mix business with pleasure? However, most of my matches have remained on the app or turned into Instagram friendships.\n\nThrough these encounters, my matches have scored me discounts at their friends' stores, invited me to parties filled with locals, and even guided me on personalized bar-hopping adventures.\n\nI've found that most people naturally like to help others and to show their city in the best possible light. And if the chat is pleasant, I encourage them to reach out when they're in my city so I can return the favor.\n\nThis travel hack might be a single-person privilege. However, in times when main courses can sometimes only be ordered for two, there aren't many perks left — so let us have this one.",

    "fullText": "(Corrects to clarify remarks by official in paragraph 23)\n\nVERBIER, Switzerland, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A New Year fire that killed 40 people at a Swiss ski resort bar has shaken a lucrative tourism industry that long had an impeccable reputation and has piled pressure on the country to tighten safety standards.\n\nNews ​that \"Le Constellation\" bar, in the town of Crans-Montana in Canton Valais, had gone six years without a safety check quickly prompted officials to ban some practices, including the ‌use of sparkling candles blamed for the tragedy.\n\nThe stain on Switzerland's otherwise exemplary safety record was quickly felt as local hoteliers reported cancelled bookings in a canton where the cost of real estate in resorts such as nearby Verbier ‌can fetch prices on a par with Hong Kong.\n\n\"There were cancellations, there were reservation postponements to later dates in hotels,\" said Bruno Huggler, director of the Crans-Montana tourism office, after the blaze that killed mostly teenagers and injured more than 100 people.\n\nLe Constellation owners Jacques Moretti and his wife are under investigation for negligent homicide and other crimes.\n\nThe disaster has ignited a fractious political debate over safety, including calls for harmonised national standards in a country that prizes local autonomy.\n\nIt has also sparked alarm in Verbier's hospitality sector.\n\n\"We realize this could very well happen right here,\" said Lionel Dubois, head ⁠of Verbier's Association of Hoteliers, Cafe Owners and Restaurateurs. \"That, I think, ‌is a bit frightening.\"\n\nTourism in Switzerland was worth about $22.17 billion, or 3% of national output in 2021, official data showed.\n\nWhile bookings at Crans-Montana's roughly 1,300 hotel rooms have suffered, the overall picture is stable, as chalet and apartment rentals cover most stays, tourism boss Huggler said.\n\nYoung people have been ‍shaken, though, and while some restaurants are returning to life, bars remain quieter, said Cedric Berger, head of the Association of Apartment and Chalet Owners of the Crans-Montana Upper Plateau.\n\nSome local accommodation providers have seen cancellations in short-term vacation rentals.\n\n\"January is a month to forget, a lost month for everyone,\" said Berger.\n\nSurvivors of the fire, which also killed French and Italian citizens, are still hospitalised around Europe.\n\nCrans-Montana apartment owners from Italy ​and France are angry, said Berger, who is also a lawyer.\n\n\"People go to Valais not because it's the 'best party', but because it's Switzerland, and you think it's safe. If that quality ‌disappears, then Switzerland's 'fortress' is a bit shaken,\" he added.\n\nAnxiety about the fallout is palpable in Verbier, where Reuters contacted 37 hospitality venues.\n\nMost declined to speak or did not reply, though the 12 who did said checks were conducted properly. But all agreed that rules must be reinforced to guarantee regular inspections, limit numbers at venues and provide fire-safety training to staff.\n\nIn four of Switzerland's 26 cantons, including Valais, building insurance is not mandatory - potentially increasing risks for owners hit by fire, as well as weakening controls.\n\nThe Swiss Insurance Association said over 90% of buildings in Switzerland are insured according to market estimates, adding it does not keep precise figures on how many are not. Reuters could not establish if Le Constellation had building insurance.\n\nThe fire generated the ⁠biggest media storm around Switzerland since the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse bank, said Alexandre Edelmann, head of ​Presence Switzerland, the foreign ministry unit that promotes the country's image abroad.\n\nAs media reports about Switzerland jumped to 25 ​times more than average in early January, a crisis room was established to support people abroad following the fire, said Edelmann.\n\nLawmaker Jacqueline de Quattro, head of the lower house of parliament security committee, said the fire had exposed potential shortcomings in Switzerland's federal system, which allows cantons to set their own ‍rules.\n\n\"We believed we had strict rules and that Switzerland ⁠was well‑prepared,\" said de Quattro. \"But then we were brutally confronted with reality.\"\n\nProposing a national review to harmonise standards backed by an events industry group, she voiced concerns over event professionals' reports of sloppy work stemming from inadequate training, cost pressures and irregular inspections.\n\nBut the head of Verbier's Val de Bagnes municipality, Fabien Sauthier, said inspections need resources ⁠and that, while regular checks occur, it was tough to inspect some 400 public buildings annually with just four full-time safety officials.\n\nAnd any push towards greater federal oversight could face resistance.\n\n\"I'm a Swiss person, so I think the canton ‌should decide what it wants to do,\" said Willy Schranz, head of the municipal council in Adelboden in Canton Bern. \"If you take responsibility, then it's a ‌very good system.\"",

    "fullText": "Costco did not even sell merchandise on its website until 1998, and, in those days, the selection was very limited.\n\nAs a longtime member, I used the website for benefits such as Costco Travel and ancillary services, like TurboTax access, that the warehouse club sells. Until much more recently, though, I rarely bought anything there.\n\nNow, Costco has a greatly expanded selection, and it allows members to use Instacart and Shipt to order select items directly from its warehouses. It's building on that with its digital-only program, Costco Next, which lets members access items the warehouse club does not stock.\n\nIt's not a new service; it has technically been around since 2017. But Costco does not promote the offering, and it's something I, and many other members, did not know about.\n\nIn fact, I only learned about it because the chain started mentioning it during earnings calls, which most members do not listen to or read transcripts of.\n\nA third-party marketplace like the model pioneered by Amazon, Costco Next offers an expanded selection of items that never make it into a Costco warehouse. The program, however, differs from Amazon's approach in important ways.\n\nApril 17, 2001: Costco expands online with a B2B e‑commerce site aimed at business customers, accessible through the main Costco.com site, according to a 2001 Costco earnings release.\n\n2017: Costco partners with Shipt for grocery delivery in select U.S. markets and expands same‑day and two‑day delivery options for members, reported SuperMarket News.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 to 2021): Online sales surge dramatically as consumer demand for non‑contact shopping grows. Costco’s ecommerce growth in 2020 surpassed the prior five years combined, according to the retailer's fourth-quarter 2021 earnings release.\n\nCostco's deal with Shipt ended in 2025, according to Costco's website, and was replaced with an Instacart partnership.\n\n\"Our digital vision at Costco is to deliver a seamless experience that builds trust and loyalty with our members both in warehouse and online,\" Costco CEO Ron Vachris said during the company's first quarter 2025 earnings call. \"We aim to make shopping at Costco easier, faster, and more personal, no matter where or how our members choose to shop. This isn't about technology for technology's sake.\"\n\nCostco Next allows the retailer to offer more merchandise, but have it shipped directly from partners. The warehouse club, however, is still careful with its merchandise, and its buyers work with partner retailers.\n\nIt's a more carefully curated selection than Amazon offers, because Costco remains focused on offering value to members. The retailer has grown Costco Next from its modest beginnings.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nHistory of Costco: Company timeline and facts\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n\"Costco Next, our curated marketplace, also continues to show healthy year-over-year growth. In Q3 fiscal year 2025, our sales on Costco Next equaled our total sales for all of fiscal year 2022, and we are excited about the pipeline of new vendors and development for future rollout,\" CFO Gary Millerchip said during the company'sthird quarter 2025 earnings call.\n\nCostco Next is a curated third‑party marketplace that lets Costco members buy directly from select brands and manufacturers at discounted prices, without Costco holding all the inventory itself.\n\nProducts are offered from hand‑selected suppliers chosen for the quality of their merchandise and strong customer service, expanding the variety beyond typical warehouse inventory.\n\nThe platform helps Costco offer higher‑margin discretionary items (e.g., electronics, appliances, goods sold directly from vendors) while leveraging member pricing perks.\n\nAccording to strategic reports, Costco Next has become a scalable engine for high‑margin products, with estimated sales in Q3 2025 equal to Costco’s entire fiscal 2022 performance in that channel, AInvest reported.\n\nThe impetus for Costco Next is to strengthen e‑commerce and mobile growth by offering discounted deals from trusted brands that complement warehouse inventory.\n\n“Separate from what members will find in the warehouses or at Costco.com, Costco Next showcases products from some of Costco’s suppliers that have been selected for the quality of their merchandise and their exceptional customer service,” Costco General Merchandise Manager Cheryl Smeby said on Costco's website.\n\n“By shopping at Costco Next, you have access to a variety of products from these vendors, and you’ll get a discount that is available only to Costco members.\"\n\nCostco is not alone in adding an online marketplace.\n\n\"Marketplaces are a relatively simple, low-capital way of expanding choice and widening audiences,\" GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders shared on RetailWire.\n\nHe believes, however, that it's not as simple as tacking on an online marketplace to an existing business.\n\n\"If they work, they can generate incremental revenue. But they are not surefire winners. Retailers need to make sure they don’t just cannibalize existing sales, and they cannot be used as an excuse to neglect the core proposition. And of course, there are now so many marketplaces that the strategy is not really a big differentiator,\" Saunders added.\n\nHis Retailwire Brain Trust colleague, Jeff Hall, believes that online marketplaces are table stakes, but must be run with intent.\n\n\"They allow you to expand assortment, enter new categories, and test demand without tying up capital or taking markdown risk. Just as important, they attract new customers who often convert into higher value buyers of owned inventory,\" he posted.\n\nCostco Next has been around since 2017, but the brand has never promoted it.\n\n\"Costco instead relies on its memberships and rotating selection of deals to do the selling for it, often through social media and word of mouth. Costco Next benefits similarly from this fear of missing out,\" CustomerThink.com shared.\n\nThe services launched with about 15 suppliers.\n\n\"There are currently over 90 brands included in the Costco Next universe. Some are familiar: Mikasa dinnerware, Dearfoams slippers and Thomas Kinkade Studios fine art. You’ll also find Artika lighting products, Baggallini accessories, Bench activewear, Cangshan handcrafted cutlery, Briggs & Riley luggage and Golden Arowana flooring, among others,\" Kiplinger reported.",

    "description": "In college, Cameron Mofid set out on a mission to visit every country — not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront his obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
    "fullText": "As a kid, I pored over maps, flags, and history books, curious about what life looked like in far-off corners of the world. At the same time, I was quietly struggling with debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder, which often left me feeling trapped inside my own mind.\n\nOne night during my freshman year at the University of Miami, I came across an article in my apartment that stunned me. It said that more people had been to space than had visited every country in the world.\n\nFinding that out changed the direction of my life. I decided to set out on a mission to visit every country, not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront my OCD and prove to myself that it didn't have to dictate the limits of my life.\n\nOver the next few years of college, I saved aggressively while working in nightlife marketing in Miami, putting aside just enough to make the trip possible if I budgeted carefully and kept costs low.\n\nWhen I told my parents about my plan, they laughed and shrugged it off, not quite taking me seriously. Not long after, I called one of my best friends. He laughed too and said just two words: \"Good luck.\"\n\nAfter graduating, I made it my mission. I backpacked mostly alone across conflict zones, remote islands, and places at the center of ancient history. On April 3, 2025, I reached my 195th and final country in North Korea. The journey was verified by NomadMania, the world's largest travel community, which confirmed that I was the youngest person ever to have visited every country.\n\nAfter completing my mission, a few places stood out as truly unforgettable. These are three cities I always suggest others experience — and one I wouldn't rush back to.\n\nOut of the hundreds of cities I've visited in my life, Sydney is my favorite. What stood out most was how relaxed and welcoming people were. The pace reminded me of my hometown in San Diego, with the same laid-back energy but an even greater sense of warmth.\n\nOne morning, while sitting at a café, an older couple at the table next to me struck up a conversation and started sharing their favorite places around the city. They talked about the coastal walks they loved, which neighborhoods were worth spending time in, and the restaurants they kept going back to. Interactions like that happened often enough that the friendliness stopped feeling like a novelty and became part of everyday life.\n\nAs I explored the city, I kept noticing how naturally beautiful it was. More than 100 beaches are within reach, including Bondi, where I watched surfers roll in with the tide. In the city center, I wandered through different neighborhoods and took in the mix of historic architecture and modern design. The sunsets were especially memorable. I watched ferries cut across the water as the skyline came into view, framed by the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge.\n\nSydney is the kind of city I could easily imagine building a life in.\n\nValletta felt like a living crossroads of history from the moment I arrived. Sitting at the center of the Mediterranean, the city reflects centuries of Italian, Arab, British, and North African influence, all packed into a compact, walkable capital.\n\nI'd walk past waterfront cafés and, minutes later, find myself standing on the city's fortified walls, looking out over waters once traveled by Phoenician traders, Ottoman fleets, and British warships.\n\nWhat surprised me most about Valletta was how under-visited it felt compared to much of southern Europe. Even during peak season, it never felt overrun. A short ferry ride away, I spent time on the island of Gozo, where life moved even slower. I visited ancient temples older than the Egyptian pyramids and passed through small villages where fishing and farming still shape daily life.\n\nExperiencing Gozo made Valletta feel even more special: a historic capital with easy access to a quieter, older side of the Mediterranean.\n\nKrabi wasn't even on my radar at first, and it ended up being one of the last places I reached on my journey. A Thai friend I'd met years earlier on the junior tennis circuit told me it was the most beautiful part of the country and insisted I couldn't miss it.\n\nHe was right. Krabi Town is the province's main city, but most travelers use \"Krabi\" to refer to the surrounding beaches and islands — and few places on Earth combine land and sea as dramatically. At Railay Beach, limestone cliffs rise from turquoise water, creating a backdrop unlike anything else I've seen.\n\nI took day trips through Phang Nga Bay and out toward the nearby Phi Phi Islands, weaving past mangrove forests and hidden coves that felt largely untouched. And then there was the food. For a few dollars, I could get a delicious local meal and a fresh dragon fruit smoothie from a roadside stall or beachside café.\n\nKrabi is a reminder that some of the most memorable places aren't always part of the original plan.\n\nIndia was one of the countries I was most excited to visit, and it delivered some amazing experiences. Seeing the Taj Mahal in Agra lived up to every expectation, and witnessing the ancient religious rituals along the Ganges in Varanasi was one of the most powerful cultural moments I've experienced anywhere in the world.\n\nThat said, New Delhi isn't a place I feel a strong pull to return to. The air quality was poor enough that I found myself coughing constantly, making it uncomfortable to spend much time outside. In a city of more than 22 million people, the traffic was relentless, adding to a sense of chaos that, unlike in other busy cities I've loved, never felt energizing. Compared to other parts of India, I also didn't find the city's main sights as compelling.\n\nI'm glad I went, and India as a whole left a lasting impression on me. But if I were planning another trip, New Delhi wouldn't be on my list.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's main space contractor vowed to develop space tourism in the next five years, state media reported on Thursday, as Beijing revs up its commercial spaceflight and deep space exploration ambitions ​amid a technology race with the U.S.\n\nState-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would \"achieve the flight operation of ‌suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism,\" as well as \"build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure\", state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\nChina and the U.S. are competing ‌as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a \"world-leading space power\" by 2045.\n\nBeijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to ⁠achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites ‌and it is also used for orbital space tourism.\n\nReusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches ‍last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.\n\nHowever, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.\n\nIn late ​December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over ‌the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.\n\nCASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.\n\nThe new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in ⁠detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on ​the inauguration.\n\n\"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog ​development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration,\" Xinhua wrote.\n\nThursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies ‍such as small celestial resource exploration ⁠and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and ⁠Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.\n\nThe U.S. faces intense competition this decade from ‌China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. ‌Apollo mission in 1972.",

That left the community without a true grocery store for years, forcing people to drive nearly a half-hour to pick up basics, or to overpay for them at local specialty stores.\n\nSomething similar happened when the K-Mart closed in Key West. That shutdown, one of the last in the chain, robbed that remote area of its only department store, forcing residents to drive four to five hours before they hit a Walmart or a Target.\n\nResidents in the Pacific Northwest now face similar challenges, according to local reports.\n\nIn the markets it serves, Cascade Farm and Outdoor, which is closing all its stores, will leave a similar hole for consumers.\n\nA rival to Tractor Supply, Cascade Farm serves farmers and rural communities. It's sort of an everything-you-might-need general store model. The chain offers grocery, clothing, footwear, sporting goods, outdoor gear, hardware, and various farming supplies.\n\n\"Cascade Farm and Outdoor is built on great Northwest traditions you’ve come to know and trust.

    "fullText": "Starmer’s team is wary of spies but such fears are not new – with Theresa May once warned to get dressed under a duvet\n\nWhen prime ministers travel to China, heightened security arrangements are a given – as is the quiet game of cat and mouse that takes place behind the scenes as each country tests out each other’s tradecraft and capabilities.\n\nKeir Starmer’s team has been issued with burner phones and fresh sim cards, and is using temporary email addresses, to prevent devices being loaded with spyware or UK government servers being hacked into.\n\nThe employment of such tactics may sound dramatic but they are par for the course in an age of digital espionage and information security. Burner phones, for example, are routinely used by No 10 on some trips abroad – at G20 the summits in Brazil in 2024 and South Africa in 2025, for example – though not on visits to allied nations or Five Eyes intelligence partners.\n\nFor visits to China these precautions have been standard for at least a decade, such is the expectation that Beijing will eavesdrop and monitor.\n\nWhen she was prime minister, Theresa May was warned ahead of her trip to Beijing in 2018 to get dressed under the duvet to ensure that spy cameras would not film her without any clothes on. It was advice that was passed on generally by officials to all those travelling on the trip eight years ago.\n\nConcerns about peeping tom surveillance are particularly relevant to those in the official entourage or business and press delegations staying in hotels. “There was a well-worn routine in places like Shenzhen that foreigners from the west would be assigned the same rooms so they wouldn’t have to move the equipment,” a former senior British intelligence official said. Those with time on their hands would try to find the concealed bugging devices for fun.\n\nWhen Gordon Brown visited China in 2008, an aide was victim of a honey trap. The male aide met a Chinese woman at a lively hotel disco in Shanghai and left with her. The next day, he reported that his BlackBerry phone was missing. He was reprimanded, though No 10 said there had been no security compromise.\n\nPart of the standard security guidance given to ministers and their aides reflects this incident. “The rest of the advice,” the senior security official said, “was warning middle-aged men that if an attractive young Chinese woman appeared interested in you, she probably wasn’t”.\n\nMichael Gove, writing in the Mail last year, recalled being given similar warnings before being dispatched on a ministerial trip in 2010: “I was also told that if anyone from the opposite sex who approached me was out of my league they had only one thing on their mind – and it wasn’t comparing notes on Confucian philosophy.”\n\nDavid Cameron visited Beijing as prime minister in December 2013. A former aide recalled that China insisted on supplying a personal protection officer “over six-and-a-half-foot tall” to follow the British prime minister and his team as closely as reasonably possible.\n\nThe practice, again, is relatively standard, but it offered an obvious possibility for low level information gathering. “At the end of the trip after pretending he couldn’t speak or understand, at the plane he said goodbye and safe travels in perfect English,” they recalled, presumably as a reminder they were being watched.\n\nGeneral guidance, according to one British official who visited Beijing, “is that everything is bugged” and the only area for sensitive or secret conversations and debriefs is the secure compartment in the British embassy.\n\nSimilar considerations apply when meeting Chinese leaders or officials – at international summits – or when visiting the country’s diplomatic premises in London or elsewhere.\n\nWhen James Cleverly was foreign secretary, a former adviser recalled that during the UN general assembly in New York, he and his team refused to take their mobiles into the Chinese consulate. The handsets were all stored in a lead-lined bag in the hands of officials who did not go inside the diplomatic building.\n\nOne of the consequences of this abundance of caution is that ministers are out of ordinary contact in China, meaning their families cannot easily get in contact, having instead to communicate via a private secretary or other close aide.\n\nIt can also cause other political issues, as happened to Vince Cable in 2014. The Lib Dem, who was then business secretary, was visiting China and did not have his mobile phone with him. Back in the UK, an old ally, Matthew Oakeshott, launched a coup attempt against the then party leader, Nick Clegg – but the plot struggled for momentum and quickly collapsed with Cable uncontactable.\n\n“I wasn’t part of this plot. It all broke in the middle of the night in China and not surprisingly we were not rushing to the phone,” Cable said.",

    "description": "From room size to food quality, my first-ever cruise on board Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas was full of surprises.",
    "fullText": "The ship has 18 decks and 2,867 staterooms, according to Royal Caribbean.\n\nI booked a mid-tier room — a step above windowless interior staterooms, a step below staterooms with a balcony, and two steps below suites.\n\nMy 179-square-foot cabin had a private bathroom, a king-size bed, and an ocean view.\n\nI was surprised by how big the discount was. To me, $1,000 feels like a huge price difference for the same vacation.\n\nI thought the stateroom made great use of a small space with plenty of storage for my clothes and other belongings. There were two closets for hanging space and more drawers than I used.\n\nAfter leaving to start my day each morning, a stateroom attendant cleaned my room. And after I left for dinner each night, they came back to clean up again. Every evening, they brought me fresh towels — sometimes creatively folded — and a flyer featuring the next day's schedule, including the weather, dress code, and any other important information, such as a time change.\n\nThis surprised me because I am used to having my room serviced once daily, if at all, during my hotel stays, and never in Airbnbs.\n\nAn electronic shade over the window could be lowered to reveal grand views. I loved waking up after a night at sea to a front-row view of the place I'd be visiting that day.\n\nWhile windowless rooms are cheaper, I couldn't imagine staying in one. My ocean-view stateroom cost about $300 more than an entry-level room.\n\nI booked a stateroom at the front of deck eight and felt constant motion in my room.\n\nSome nights were rockier than others. On the roughest nights, I heard and felt a similar sensation to thunder beneath me every few minutes. Loud thumps and heavy vibrations in my room sounded like large pieces of furniture falling. The first night this happened, I feared the worst, but over time, I realized that this was a normal aspect of cruising — but one I would likely never get used to.\n\nAfter talking to seasoned cruisers on the ship, several told me that the front of the ship is one of the worst places to be for feeling motion. Higher decks in the middle of the ship feel calmer and more stable, they said.\n\nNext time, I'd choose a room in the middle of the ship.\n\nAll I had to do for safety training was watch a couple of videos — either on my room TV or on the Royal Caribbean app — and then check in at my assembly station, the area I was assigned to in case of an emergency. At the assembly station, an attendant checked the Royal Caribbean app to confirm that I had completed the mandatory training.\n\nI was expecting to attend a large safety training session once I got on the ship, so this alternative was a breeze.\n\nSince there were so many elevators on the ship, I expected them to be a pretty efficient way to get around. But they were often so crowded and slow that I took the stairs instead. By the middle of my trip, unless I was going all the way up to the pool decks, I always opted for the stairs to save time.\n\nThe ship has 16 guest decks; each deck is divided into three sections — forward, middle, and aft.\n\nIt took me a few days to get used to the sections, and I often found myself heading to the right deck but the wrong section of the ship. Luckily, there were maps on every floor, which I used until the morning I left.\n\nIf I woke up on deck five of Wonder of the Seas with no memory of my cruise, I'd think I was in a shopping mall.\n\nAside from the slight movement of the ship, the indoor decks were so big that, as a cruise newbie, it was hard to believe that I was on a gigantic boat in the middle of the ocean. Everywhere I looked, I saw shops, stands, restaurants, large sculptures, and a unique ceiling structure that reminded me of the malls I've visited.\n\nAside from music festivals, I've never heard more live music on a trip than on this cruise. On the communal decks, musicians played for hours while people relaxed and played around them. I was also surprised by the eclectic mix of genres I heard, from rock to jazz to classical.\n\nIn addition to the music hall, where concerts were regularly held, live bands performed on indoor and outdoor communal decks. Some people watched, while others listened while swimming, relaxing, or walking around.\n\nI like to be comfy, so I was dreading formal nights going into this cruise.\n\nI brought one fancy dress with me to wear whenever I needed, but on the first formal night, I realized that the dress code wasn't strictly enforced. People wore a range of outfits, from evening gowns to T-shirts.\n\nFor the rest of the trip, I also relaxed my interpretation of the dress code.\n\nThe excursion I was most thrilled about — a hot-air balloon ride over the Bahamas — was canceled the day of because the winds were too high.\n\nIt was on the last day of my trip, and with only one day in port, it could not be rescheduled. It was the experience I was looking forward to most, so I was disappointed. On a cruise ship, I learned that all plans are subject to change based on things outside the crew's control, like the weather.\n\nSince we traveled such a long way to each port, I wrongfully assumed we'd spend more time in them. The ship usually docked around 8 a.m. and left in the early afternoon.\n\nI thought I'd have time to explore the port for a while after each excursion, but some of my excursions took the entire day, getting me back to the boat just in time for departure. I also hoped to see what these places looked like at night, but we never departed after sundown.\n\nAlthough I got a taste of the Caribbean, I didn't have enough time to get a sense of each place, which made me realize that I would probably prefer to vacation in just one place and have time to truly explore it.",

    "title": "Russian Scientists Test Plasma Engine That Could Cut Mars Travel to About 30 Days",
    "description": "Russia is testing a plasma engine prototype designed to slash Mars travel time to just 60 days. Developed by Rosatom’s Troitsk Institute, the system uses electromagnetic fields to accelerate particles to 100 km/s, promising a flight-ready model for deep-space missions by 2030.",
    "fullText": "Russia is quietly testing a new plasma propulsion system that, if it performs as claimed, could dramatically change how long it takes to travel to Mars. Early results suggest a leap in speed and efficiency that has drawn attention precisely because it is not coming from NASA or private U.S. companies such as SpaceX.\n\nThe engine is being developed by the Troitsk Institute, part of Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom. According to researchers involved in the program, the system could reduce interplanetary travel time from several months to roughly one to two months. Ground-based testing is currently underway, and the developers say the technology could be ready for space deployment by around 2030.\n\nUnlike conventional chemical rockets, the new system relies on electromagnetic fields to accelerate charged hydrogen particles. This places it firmly in the category of electric or plasma propulsion, a field that has gained increasing global attention as space agencies look for more efficient ways to travel deeper into the solar system.\n\nChemical rockets deliver very high thrust for a short time, which is ideal for launching from Earth. However, they are inefficient for long-distance travel once a spacecraft is in orbit. Plasma engines, by contrast, generate much lower thrust but can operate continuously for long periods, gradually building up extremely high speeds while using far less propellant.\n\nIf the Russian system achieves its projected performance, it could have a major impact on how future missions to Mars and beyond are planned, both for scientific exploration and for potential military or logistical applications.\n\nThe prototype engine is currently being tested inside a 14-meter-long vacuum chamber designed to simulate space conditions. According to technical details reported by the Russian newspaper Izvestia, the engine operates at a power level of 300 kilowatts in a pulsed periodic mode and has already demonstrated a working lifespan of 2,400 hours. That duration would be sufficient for a full Mars mission, including acceleration and deceleration phases.\n\nResearchers say the engine accelerates charged hydrogen particles, including protons and electrons, to speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second. By comparison, traditional chemical rockets typically achieve exhaust velocities of around 4.5 kilometers per second. This massive difference in exhaust velocity is the key to the engine’s potential efficiency and speed.\n\nThe plasma engine is not intended to launch directly from Earth’s surface. A conventional chemical rocket would first carry the spacecraft into low Earth orbit. Once in space, the plasma engine would be activated to provide continuous thrust for the journey through deep space.\n\nOfficials involved in the project also note that the system could function as a space tug, moving cargo, modules, or satellites between different planetary orbits. This concept aligns with broader international interest in reusable orbital transport systems.\n\nThe engine uses hydrogen as propellant and relies on an onboard nuclear reactor to provide a constant energy supply. According to project researcher Yegor Biryulin, hydrogen’s low atomic mass allows for faster acceleration while reducing fuel consumption. Its abundance in space could eventually allow for in situ refueling, at least in theory.\n\nThe propulsion system uses two high-voltage electrodes to create directed plasma flow. Charged particles pass between them, forming a magnetic field that expels plasma and generates thrust. This design avoids the need to heat plasma to extreme temperatures, which reduces component wear and improves overall efficiency.\n\nRosatom documentation lists the projected thrust at 6 newtons, which is high for a plasma propulsion prototype. Even so, the thrust remains far lower than chemical rockets, meaning spacecraft would be designed for slow but continuous acceleration rather than short bursts of power.\n\nPlasma propulsion is already used in orbit on many satellites, including systems on OneWeb spacecraft and on NASA’s Psyche mission launched in 2023. Most existing plasma engines operate at exhaust velocities between 30 and 50 kilometers per second. The Russian claims of 100 kilometers per second would represent a significant step forward.\n\nHowever, the technology remains unproven in space. Peer-reviewed scientific data have not yet been published, and the nuclear reactor design has not been disclosed. Nuclear-powered spacecraft raise complex safety, regulatory, and international approval issues, especially during launch.\n\nWhile the concept is promising, the engine is still years away from practical use. Its projected readiness by 2030 will depend on continued testing, funding, and successful resolution of engineering and regulatory challenges.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Autorepublika.com and has been republished with permission by Guessing Headlights.

    "title": "I backpacked around Europe for 6 months. Here are the items I couldn't live without — and the ones I wish I'd left behind.",
    "description": "I spent six months traveling Europe with two backpacks, and loved having things like a portable white-noise machine and flat travel pouches with me.",
    "fullText": "Packing for a six-month trip around Europe wasn't easy. I deliberated for a good two months about what to take with me and what to leave behind. Since I only had two backpacks, I had to be picky about what I brought.\n\nNow that I'm back home, I'm able to reflect on the items I took with me. Here are the three things that now have a permanent spot in my luggage and the two that won't make the cut next time.\n\nNoisy neighbors and loud city streets are part of the traveling experience. Although some people like to counteract these things with earplugs, I've always found them uncomfortable as a side sleeper.\n\nSo, I brought a mini white-noise machine to drown out any music, traffic, or chatter. The little cylinder was quite loud for its size, and did a great job of masking any background noise.\n\nI definitely had more restful sleep because of it, and it's now an essential for all my future trips.\n\nI find the traditional hard-plastic travel containers for liquids to be quite clunky. So, for this trip, I bought a pack of flat travel pouches in different sizes.\n\nI used the bigger bags for shampoo and body wash and the smaller ones for face wash and conditioner. I'd then refill them from larger bottles purchased during my longer stays.\n\nAlthough they took a little more patience to fill, these pouches stacked up much more neatly than the bulky travel bottles I used to use.\n\nI typically won't wear a pair of earrings or a bracelet if I can't physically see it. This presents a problem for many bag-like travel containers where the jewelry isn't laid out neatly.\n\nWhen I researched other travel-jewelry options, I found that many were large and bulky, which wouldn't bode well for my limited space.\n\nHowever, I saw a hack online about using a foldable pill box to store jewelry. I ordered one immediately and found it to be the perfect solution.\n\nWhile packing for my trip, my mind went to everything I'd have to charge: my laptop, smartwatch, phone, and white-noise machine.\n\nSo, I purchased a travel power strip/adapter with three ports and a long cord. I figured I'd be set for all my charging needs.\n\nIn practice, however, this big rectangle ended up being a nuisance. It was incredibly bulky, and if I plugged two or more things into it, a spark would shoot off from the plug.\n\nI ended up throwing it out and replacing it with a high-quality cube adapter. This much-lighter converter had a three-prong port and several USB slots, which suited my needs just fine.\n\nIf anything, I'd bring two cube adapters next time to have one in the bedroom and one in the living room.\n\nThis story was originally published on February 4, 2025 and most recently updated on January 28, 2026.",

The day ended with 6,250 canceled flights, per FlightAware.\n\nThat compares to Sunday's 11,618 canceled flights.\n\nSunday marked the worst day for air travel since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Monday.\n\nHe added that the government expects flight schedules to return to normal on Wednesday.\n\n\"This storm is unique,\" he said. \"You get the ice, and you get the snow, and on top of that, we have now a cold weather snap that comes after it.\"\n\nAirport and airline workers have also struggled to get to work due to the state of the roadways.\n\nOn Monday evening, Heather Garboden, American Airlines' chief customer officer, wrote to customers saying the storm \"continues to present travel challenges across the country.\"\n\nAmerican has been the most-affected airline each day, including over 1,900 cancellations on Sunday, per FlightAware.\n\nGarboden added that five of the airline's nine hubs were \"significantly impacted,\" including its largest at DFW, which saw \"record-setting\" weather conditions.\n\nAnd as the storm affected cities that don't generally experience such cold, many areas lacked the infrastructure to handle the heavy snow and ice.\n\nThis, in turn, has \"led to staffing issues as team members, plus vendor and federal partners, struggle to make their way on the roads,\" she said.\n\nAirlines have waived change fees so that passengers have more flexibility to avoid disruption due to the storm.\n\nHowever, while American's waiver covers travel through Thursday, United Airlines' is through Wednesday, and Delta Air Lines' only continues through Tuesday.",

    "description": "As a Disney travel planner who's visited the theme parks many times, here are the mistakes I always see people make that cost them time and money.",
    "fullText": "I've been to the Disney parks over 50 times, so I've truly done it all.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels who specializes in Disney destinations, so a big part of my job is making recommendations about how to plan an epic trip. I also give my clients a lot of advice on what not to do.\n\nHere are some of the biggest mistakes people make at Disney World.\n\nIf you have any flexibility, avoid scheduling your Disney vacation during major school breaks in the US.\n\nHoliday weekends, spring break, and winter holidays will almost always bring the biggest crowds to the theme parks.\n\nDisney doesn't really have many low seasons anymore, but avoiding these highly popular times will give you more freedom to explore the parks with fewer crowds and lower ticket prices.\n\nThe theme parks are a big part of the Disney experience, and I love spending time at them. However, there's so much more to do in the area.\n\nFor one, I recommend taking a day off to lounge by your hotel's pool, resort hop, shop at Disney Springs, or even play a round of mini-golf.\n\nWhen we go to the parks, my family also usually takes a midday break to rest and relax. It is supposed to be a vacation, after all.\n\nSpeaking of just how much there is to do at Disney beyond the parks, you must check out its shopping, dining, and entertainment complex Disney Springs. It's free to explore.\n\nPick up some souvenirs at the massive World of Disney shop, check out the hundreds of sets and amazing displays at the Lego store, or just enjoy some snacks while you bask in the Florida sun.\n\nIf you get really hungry, head over to grab a delicious lunch at one of my favorite eateries, like Homecomin' or Frontera Cocina.\n\nMy No. 1 tip for visiting theme parks of any kind is to arrive early.\n\nYou'll get a huge jump on your day if you get to the parks as soon as they open, or just before. Crowd levels tend to be much lower at this time, meaning you can experience many attractions early in the day.\n\nAs with most theme parks, the longer you stay, the lower your daily ticket and accommodation costs are likely to be with bundles.\n\nIf you're already paying to travel to Disney, do yourself a favor and stay a few extra days.\n\nAfter all, the biggest complaint I get from clients is that they didn't stay long enough. In my opinion, a week is the ideal amount of time to truly experience Disney World.\n\nSome organization and prep are required for the ideal Disney World trip, but you shouldn't overplan.\n\nYou don't need to schedule every moment of your day or have every detail organized. Make a general outline of your daily agenda — with dining reservations and a list of must-do rides and attractions — but leave room for spontaneous fun.\n\nIf you're on too tight a schedule, you'll miss all the good stuff, like unique character interactions.\n\nThe park-hopping ticket option allows you to visit more than one park per day for less than it'd cost to buy each ticket separately.\n\nHowever, unless you're staying for only a very short time and want to see as much as possible, there are few reasons to park hop with small kids.\n\nIt can just become an unnecessary added expense that you probably won't make the best use of if you're pausing for afternoon naps or breaks.\n\nHowever, groups with older children or only adults may enjoy and fully take advantage of the flexibility that park hopping offers.\n\nIf you want to dine at table-service restaurants, you should make reservations in advance. However, eating three sit-down meals a day at Disney World will take up way too much of your time.\n\nMany table-service experiences can take 90 minutes to two hours from start to finish, so you wouldn't be left with much time to experience the rest of the parks.\n\nOne table-service reservation a day is usually a perfect respite from the hustle and bustle without overcrowding your schedule.\n\nRider swap, or rider switch, is a great service when traveling with young children who aren't tall enough for or don't want to ride certain attractions.\n\nIt allows one parent or guardian to wait with the child while the rest of the party rides. Once the first group returns, the waiting adult can go on the attraction without having to get in the back of the line.\n\nHowever, not enough people know about it, and they can end up wasting time in lines.\n\nJust get in the habit of asking the park employee at the front of the ride whether it's available for a particular attraction.\n\nStaying off the property can save you money, and I've done so many times on Disney trips. However, if you've never stayed at a Disney resort, you're missing out.\n\nThese stays can come with practical benefits, including complimentary transportation to and from the parks. The biggest perk, though, is the access to extra Disney magic.\n\nThese resorts typically have incredibly immersive themes and special touches that should be experienced at least once. Though there are some extravagant Disney resorts, there are also value ones that tend to be more budget-friendly.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 9, 2021, and most recently updated on January 27, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Before Melania Trump became a fashion model and first lady of the United States, she was Melanija Knavs, the Slovenian daughter of a car salesman and a textile factory worker.\n\nAs the first naturalized US citizen to serve as first lady and the second foreign-born first lady in US history, Trump's hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has become a tourist destination attracting visitors to see where she spent her early years.\n\nHere are some Sevnica landmarks from Trump's childhood.\n\nTrump was born in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, on April 26, 1970.\n\nShe spent her childhood in Sevnica, a small town 30 miles away.\n\nIt has a population of 17,672, according to data collected by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia in 2023.\n\nSlovenia became independent in 1991.\n\nSevnica produces over 150 kinds of salami, a feat celebrated at its annual Salamiada festival.\n\nSevnica's tourism doubled in the year before Donald Trump's first term as interest in Melania Trump grew, a tour guide told Reuters in January 2017.\n\nThe small town capitalized on its claim to fame as the former FLOTUS' hometown, offering tours, foods, and souvenirs named after her.\n\nFor 2017 as a whole, the number of foreigners visiting Slovenia jumped 17% when compared to the previous year, with a total of 3.4 million visitors, Reuters reported in January 2018.\n\nThe number of visitors has risen in the years since, with just under 7 million visitors in 2025, The Slovenian Times reported.\n\nHer father, Viktor Knavs, worked as a car salesman. Her mother, Amalija, worked at a local textile factory.\n\nTrump has one sister, Ines Knauss, and a half-brother, Denis Cigelnjak.\n\nMirjana Jelancic, a friend of Trump's who went on to become principal of the school, told ABC News in 2016 that the young Trump was \"an angel\" and \"a very good student.\"\n\nWhen Trump and her sister, Ines, were in high school, the Knavs family moved to Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital. There, Trump was scouted by photographer Stane Jerko and signed with a modeling agency when she was 18.\n\nTrump made the donation after her wedding in 2005, The New York Times reported.\n\nTrump is the second first lady born outside the US. The first was John Quincy Adams' wife, Louisa Catherine Adams, who was born in London.\n\nThe Rotary Klub Sevnica held events in honor of Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017 and 2025. Proceeds from the 2025 event went toward a youth scholarship fund, the Slovenian outlet Dolenjski List reported.\n\nA plaque at the site says the new bronze statue is \"dedicated to the eternal memory of a monument to Trump which stood in this location from 2019-2020.\"\n\nAt a 2023 naturalization ceremony held at the National Archives in Washington, DC, Trump said that becoming a US citizen is a \"life-altering experience that takes time, determination, and sometimes even tremendous strength.\" She also recalled navigating a \"labyrinth\" of paperwork to obtain a worker visa during her modeling career.\n\n\"I recall feeling a tremendous sense of pride and belonging after I recited the US oath of allegiance, as the pathway to citizenship is arduous,\" she said.",

    "description": "As a travel planner, there are a lot of mistakes I tell my clients to avoid when booking all-inclusive vacations, especially when choosing rooms.",
    "fullText": "As a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels, one of my areas of expertise is booking all-inclusive vacations.\n\nThere are a lot of resorts out there with different tiers and offerings, so it's easy to get tripped up if you're new to booking them. And if you're spending a few thousand dollars for a weeklong getaway for two, you want to ensure you're getting your money's worth.\n\nHere are the biggest mistakes people make while booking all-inclusive vacations — and how to avoid them.\n\nWhen choosing an all-inclusive resort, it's important to consider your dream vacation before you even start looking online. Determining a trip bucket list will greatly help to narrow down your search.\n\nI encourage clients to think about things like their budget, nonnegotiable amenities, ideal locations, flight accessibility, desired room features, and resort size.\n\nMany popular all-inclusive resorts are in tropical locations, but there are also some great options in places like Canada, Europe, and Japan.\n\nClub Med offers all-inclusive resorts worldwide. One of its newer offerings is Club Med Québec Charlevoix, which offers an all-inclusive ski experience in the winter and an adventure experience in the summer.\n\nIn all-inclusive travel, you truly get what you pay for.\n\nValue properties often struggle to provide quality food options, comfortable accommodations, and adequate service. I recommend focusing searches on properties with a rating of at least 4.5.\n\nAlthough entry-level rooms are the least expensive, booking them can also come at a price.\n\nThe cheapest rooms can have views of the parking lot or construction sites. Or they're located on the ground floor, which can get musty in humid, tropical climates.\n\nYou can often upgrade to a better room for a minimal extra cost, and I think it's more than worth it. If you're really on a strict budget, shorten your trip by a day or two to allow for a higher-quality experience.\n\nThere are many great kid-friendly, all-inclusive resorts, but taking an adults-only trip is so much fun.\n\nGrab your friends, family, or significant others to rewind for a few days without the kids.\n\nOn one kid-free trip to Le Blanc Spa Resort in Cancún, my husband and I appreciated the time we spent reconnecting, unwinding, and unplugging from work and family responsibilities.\n\nBooking a trip to the Caribbean or Mexico in summer and fall (hurricane season) carries some risk, but prices are usually significantly lower than at other times of the year.\n\nThe weather can be gorgeous, and there's no guarantee your trip will be affected by bad weather. For example, my husband and I honeymooned in the Caribbean in the fall, and the weather was some of the best I have ever had on a vacation.\n\nIf you're concerned, definitely keep an eye on the weather and add travel insurance to your booking.\n\nOne of the best parts of an all-inclusive vacation is enjoying the all-you-can-eat cuisine and top-shelf drink selections.\n\nSpending up to a week at a luxury resort with mediocre food can be an unenjoyable experience. When reading reviews, pay close attention to comments about food quality.\n\nI love the food and drinks at Palace, Sandals, and Beaches resorts and often recommend them to my clients.\n\nOne of the biggest disappointments I hear from clients is that the view from their room didn't live up to their expectations.\n\nSome resorts are more liberal with their categorization of partial-ocean-view and ocean-view rooms — maybe you can see a sliver of blue through the trees if you crane your neck.\n\nIf you want to see the beautiful blue of the sea from your balcony, you generally need to book an oceanfront room.\n\nYour friend might have impeccable taste, but that doesn't mean their favorite resort meets your style or needs.\n\nOne of my clients might love a resort, but another may not enjoy the experience at all. For example, your friend may love lounging by the pool, but you prefer beachfront activities. Maybe they'd rather have mindblowing cocktails, while your priority is being served first-class dinners with bites from around the globe.\n\nRemember, finding the resort that's right for you is a very personal process.\n\nSure, I'm a little biased, but hear me out: Choosing the right destinations and resorts for your all-inclusive vacation can be daunting.\n\nIn Mexico alone, there are hundreds of lodgings to choose from.\n\nMost travel planners offer complimentary services (we get commissions from hotels and other bookings), which can greatly reduce the headache of planning your trip.\n\nI always look for the best pricing and make sure to support my clients before, during, and after their vacations so they can relax.\n\nAs an agent, I also visit resorts to vet them for my clients. Reading online reviews can be helpful, but they can also be confusing, so I like being able to make personal recommendations.\n\nThis story was originally published on May 4, 2024, and most recently updated on January 26, 2026.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jim Rowley, CEO of Crunch Fitness and United States Marine Corps. veteran. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat's interesting about my day is that it's never really routine.\n\nIt's highly dependent on where I'm working from, so if I'm in my main office in Manhattan, the day is quite different than if I'm at home in Lake Tahoe. It's fulfilling to not have the same routine over and over again.\n\nI've been doing this for 34 years, so monotony is a killer for me.\n\nWhere my job gets fun is if I'm on the road, I'm in gyms. My team and get to go to our more than 500 gyms, and I love meeting the members.\n\nLately, we've been spending a lot of time on understanding where AI is going to integrate perfectly with the member experience and the team member experience. We're testing some ideas out in the field.\n\nWhen I'm feeling like I'm in a rut from a strategy standpoint, creatively, I go to the gyms. I think all the answers are in the gyms. So I talk to my teams about what's working, what's not.\n\nPeople think I'm kind of a hard guy, but I think I'm pretty relaxed, especially on the road. There are just a few non-negotiables I have in my regular cadence to stay on track.\n\nTypically, I get up at 5:45 a.m. to 6:30 a.m., depending on the day. My morning is like an old grandpa's. I watch the business news, see how the markets are trending. I usually have my one cup of coffee for the day.\n\nRight now, my morning is special — I had a granddaughter born last June, so she's up really early, my daughter's up really early, so I usually get to chat with them via text or FaceTime before everything has started. Once that's done, I start my emails. The majority of my day is set up around Zoom rodeos, performance updates, executive leadership team meetings, or huddles.\n\nThis may be funny, but when I'm on the road, I need to have a desk or a sitting area so I have space to think and stretch my legs. I can't just be checking emails from bed.\n\nI also need to get a protein shake in the morning, especially when I'm on the road. I'm not going to sit down and have a hotel breakfast or stop anywhere.\n\nI believe fitness is medicine. I'm 58 now, and I'm chasing being happy, healthy, and mobile in my eighties and nineties, so it's really about staying active, keeping moving.\n\nWhen I was in the Marine Corps., I worked out in the morning. Prior to 2020, I worked out at the end of my day.\n\nI'm finding that the midday routine is best for me now, to block out some time.\n\nAt lunchtime, around 1 p.m., I break for exercise. So about 12:45, I wind down my meetings, and I'm either headed to Pilates or the gym.\n\nI can walk to our gym, which is great. It's about a 20-minute walk there and back, so you get 40 minutes of cardio with your weightlifting.\n\nI don't lift for ego anymore. I rarely bench. I used to bench press all the time, and I was very proud of what I could bench press. Now, I don't bench press at all because it's so hard on my shoulders. I do a lot more dumbbell workouts now, a lot more machine lifting.\n\nHaving lifted weights since I was 14, I felt like Pilates was an opportunity for me to try to lengthen, strengthen, and activate some of the smaller muscles.\n\nIt changed my life, to be honest with you. I became much more limber, a lot less tight. At first, I was the only man in the Pilates class, but I've been telling my neighbors and building a little army of Pilates guys.\n\nI've done both yoga and Pilates, and prefer Pilates because there is a little bit of strength with mobility and balance.\n\nAfter the gym, I'll have lunch, and then I'm back at the office for more calls, meetings, and so forth. It's problem-solving, it's answering questions, and then I wrap up my day.\n\nI like to get out of here by 5:30 p.m. to get a walk in, especially this time of year, because it's cold and it's just refreshing.\n\nWe eat dinner around 6:30 or 7 p.m.\n\nMy wife and I aren't big on sitcom television, but we do like series. She likes anything out of England, the BBC. I'm more into military history, US history, or westerns. We settled in the middle with dramatic crime whodunnit type of series.\n\nI do have a passion for \"Survivor\" and \"The Amazing Race.\" People laugh at me, but I just love competition.\n\nThen I read a little bit, and I'm in bed usually by 11.",

    "fullText": "I've been to all 50 states and have explored everywhere from tiny towns in New England to the mountains of Alaska. Along the way, I've learned that the right travel essentials can make all the difference.\n\nAfter hundreds of flights and road trips, I've boiled my packing list down to 11 things I never leave home without. Whether it's a quick weekend getaway or a cross-country adventure, these are the items I always bring with me.\n\nAs a very frequent traveler, I do everything I can to turn airport chaos into a calmer experience, whether I'm on a packed plane or waiting in a noisy lounge or terminal.\n\nSo, I use noise-cancelling headphones to sleep, listen to music, or just tune everything else out. They've saved more trips than I can count, and I never leave home without them.\n\nNo matter where I'm going, I always bring a small first-aid kit with me.\n\nScrapes, blisters, or minor aches happen on the road, and having basics like Band-Aids and over-the-counter medications means I'm ready for anything.\n\nBetween long hikes, flights, and summer heat, it's easy to get dehydrated while traveling. That's why I always bring electrolytes with me.\n\nA quick powder package or tablet keeps me energized and feeling my best without weighing down my bag. I rarely leave home without them, as they're a small addition that makes a big difference.\n\nThis should go without saying, but hydration is a non-negotiable. That's why I always bring a refillable water bottle when traveling.\n\nI always fill mine up immediately upon entering the airport terminal (after going through security), and it makes it much easier for me to stay hydrated. Plus, it's much more cost-effective than buying airport water.\n\nI always bring cash and multiple credit cards with me when I'm on the road.\n\nCash always comes in handy for tips and hole-in-the-wall vendors that don't accept cards. However, I also pay attention to which credit cards have the best travel benefits and use them to my advantage.\n\nFor example, my American Express Platinum Card gets me into lots of airport lounges and provides a host of other benefits, including rental car theft and damage insurance.\n\nPlus, my United Airlines MileagePlus credit card helps me save on in-flight purchases.\n\nAs a woman traveling solo, I'm always thinking about my safety, so I carry a whistle with me and keep it within arm's reach.\n\nThankfully, I've never needed to use it, but knowing I can quickly draw attention to myself in any situation gives me peace of mind.\n\nAs a solo traveler, I depend on a tripod for photos. I simply place my phone on it and snap photos on a delay.\n\nThis way, I don't have to reply on other travelers — or selfies — to capture the moment.\n\nI spend a lot of time outside when I travel, so sun protection — like sunglasses and a hat — are key.\n\nIt feels obvious, but I can't tell you how many times I've seen people around me scrambling to buy these essentials because they didn't think to bring them.\n\nI love to journal on the road, so I always bring a notebook with me. I often spend nights doodling memories of the day to look back at later.\n\nIt may sound fancy, but I never travel without my large black cashmere scarf. It doubles as a blanket on flights, works well as a shawl over outfits, and adds another layer anytime I need one.\n\nIt's such a versatile item and keeps me at the perfect temperature at all times.\n\nAs a female solo traveler, I always travel with an Addalock — a small, portable device that lets me secure doors from the inside for additional peace of mind.\n\nEven if the main lock feels safe, having this on hand is a tiny addition that makes me feel more secure.",

    "fullText": "As a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels, I've explored Europe extensively to find the best recommendations for my clients.\n\nThough popular cities such as Paris, London, Rome, and Amsterdam have massive appeal, the continent's vast landscape offers gems around every corner.\n\nHere are five European destinations I think everyone should visit at least once.\n\nSalzburg is a stunning destination — especially if you're a \"Sound of Music\" fan.\n\nThere are plenty of prearranged tours to iconic filming locations where you can dance around the Pegasus fountain like Maria and the children, visit the \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" gazebo, and tour the stunning Basilika St. Michael, where Maria was married to Captain Von Trapp.\n\nIn the summer and fall, there are even \"Sound of Music\" bike tours available.\n\nAnd yes, there are plenty of other activities in the city, even if you're not into musicals. Young children may like the Salzburg Zoo, and music lovers can explore Mozart's birthplace and residence.\n\nSitting atop a hill, Hohensalzburg Fortress is one of the largest castles in the area and boasts great views of the city. To get another stunning view, take the Untersberg cable car.\n\nJust a few hours from London by train, Liverpool is a must-visit spot for Beatles fans.\n\nAll four band members grew up in the port city. There are many different types of excursions, from short bus rides to full-day private tours that will immerse you in the sights and sounds of the band's legacy.\n\nIn Liverpool, football (or American soccer) is a way of life, and there are two main clubs here: Liverpool and Everton. Fans of the game can take an LFC stadium tour for a behind-the-scenes look.\n\nThe city also houses a slew of theaters, art galleries, and museums — and it's becoming a hot destination for shopping and unique culinary experiences.\n\nCinque Terre is one of my favorite cities — or, more accurately, my favorite collection of five villages.\n\nNestled along the Italian Riviera, Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore are accessible only by train, ferry, or foot.\n\nEach has a distinct style, and hikers flock to this region to enjoy the beautiful scenery.\n\nVernazza, my favorite village, is the gem of this region. I love wandering the cobbled streets to shop, snack, and explore. You can also visit the Castello Doria or the church of Santa Margherita d'Antiochia.\n\nIn the summer months, tourists sunbathe on the beaches of Monterosso or take a dip in the sea. For a history lesson, visit the remains of Castello Fieschi or the Church of St John the Baptist and the Capuchin Monastery.\n\nIn Manarola, take some time to watch locals cliff-jump into the marina. I also suggest taking a wine tour through the town to sample some local specialties. Be sure to try Sciacchetrà, a sweet but strong dessert wine produced in Cinque Terre.\n\nRiomaggiore is also home to a castle and churches dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries. The center of the town is great for wandering, shopping, and eating.\n\nCorniglia is probably the quietest of the five villages. There, climb the Lardarina staircase for beautiful views of the coastline or take a boat tour to fully enjoy the area's beauty.\n\nJust about two hours east of Paris by high-speed train, Strasbourg is a beautiful city along the border of France and Germany.\n\nEvery trip should include a visit to the Gothic Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Strasbourg. Try to plan your day around arriving there at 12:30 p.m. to see the wooden figures dance around the clock.\n\nAfter your cathedral visit, stroll through Petite France, explore cheese shops, and take a break to sip a glass of wine at one of the canal's many cafés.\n\nAt the end of the year, Strasbourg is also home to one of the oldest Christmas markets, dating back to the late 1500s. The Christkindelsmärik is truly magical, with more than 300 vendors selling their holiday best.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 3, 2024, and most recently updated on January 23, 2026.",

    "description": "My friend wanted to plan a Europe trip, but then I got laid off. We went to Montreal instead, and the more affordable vacation was just what I needed.",
    "fullText": "I'm never one to say no to travel, whether it's for work, to visit a friend, or just because.\n\nIn the first half of last year alone, I flew from New York to Palm Springs with friends, planned a London trip around a play I wanted to see, and saw Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour in Los Angeles.\n\nOne of my friends was trying to sell me on one more big vacation — Scotland, maybe, or Paris — that we could take together before 2025 was over.\n\nIt wouldn't have taken much convincing, but then I got laid off right at the end of May. Suddenly, traveling anywhere felt out of reach.\n\nHowever, as the dust settled and summer came and went, the thought kept creeping back into my mind: Transatlantic travel would definitely have to wait until I had steady work again, but maybe it wouldn't be impossible to take one more small trip while I still had severance?\n\nTurns out, it was possible. We went to Montreal for a long weekend in late October, and it turned out to be the perfect trip.\n\nI'd never been to Montreal before, but it was the perfect destination for several reasons.\n\nLogistically, it was a quick, 90-minute flight from New York, making it an easy choice for a weekend trip. Less time in the air meant we could make the most of just a handful of days on the ground.\n\nI was also able to buy my airfare with credit-card points, which helped keep my out-of-pocket costs low.\n\nPracticalities aside, I knew that Montreal, with its cobblestone streets in the Old Port, cozy cafés, and official language (French), would feel like a true \"trip\" — a chance to hit pause on the stress of the last few months and immerse myself in a new place.\n\nWe kept the itinerary for this girls' weekend loose. Apart from making a few dinner reservations, we really just took our time exploring the city.\n\nAs someone who tends to plan jam-packed vacations, this was definitely a departure for me, but I was surprised to find I didn't really care.\n\nIt certainly didn't feel like I was missing anything as we took our time yapping, poking through vintage stores, and taste-testing Montreal-style bagels.\n\nSure, we made time to hike up Mount Royal and checked out the Old Port, but this trip wound up being less about sightseeing and more about just having a good time together. Getting to close my laptop and not think (too much) about work was the biggest gift of all.\n\nInstead, I got to channel my energy into a few days of uninterrupted time focusing on things that brought me joy: spending quality time with a friend I'd never traveled with before, taking in a new-to-me city, people-watching on public transportation, and successfully ordering my daily oat latte in French.\n\nThe past few months had been unsteady and stressful, and I knew those same uncertainties would be waiting for me when the plane touched down. Still, our trip recharged my batteries in a way I didn't know I needed until we got home.\n\nTaking any sort of trip is a privilege, especially when your life is in flux. Those three days, though, wound up being the perfect trip for this moment in my life.\n\nBest of all, there was enough I didn't do or see in Montreal that I'm already excited to visit again, if given the chance.\n\nI know I'll take another European vacation at some point, once things feel a little more settled. In the meantime, while I wait for the next chance to grab my passport and get on a plane, I'll just sit here with my \"Bon Matin\" mug and be glad I took the trip.",

    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "fullText": "As horrific details of the Iranian government’s suppression of protesters emerge — with internal estimates counting more than 10,000 dead — the country’s young, wealthy elite are inciting further rage by continuing to flaunt their lavish lives online as they have for years, as if the nation weren’t on the brink of collapse outside of their privileged bubble.\n\nAmid an enforced internet blackout that allows an oppressive regime to commit “genocide under the cover of digital darkness,” according to one outraged expert, reporters from the Telegraph are said to have observed “rich Iranians” partying at a nightclub in a popular holiday hot spot on the border with Turkey.\n\n“Their lifestyle has enraged the citizens of Iran, specifically Gen Z in their age group, mainly because they see how these rich kids live — with no accountability for anything that they do,” Ella Rosenberg, a senior researcher at the Jerusalem Centre for Foreign Affairs, told the Times of London.\n\nMostly the children of Iran’s ruling class, they’ve famously led hedonistic lifestyles for decades, but their jaw-dropping wealth had become more visible in recent years, due to the government’s temporarily loosened grip on the internet and social media, before the current unrest began.\n\n“They’re the equivalent of the Iranian ‘Gossip Girl’: luxury cars, living in opulent high-rises in north Tehran,” Rosenberg said.\n\nThe wealth of Iran’s young elite first came to global attention more than a decade ago, with the Instagram account @richkidsoftehran.\n\n“It depicts seemingly affluent teens flaunting Rolex watches, Porsches and Maseratis, sprawling estates and pricey attire,” The Post reported in 2014.\n\nThe Instagram account has remained active and now boasts 477,000 followers.\n\nGlamorous snaps ceased being shared on the account in 2024 — since Jan. 9, six new posts relating to current events have appeared, referring to the government as a “regime” — but other well-connected and cashed-up Iranians have become influencers in their own right.\n\nAnashid Hoseini, who is married to the son of Iran’s ambassador to Denmark, has more than 1.7 million followers, thanks to envy-inducing photos that show her dripping with jewels and toting designer handbags.\n\nHoseini is reported to live in Niavaran, an affluent neighborhood in northern Tehran, but she has not posted to her account in almost a month.\n\nIt’s unclear whether she remains in Iran amid the unrest, but many have fled the country in recent weeks seeking shelter in Van, a Turkish province about 60 miles from Iran’s border.\n\nSaid to be a popular holiday spot with affluent Iranians, the Telegraph reported seeing well-heeled types gathering in a venue that can easily cost more than $100 for entry and drinks, according to the outlet.\n\n“These people benefit from the regime. They left Iran for now, because they were worried about staying there. Here, they can feel safe,” one Iranian at the club told the paper.\n\nOther young and well-connected Iranians left their home country long ago, but have still incited anger among those less affluent citizens left behind.\n\nSasha Sobhani, the son of a former Iranian ambassador to Venezuela, became a social media star showing off his expat life in Spain, where he moved in 2019.\n\nSnaps show Sobhani surrounded by scantily clad ladies and luxury sports cars, and he has since denounced Iran.\n\nHowever, the country is seeking his extradition after accusing him of money laundering and running illegal websites.\n\nThe current uprising, which exploded Dec. 28, has morphed into the most serious threat to Iran’s clerical rulers since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nThe regime has answered with overwhelming force, deploying the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij militia to crush the unrest, according to rights groups and witness accounts.\n\nSources inside Iran estimate at least 12,000 — and possibly as many as 20,000 — people may have been killed during the unrest, according to CBS News.\n\nTehran has fiercely disputed the numbers, blaming the bloodshed on what it calls “armed rioters” and “terrorists” backed by foreign powers, including the US and Israel.",

    "fullText": "World Cup 2026 ticket holders can now access priority visa appointments for travel to the United States - but doubt remains whether fans from every country to have qualified will be able to enter.\n\nThe Fifa Prioritised Appointment Scheduling System - or Fifa Pass - announced by US President Donald Trump in November, went live on Tuesday.\n\nIt was introduced in part because citizens of some countries whose teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup may not otherwise receive visa appointments in time for the tournament.\n\nBut the US State Department has stressed that a Fifa Pass appointment does not guarantee a visa will be approved, with all ticket holders having to \"undergo thorough security screening and vetting\".\n\nMost citizens of countries under the US visa waiver programme, which covers much of Europe, including the UK, along with Japan, Australia and others, can ordinarily travel visa-free for up to 90 days, so do not need to use the Fifa Pass. Travellers from those countries would need to apply instead for an Esta - an Electronic System for Travel Authorization.\n\nA senior State Department official said the new Fifa Pass system will cut wait times - with applicants in \"over 80%\" of countries now able to schedule a visa appointment in \"less that 60 days\".\n\nIt added: \"At the visa appointment, the applicant must show they qualify for the visa and plan to follow our laws and leave at the end of the tournament. America's safety and the security of our borders will always come first.\"",

In past years, Japan previously held the No. 1 position but has since fallen to No. 2, joining South Korea with access to 188 countries.\n\nBelow are the countries with the most powerful passports, ranked by the number of visa-free travel options, according to the Henley Passport Index.
