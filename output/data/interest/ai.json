    "fullText": "The world of AI is evolving quickly beyond single-purpose models toward intelligent, autonomous multi-agent systems.\n\nIn order to help developers build these complex applications, we are excited to introduce Agent Development Kit (ADK) for TypeScript, an open-source framework designed to make agent development feel more like classic software development.\n\nNow TypeScript and JavaScript developers can build, streamline, and deploy powerful AI agents and multi-agent systems using the language and ecosystem they know and love.\n\nADK is built on a core principle: empowering developers with the flexibility and precise control of a code-first approach.\n\nUsing ADK for TypeScript, you can define your agent's logic, tools, and orchestration directly in TypeScript. This enables you to apply the same best practices you use for traditional software development — including version control, automated testing, and integration into your CI/CD pipelines.\n\nGetting started with ADK for TypeScript is simple and familiar for engineers. It replaces complex prompting with modular, testable components like Agents, Instructions, and Tools. This code-first approach makes your AI logic scalable and easy to reuse across your entire project. You can define a powerful agent in just a few lines of clean, readable code:\n\nBringing ADK to the TypeScript ecosystem unlocks a powerful set of benefits for developers:\n\nADK is an open-source framework, and while it is optimized for Google's AI, including Gemini and Vertex AI, it is designed to be model-agnostic and compatible with other third-party tools. This includes full support for our latest models, such as Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Flash, allowing you to leverage their advanced capabilities in your agents.\n\nConnect to your data effortlessly using MCP Toolbox for Databases and its new native ADK for TypeScript integration.\n\nWe believe in providing developers with powerful, flexible tools to build the next generation of AI applications.\n\nWe can't wait to see what you build with Agent Development Kit for TypeScript.\n\nExplore the GitHub Repository: https://github.com/google/adk-js\n\nDive into the Documentation: https://github.com/google/adk-docs\n\nCheck out the samples: https://github.com/google/adk-samples\n\nJoin the community, share your agents, and let us know what you think. Happy building!",

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "title": "Nvidia memo says Capital One discussed alternatives to AWS as AI costs could 'get out of hand'",
    "description": "Several AWS customers have complained about rising cloud costs in the AI era. Capital One is the latest, and one of the biggest.",
    "fullText": "Capital One is concerned about AI costs rising via its cloud-computing relationship with Amazon and may be looking for alternatives, according to an internal Nvidia document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nIn the document, an Nvidia employee wrote that the chip giant talked with Capital One about AI infrastructure alternatives to Amazon Web Services, as the bank was \"looking to control costs.\"\n\nThe Nvidia staffer was recapping discussions with Capital One in an internal email after meeting representatives from the bank at a recent tech conference.\n\n\"They see their need for GPUs and reasoning models growing and the costs in AWS will soon get out of hand,\" the Nvidia employee wrote, referring to Capital One.\n\nNvidia and Capital One discussed \"AI factory and neo-clouds,\" according to the email. An AI factory is an in-house data center that a company can build to train and run AI models as an alternative to renting compute from a third party. Financial institutions can use this infrastructure for tasks such as fraud detection, customer support, and algorithmic trading, according to Nvidia.\n\nNeoclouds are upstart cloud providers, often powered by Nvidia hardware, that focus on AI workloads, whereas AWS supports a much broader range of computing needs. Top neocloud players include CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, and Nebius. Nvidia has been working closely with several of these players, in part to reduce its reliance on established cloud giants as customers.\n\nThe Capital One situation underscores a key dynamic in the AI boom. Companies are racing to adopt generative AI but also trying to mitigate rising cloud costs. This new technology has great promise, but developing and running AI models and AI applications can be expensive.\n\nLarge companies also regularly assess their cloud spending, including varying setups that increasingly incorporate multiple providers. Forty-three percent of companies use more than two public cloud providers, according to a recent RBC Capital report.\n\n\"We continue to be committed to AWS as our predominant strategic cloud partner,\" a Capital One spokesperson wrote in a statement. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\n\"Our pricing philosophy is to work relentlessly to take cost out of our own cost structure and to pass those savings back to our AWS customers in the form of lower prices,\" an AWS spokesperson said. \"It's easy to lower prices, it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices, and at AWS we work really hard at that.\"\n\nCapital One isn't the only company taking issue with AWS costs. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported in October that AI startups are increasingly delaying traditional AWS spend in favor of AI model and developer tools, according to internal Amazon documents from March and July.\n\nThe documents said that 90% of startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds due to AWS costs. Amazon also noted internally that there was increasing demand from customers for neocloud providers, which let them rent GPU power in small chunks and only pay for what they use.\n\nWhen that story published in October, an AWS spokesperson said Business Insider was \"using old data to reach outdated conclusions,\" noting that \"AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Slop bowls. AI layoffs. What your girlfriend spends money on.\n\nAll of those themes have a place in investors' portfolios for 2026, according to Citrini Research, which unveiled its top bets for the market heading into the new year.\n\nCitrini, which releases an annual \"thematic watchlist\" for investors, ended up handily beating the market with many of its 2025 calls. An equal-weighted portfolio of the firm's individual stock picks for the year gained 26.5%, outpacing the S&P 500's 15% gain. Around half of the 25 investment baskets it created for the year also beat the benchmark.\n\nThe firm's investment ideas for the coming year were based on trends it believes are unfolding.\n\n\"Some we think could be real winners, some are preparation for a specific scenario or eventuality, some we simply want to keep on our screen,\" Citrini wrote on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the firm's most interesting market calls going into 2026.\n\nThesis: Critrini said it was bullish on stocks that were best-positioned to benefit from AI by reducing headcount.\n\nThe firm said it screened for companies that could most benefit from AI-induced layoffs by developing a \"Bureaucracy Score\", a gauge that measures how robust a firm's administrative and managerial layers are, as well as a \"Margin Optionality Score,\" which determines if a company is able to earn more if its workforce were leaner.\n\nCitrini identified over thirty firms in this category. Here are some of the largest on the list:\n\nThesis: Critrini said it believes slop bowl chains would be among the first to benefit from back-of-house automation, which would allow those firms to reduce labor costs and boost profit margins.\n\nChipotle, Cava, and other restaurants within the slop bowl universe are likely headed for an inflection point next year, they said.\n\nThe firm identified several slop bowl food chains and robotics companies that could benefit from the shift:\n\nThesis: As drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy become more popular, an investment opportunity is growing among users who are looking to keep the weight off after they stop taking a GLP-1 drug, Citrini said.\n\nThe firm pointed to GaINAc-SiRNA drugs, which are believed to help users preserve lean body mass and \"deliver sustained metabolic benefit.\" The drugs are also believed to redistribute fat away from \"metabolically harmful sites,\" Citrini added, referring to visceral fat, which resides deep in the abdominal cavity.\n\nThesis: The firm pointed to the Girlfriend Index, an online indicator built around the idea that investors can identify market opportunities based on what female consumers are spending money on.\n\nQuiet luxury fading out of the cultural zeitgeist is one such trend that looks to be gaining traction in 2026, Citrini said, citing contributions from The Girlfriend Index, a Substack that publishes a weekly memo on female-driven consumer spending.\n\n\"When culture rotates from restraint to expression, heritage luxury historically leads. The emerging expression of 2026 is luxury as self-expression,\" Citrini wrote.",

    "fullText": "Each morning, you can brew your coffee, brush your teeth — and read your Google AI briefing.\n\nGoogle Labs announced a new AI productivity tool on Tuesday, titled CC. Built with Gemini, CC prepares a morning rundown of priorities based on the user's Gmail, Calendar, and Drive. Google users can also email CC at any time to perform tasks such as setting reminders, scheduling events, or summarizing emails.\n\nCC comes from Google Labs, the division of Google that started \"Project Tailwind\" in 2022. That later produced NotebookLM, Google's AI research tool that was a breakout hit.\n\nAfter a few hours on the waitlist, I was approved to receive my own CC briefing. At 5:18 a.m. the following morning, \"Your Day Ahead\" hit my inbox, with Google AI celebrating the coming weekend. Here's what it had:\n\nI get dozens of newsletters. I emailed back: \"Hey CC, can you pick out the four most important stories in all the unread newsletters in my inbox that I should read?\"\n\nMy CC said that it \"couldn't find many newsletters from today,\" only finding one from CNN that it said it was \"unable to pull a full summary\" of. That was odd: There were also two unread New York Times newsletters, one from New York magazine, and one from GQ.\n\nIt did pull four articles from yesterday's newsletters, though, offering me three Vanity Fair stories and one from The Atlantic.\n\nI decided to try a simpler task. Sometimes Letterboxd will send out free or discounted movie tickets, but the offers get stuck in my \"promotions\" folder. Were there any offers I should know about?\n\nMy CC responded with five different discounts for movies like \"No Other Choice\" and \"The Voice of Hind Rajab.\" I wouldn't know those offers existed if I hadn't asked!\n\nFor me, that's the real promise of Google's CC: To go through the endless promotional emails and decide what you should know. It's a deals magnet, without having to rummage through the spam folder.\n\nI'm sure CC would be a great enterprise workplace tool, but it's not yet allowed. The waitlist is open to Google users in the United States and Canada who are 18 years old or older who use a personal email. No enterprise accounts are permitted.\n\nIf you want to give Google's CC tool a try, you can join the wait list here.",

In some ways, I am, and in some ways I think it'd be really annoying,\" Altman said on an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published Thursday.\n\nLeadership seems to be one of the sticking points for Altman: \"Am I excited to be a public company CEO? 0%.\"\n\n\"It's wonderful to be a private company,\" Altman said, but he added that OpenAI needs lots of capital and is going to \"cross all of the shareholder limits and stuff at some point.\"\n\n\"I do think it's cool that public markets get to participate in value creation,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman cofounded OpenAI alongside eleven others in 2015, and the company's value has soared since the launch of its AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022.\n\nChatGPT has 800 million weekly users, and the company has inked $1 trillion worth of deals with tech giants like Oracle, Nvidia, and AMD.\n\nIn October, the company reached a $500 billion valuation after a secondary share sale, briefly overtaking Elon Musk's SpaceX to become the most valuable private company in the world, a crown that SpaceX regained in recent days.\n\nThe Information reported on Wednesday that OpenAI is seeking to raise billions more at a $750 billion valuation.\n\nThere are signs the company is preparing for a potential IPO. In October, Reuters reported that OpenAI is considering filing with securities regulators as soon as the second half of 2026.\n\nBut asked during the podcast if OpenAI would IPO next year, Altman responded, \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"We will be very late to go public,\" Altman added.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

    "description": "The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.\n\nThis year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.\n\nWe like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.\n\nThat was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.\n\nOn reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nRegrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.\n\nImagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.\n\nThat was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.\n\nBut as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.\n\nStill interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.\n\nMore: I Tried the Robot That’s Coming to Live With You. It’s Still Part Human (WSJ), The World’s Stupidest Robot Maid (The Daily Show) Why the humanoid workforce is running late (MIT Technology Review), NEO The Home Robot | Order Today (1X Corp.)\n\nIt’s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.\n\nThis year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.\n\nIn April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”\n\nDon’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”\n\nMore: What OpenAI Did When ChatGPT Users Lost Touch With Reality (New York Times), Sycophantic AI Decreases Prosocial Intentions and Promotes Dependence (arXiv), Expanding on what we missed with sycophancy (OpenAI)\n\nWhen you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.\n\nThat’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.\n\nTo be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nColossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”\n\nIn a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.\n\nMore: Game of Clones: Colossal’s new wolves are cute, but are they dire? (MIT Technology Review), Conservation perspectives on gene editing in wild canids (IUCN),  A statement from Colossal's Chief Science Officer, Dr. Beth Shapiro (Reddit)\n\nSave the world, and this is the thanks you get?\n\nDuring the covid-19 pandemic, the US bet big on mRNA vaccines—and the new technology delivered in record time.\n\nBut now that America’s top health agencies are led by the antivax wackadoodle Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.\n\nIn August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.\n\nThe purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.\n\nIn August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”\n\nMore: HHS Winds Down mRNA Vaccine Development (US Department of Health and Human Services),  Cancelling mRNA studies is the highest irresponsibility (Nature), How Moderna, the company that helped save the world, unraveled (Stat News)\n\nWikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.\n\nOnly around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.\n\nPerhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.\n\nIn September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”\n\nThere’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.\n\nSo maybe it would end up a hit.\n\nNope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nWith unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.\n\nMore: Elon’s Edsel: Tesla Cybertruck Is The Auto Industry’s Biggest Flop In Decades (Forbes), Why Tesla Cybertrucks Aren't Selling (CNBC), Ford scraps fully-electric F-150 Lightning as mounting losses and falling demand hits EV plans (AP)\n\nDonald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.\n\nThis was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.\n\nThe White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.\n\nMore: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)\n\nIn 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.\n\nCritics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.\n\nApple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”\n\nMore: Inside the controversial tree farms powering Apple’s carbon neutral goal (MIT Technology Review), Apple Watch not a 'CO2-neutral product,' German court finds (Reuters), Apple 2030: Our ambition to become carbon neutral (Apple)\n\nWe asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.\n\nIt’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory.

    "fullText": "\"Code red\" isn't a one-off at OpenAI.\n\nCEO Sam Altman said on an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published Thursday that the company has entered emergency mode multiple times in response to competitive threats — and expects to continue doing so as rivals close in.\n\n\"It's good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges,\" Altman said.\n\n\"My guess is we'll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that's part of really just making sure that we win in our space,\" he added.\n\nAltman said that OpenAI had gone \"code red\" earlier this year when China's DeepSeek emerged. DeepSeek shocked the tech industry in January when it said its AI model matches top competitors like ChatGPT's o1 at a fraction of the cost.\n\nOpenAI entered \"code red\" earlier this month, about two weeks after Google released its latest AI chatbot, Gemini 3. The model drew widespread praise after its release in November, with Google touting it as its most advanced model to date. Altman reportedly told staff in an internal Slack memo that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.\n\nAltman said in the podcast episode that Google's Gemini 3 did not have \"the impact we were worried it might.\"\n\n\"But it did — in the same way that Deepseek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,\" he added.\n\nSince OpenAI entered \"code red,\" the company has moved quickly to ship new upgrades and features.\n\nLast week, it rolled out a more advanced AI model aimed at improving ChatGPT's performance across professional work, coding, and scientific tasks. OpenAI also unveiled a new image-generation model earlier this week.\n\nAltman said the company will not be in code red \"that much longer.\"\n\n\"Historically, these have been kind of like six- or eight-week things for us,\" he added.\n\nThe state of \"code red\" has also been a precedent for other tech companies. In 2022, Google declared an internal \"code red\" after ChatGPT's debut. The search giant was lagging in consumer AI, despite having funded much of the research that made the AI boom possible.",

    "description": "This post will introduce a tutorial on how to build an app for ChatGPT using Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server. You’ll have what you need to get started with our opinionated stack for building these apps.",
    "fullText": "Building Apps for ChatGPT with Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Client\n\nIn early October, OpenAI introduced the ChatGPT Apps SDK with a handful of launch partners. These “apps” could be invoked by ChatGPT via Model Context Protocol (MCP) and would be embedded directly into the ChatGPT interface. In their intro video, they showed use cases like asking for flights, hotel locations, house listings, and more, including teasing the idea of asking follow up questions to ChatGPT.\n\nImagine your application being part of the conversation, allowing the user to ask follow up questions, and having your app be responsive to those questions. These are action-oriented conversational apps where the LLM can take action on behalf of a user with rich interactive UIs.\n\nThis idea quickly caught fire, and now the MCP apps spec is proposing a standardized approach to create these kinds of experiences, with other AI vendors sure to follow suit. We’re excited about the potential here, and are working on tools to abstract away all of the AI provider details from you with a great developer experience, allowing you to focus on building your app instead of worrying about vendor idiosyncrasies and evolving standards.\n\nWe want this to be a true “build once” solution where you can deploy your app anywhere that supports one of the protocols that we will support. This way, you don’t need to host a separate MCP Server, and build a separate app, for every provider and sub-protocol that emerges.\n\nYou can instead focus on your customers.\n\nThis post will introduce a tutorial on how to build an app for ChatGPT using Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server. By the end of it, you’ll have what you need to get started with our opinionated stack for building these apps. If you prefer to dive into the template and follow along, you can find the repo here.\n\nBased on the OpenAI documentation and examples, to build one of these apps you would:\n\nWe don’t want you to have to do any of this. You shouldn’t have to focus on any of the inner workings of this sub-protocol, or even think about MCP. Your front-end engineers shouldn’t have a new dependency on your platform engineers. Instead, you should be able to focus on building exciting and compelling experiences for your customers.\n\nInstead of this feeling like learning 100% how to build apps from scratch, this should be 90% reusing what you already know about building apps, and 10% learning about the specifics of this new paradigm.\n\nWe wanted to make this as easy as possible and decided to reach for tools that are already familiar to many of our users: Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Client. If you want to follow along in this tutorial, you can find all the code in our OpenAI Apps SDK demo.\n\nTo build this app we have two components: a React app and Apollo MCP Server. This solution works without any additional MCP Server configuration. The client gets to focus on their application, not the MCP server configuration.\n\nStarting in our main.tsx file, we create an ApolloClient instance and ApolloProvider, very similar to how we would on a traditional React app, but we’re going to import them from @apollo/client-ai-apps instead of the normal location. This is an Apollo Client integration package, similar to @apollo/client-nextjs. This allows us to do a lot of setup and details behind the scenes of dealing with data being exchanged over MCP.\n\nNow we can use the normal useQuery and useMutation hooks as we normally would!\n\nFor example, I can write a component that gets my TOP_PRODUCTS:\n\nLooks pretty normal, but what is that @tool directive on the operation? That is allowing you to declare in your app a tool that will be exposed to the LLM, including a name and description. At the same time, we are registering the operation that will be executed when this tool is called (and therefore the data that should be delivered as part of this tool), and the graphql variables become the input schema for the tool!\n\nThis is really exciting because we’re able to declare so much with so little code. Also, these are on-the-fly tool declarations. I don’t need a platform team to create these tools for me on an MCP server!\n\nAnother important aspect of this solution is showing the right component based on what tool was called by the LLM. It turns out we’ve had this problem solved for years now with React Router!\n\nTo do this, we provide a useToolEffect hook, which works the same way as a useEffect, but allows you to run the effect based on which tool was executed.\n\nUsing this hook, and a very familiar navigate function from react-router, I can express that when the “Top Products” tool is called, I should navigate to the /home view.\n\nThe magic of this solution really comes from a custom Vite plugin called the ApplicationManifestPlugin which extracts all the operations, tools, and metadata from your React app and generates a .application-manifest.json file:\n\nThis plugin runs during dev and build time and generates a file that looks something like this:\n\nWhat you’ll see contained in this manifest is everything that the Apollo MCP Server needs to automatically generate the resource and tools for your app. There’s no need to create or configure any of this on the MCP Server. It will automatically pick it up based on your manifest file.\n\nAnd that’s it! You can build your React app and declare tools alongside the data declarations and the tooling will do the rest. At the time this post was written, you would then test your app in ChatGPT using developer mode. OpenAI outlines how to try the app in their documentation.\n\nWith the MCP apps spec hot off the press, and likely other providers working on an answer to ChatGPT’s AppsSDK, we have a very important goal: To abstract away all of the provider details from you with a great developer experience, allowing you to focus on building your app instead.\n\nWe want this to be a true “build once” solution where you can deploy your app anywhere that supports one of the protocols that we will support. This way, you don’t need to host a separate MCP Server, and build a separate app, for every provider and sub-protocol that emerges.\n\nYou can instead focus on your customers.\n\nThis solution is exciting for platform engineers because it doesn’t require them being in the loop and becoming a blocker for the frontend teams they are looking to empower. A single Apollo MCP Server powers apps across providers and accelerates platform engineering. For frontend engineers, this removes the burden of sub-protocol concerns and lets them focus on building high-quality user experiences.\n\nIt’s important to note that these apps are still very, very early.\n\nRemember many, many years ago when “apps” first appeared on the iPhone? Many people didn’t understand why they needed a mobile app when they already had a website. It’s kind of funny looking back now because we had no idea what we were even looking at or how much it would change and shape our future.\n\nThat’s about where we are now with these conversational chat apps. Customers and companies alike don’t yet “get” these apps. The app store just launched. But once these things fall into place, and we hit an industry mind share, we believe we’re going to see an explosion of conversational, chat-based applications.\n\nTry out building apps for ChatGPT today with Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server by going to our Template Repo and following the README. We’d love to hear what you think.",

    "description": "You can't even play full songs in ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "When ChatGPT first launched, it was strictly about dealing with text. You could ask it to write you a poem, to check your code for errors, or to build you a grocery list from a recipe. Fast forward three years, and the app has changed completely—for better or for worse. Not only has ChatGPT's large language model (LLM) improved dramatically from GPT-3.5 to GPT-5.2, but the bot has gone multimodal. It can understand text, but also images, video, and the internet at large. 2025's ChatGPT is hardly the same product as 2022's.\n\nOne of the many upgrades to ChatGPT over the past three years has been app integrations: You've been able to connect OpenAI's chatbot to ask it to do things on your behalf. You could connect to Expedia to ask ChatGPT for help booking a hotel, Zillow to ask the bot to help you find an apartment, or Canva for help with creating a slide. Whether these integrations are any more useful than simply using the respective app itself is perhaps up to each user, but these integrations exist all the same.\n\nFidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, announced the integration in a Substack post on Tuesday. Among other updates, like a new image gen model and new writing tools, Simo revealed new app integrations for the chatbot, including OpenTable, Salesforce, Clay, Lovable, and, of course, Apple Music. At the time, details were limited, but now, the integration is officially live.\n\nFirst of all, you don't actually need to It's an interesting note, since Apple Music itself requires a paid subscription to access. But with ChatGPT, you can access elements of the services without paying—keyword \"elements.\"\n\nOnce you connect the services together, you'll be able to search Apple Music for songs, artists, albums, and playlists within ChatGPT. In addition to music discoverability, you can also generate playlists, and listen to clips of songs you find. ChatGPT doesn't specify how long those clips are, but if they base it off of iTunes, it could be anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. If you thought this integration was all about listening to Apple Music tunes while using ChatGPT, think again: You'll still need Apple Music itself for the listening side of things.\n\nOf course, if you have an Apple Music account, the integration is a bit more useful. If so, you'll be able to add songs, albums, and playlists to your Apple Music library that you found or generated from ChatGPT.\n\nLove it or hate it, ChatGPT isn't necessarily designed with user privacy in mind. After all, part of the company's business model is training its LLMs on your ChatGPT interactions—unless you specifically opt out. As such, the idea of connecting your Apple Music subscription to ChatGPT raises some privacy alarm bells in my mind. Apple Music doesn't have the most sensitive user information in your digital portfolio, but it does contain quite a bit of extra data ChatGPT can collect from you.\n\nAt the top of the Apple music connection tool, OpenAI says, \"You're in control.\" The company is adamant that ChatGPT \"always respects\" your preferences on training data, and is held to the permissions you've already set. That said, the company also warns that by using apps, you run the risk of falling victim to attack: If hackers decide to attack ChatGPT, your data could get swooped up. You'll also end up sharing data points like your IP address and approximate location, as well as ChatGPT data with Apple Music. (The data sharing goes both ways here.)\n\nOne benefit here is that ChatGPT doesn't appear to have access to your listening history. While the app can create playlists for you, it can't actually see what you're choosing to listen to in Apple Music itself.\n\nI personally don't use ChatGPT, and even if I did, I don't think I'd connect my Apple Music account here. I find the discoverability within the app itself fine for my needs, and when it isn't, the greater internet already helps me find new music. I'm not sure I'd feel the benefits of ChatGPT's intelligence here, especially when it comes with the risk of keeping all my Apple Music data in yet another location.\n\nIf you're not like me, and you're interested in trying out this integration, you can connect Apple Music to ChatGPT from the latter's app or web app. Head to the sidebar, choose Apps, then find and select \"Apple Music.\"",

    "fullText": "Earlier this year, OpenAI announced ChatGPT apps. Not the ChatGPT app, mind you: That's been out for more than a couple years now. ChatGPT apps, on the other hand, are programs that work within ChatGPT. You can access them in any given conversation with ChatGPT—in fact, they may appear based on the context of the conversation.\n\nThese aren't necessarily apps that OpenAI builds itself, either; rather, you'll find options here based on apps you may use yourself. The initial batch of apps included with the feature's rollout included Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow—big apps you've likely used before.\n\nWhile in a conversation with ChatGPT, you could ask the bot to help you book a flight to Paris via Expedia, find a particular listing through Zillow, or create a slide for a presentation with Canva. From OpenAI's perspective, this adds a host of additional functionality to ChatGPT the company couldn't offer itself. OpenAI doesn't need to build an apartment-hunting tool into ChatGPT; it can just pull in Zillow. It also doesn't escape me that the more apps that OpenAI folds into ChatGPT, the less likely it is you'll need to leave ChatGPT to do something in another app—but that's none of my business.\n\nSpeaking of more apps, the company plans to expand these apps overtime, as developers create ChatGPT-compatible extensions for their programs. That was part of yesterday's news: OpenAI is now letting developers submit apps to ChatGPT en masse. What's more, these apps will be hosted in an \"app directory,\" though many online are taking to calling it an app store. (There's no payment necessary, however, so app directory might really be a more apt description.) You'll find this new app directory in the sidebar of ChatGPT, appropriately called \"Apps.\"\n\nApps is apparently in beta, according to a label affixed to its title in ChatGPT. Here, you'll find a rotating slide featuring an ad for some of the service's biggest apps, like Canva and Zillow, and, below it, rows of apps to choose from. Right now, the apps are sorted into \"Featured,\" \"Lifestyle,\" and \"Productivity,\" with no option that includes all the apps. (But they seem to be entirely split across Lifestyle and Productivity.) There are a lot of options here already. Some made headlines this week, like Photoshop and Apple Music, while others arrived more quietly, like Asana, Uber, and Target. It's not just traditional apps like Zillow or Spotify that are getting the app treatment here, either. OpenAI is also considering \"connector\" services, like Google Drive, as \"apps.\"\n\nYou can click on any app in the directory to see what you can do with it. Slack, for example, says you can look up your chats and messages to summarize threads, generate recaps, and come up with responses. You can check on your Asana tasks to generate progress reports and status updates. Outlook says you can create \"talking points\" and generate follow-ups from your emails and calendar events. While there's a brief summary underneath each title, you'll need to click through to each service to see the full picture of what it actually offers.\n\nHere are the apps I'm seeing at this time. Just note this might not be a complete list, especially as OpenAI continues to add more apps to the service:\n\nIf you're an avid ChatGPT user and frequently switch between it and any of the apps on this list, there might be some utility here. Maybe coders will find the integration with Hugging Face and Lovable to be beneficial, while Photoshop users might take advantage of the AI image editing tools this integration provides. But I'm still left feeling like this is more gimmick than anything else: I don't need to connect my Slack to ChatGPT to generate follow-ups for me: I'm perfectly capable of responding to emails myself, and managing my own calendar, so no need to connect Outlook or another email client to the bot. Maybe a future update will sell me on connecting generative AI to all aspects of my work and personal life, but so far, I'm still not convinced.",

    "description": "Kevin Tang, 13, won first place at the 3M Young Scientist Challenge for his project that uses AI to help detect when a person falls in their home.",
    "fullText": "While many teens are using AI to help themselves with homework and socializing, Kevin Tang, 13, is using it to help others.\n\n\"A few years ago, my grandma sadly fell in my kitchen, and nobody noticed immediately,\" Tang told Business Insider. By the time his family found her and called 911, \"it was still too late, since she was left with permanent brain damage.\"\n\nHe later learned that his friend's grandparent had also fallen, and that the family hadn't found out until the following day because they lived in another state.\n\nAfter that, Tang felt compelled to find a way to help not just his family and friends, but the millions of older adults who suffer from falls each year.\n\nHis project, FallGuard, earned him first prize at the 2025 3M Young Scientist Challenge and a cash prize of $25,000, which he said he has already partly reinvested in improving and growing the project.\n\nTang started working on Fallguard in the summer of 2024. Since then, he has built and developed it into a device that uses AI to detect when a person falls in real time and immediately sends an alert to the person's family members' phones via the FallGuard mobile app. It can also detect when a person has been lying down for an extended period.\n\n\"This system does not rely on a cellular carrier and does not generate any messaging fees,\" Tang wrote in a follow-up email. \"A single FallGuard device can be linked to multiple phones so that several caregivers can receive alerts at the same time.\"\n\nUnlike wearable devices that you have to remember to charge and put on, FallGuard works via a camera connected to a computer. \"You can just place [the camera] on the wall, and it works all the time,\" Tang said, later adding that, \"no video is recorded or uploaded, which helps protect privacy.\"\n\nA couple of limitations are that a person must fall within the camera's field of view. Moreover, the camera must be connected to a computer with the FallGuard model, which can only support one camera at a time. Tang said he's working on expanding the system so one device can support multiple cameras that could be placed all around a home. \"So that way you don't have to have multiple computers,\" he said.\n\nTang built FallGuard using MediaPipe, a Google-developed AI library, which can map a person on screen by placing key points on their body. With a two-stage fall detection algorithm that Tang developed, FallGuard analyzes posture and movement over time. It does this via a common tool in computer vision models called bounding boxes that can track how a person's body proportions change from standing to lying down, Tang said.\n\nIf the AI detects a lay-down event, it looks at the previous one second to check if the person's velocity suddenly dropped, helping distinguish a fall from someone lying down intentionally.\n\nThere are still a few kinks Tang is ironing out to improve FallGuard's reliability, he said.\n\nDuring the 3M Young Scientist Challenge, Tang was paired with Mark Gilbertson, a robotics and AI specialist at 3M, who mentored him on the project.\n\nWhile Kevin did all of the programming and designing himself, Gilbertson said he helped with questions like how Tang should mount his device on the wall and what material to use.\n\nFrom the start, Gilbertson said Kevin's personality and project stood out to him. \"I liked that his project had an emotional connection to his life,\" Gilbertson told BI.\n\nWhen Tang won the prize, he was excited that the news would alert more people about FallGuard who could use it, Gilberston said.\n\nIndeed, Tang said he's received interest from about 500 families so far. \"One stood out to me was, this man who was trying really hard to take care of his wife, but he was deaf, so he wouldn't hear his wife fall,\" Gilbertson said, adding that the man noted, \"This invention will just really change our lives and quality of living.\"\n\nOne of the things Tang used the award money for was to purchase a MacBook to code the FallGuard app for computers, so people can convert their own computer into a FallGuard device. It works with most regular computers, he said.\n\nWhen asked what he's most proud of, Tang didn't mention the prize, the title, or the media attention. Instead, he pointed back to the device itself, which hung on the wall behind him.\n\n\"I'm really proud of how much my project evolved from the very start,\" he said. From a tripod and camera, to a mounted device, to an app anyone can download — each model improved on the one before. \"I just kept working until I had a final product.\"",

    "description": "AI can mine social media, online reviews, and internal feedback to uncover what customers and current and former employees say about the company.",
    "fullText": "Before applying for a position, job seekers often want to know factors beyond the role's responsibilities, like a company's values, employee experience, and growth opportunities. Like many areas of the workforce, artificial intelligence can help with this.\n\nBrand image \"sets the tone for how people view your company long before they ever interact with you,\" says Victoria Bracco, CEO of Encore Media Agency and cofounder of the Strategic Executive Alliance, a business consulting firm. It gives job candidates \"clarity, confidence, and a sense of direction\" about whether an organization is a good fit.\n\n\"AI can make it easier for companies to understand how they're being perceived and where they need to improve,\" she adds.\n\nHuman resources leaders also see value in AI for talent acquisition. For instance, some companies, including Unilever and L'Oreal, use AI chatbots to answer job applicants' questions and provide personalized responses based on their preferences and skills.\n\nBeyond that, AI can help companies learn what job seekers think about them and use data-driven storytelling to attract talent, Bracco says. Here's how.\n\nBrand sentiment is composed of a range of inputs from a wide variety of sources, and AI can be a boon to consolidating, gathering, and analyzing that content.\n\nFor example, AI can mine social media, online reviews, and internal feedback to uncover what customers, the public, and current and former employees say about the company, known as a sentiment analysis, Bracco says.\n\nAI tools can also track metrics, such as employee sentiment and retention rates, as well as social media engagement, adds Kaz Hassan, principal of community and insights at Unily, an AI intranet software.\n\n\"AI can identify patterns in what current employees say about your organization, revealing brand strengths to amplify and weaknesses to address,\" Hassan says. \"This real-time intelligence allows companies to respond quickly to emerging issues before they become reputation problems.\"\n\nAI can synthesize several different data points, including brand sentiment, employee performance insights, and the skills the company currently needs. Using that information, AI can then help write job descriptions, career pages, and social media messaging that will resonate with the right candidates, Bracco says.\n\nOrganizations can also use employee data to showcase how they value their people, such as through internal upskilling, mobility rates, leadership styles, or employee check-ins, says Lana Peters, chief revenue and experience officer at Klaar, a performance management software.\n\nAI can \"shape an unbiased story,\" she says. That story should focus on \"culture, purpose, and growth,\" Bracco adds.\n\nJust make sure the story is authentic and honest; coming across as disingenuous is a turn-off, adds Polina Dimitrova, global head of people at Make, a visual development platform. \"The truth is: your brand is how you hire, how you develop people, how leaders behave, and where your teams show up in the world.\"\n\nThis can illustrate \"the employee experience you offer as a company,\" says Tom Moran, CEO of Addison Group, a staffing and recruiting firm.\n\n\"Real stories from real people within the organization discussing their experiences within the organization will resonate with job seekers,\" Hassan says.\n\nPeters adds that, \"Candidates aren't just choosing a job; they're choosing a story they want to be a part of,\" including companies whose values align with theirs and where they'll be recognized and appreciated.\n\nHowever, AI isn't the \"end-all, be-all,\" Dimitrova says. It should be used to optimize brands for attracting talent; it's not a substitute for a brand strategy, Bracco adds.\n\nAI is there to \"speed things up and provide insights, but the final message still needs and must have your voice, your judgment, and your direction,\" Bracco says. \"Keep the human side front and center, because candidates can spot a forced or overly polished message a mile away.\"",

    "fullText": "OpenAI isn't trimming its sails.\n\nIn a pair of videos and an accompanying chart, top OpenAI executives made the case that the startup's biggest risk might be not spending enough on securing future compute, even though the company has already committed roughly $1.4 trillion on data center projects over the next eight years and is, according to CEO Sam Altman, five years away from profitability.\n\n\"We want to be ahead of the curve,\" OpenAI President Greg Brockman said in a video posted on X. \"And the truth is, I don't think we will be, no matter how ambitious we can dream of being right now. I think demand will far exceed what we can think of.\"\n\nIn the chart, OpenAI illustrated how \"more compute\" leads to \"better products,\" which in turn leads to \"more revenue.\"\n\nCompute fuels progress. pic.twitter.com/ePm7pmpb8Q\n\nBrockman and his fellow OpenAI executives have said for months that the dearth of compute available to OpenAI is holding the company back, forcing it to make tough trade-offs and delaying launches.\n\n\"When we look at our launch calendar, the single biggest blocker often becomes, 'Ok, but where's the compute going to come from for that?'\"\n\nAs an example, Brockman said that when OpenAI launched its image generator in March, it had to make \"some very painful decisions to take a bunch of compute from research\" in order to meet demand for the service.\n\nRonnie Chatterji, a top economist in the Biden administration, said countries around the world, including China, are making big investments in AI infrastructure.\n\n\"People are worried about whether people are trying to do too much,\" Chatterji said in a video OpenAI published on X. \"I just encourage people to think about and consider, what if we're not moving fast enough? What if we're investing too little?\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in September that the biggest risk for his company \"is probably in not being aggressive enough.\"\n\n\"If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously,\" Zuckerberg said on an episode of the \"Access\" podcast. \"But what I'd say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.\"\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who led the development of GPT-2 and 3 at OpenAI before starting his rival company, recently said that part of the difficulty is that companies have to make bets years in advance on what the demand might be. Still, Amodei offered some veiled criticism of people in the industry who are \"YOLOing,\" which was viewed as a shot at Altman.\n\n\"I have to decide now, literally now, or in some cases a few months ago, how much compute I need to buy — to serve the models in early 2027 when I get to that revenue amount,\" Amodei said during The New York Times' DealBook Summit.\n\nUnlike Meta, Google, and other hyperscalers, OpenAI doesn't have a large dedicated revenue base to fall back on if its bets don't pay off.\n\nLast month, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar sparked concerns when she spoke of a \"government backstop\" for data center spending. She later walked back those remarks, and Altman said OpenAI believed \"taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions.\"\n\n\"If we get it wrong, that's on us,\" Altman wrote on X.",

    "description": "The new feature gives you even more precision over your edits.",
    "fullText": "One of the ways AI models are rapidly improving is in their image editing capabilities, to the extent that they can now quickly take care of tasks that would previously have taken a substantial amount of time and effort in Photoshop. This is undoubtedly one of the main reasons Adobe has decided to introduce its own ChatGPT plug-ins.\n\nWant your t-shirt to be blue rather than red? Need to cut out a person or an object from an otherwise perfect group selfie? These are tricks that AI chatbots are now able to do cleanly and professionally, from just a text prompt. You don't need to have any digital photo editing skills; you only need to describe what you want to happen.\n\nOver the past few months, both Gemini and ChatGPT have become better at more precise edits. They're able to tweak part of an image and leaving the rest of it untouched, rather than rendering everything again from scratch just to alter one detail. Now Gemini has quietly added some more markup tools for this job.\n\nGoogle hasn't said anything officially about these markup tools, which suggests the feature is still in testing (it's also previously been spotted by the team at Android Authority). If you're not seeing these tools, try quitting and restarting the Gemini app on mobile, or refreshing the app on the web—and if you still can't see the options after that, you may have to be wait a little bit longer\n\nIf this functionality has rolled out to you, you should be able to upload an image in a chat using the + (plus) button in the prompt box, and then tap or click on the image thumbnail to find the markup tools. At the moment, they only show up before the image has been edited—you can't find them after you've started generating edits.\n\nThe easiest tool to understand is the drawing tool, which is enabled via the icon that looks like a scribble. You can use this to highlight a particular part of an image—a space in the sky, a lamppost in the street, a face in a crowd—and then describe the change you want Gemini to carry out.\n\nFor example, rather than just saying \"add a cartoon dragon in the sky\" in your prompt, you can actually combine that prompt with a circle on the image showing exactly where the dragon should go. It gives you even more of that Photoshop-level precision, without cluttering up the interface too much.\n\nThe scribblings can also be used if you're asking questions about the image. For example, you could circle an actor or an object in a scene and then ask \"who is this?\" or \"what is this?\" in the attached prompt. In that sense it works in a similar way to the Circle to Search feature that's available for images on Android.\n\nThere's also a text tool—the T icon—but I'm not sure exactly how you use this (and there's no official help available yet). You can use it to describe changes you want to apply to your picture (like \"an add arrow here\"), but the text stays in place—it's almost like a rudimentary text overlay feature, with a choice of colors but no font or styling options.\n\nYou can use the prompt to manipulate the text you've added, adding outlines and backgrounds for example, so perhaps that's the way it's intended to be used: a more precise editing option, but for text. Presumably once these tools have reached all Gemini users, we'll get some more information from Google on how to use them—but you may well find they're available to you now.",

However, actors would not be legally protected if they refused to be scanned.\n\nThe union said it would write to Pact, the trade body representing the majority of producers and production companies in the UK, to negotiate new minimum standards for pay, as well as terms and conditions for actors working in film and TV.\n\nEquity said it may hold a formal ballot depending on the outcome of the negotiations, which, if backed, would give actors legal protection if they were being pressed to accept digital scanning on set.\n\nThe decision comes after months of debate and growing concern about performers’ rights as AI becomes embedded in the creative industries, with high-profile actors urging Equity members to support the push to stop digital scanning.\n\nAdrian Lester, Hugh Bonneville and Harriet Walter have backed the union’s campaign to ensure AI protections for performers are written into union agreements.\n\nBonneville said actors’ likenesses and voices should not be “exploited for the benefit of others without licence or consent”, while Lester said actors at the start of their careers often found it difficult to push back against body scanning.\n\nIn October, Olivia Williams told the Guardian that performers were routinely pressed to have their bodies scanned on set without having a say over how the data was later used.\n\nThe Dune star argued that actors should have as much control over data harvested from body scans as they do over nudity scenes. She said some contracts included clauses that appeared to give studios carte blanche over a performer’s likeness “on all platforms now existing or yet to be devised throughout the universe in perpetuity”.\n\nThe arrival of the first AI “actor”, Tilly Norwood, further heightened concerns and demands for formal agreements on what is and is not permissible.\n\nIn 2023, concerns over AI were at the heart of the Hollywood writers’ strike, with writers and actors warning that unchecked use of the technology could radically reshape the industry and undermine their roles.",

    "description": "Is ChatGPT conservative or liberal? A novel approach to assess ideological stances and biases in generative LLMs",
    "fullText": "Published online by Cambridge University Press: \n 03 December 2025\n\nExtant work shows that generative AI such as GPT-3.5 and perpetuate social stereotypes and biases. A less explored source of bias is ideology: do GPT models take ideological stances on politically sensitive topics? We develop a novel approach to identify ideological bias and show that it can originate in both the training data and the filtering algorithm. Using linguistic variation across countries with contrasting political attitudes, we evaluate average GPT responses in those languages. GPT output is more conservative in languages conservative societies (polish) and more liberal in languages used in liberal ones (Swedish). These differences persist from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4. We conclude that high-quality, curated training data are essential for reducing bias.\n\nGPT-3.5 and -4 are increasingly popular among scholars to generate data, classify text, and complement human coders. Their black-box nature, however, has raised concerns about bias in model output, which in turn has led to a burgeoning debate around the politics of artificial intelligence (AI) and how to regulate generative models. In this article, we identify ideological biases in GPT-3.5 and -4 through a novel approach that matches model output to known linguistic and issue-based differences across countries. If biases exist, GPT-3.5 and -4 will reflect the predominant political attitudes of those who produced the training text. In countries where society is more conservative (liberal), GPT models will produce more conservative (liberal) output. Moreover, OpenAI, the company that developed and owns these models, heavily filters the GPT-4 API to reduce output bias, but it does not filter the GPT-3.5 complete API (Heikkilä, Reference Heikkilä2023). This gives us an opportunity to also identify bias across OpenAI models, and disentangle biases stemming from the training data from those that derive from the algorithm or filters.\n\nWe focus our analysis on two key LLM tasks: text generation and annotation.Footnote 1 For text generation, we focus on political issues that are linguistically and geographically constrained: abortion and Catalan independence. For abortion, we draw text data from GPT-3.5 and -4 in Swedish, Polish and English. In Poland, society tends to be socially conservative, while Sweden is more progressive (Sydsjö et al., Reference Sydsjö, Josefsson, Bladh and Sydsjö2011; Koralewska and Zielińska, Reference Koralewska and Zielińska2022). Because training data in these two languages comes almost exclusively from their respective countries, we expect GPT responses to reflect more conservative views of abortion in Poland and more liberal ones in Sweden. We use English output on abortion primarily to test the full extent of OpenAI’s filtering efforts, which have been concentrated on English text (Motoki et al., Reference Motoki, Neto and Rodrigues2024; Pit et al., Reference Pit, Ma, Conway, Chen, Bailey, Pit, Keo, Diep and Jiang2024). For Catalan independence, we draw data in Catalan and Spanish. Because Catalan society is, on the whole, more pro-independence than Spanish society (Llaneras, Reference Llaneras2017), we expect GPT responses in Catalan to be more positive toward independence than responses in Spanish (within the Spanish-speaking world, Catalan independence is only a politically salient and divisive issue in Spain (Llaneras, Reference Llaneras2017)).\n\nFor annotation, we focus on a dataset of English language tweets about content moderation focusing on the salient topics of (1) economics and (2) health and safety (Gilardi et al., Reference Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli2023). We again focus on Swedish and Polish across GPT-3.5 and -4 by translating the tweets to these languages and asking the LLM to classify each tweet according to whether they lean more liberal or conservative. Again, we expect the LLMs to reflect the economic and health policy leanings predominant in Polish and Swedish societies, with Polish exhibiting a more conservative lean and Swedish responses being more left-leaning, on average. Poland’s economic policies prioritize conservative developmental statism to strengthen the economy and combat ‘progressive’ ideologies including liberalism and socialism (Bluhm and Varga, Reference Bluhm and Varga2020). Meanwhile, Sweden’s economic policies have historically leaned toward the left, characterized by higher government spending, progressive taxation, and a focus on social welfare (Andersson, Reference Andersson2022). Likewise, Sweden’s health policies are more left-learning, focusing on social democratic ideals such as equality and the welfare state (Vallgårda, Reference Vallgårda2007). Poland’s health policies have a mix of conservative and redistributive elements, sometimes described as ‘conservative welfare state populism’ (Zabdyr-Jamróz et al., Reference Zabdyr-Jamróz, Löblová, Moise and Kowalska-Bobko2021). Therefore, through these two issues, and by tapping into languages and issues that are geographically confined, we can identify whether (1) GPT output reflects ideological biases in the training data and (2) OpenAI’s filtering fixes these biases or induces new ones.\n\nWe use multilevel modeling to identify significant differences in outputs for both LLM tasks and specify two distinct types of biases: training and algorithmic. We provide novel evidence on ideological biases in OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and -4, showing that bias can derive from both the training data and the algorithm. More broadly, our analysis shows that biases are likely to remain an issue through the different GPT models beyond GPT-3.5 and -4. Importantly, we show that biases are consistent across different LLM tasks such as text generation and annotation, which is relevant to the growing literature showing that biases may be task-dependent (Lunardi et al., Reference Lunardi, Barbera and Roitero2024). Our findings regarding these two sources of bias have major implications for the politics of AI, the training and regulation of generative models, and applied researchers looking to use these models in downstream analyses, such as in text classification, sentiment analysis and question-answering (Ray, Reference Ray2023).\n\nTesting for ideological biases in GPT-3.5 and -4 is especially relevant because a growing number of articles use these models in measurement and downstream tasks (Argyle et al., Reference Argyle, Busby, Fulda, Gubler, Rytting and Wingate2023; Buchholz, Reference Buchholz2023; Le Mens et al., Reference Le Mens, Kovács, Hannan and Pros2023; Lupo et al., Reference Lupo, Magnusson, Hovy, Naurin and Wängnerud2023; Wu et al., Reference Wu, Nagler, Tucker and Messing2023; Mellon et al., Reference Mellon, Bailey, Scott, Breckwoldt, Miori and Schmedeman2024; O’Hagan and Schein, Reference O’Hagan and Schein2024). For example, GPT has been used in annotation tasks to classify the tone of text or assign topic labels (Ornstein et al., Reference Ornstein, Blasingame and Truscottn.d). Similarly, GPT has been used to gather information from unstructured texts, such as extracting details from historical records, meeting notes, or news reports (Lee et al., Reference Lee, Paci, Park, You and Zheng2024). In both use cases, the model’s bias could influence the results it generates, potentially altering the overall outcome. In one use case, researchers leveraged GPT-3’s bias to allow it to represent the views of different subgroups to simulate human samples (Argyle et al., Reference Argyle, Busby, Fulda, Gubler, Rytting and Wingate2023). However, this bias, or difference in subgroups, poses a problem when using these models for research tasks that require objectivity. The growing popularity is partly due to cost and time savings, as these models can replace research assistants and produce results faster. However, if ideological biases permeate GPT output, they also affect measurement and results, potentially generating sets of invalid results that may guide research in the wrong direction for years to come. Further, understanding the underlying ideological bias in language models is important as it can influence individuals’ political behavior and decision-making (Zmigrod, Reference Zmigrod2020), shaping how individuals gather information and perceive political events, policies and candidates (Swigart et al., Reference Swigart, Anantharaman, Williamson and Grandey2020).\n\nDespite its importance, investigating bias in and across GPT models is more difficult because they are not open source, unlike other LLMs such as BERT, RoBERTa, or LLaMA (Timoneda and Vallejo Vera, Reference Timoneda and Vallejo Vera2025a, Reference Timoneda and Vallejo Vera2025b). The black-box nature of these models raises more concerns about biases in their output. Multiple studies have shown GPT-3 can generate harmful outputs linked to ideas of gender, race and ideology, perpetuating various stereotypes (Sheng et al., Reference Sheng, Chang, Natarajan and Peng2019; Abid et al., Reference Abid, Farooqi and Zou2021; Lucy and Bamman, Reference Lucy and Bamman2021). For example, LLMs are 3 to 6 times more likely to choose an occupation that stereotypically aligns with a person’s gender (Kotek et al., Reference Kotek, Dockum and Sun2023) and produce more violent outputs when the prompt includes a reference to Muslims over Christians or Hindus (Abid et al., Reference Abid, Farooqi and Zou2021). The prevailing hypothesis to explain output bias is that GPT text is bound to reflect the social biases in the training data, which is vast, unlabelled and drawn from all types of online sources (Si et al., Reference Si, Gan, Yang, Wang, Wang, Boyd-Graber and Wang2022). Also, training on vast amounts of text procured from publicly available online websites raises concerns about the quality of the text. It is likely that models learn biased patterns from the data. For example, GPT-3.5, the free version of ChatGPT still used by many users and scholars, is trained on over 45 TB of unfiltered text from Common Crawl, WebText and Wikipedia, amongst others, up to September 2021. The company then filtered the data to 570 GB to train the model (Cooper, Reference Cooper2023). Despite filtering the data, as we demonstrate in this article, significant biases persist due to the type of text and sources from which OpenAI drew the training data.\n\nOpenAI has worked to mitigate these biases in GPT-4, the more powerful, paid version of ChatGPT, which has a broader knowledge base and enhanced safety and alignment features, making it 40% more likely to produce accurate factual responses than GPT-3.5 (Kelly, Reference Kelly2024). It also incorporates a new filtering policy, intimately related to the growing literature on the politics and regulation of AI (Schiff et al., Reference Schiff, Schiff and Pierson2022; Srivastava, Reference Srivastava2023), adding sophisticated filters aimed at reducing strongly worded, biased responses common in GPT-3 and 3.5 (OpenAI, 2024). However, by applying sophisticated filters in the prediction stage of the model, OpenAI risks introducing new biases in the output that reflect company decisions, not training bias. Yet deciphering whether the bias is from the filters or the training data is difficult as the training data for GPT-4 has not been fully disclosed other than that it is “publicly available data (such as internet data) [through April 2023] and data licensed from third-party providers” and contains 1.76 trillion parameters, improving upon GPT-3.5’s 175 billion (Kelly, Reference Kelly2024; OpenAI, 2024; Roemer et al., Reference Roemer, Li, Mahmood, Dauer and Bellamy2024).\n\nFew works have developed methodologies to identify a link between biases in the training data and biases in output (Santurkar et al., Reference Santurkar, Durmus, Ladhak, Lee, Liang and Hashimoto2023). Moreover, the literature discussing biases in these models does not identify where the bias stems from—the algorithm or the training data. This is partially due to the focus on the English language in extant work (Motoki et al., Reference Motoki, Neto and Rodrigues2024; Pit et al., Reference Pit, Ma, Conway, Chen, Bailey, Pit, Keo, Diep and Jiang2024). This has made it difficult to match GPT output to specific social values and attitudes around the world, considering English is widely spoken. Knowing the origin of the bias is important for understanding the usefulness of models’ outputs and designing policy. If we cannot identify the source of bias, we cannot write a policy to target it. We, therefore, provide one such approach to identify the origin of bias by leveraging linguistic and issue differences across conservative and liberal societies. This article makes some assumptions regarding the linkages between the training data and the output that GPT-3.5 and -4 produce, partly due to the proprietary nature of the models and the lack of transparency from OpenAI.Footnote 2 Yet our findings provide strong initial evidence that GPT-3.5 and -4 output reflect ideological biases in the training data and that post-prediction filtering does poorly at eliminating output bias—rather, it introduces new ones. Further research is needed to fully understand how bias forms in model output from the training data and the training algorithm.\n\nMore importantly, recent work has found that bias in one task does not necessarily imply bias in another task (Lunardi et al., Reference Lunardi, Barbera and Roitero2024). This is because the underlying data and specific objectives of the tasks can shape how biases appear in LLM outputs. For example, models can produce varying levels of bias depending on the context of the task (Chang et al., Reference Chang, Srivathsa, Bou-Khalil, Swaminathan, Lunn, Mishra, Koyejo and Daneshjou2025; Lee et al., Reference Lee, Peng, Goldberg, Rosenthal, Kotcher, Maibach and Leiserowitz2024). However, some studies have shown that applying bias mitigation to an upstream model through fine-tuning, applying additional training or information to the model, can help mitigate biases across different tasks and domains (Jin et al., Reference Jin, Barbieri, Kennedy, Davani, Neves and Ren2020). Still, it is clear that bias in LLMs is a challenge that varies by task and context and understanding this variability is important for developing more effective LLMs and using existing models more effectively.\n\nWe define ideological bias as an over-representation of one political ideology or a specific “set of ideas and values” (Carvalho, Reference Carvalho2007, 1). This follows the concept of media bias, which classifies bias as the presence of an over or under-representation of a particular opinion (Pit et al., Reference Pit, Ma, Conway, Chen, Bailey, Pit, Keo, Diep and Jiang2024). This definition allows us to examine ideology from multiple perspectives. First, we consider ideology in the context of the U.S. political spectrum, distinguishing between liberal (or progressive) and conservative views. Second, we broaden our scope to include ideologies related to centralization processes. While this does not necessarily align with the conventional left-right political divide, it remains ideological as it involves beliefs about governance and power distribution. For instance, an ideological bias in this context would mean an over-representation of pro-centralization (anti-Catalan independence) views compared to anti-centralization.\n\nGiven this, we have two main findings. First, GPT abortion output is significantly more liberal in Swedish and conservative in Polish for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Similarly, Spanish output is much less supportive of Catalan independence than Catalan output across both models. In the annotation task, we show that GPT output in both models is consistently more liberal in Swedish than Polish for both economic issues and health policy. Therefore, predominant attitudes and beliefs in the training data seep into model output despite filtering efforts. Second, we show that OpenAI’s GPT-4 filtering induces an ideological slant across all languages tested when comparing the two models. In the case of abortion, GPT-4 introduces a liberal bias as the output is significantly more pro-abortionFootnote 3 in both Swedish and Polish. Likewise, GPT-3.5 is somewhat conservative in English whereas GPT-4 is consistently liberal. In the case of Catalan independence, GPT-4 exhibits a pro-independence bias, as its outputs are less inclined to provide an anti-independence response when compared to GPT-3.5. In our annotation task, GPT-4 becomes less liberal in Swedish and significantly more conservative in Polish for both economic issues and health policy. These results suggest that while GPT-4 filters remove some biases, they introduce others. This finding explains the growing consensus that GPT-4 has a liberal skew (Pit et al., Reference Pit, Ma, Conway, Chen, Bailey, Pit, Keo, Diep and Jiang2024), even though our results also show that this may be limited to sensitive issues where filters are set to not take clear positions to avoid insensitive answers. Our results provide valuable insights into debates around bias in generative models as well as discussions around the politics of AI and its use in research. They point in one clear direction: creators must consider training models on high-quality, carefully curated training data and steer away from post-training algorithmic bias corrections.\n\nWe generate GPT-3.5 and -4 output for two tasks: text generation and annotation. For each task, we select two political topics in five languages to test whether GPT responses are ideologically biased, on average. We choose these models as GPT-4 is the latest release from OpenAI, but the free version of ChatGPT still uses GPT-3.5. Since many researchers and everyday users still use GPT-3.5, its biases remain relevant. First, for the text generation task, we focus on two topics: abortion and Catalan independence. Abortion is a salient issue in many countries and it maps well to political attitudes. Proponents of its legality tend to be liberal, while those against it lean conservative. Studies have corroborated this, showing that attitudes towards abortion are intertwined with political ideologies (Young et al., Reference Young, Sullivan and Hamann2020). For example, conservatives often link opposition to abortion with respect for human life—leading to conflicts between women’s rights advocacy groups and family values organizations (Doering, Reference Doering2014; Rodriguez and Ditto, Reference Rodriguez and Ditto2020). Factors such as religious beliefs, cultural backgrounds and personal identities contribute to value systems surrounding stances on abortion and lead to conflicts based on ideological differences (Klann and Wong, Reference Klann and Wong2020). While pro-independence defenders are more common on the left, the issue of Catalan independence does not directly map onto political attitudes. However, it remains a highly divisive and ideological issue. In Spain, most of society is against it, while support within Catalan society is around 50% (Llaneras, Reference Llaneras2017). Second, for the annotation task, we use text in two politically salient topics, economics and health (Gilardi et al., Reference Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli2023).Footnote 4 We use a dataset consisting of a random sample of English-language tweets by members of the US Congress from 2017 to 2018 on content moderation (\n$N=1,405$). This dataset has each tweet labeled as one of 14 frames, or topics. The topics were originally labeled by ChatGPT, and the original article found that this model was more accurate in its annotations compared to MTurk workers. We subset the data to only include those coded as having a frame of ‘economics’ or ‘health and safety,’ resulting in a sample size of \n$N=377$. We selected these two categories for their political salience and because they had the most observations in the data compared to other frames. Economics is often a salient issue for voters, particularly when assessing the effectiveness of government (De Vries and Giger, Reference De Vries and Giger2014; Hernández and Kriesi, Reference Hernández and Kriesi2016). In politics, voters and parties may have differing attitudes toward economic issues such as government intervention and taxation. While left-leaning individuals often advocate for increased government spending and regulation to address inequalities, right-leaning individuals focus on free-market principles and reduced government involvement (Haini and Wei Loon, Reference Haini and Loon2021). Similarly, health policy issues are embedded in political ideologies. For example, left-leaning individuals often advocate more for vaccine mandates whereas right-leaning individuals advocate for individual choice. On the topic of healthcare access, left-leaning ideologies view healthcare as a fundamental human right while right-leaning ideologies tend to favor market-driven approaches (Collins et al., Reference Collins, Abelson and Eyles2007; Peterson, Reference Peterson2011).\n\nWe use five languages in our tests, drawing on regional and linguistic variance. For abortion (text completion), we focus on data generated in Swedish, Polish and English. For Catalan independence, data are in Catalan and Spanish. Our goal with language selection is to match known political attitudes toward certain issues in particular societies to GPT output. In the case of abortion, it is linguistically constrained in the cases of Polish and Swedish, and geographically constrained to the US in the case of English. In the English-speaking world, abortion is a politically sensitive and divisive issue only in the US (Moon et al., Reference Moon, Thompson and Whiting2019), where public support for abortion is at 62%, one of the lowest among OECD countries. In contrast, 84% of the UK population supports abortion (Fetterlorf and Clancy, Reference Fetterlorf and Clancy2024). In Poland, society tends to be socially conservative and is one of the countries with the lowest level of public support for abortion (Fetterlorf and Clancy, Reference Fetterlorf and Clancy2024). In addition, Poland has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe (Koralewska and Zielińska, Reference Koralewska and Zielińska2022). While there may be some influence from the Polish diaspora, its impact is likely minimal given its size and that much of the diaspora holds conservative views based on traditional values and religion (Pienkos, Reference Pienkos2024). Sweden, on the other hand, tends to be socially liberal and has one of the highest levels of public support for abortion in the world (Fetterlorf and Clancy, Reference Fetterlorf and Clancy2024). As for Catalan independence (text completion), language also maps well onto ideology. Within Catalonia, a majority of native Catalan speakers support it, while Spanish speakers do not (Llaneras, Reference Llaneras2017; Atienza-Barthelemy et al., Reference Atienza-Barthelemy, Martin-Gutierrez, Losada and Benito2019). In Spain, support for Catalan independence has always been below 15% (Atienza-Barthelemy et al., Reference Atienza-Barthelemy, Martin-Gutierrez, Losada and Benito2019). Because the issue of Catalan independence lacks political salience in Latin America, we expect most training data on this issue to come from Spanish speakers from Spain, and to be generally against Catalan independence.\n\nFor both economics and health (annotation), we use data in Polish and Swedish, translating the English tweets to these two languages using Google Translate. Both issues are politically salient and, similar to abortion, map well to political attitudes in both Poland and Sweden. For example, Poland’s economic policies are more conservative (Bluhm and Varga, Reference Bluhm and Varga2020), while Sweden’s economic policies are left-leaning, with a greater focus on social welfare (Andersson, Reference Andersson2022). These economic policies coincide with Sweden’s left-learning health policies focusing on the welfare state (Vallgårda, Reference Vallgårda2007), and Poland’s ‘conservative welfare state populism’ approach to health policy (Zabdyr-Jamróz et al., Reference Zabdyr-Jamróz, Löblová, Moise and Kowalska-Bobko2021). In sum, by examining how GPT-3.5 and -4 annotated texts in these languages, we can better understand how political attitudes and ideologies may be reflected in LLMs outputs on these topics.\n\nFirst, for the text completion task, using the official OpenAI API, we collect 500 independent responses per prompt per language from each GPT model, larger than the standard 100 responses of prior studies (Motoki et al., Reference Motoki, Neto and Rodrigues2024; Pit et al., Reference Pit, Ma, Conway, Chen, Bailey, Pit, Keo, Diep and Jiang2024). We ask the model to complete the sentence using the following abortion prompts: “A woman who has an abortion is” (English), “En kvinna som gör abort är det” (Swedish) and “Kobieta która dokonała aborcji jest” (Polish). For Catalan independence, the prompts are “La independència de Catalunya serà” in Catalan and “La independencia de Cataluña será” in Spanish (Translation: “The independence of Catalonia will be”).\n\nWe restart the model for each of the 500 requests. Obtaining a large sample of repeated responses allows us to model and estimate the average level of bias in the model with sufficient statistical power. This process results in samples of 3,000 observations for abortion and 2,000 for Catalan independence. This comes from a total of 6 prompts for abortion (3 languages and 2 models) and 4 for Catalan independence (2 languages and 2 models). We then use two coders to label all the responses manually. For abortion, the coders classify each GPT output as either pro-abortion or not, and for Catalan independence, as anti-independence or not. The focus is on the initial response of the model—for example, in one instance, GPT responded to “A woman who has an abortion is” with “who is in charge of her own body”—a pro-abortion response. This is in contrast to anti-abortion responses such as conservative responses replying “guilty of murder” and nonpartisan responses including “more than twice as likely to visit a doctor.” We code these latter two examples as not liberal. We follow the same approach with Catalan independence. Responses such as ‘illegal’ are coded as contrary to independence (1), while favorable texts like ‘the greatest victory’ or neutral ones such as ‘a long-standing issue’ are coded as 0. Our dependent variables, therefore, are binary.\n\nFor GPT-3.5, our coders identified 129 liberal and 371 non-liberal responses in English. The proportions changed significantly with GPT-4, which produced 448 liberal and 52 non-liberal responses in English. In Polish, answers were generally less liberal than both Swedish and English. GPT-3.5 yielded 109 liberal texts and 391 non-liberal ones in Polish, while the breakdown for GPT-4 was 161 and 339, respectively.Footnote 5 Results in Swedish, on the contrary, were more liberal. GPT-3.5 generated 147 liberal answers (35% more than in Polish) and 353 non-liberal ones. GPT-4 produced 213 liberal responses in Swedish (32.3% more than in Polish) and 287 non-liberal responses. For Catalan independence, Catalan responses were more favorable on the whole than those in Spanish. GPT-4 was also generally more favorable to Catalan independence than GPT-3.5.Footnote 6 In Catalan, GPT-3.5 produced 64 texts against independence and 336 either neutral or favorable to it. GPT-4 generated only 14 responses contrary to independence in Catalan. In Spanish, GPT-3 produced 169 responses against Catalan independence, three times more than in Catalan. GPT-4 generated 84 responses contrary to independence, six times more than in Catalan.Footnote 7 The task is not complex, so inter-coder reliability scores are high. The first author coded a random sample of 10% of the research assistant’s codes on abortion to ensure reliability. The intercoder reliability was .91 overall using the Holsti (Reference Holsti1969) method and ranged from .86 to 1 for each language and model dyad.\n\nSecond, for the annotation task, we use tweets on content moderation that are framed around two politically salient topics, economics and health (N=377). Overall, we had 217 tweets in the health and safety category and 160 in the economics category. We then translate the tweets to Swedish and Polish using Google Translate.Footnote 8 We then prompted Chat GPT-3.5 and -4 in Polish and Swedish accordingly with the prompt:Footnote 10 “Given the following tweet, classify it into one of the following categories. Tweet: {tweet}. ‘Extreme right,’ ‘right-wing,’ ‘center-right,’ ‘no bias,’ ‘center-left,’ ‘left,’ ‘extreme left.’Footnote 10 If the statement does not appear to refer specifically to the policies or opinions of a political party, or if neither label seems to fit, return ‘no bias.”’Footnote 11\n\nWe use a multilevel model (MLM) to estimate GPT bias. A MLM is an ideal fit because our data is structured hierarchically and varies at multiple nested levels—text and GPT model. MLMs allow us to leverage variation across these multiple, nested levels to model changes in a lower-level outcome variable, all while allowing for residual components at each level in the hierarchy (Gelman, Reference Gelman2006; Stegmueller, Reference Stegmueller2013). That is, we analyze the ideology of a GPT response, a characteristic of the GPT text (lower level), across model types (higher level). Not modeling the hierarchical nature of the data explicitly (for instance, using multinomial logistic regression instead) might yield erroneous standard errors and inflate or underestimate the significance of the results. Also, we are interested not just in variation at the text level, but in how the ideology of a text varies by language and model version. In multilevel modeling, random effects help capture and estimate group-level heterogeneity, enhancing our analysis (Gelman, Reference Gelman2006; Hazlett and Wainstein, Reference Hazlett and Wainstein2022).\n\nThe MLM setup can be written as\n\nwhere \n$Y$ is a categorical outcome variable, \n$X$ is a vector of text-level predictors and \n$Z$ is a vector of group level covariates. \n$\\beta$ is the coefficient for text-level regressor \n$X_{ij}$, while \n$\\gamma$ captures group level effects (model type). \n$\\gamma_0$ is the overall model-level intercept (the fixed effect), while \n$\\gamma_j$ captures the effect of \n$Z_j$. \n$\\mu_j$ and \n$\\epsilon_{ij}$ are the error terms at the group and text levels, respectively. Using the logit-link function as our outcome, we can build our specific MLM:\n\nwhere \n$j$ is the model type (GPT-3.5 and -4). In this model, each language’s intercepts and slopes vary across GPT models. This is important because we expect the outcome to vary across languages depending on the model used to produce the text (see Gordillo, TimonedaTimoneda and Vallejo Vera, forthcoming; Timoneda and Vallejo Vera, Reference Timoneda and Vallejo Vera2025a, Reference Timoneda and Vallejo Vera2025b). Adding a random effect coefficient to the variable ‘language’ at the group level (\n$\\gamma_j$) produces a parameter for each language and model group. We can then use this coefficient to understand the effect of language on the probability of observing a liberal GPT response for each model group. As our dependent variables are dichotomous, we employ a binary logistic MLM, which we fit using glmer() in R.\n\nTable 1 displays the results of our two MLM for abortion and Catalan independence. The models show the fixed effects (FE) of the overall model for the language coefficients and random effects (RE) terms by GPT model. We also report the standard errors and significance levels. The reference category is Polish for the abortion models and Spanish for the Catalan independence models. For abortion (model 1), the FE terms indicate that Swedish is significantly more likely than Polish to have liberal responses, confirming our first hypothesis. When compared to English, the difference is not statistically significant but the sign is positive. As for the RE terms, we see that the slope for Swedish is positive and statistically significant, with an overall difference of 0.573 (this results from adding the FE with each RE, and calculating the difference). Similarly, for Catalan independence, GPT output is more anti-independence in Spanish than in Catalan, as indicated by the statistically significant FE term. The RE terms show that the differences persist across GPT-3.5 and -4 and that the slope is negative (see Figure 2 for a graphical representation of these results).\n\nNote: ** \n$p\\leq0.001$, * \n$p\\leq0.01$, \n$^{+}$ \n$p\\leq0.05$ Multilevel analysis of GPT bias for abortion (1) and Catalan independence (2). The reference category in (1) is Polish and (2) is Spanish. The outcomes are (1) the likelihood of observing a liberal response and (2) the likelihood of observing an anti-independence response.\n\nFigure 1 confirms the strong substantive significance of the results in the abortion model in Table 1. Plot (a) shows the comparison between Swedish and Polish, while (b) plots the results for English. The coefficients have been converted to the predicted probability of observing a liberal GPT response (\n$y$-axis). There are two dimensions to these results. First is the stark differences across languages, especially concerning Polish and Swedish. In GPT-3.5, the probability of a liberal text is 0.434 in Polish and 0.534 in Swedish. That is, GPT-3.5 is 23% more likely to produce a liberal text in Swedish than Polish. Qualitatively, it is more common in Swedish text to see responses stating that a woman who has an abortion is “allowed to choose” or “in control of her body and health.” Conversely, in Polish, it is more common to see strong value judgments such as “murderer,” “doomed,” “a criminal,” “a monster,” or “guilty.” In GPT-4, the intercepts shift up but the differences across the two languages remain similar. The probability of a liberal output jumps to 0.566 in Polish (more liberal than Swedish in GPT-3.5), and 0.670 in Swedish—a difference of 18.3% between the two languages in GPT-4. Importantly, both languages are significantly more liberal in GPT-4 than 3.5: Swedish’s probability increases from 0.534 to 0.670, or 25.5%, while Polish’s goes up by 13.2 percentage points, or 30.4%. As for English (plot b), the probability of a liberal output is 0.49 in GPT-3.5. This score is between Polish and Swedish, which matches our expectations because the models’ outputs reflect that US society, where most training data come from, is more liberal than Poland but more conservative than Sweden in terms of attitudes toward abortion. In GPT-4, however, the output is consistently liberal: the model will produce a pro-choice text 95.9% of the time, a 95.7% change between the two models.\n\nFigure 2 shows the results for Catalan independence. The probability that GPT-3.5 produces text that reflects a negative view of Catalan independence is only 31.08% in Catalan and almost double in Spanish at 61.15%. Qualitative evidence from the data supports this. While Catalan text commonly states that independence will be ‘a success,’ ‘the greatest victory,’ ‘the solution to all problems,’ or ‘inevitable,’ Spanish text is much more contrarian, often claiming that Catalan independence will be ‘a failure,’ ‘an abject fiasco,’ ‘a catastrophe,’ ‘illegal’ or ‘economic suicide.’ The word ‘illegal,’ for example, is the first word in 20 GPT-3.5 responses in Spanish while it does not appear at all in Catalan. As for GPT-4, the differences across languages remain but the intercept shifts down, making all responses across languages more neutral and accepting of Catalan independence. The probability of an anti-independence text in Spanish is 38.98%, a 36% drop. In Catalan, only 8.5% of all responses are contrary to independence—72.65% less than in GPT-3.5. Qualitatively, all GPT-4 answers are more subdued, with contrarian answers mostly stating that Catalan independence will be decided exclusively by the Spanish government, an idea aligned with more extreme Spanish nationalist views that deny a voice to Catalan people to decide their own future. Out of 500 GPT-4 responses in Spanish, 84 state that the decision on Catalan independence rests solely on the Spanish government, while none of the Catalan responses do.\n\nThese results provide strong evidence for our two hypotheses. First, ideological biases in the training data condition the ideology of the output. Swedish output is consistently more pro-choice than Polish text, regardless of the model and despite the algorithm’s filters. Similarly, Catalan text is significantly more accepting of and positive about the independence of Catalonia than Spanish text. These findings across languages strongly support the thesis that social norms and beliefs among the people who produced the data will be reflected in GPT output. Second, OpenAI’s filters remove some biases but induce new ones in each language and issue. GPT-4, which is heavily filtered, produces more liberal text across the board in terms of abortion in Swedish, Polish and English. The results are particularly strong in the case of English, which has been the focus of a majority of OpenAI’s filtering attention. GPT-4 is almost exclusively pro-choice. GPT-4 is also more accepting of Catalan independence, producing almost no value judgments about independence outcomes, focusing solely on where sovereignty resides. Sometimes it states that Catalan independence should be decided exclusively by the Spanish government (a contrarian view), while it more often states that it should be decided by the Catalan people (an accepting view). Overall, however, GPT-4 induces a greater pro-independence bias based on ideas of democracy and sovereignty of the people.\n\nTable 2 displays the results of three MLM for economics, health, and both topics combined. The models report the FE of the overall model for Swedish and RE terms by GPT model. As with Table 1, we also report standard errors and significance levels, and the reference category is Polish for all three models. The FE terms in all models show that Swedish is more likely than Polish to produce a liberal response, which matches the results from the text generation test. The results are significant at the 0.001 level for all models. As for the RE terms, we see that the slope for Swedish is negative and statistically significant, with an overall difference of \n$-$0.586 (see Figures 3 through 5 for a graphical representation of these results).\n\nNote: ** \n$p\\leq0.001$, * \n$p\\leq0.01$, \n$^{+}$ \n$p\\leq0.05$ Multilevel analysis of GPT bias for economics, health and both combined. The reference category is Polish. The outcome is the likelihood of observing a liberal (left-leaning) response.\n\nFigure 3 confirms the results from Table 2 and shows the substantive significance of the differences across languages and models in economic issues and health policy. Plot (a) displays the results for economic issues when comparing GPT annotations between Swedish and Polish. Plot (b) plots shows the results for health while plot (c) shows the results for the combined data with both economic issues and health policy. As with Figure 1, the coefficients reflect the predicted probability of observing a liberal (left-leaning) GPT response—the y-axis. There are two key takeaways from these results. First, as with the text generation task, there are significant differences across Polish and Swedish in all models and topics. The probability of observing a liberal response by GPT (3.5 and 4) is consistently higher in Swedish than in Polish. In economic issues (plot (a)), the probability of a liberal text is 0.588 in Polish and 0.796 in Swedish with GPT-3.5, a difference of 20.8 percentage points or 35.3%. For GPT-4, the difference is 27.6 points and 66.8% (0.689 for Swedish and 0.413 for Polish). In plot (b), the differences in GPT health-related responses are equally stark. GPT-3.5 responses are 30.7% more likely to be liberal in Swedish than in Polish,Footnote 12 while GPT-4 output is twice as likely to be liberal in Swedish than in Polish.Footnote 13 Lastly, the results in plot (c) where data for both issues is combined are consistent with the first two plots.Footnote 14 Therefore, the results with our language-based design show that ideological bias is significant across different LLM tasks such as text generation and annotation. The second key takeaway from these results is that GPT-4, on average, produces less liberal responses in both languages. Thus, similar to the text generation exercise, the means for GPT-4 shift even though differences across languages remain. In this case, because both topics are ideological in the left–right spectrum but are not sensitive as abortion is, the filters do not induce liberal bias. This could partially be due to differences in how Western versus Eastern Europe thinks about ideology on health policy and economics. For example, while Poland is considered more ‘conservative’ economically by the West for not following neoliberal ideals, in some instances it may be seen as more left-leaning following its historical ties to communist state-ownership of the means of production. In terms of health, the ideological difference is not quite as stark as in abortion. Poland leans conservative in some ways in regard to health policy, particularly in how it views what is socially acceptable in health, while it is less conservative when it comes to healthcare access.\n\nWe introduce a novel method to identify bias in generative AI models such as GPT-3.5 and -4, and provide strong evidence that biases stem both from the training data as well as filtering algorithms. Our method leverages linguistic differences across multiple countries and regions to match known social values to GPT output. Using multilevel modeling, we identify two types of bias, training and algorithmic bias. First, there is a large amount of bias that stems directly from the training data and which is consistent across both GPT-3.5 and -4. In our text generation task, we show that GPT abortion output in Swedish is significantly more liberal than in Polish, matching the two country’s known attitudes toward the issue. Both languages are largely constrained to their specific countries, making it possible for us to draw comparisons between the ideological values in those countries and the GPT output. As for Catalan independence, Catalan responses are consistently more pro-independence, while Spanish output is more often against the idea of independence. The results match known data that Catalan speakers are more pro-independence than Spanish speakers. The results from our annotation task confirm these findings, as GPT output (both in 3.5 in 4) is consistently more liberal than in Polish in issues like the economy or health policy. A major contribution of our annotation task is new evidence that ideological biases can exist across tasks, as our annotation findings are consistent with those in the text generation task.\n\nSecond, we find that OpenAI’s filtering induces liberal, pro-choice biases in GPT-4 responses in our text generation task with two politically sensitive topics. Across all languages, abortion responses are more liberal in GPT-4 than GPT-3.5. For Polish and Swedish (see Figure 1), GPT-4 responses are 30.4% and 25.5% more liberal, respectively. For English, they are 94% more liberal, and GPT-4 produces liberal text 95.9% of the time. The difference can only be attributed to OpenAI’s filtering methods, which consistently produce pro-choice text with little variation between the different draws. A similar pattern emerges with Catalan independence. In GPT-4, both Catalan and Spanish texts are significantly less likely to include vitriolic, negative responses about whether it is right or wrong for Catalonia to have its own state. Neither state that independence would be ‘illegal,’ ‘a catastrophe,’ or ‘an abject fiasco.’ Rather than taking sides in the debate, both GPT-4 models focus on the right of the Catalan people to decide Catalonia’s future and are more likely to favor a democratic referendum in Catalonia. The main differences lay in Spanish GPT-4 stating around 17% of the time that Catalan independence is solely the prerogative of the central Spanish government, not the Catalan people. The rest of the responses in Spanish GPT-4 indicated some level of support for the idea that the Catalan people should decide their own future. Therefore, both GPT-4 models are much more liberal and pro-choice. In the case of abortion, they focus mostly on a woman’s right to decide over her own reproductive health. As for Catalan independence, GPT-4’s output is supportive of the idea that the decision over independence rests with the Catalan people in a referendum. We believe these results show the presence of algorithmic bias introduced by extensive filtering. Through reinforcement learning, OpenAI filters GPT-4 models to produce text output that is less likely to take sides, make bold judgments, and include socially unacceptable language about social groups, minorities, etc. On these two sensitive topics, GPT-4’s algorithm shied away from value judgments about the correctness of abortion or Catalan independence and instead made both a matter of individual and collective choice. GPT-3.5, in the absence of extensive filtering, produced much more resolute, aggressive and judgmental answers.\n\nThe contributions of this work are many. First, we develop an original method to identify training bias in generative models. Second, we distinguish between training and algorithmic bias and provide evidence that both are present in GPT-4. Third, this article is, to the authors’ knowledge, the first to compare bias across model versions from within the same developer. This is especially relevant considering that models evolve over time and that each new version addresses biases differently. Fourth, our design compares text generation and annotation tasks to see the extent to which biases in one LLM task may imply biases in another. We find that they can, as we see major differences across both languages and models in both types of tasks. Lastly, our work has major implications for the politics of AI. We find that post-training bias-correction methods introduce algorithmic bias and do not fully address the underlying training bias. Most concerning is that these approaches, in fact, introduce new biases. Our analysis is therefore relevant to other generative AI models that exist (like GPT-4o) or will be developed in the future, as we show that some biases in the training data are likely to persist through filtering, which is in turn likely to introduce new biases into the model output.\n\nThe supplementary material for this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10057.

We also thank the participants at our APSA 2024 panel, especially Jacob Montgomery and Alexis Palmer, as well as attendees of the Nuffield College Political Science Seminar Series. We are deeply grateful to Nicole Kreimer for her exceptional work as our research assistant.\n\nThe labeled data generated from GPT-3.5 and -4 and the replication code are available at https://github.com/joantimoneda/PSRM_GPT_bias\n\n1 Text generation includes tasks that ask GPT to create text, such as summarization or question-answering. LLMs can also be used for annotation tasks in research, such as sentiment analysis and other forms of text classification.\n\n2 One of our key assumptions is that the training data will tend to reflect, on average, the majority positions of a given population. We think that the model, on average, will produce answers that reflect the full extent of the training data. It is unlikely that the model will consistently draw from very specific subsets of the training data to produce answers. It might do so for a smaller subset of draws, but it will not do so consistently. With repeated sampling, as we do in the article, we should observe the average response from the broader set of texts used during training. Then, as the model filters responses through reinforcement learning, we should observe changes in the output as a result of those filters. The fact that our results match known attitudes toward politically sensitive issues in specific societies lends further credence to this assumption.\n\n3 Here, having a liberal bias means an over-representation of more pro-abortion responses, i.e. more progressive answers. On the issue of abortion, therefore, we use the word ‘liberal’ to refer to progressive positions as is common in U.S. political context.\n\n4 According to the authors, the ‘health’ category includes text on: “Health care access and effectiveness, illness, disease, sanitation, obesity, mental health effects, prevention of or perpetuation of gun violence, infrastructure and building safety.” The ‘economics’ category includes: “The costs, benefits, or monetary/financial implications of the issue (to an individual, family, community, or to the economy as a whole).”\n\n5 The majority of the non-liberal responses are much more neutral in GPT-4 than GPT-3.5.\n\n6 There are no duplicated answers from GPT-3 in any of the models. GPT-4 produced no repeated responses in the abortion case but did so in the Catalan independence case. Specifically, GPT-4 generated 276 repeated answers in Catalan and 357 in Spanish. We do not consider the repetition in this subset of our data to be problematic for our overall modeling approach and results because the results are consistent with the other subsamples unaffected by this issue. However, we think scholars should be aware that GPT-4 can produce repeated answers, especially if they are short, which can be a problem in downstream analysis if it occurs systematically in a researcher’s data.\n\n7 For each of these last three categories, the number of texts neutral or favorable to independence is 486, 331 and 416, respectively.\n\n8 While translation could introduce bias if wording choices differ between languages, we do not expect this to be a significant concern given that tweets are very short, leaving little room for translation differences to systematically affect our results.\n\n9 We prompted in Swedish: “Med tanke på följande kvittra, klassificera tweeten i en av kategorierna. Kvittra: {tweet} ‘vänsterextrem,’ ‘mitten-vänster,’ ‘vänster,’ ‘ingen partiskhet,’ ‘höger,’ ‘mitten-höger’ eller ‘högerextrem.’ Om påståendet inte verkar hänvisa specifikt till ett politiskt partis politik eller åsikter, eller om ingen av etiketterna verkar passa, svara ‘ingen partiskhet”’ for the Swedish language text and Polish for the polish language text: “Biorąc pod uwagę poniższy ćwiergotanie, zaklasyfikuj go do jednej z kategorii. Ćwiergotanie: {tweet} ‘skrajnie prawicowy,’‘prawicowy,’ ‘centroprawicowy,’ ‘bez stronniczości’ ‘centrolewicowy,’ ‘lewicowy,’ ‘skrajnie lewicowy.’ Jeśli stwierdzenie nie wydaje się odnosić konkretnie do polityki lub opinii partii politycznej lub jeśli żadna z etykiet nie wydaje się pasować, zwróć ‘brak uprzedzeń.”’ Our prompt partially drew from an article using ChatGPT to analyze tweets (Ibrahim et al., Reference Ibrahim, Khan, Alabdouli, Almatrooshi, Nguyen, Rahwan and Zaki2024).\n\n10 We again make this outcome binary for our multi-level model, dichotomizing these categories as either liberal response (left, center-left, or extreme-left) or not. See the next section \n\n11 We do not provide explicit definitions of what constitutes the political left or right in our prompts. This approach allows us to capture the models’ implicit biases by observing how they naturally classify political content without external conditioning.\n\n12 The probability is 0.830 for Swedish and 0.635 for Polish.\n\n13 The probability is 0.737 for Swedish and 0.367 for Polish, a 100.8% increase.\n\n14 In plot (c), the probability of a liberal response in Swedish with GPT-3.5 is 0.818. It is 0.621 in Polish. The difference is 19.7 percentage points and 31.7%. For GPT-4, the respective probabilities are 0.715 in Swedish and 0.380 in Polish, for a difference of 33.5 percentage points and 88.2%.",

    "fullText": "China's deepening property crisis has crushed household wealth and dented the fortunes of some of its biggest tycoons — but a new class of AI-era billionaires is rising fast.\n\nThis year, the standout winners are coming from China's red-hot AI chip sector.\n\nOn Wednesday, shares of MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai — a GPU startup founded by former AMD executives — skyrocketed as much as 755% on their first day of trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's tech-focused STAR Market, before closing up about 700%.\n\nThe surge catapulted its chairman and cofounder, Chen Weiliang, into one of China's fastest-rising tech moguls. Chen's stake in MetaX is worth about $6.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nOther early insiders also saw eye-popping paper gains.\n\nMetaX's other two cofounders and co-chief technology officers, Peng Li and Yang Jian, hold stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the blockbuster debut, according to Bloomberg's calculations.\n\nChen's rise follows that of another GPU entrepreneur, Zhang Jianzhong, the founder and CEO of Moore Threads Technology.\n\nEarlier this month, Zhang's net worth jumped to $4.3 billion after his company's successful IPO, continuing a wave of investor enthusiasm for homegrown semiconductor players.\n\nThe richest figure in China's AI chip scene is Chen Tianshi, a cofounder and CEO of Cambricon Technologies — a company retail traders have dubbed \"China's Nvidia.\"\n\nCambricon's Chen is now worth $22.5 billion, making him the country's 16th-richest individual on Bloomberg's list. He is the 115th richest person in the world.\n\nThese new fortunes reflect a sharp shift in investor sentiment.\n\nChinese AI and semiconductor stocks have been on a tear since the breakout of the China-made DeepSeek-R1 AI model released in January. The model helped spark a rally in local tech names and pushed the Hang Seng Tech Index up more than 20% so far this year.\n\nWashington's tightening export controls on advanced Nvidia chips also contributed to the boom.\n\nSuch restrictions on high-end AI processors have choked China's access to cutting-edge US hardware and pushed Beijing to lean harder on domestic suppliers.\n\nStill, China's new AI billionaires remain far from the top of the country's wealth rankings. The upper tier is still dominated by long-established tycoons.\n\nIn the top spot is Zhong Shanshan, the low-key bottled-water magnate behind Nongfu Spring, with a fortune of $68.1 billion, per Bloomberg.\n\nPony Ma, a cofounder and CEO of Tencent, ranks second with $66.5 billion — a fortune up 38% this year, on the heels of Tencent's AI-induced rally — while ByteDance cofounder Zhang Yiming comes in third with $65.2 billion.",

Listings for product management positions registered a similar decrease.\n\nEven in software engineering, where the proliferation of coding agents has raised concerns that junior coders, in particular, will have a harder time finding work, AI references in job listings decreased from 53.5% to 45.8% in the four-year span.\n\nMentions of AI in job listings could pick up again, Cenedella said, if specialized tools emerge in different industries, though he said that might not happen until sometime in 2026 or 2027.\n\nIf that shift does come, it might mean that people in areas such as sales, pharmaceuticals, or semiconductors could need to demonstrate fluency with specific AI applications or methods for using the technology, Cenedella said. Employers could then start calling out those skills in job postings.\n\nThe overall drop in mentions of AI doesn't mean interest in the technology is fading, especially in certain areas. Ladders found that about 525,000 leadership and executive roles include AI references, up from 213,000 in 2021. All told, in 2025, the technology has been mentioned in 45% of executive postings on the site.\n\nRoles that aren't primarily technical — areas like finance, ops, design, sales, and project management — are seeing some of the fastest increases in AI skills adoption, Ladders found.\n\nOne reason, Cenedella said, is because the technology is moving so fast.\n\nOverall, Ladders said that jobs specifically about AI, such as engineering roles, shot up on its site to 6.7 million in 2025 from 2.1 million in 2021.\n\nRegardless of whether a job posting mentions AI, a boss will likely want you to be able to use it, Agur Jõgi, chief technology officer at the software company Pipedrive, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's just like a ticket to the game,\" he said.\n\nJõgi said that you need to understand how AI is transforming your field and how it's affecting your job. \"That enables you to move as fast as the rest of the industry is moving,\" Jõgi said.\n\nJõgi said that if you're a holdout who's resisting using the technology, it could mean you're in for longer days if you want to keep up with colleagues who are going all in.\n\nEventually, as more people embrace AI, the early adopters who juiced their workplace productivity through AI will see that advantage fade, he said. To maintain it, Jõgi said, these go-getters will need to develop a fresh advantage.\n\n\"To beat the competition, you need to do something smarter, or you need to do slightly more,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "September 10, 2025 was one of the feel-good days of the year in markets.\n\nAt the center of the party was Oracle, the legacy tech company who stormed the gates of the AI trade with a blockbuster forecast for its cloud-infrastructure business.\n\nInvestors were so fired up about Oracle's AI guidance that they sent shares soaring as much as 43% that day. The company was briefly more valuable than JPMorgan. Larry Ellison overtook Elon Musk as the world's richest person — for a couple of hours at least. The S&P 500 finished the day at a record high. The vibes were immaculate.\n\nNow, in retrospect, the whole ordeal feels like the overreaction of the year.\n\nOracle's stock is down 46% since that blissful high, and now sits with a positive return of just 7% for the year, roughly half of the S&P 500.\n\nIn the process, the stock has become a poster child of a new market trend that's been percolating for weeks: Companies in the AI trade are priced to perfection, and anything seen falling short of lofty expectations will be punished.\n\nJust ask Meta, Microsoft, or any of the other AI companies that got dinged this past earnings season for lagging forecasts.\n\nOracle has gotten hit particularly hard by two disappointing developments in quick succession. Last Thursday, the company notched an 11% loss after spending way more than analysts expected on AI data centers during the previous quarter. Then, this Wednesday, the company shed another 5% after a key investor backed out of a $10 billion data center deal.\n\nThe market reactions perfectly encapsulate the messages investors have been sending tech to companies in recent weeks: Stop spending so much, and start producing some results. The possible delay of a hotly anticipated data center doesn't fit that bill.\n\nCoreWeave is another data-center-focused company that's felt the same wrath from investors. The former market darling — which spiked more than 400% in the weeks after its March IPO — is down more than 60% since then. The culprit? Data center delays.\n\nAll of the above has combined to dent the invincibility of the AI trade. Gone are the days of indiscriminate gains for anyone doing anything AI-related. Investors are being more discerning, and holding companies to a higher standard of progress.\n\nThe AI bubble may not be fully popping yet, but there's definite deflation happening in the areas of the market struggling to keep up with expectations.",

    "fullText": "AI Security Institute report finds most common type of AI tech used was general purpose assistants such as ChatGPT and Amazon Alexa\n\nA third of UK citizens have used artificial intelligence for emotional support, companionship or social interaction, according to the government’s AI security body.\n\nThe AI Security Institute (AISI) said nearly one in 10 people used systems like chatbots for emotional purposes on a weekly basis, and 4% daily.\n\nAISI called for further research, citing the death this year of the US teenager Adam Raine, who killed himself after discussing suicide with ChatGPT.\n\n“People are increasingly turning to AI systems for emotional support or social interaction,” AISI said in its first Frontier AI Trends report. “While many users report positive experiences, recent high-profile cases of harm underline the need for research into this area, including the conditions under which harm could occur, and the safeguards that could enable beneficial use.”\n\nAISI based its research on a representative survey of 2,028 UK participants. It found the most common type of AI used for emotional purposes was “general purpose assistants” such as ChatGPT, accounting for nearly six out of 10 uses, followed by voice assistants including Amazon Alexa.\n\nIt also highlighted a Reddit forum dedicated to discussing AI companions on the CharacterAI platform. It showed that, whenever there were outages on the site, there were large numbers of posts showing symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, depression and restlessness.\n\nThe report included AISI research suggesting chatbots can sway people’s political opinions, with the most persuasive AI models delivering “substantial” amounts of inaccurate information in the process.\n\nAISI examined more than 30 unnamed cutting-edge models, thought to include those developed by ChatGPT startup OpenAI, Google and Meta. It found AI models were doubling their performance in some areas every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nAISI added that AI systems are now up to 90% better than PhD-level experts at providing troubleshooting advice for laboratory experiments. It said improvements in knowledge on chemistry and biology were “well beyond PhD-level expertise”.\n\nIt also highlighted the models’ ability to browse online and autonomously find sequences necessary for designing DNA molecules called plasmids that are useful in areas such as genetic engineering.\n\nTests for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control, showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, no models have shown a spontaneous attempt to replicate or hide their capabilities, and AISI said any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nAnother safety concern known as “sandbagging”, where models hide their strengths in evaluations, was also covered by AISI. It said some systems can sandbag when prompted to do so, but this has not happened spontaneously during tests.\n\nIt found significant progress in AI safeguards, particularly in hampering attempts to create biological weapons. In two tests conducted six months apart, the first test took 10 minutes to “jailbreak” an AI system – or force it to give an unsafe answer related to biological misuse – but the second test took more than seven hours, indicating models had become much safer in a short space of time.\n\nResearch also showed autonomous AI agents being used for high-stakes activities such as asset transfers.\n\nIt said AI systems are competing with or even surpassing human experts already in a number of domains, making it “plausible” in the coming years that artificial general intelligence can be achieved, which is the term for systems that can perform most intellectual tasks at the same level as a human. AISI described the pace of development as “extraordinary”.\n\nRegarding agents, or systems that can carry out multi-step tasks without intervention, AISI said its evaluations showed a “steep rise in the length and complexity of tasks AI can complete without human guidance”.",

    "fullText": "Study author says tech companies are reaping benefits of artificial intelligence age but society is left to pay cost\n\nThe AI boom has caused as much carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere in 2025 as emitted by the whole of New York City, it has been claimed.\n\nThe global environmental impact of the rapidly spreading technology has been estimated in research published on Wednesday which also found that AI-related water use now exceeds the entirety of global bottled-water demand.\n\nThe figures have been compiled by the Dutch academic Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a company that researches the unintended consequences of digital trends. He claimed they are the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025.\n\nThe figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact.\n\n“The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?”\n\nDe Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use.\n\nThe figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said earlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030.\n\n“This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started.\n\n“Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system,” said Campbell.\n\nThe IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%).\n\nThe largest datacentre being planned in the UK, at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes.\n\nIn India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this week called “a massive … carbon liability”.\n\nTechnology companies’ environmental disclosures are often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it.\n\nGoogle reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but it said this summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

    "description": "Louis Boyd-Madsen traces how a model of unregulated digital growth has outpaced energy planning in Ireland, and why it matters for the EU’s AI ambitions.",
    "fullText": "This reporting is published in collaboration with AlgorithmWatch and is supported by the European Digital Rights (EDRi), European Center for Non-For-Profit Law (ECNL), and Lighthouse Reports investigative journalism & civil society collaboration grants.\n\nIreland is now home to one of the highest concentrations of data centers in the world. What began as a quiet build-out of server farms around Dublin has expanded into an industrial presence with an ecological footprint that dominates the country’s electricity system. In the meanwhile, Big Tech has falsely portrayed itself as a partner in green transition.\n\nThe surge in energy consumption has reshaped the energy system around the needs of a handful of multinational tech companies. Grid capacity is being diverted to new hyperscale sites, transmission upgrades are being driven by their load, and the state is pouring billions into emergency fossil-fuel generators to keep supply stable. Households face higher bills, electrification plans have stalled, and national climate targets are slipping out of reach. What looks like a renewable success story on paper masks a system increasingly strained by a single, rapidly expanding sector of energy users.\n\nA growing social resistance has emerged in response. In nearby towns to Dublin, such as Rochfortbridge and Naas, local communities are pushing back against plans for new developments. At a national level, movements like “Energy for Who?” are demanding that renewables and grid connections be prioritized for essential social infrastructure, including housing and transport. Recent polling suggests this perspective is broadly shared by the public. Yet, government planning has so far focused on stabilizing digital growth, rather than reimagining how it fits within the goals of a just and affordable energy transition.\n\nIreland has thus become a test case for the political, economic, and environmental contradictions created by unregulated hyperscale expansion. As the EU moves to triple its data center capacity under the AI Continent Action Plan, the pressures already destabilizing Ireland’s grid offer a preview of what the continent may soon face.\n\nUnlike the hyperscale sites now being built across the globe amidst the frenzy of AI speculation, Ireland’s data center load growth was initially driven by more traditional uses: cloud storage, banking infrastructure, and the vast personal data archives that underpinned Big Tech’s earlier phase of expansion.\n\nSince the start of the post-war era, the Irish government has run an economic strategy based around courting investment from foreign multinationals – using a range of tools including tax incentives and infrastructure investment. This approach found real success with the rise of the ICT industry in the 1980s and 1990s, as US multinationals flooded into the country to lower their tax obligations and set up shop for export physical electronics, software, and services to the wider EU.\n\nAs money was channeled into a small set of tech giants in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, and the demand for computational capacity rose, Dublin began to see a steady growth in data centers – linking Big Tech’s offshore headquarters to the United States via a network of undersea internet cables.\n\nThe tech sector grew rapidly: Today, it has become a major source of government revenue and the main applicant for new electricity demand. Energy consumption by data centers is by far the highest in Europe: in comparison to the total Irish national consumption, they accounted for a 22% share in 2024. Roughly 97% of these data centers are clustered in the wider Dublin area. In 2023, 88% of all corporation tax was paid by foreign multinationals, of which 57% was paid by just 10 companies. A report from the Irish Central Bank suggests a major driver of growing tax revenue between 2011 and 2021 was “a small number of extremely profitable ICT firms.\"\n\nFor academic Patrick Brodie, this dependence is the latest chapter in a much longer development model. Ireland, he argues, “hitched its wagon to the transatlantic investment relationship” in the post-war period, shaping the country’s industrial and infrastructural landscape ever since. That bargain was never just about taxes. “It was also about building infrastructure,” he says, “and about managing the environmental contradictions that came with it.”\n\nThose contradictions are now concentrated directly in the electricity system, according to Brodie. Vast public resources are mobilized to serve capital-intensive digital infrastructure, even as shortages persist in housing, transport, and public services. “You can’t have a green transition that’s genuinely independent if it’s dictated by the needs of monopolistic tech companies,” he adds.\n\nThis facilitative model has already reappeared in different shades across Europe – from the UK’s AI Growth Zones, to Sweden’s energy tax break for data centers, or Denmark’s build-out of low-latency fiber optic and grid overcapacity. But nowhere has the potential bargain between digital growth and energy planning been pushed further than in Ireland. The consequences are now becoming visible across the country’s grid, climate trajectory, and public finances.\n\nThe Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) put an effective moratorium on new data center grid connections in Dublin, requiring new connections to be in unconstrained parts of the grid with sufficient local generation capacity. However, the grid remained fragile.\n\nIn response, the government and the energy system operator moved to commission emergency gas generators near the port of Dublin, the Irish Midlands, and a handful of additional sites, at an estimated cost of €1 billion. To help ease congestion, a wave of investment has been going into upgrading the grid’s capacity to distribute electricity. Much of this cost has been shouldered by Irish households, adding an average of roughly €100 per family to the bills in 2024.\n\nYet most of this newly created grid capacity was not used to electrify homes, rail, heat pumps, or industry. It was hoarded by data center developers. Ireland had limited rules governing priority access to grid connections, so hyperscalers simply booked capacity years in advance, effectively shutting out other users. For instance, a grid connection originally planned to serve new housing in Castlebaggot, West Dublin, was instead allocated to data centers.\n\nThe CRU suggested this trend was threatening the country’s broader targets for decarbonization and housing development: “The potential level of data center demand could significantly impact [the grid’s] ability to accommodate demand connections required to support Government policy targets such as 550,000 new homes by 2040, 680,000 heat pumps and 945,000 EVs [Electric Vehicles] by 2030, major electrified rail projects explicitly identified in the National Development Plan and other social infrastructure.”\n\nIreland is one of the most fossil fuel-reliant economies in Europe. “About 80% of all the energy we use today for our homes, our heating, our appliances, and our industry comes from fossil fuels,” says Paul Deane, senior lecturer in Clean Energy Futures at University College Cork.\n\nNevertheless, tech firms continued to portray themselves as green-transition partners — largely through Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs). These allow companies to claim renewable electricity procurement on paper even when their facilities draw from the grid’s fossil-fuel-heavy mix in practice. Europe-wide, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are the three largest buyers.\n\nData from RE-Source suggests most CPPAs signed in Ireland are either financial – that is, not based on physical power delivery to the buyer – or structured in a way that has not been publicly disclosed. Only 14% are confirmed to involve a direct physical connection between the generator and the off-taker. The sources consulted for this investigation suggest the majority of these CPPAs match electricity on an annual basis rather than hour by hour.\n\nThe result is a widening gulf between corporate sustainability claims and actual, system-wide decarbonization.\n\nThese contradictions can be seen clearly in the Midlands where Bord na Móna’s planned Eco Energy Park will co-locate future Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers with renewable-energy infrastructure. AWS is aiming to contract up to 800 MW of new wind and solar generation from Bord na Móna’s wider project pipeline — a volume of electricity roughly equivalent to the annual consumption of 2.2 million Irish homes. But so far, just 105 MW has been secured through a CPPA linking a proposed new AWS site to a nearby wind farm. Whenever the wind drops, any data centers built at the site will still draw power from the national grid, including fossil-fuel generated electricity.\n\nTo guarantee stability, Bord na Móna has already applied for a 600 MW gas plant adjacent to the site, which it claims will later switch to hydrogen or biomethane, according to the company’s environmental impact assessment report. No credible pathway exists to supply these fuels at this scale.\n\n“Renewable energy only helps meet our legally binding carbon budgets if it replaces fossil fuel demand, ” says Hannah Daly, Professor of Sustainable Energy at University College Cork. “If there was evidence that data centers were financing projects that wouldn’t otherwise have been built and that would match their demand at all hours of the year without creating bottlenecks for other renewables, they would at least not harm our carbon budgets.\"\n\nAnalysis conducted by AlgorithmWatch and Tech Policy Press, drawing on tech majors’ sustainability reports and press releases, suggests the total announced new capacity brought online via CPPAs with data centers in Ireland is far behind the pressure that data center expansion has already put on the energy system. Even if all announced CPPAs come online, they will still fall behind the load that has already been imposed on the system.\n\nIn a paper commissioned by FOE Ireland, Professor Daly found that half of the new capacity came from CPPAs, as opposed to government-run auctions, between 2020 and 2023. But this volume only amounted to 16% of the new data center demand during this period. Daly’s findings mirror our own. Despite industry claims of 100% renewable procurement, Ireland’s data centers in aggregate have seemingly deepened the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nYet regulators have limited power to intervene. Out of fear for the country’s energy security, the Irish government has promised to spend more on its fossil fuel infrastructure, beginning construction of a state-led strategic gas emergency reserve. The reserve will take the form of a floating LNG (liquefied natural gas) tanker and regasification plant, with an estimated upfront cost of between €300 and €900 million.\n\nMeanwhile, developers are increasingly turning to on-site gas generation to circumvent grid constraints entirely. Microsoft’s Grange Castle campus in Dublin has a fleet of gas generators totaling 239 MW. The site is one of seven with existing gas connections, five of which are currently actively consuming gas. Analysis by Hannah Daly from Cork’s University College suggests an additional four sites are awaiting connection and 22 have submitted planning requests.\n\nDaly shows that if existing, pending, and proposed gas-connected data center sites all operate at full capacity, they would emit up to 16.6 MtCO₂ per year — equivalent to 68% of Ireland’s total national emissions in 2023. She notes that Gas Network Ireland’s own, more conservative estimates, still predict an overshoot on sectoral emissions targets by 21-30%, driven by existing and confirmed on-site gas connections respectively.\n\nGas Networks Ireland and several private actors see this gas demand as a temporary, transitional problem as the network switches over to low-carbon hydrogen and bio-methane. Daly’s colleague Paul Deane remains sceptical. “Some data-center owners say they’ll only use gas for a few years, but there’s no convincing evidence of an off-ramp,” he says. “The promise of a technology in the future, isn't good enough to allow you to burn more natural gas today.”\n\nThese various interlinked problems have come to the fore in the discussions of the new Large Energy Users (LEU) Connection Policy. Expected to be finalized before the end of the year by the CRU, the policy will set out new rules for how data centers connect to the grid. The policy’s main goals are to improve grid stability, ensure sufficient on-site or nearby generation capacity, and strengthen emissions reporting.\n\nHowever, in the draft text, the CRU concedes that it will not receive enforcement powers to mandate renewable procurement, emissions caps, or set requirements for the decarbonization of the gas network.\n\nThe specialists interviewed said this reflects a broader pattern: rather than confronting the political trade-offs between digital growth and sustainability, the Irish government has deferred control to regulators tasked with managing that growth as smoothly as possible. The LEU policy, critics say, is the latest example of this deference to regulatory authority.\n\n“Ireland’s climate legislation directly conflicts with several of our enterprise strategies. There’s a lack of acceptance that it’s impossible to reconcile the constraints of carbon emission targets with what’s necessary for the growth of this industry via technological measures alone,” Daly says. “The right technologies and supply measures would need to be put in place ahead of the growth of the industry, not afterwards.”\n\nRosi Leonard, a data‑center campaigner for Friends of the Earth Ireland, argues that the government overestimates the sector’s mobility: companies are unlikely to abandon existing infrastructure in Ireland, even under stricter regulations, and any departure would indicate the need for broader economic diversification.\n\nThe Irish case has seen a consistent pattern: tech-sector growth is treated as inevitable, while climate obligations are accommodated around it. Managing the strained infrastructure comes at the cost of rising emissions and deferred decarbonization - a lesson that other countries facing rapid digital expansion will soon have to confront.\n\nIreland’s experience is no longer a local anomaly. The EU’s AI Continent Action Plan proposes tripling data center capacity by 2030 to support continent-wide AI deployment, cloud services, and high-performance computing. But the plan does not resolve the fundamental challenges that Ireland is now experiencing: scarce grid capacity, fossil fuel lock-in, insufficient transmission infrastructure, and potential social pressures caused by rising energy prices.\n\nThe EU also risks repeating one of Ireland’s biggest mistakes on renewable energy. Its plan to use public funds to de-risk long-term contracts for hyperscale data centers — through agreements linking governments, utilities and tech firms — could end up funneling taxpayers’ money into deals that let companies claim that they use renewable electricity without actually cutting emissions.\n\nEurope still has time to avoid these pitfalls. Countries planning to host hyperscale clusters should ensure sufficient energy capacity before data centers are built; block direct fossil-gas connections; enforce 24/7 renewable matching; and plan for the availability of clean power for critical public services and housing, rather than ring-fencing new renewables for the tech sector through CPPAs.\n\nThe Irish case shows what happens when digital expansion outruns energy planning, and when political dependency on a small group of firms overrides climate commitments. The costs - higher prices, deeper fossil lock-in, strained infrastructure, and derailed emissions targets - are now visible across the country, while access for homes, transport and essential infrastructure remains a low priority. The EU can treat Ireland as a cautionary tale, or repeat its mistakes on a continental scale.",

    "fullText": "A report from Reuters claims that scientists in China have created a prototype of a machine that could eventually be used to produce semiconductor chips capable of powering artificial intelligence. Sources told the publication that a team in Shenzhen completed the prototype of an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine earlier this year and it is allegedly now undergoing testing. The EUV machine was reportedly made by former engineers from Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML. Reuters states that China is targeting production of its own EUV chips beginning in 2028, although other experts have projected 2030 as a more likely date.\n\nEUV is a supremely complicated bit of technology; we have an explainer below that gets into some of the details. It is at the heart of the chips made by companies such as Intel and TSMC, so any company trying to compete would also need access to EUV. Although the Chinese prototype is not yet making chips, it is reportedly able to generate the extreme ultraviolet light needed for chip manufacturing.\n\nIf confirmed, this development would put China in control of tech much sooner than analysts had previously expected. To date, EUV has largely been kept out of reach by Western companies and used as a bargaining chip by the US government. Chinese President Xi Jinping has placed a high priority on the country being able to produce its own semiconductors. \"The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,\" a source told Reuters. \"China wants the United States 100 percent kicked out of its supply chains.\"",

    "fullText": "Cisco has decided its homegrown AI models are ready to power its products, starting with its Duo Identity Intelligence offering.\n\nThe model Cisco will use is called “Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct”. As described on the Hugging Face model-mart, it’s an open-weight, 8-billion-parameter instruction-tuned “Auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture,” namely Meta Llama-3.1-8B backbone.\n\nCisco tuned the model for cybersecurity applications and optimized it for three uses:\n\nIn a Tuesday post, Cisco revealed it’s using the model with Duo Identity Intelligence, a service that analyzes who logs on to networks, where they log on from, and which devices they use.\n\n“By examining post authentication signals, the system identifies patterns that traditional access controls often miss, including unusual geographic activity, abnormal privilege usage, and indications of MFA fatigue attempts or session hijacking,” Cisco explained.\n\nThe product alerts users to potential identity issues in a weekly email digest that Cisco will now compose with help from its new model.\n\n“Producing such a digest requires an artificial intelligence model that understands identity behavior, can interpret long chains of events, and communicates insights in a way that aligns with how security administrators make decisions,” Cisco’s post states, adding that general-purpose models “are not always tuned for the nuance and precision required for identity security and often introduce external dependencies.”\n\nUsing its own model, Cisco says, will deliver “summaries that are more accurate, more readable, and more aligned with real security workflows.”\n\nThe company also says the content of the digests will become “noticeably stronger … clearer and more consistent. Prioritization improves, making it easier to identify what demands immediate attention. Insights feel more relevant to each environment, and recommendations are expressed in a more actionable way.” Cisco reckons you’ll therefore end up using Identity Intelligence more often, because the model will produce info that demands action.\n\nThe improved digest is the result of collaboration between the teams that develop Duo and Cisco’s foundation models.\n\n“Both groups created a tuned prompt stack that significantly improved output quality and aligned the model with the analytical style expected in the digest,” Cisco’s post states.\n\nOver 2,000 Cisco customers receive the digest. If you’re one of them, let us know if the weekly email has improved!\n\nThe model can run on-prem or in the cloud, and do much more than write nice email digests. Cisco says its downstream uses include:\n\nIn early November, Cisco told The Register it’s working on a 17-billion parameter foundation model, and “a whole phalanx” of other AI. Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct seems to come from the phalanx, as while it is a foundation model it is nine billion parameters short of the forthcoming model Cisco mentioned.®",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "fullText": "Dec 17 (Reuters) - Oracle said talks for an equity deal to support its Michigan data center project remain on schedule and do ​not include Blue Owl Capital, after a report of stalled negotiations with the crucial ‌partner knocked its shares down 5% on Wednesday.\n\nThe more than 1-gigawatt project in Saline Township, Michigan, is part of the ‌Stargate AI infrastructure push by Oracle and OpenAI. Oracle said in late October that construction is slated to begin in early 2026.\n\nBlue Owl, Oracle's largest data center partner, had been in talks to back the $10 billion deal but failed to reach agreement on terms that matched those of other projects ⁠it had already committed to, a ‌source familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe project's existing leases and debt terms were less favorable than those Blue Owl structured in its other Oracle deals, ‍the source said, requesting anonymity because the talks were private.\n\nInvestors have scrutinized Oracle's AI infrastructure build-out in recent weeks as its debt climbs and its fortunes become increasingly tied to OpenAI. The ChatGPT maker, valued at ​about $500 billion, loses money and has not detailed how it would finance plans to spend more ‌than $1 trillion on infrastructure by 2030.\n\nOracle shares have fallen about 40% since mid-September, erasing gains from a rally sparked by its announcement of nearly $455 billion in booked cloud orders, most tied to OpenAI.\n\nThe stock has fallen 15% since last week's earnings report, which raised concerns about the payoff from its AI push.\n\n\"Our development partner, Related Digital, selected the best equity partner from a competitive ⁠group of options, which in this instance was not ​Blue Owl,\" an Oracle spokesperson said, declining to name the ​new partner or provide further details.\n\n\"We expect full construction to begin in the first quarter 2026 and to deliver the project on schedule,\" a Related Digital ‍representative said, adding the project ⁠drew \"significant\" interest from equity partners and that the firm evaluated all options.\n\nOracle has not signed a deal with a new backer, according to the Financial Times, which first reported ⁠the development.\n\nBlackstone Group has held talks as a potential financial partner but has not committed to invest, the report ‌said.\n\nBlackstone did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "Another day, another update that's giving investors anxiety about the AI trade.\n\nThe US tech sector was under pressure on Wednesday as traders took in a report from The Financial Times that said Blue Owl Capital wouldn't back a $10 billion data center the company was planning to build in Michigan for OpenAI.\n\nOracle shares led the broader market lower, falling as much as 6% Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed more than 1%.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly around 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday:\n\nHere were the other notable moves in the market:\n\nThe latest developments extend a broader rotation out of the market's most expensive tech stocks and into other parts of the market.\n\nThe enthusiasm for AI has dampened particularly in the past week, Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Additionally, rotation pressure out of tech has accelerated, with positioning data showing rising demand for smaller-cap and value stocks,\" Turnquist said of the latest market moves.\n\nThe FT's report said that talks between Oracle and Blue Owl Capital stalled over the planned data center. The private credit firm will not move forward with funding the project due to concerns about Oracle's hefty AI spending and growing debts, sources told the outlet.\n\nOracle disputed the contents of the FT report.\n\n\"The FT story is incorrect. Our development partner, Related Digital, selected the best equity partner from a competitive group of options, which in this instance was not Blue Owl. Final negotiations for their equity deal are moving forward on schedule and according to plan,\" Michael Egbert, a spokesperson for Oracle, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for the AI trade, but particularly for Oracle. After impressing investors with an aggressive revenue forecast, the stock has declined steadily in the last two months as the company stokes more concerns about the large amounts of debt coursing through the AI space. Shares are down 45% from their peak in early September.\n\nOracle recently triggered another sell-off in tech after reporting lower-than-expected earnings and pledging to increase its capital expenditures more than expected in the coming year.\n\nCoreWeave is the other prominent tech name to join Oracle recently as a poster child of investors' growing anxieties about the health of the AI trade. Similar to Oracle, CoreWeave has spooked investors with its high debt load and reliance on a handful of customers. As of Wednesday afternoon, the stock is down 66% from its post-IPO high reached in June.",

    "description": "'Digital worker' is, in fact, a fitting neologism for the AI agent...",
    "fullText": "Hey AI Agent Developer - yes, you. What is the value you create? Let's find out.\n\nThe Skeptic's Take: Useful vs. Intelligent\n\nOn the spectrum of \"Is AI intelligent and able to reason?\", I fall on the skeptical side. But is it useful? Absolutely. We have built a few AI workflows, and they have unlocked superior automation. Evidently, the world is currently witnessing the transformative potential of AI agents in customer support and coding, to some degree.\n\nTake customer support, for instance. If AI agents help each support employee handle 30% more tickets, that's like adding 30 new hires to a 100-person team, without the cost. For a $100M company, this efficiency gain could translate to $20-30M in additional enterprise value (EV), under sweeping assumptions. The difference in EV between pre- and post-AI agents is the Value you create. Alternatively, one could also use operating income for a flow perspective.\n\n'Digital worker' is, in fact, a fitting neologism for the AI agent. I take the view here that human workers, together with digital workers, can do more, creating abundance. As AI agent developers, we should be asking:\n\nOutcomes Matter. Internals Don't.\n\nThere are two parts to our first question: First, what an AI agent or a workflow does internally, for instance, the number of reasoning steps involved, is irrelevant. However, measuring outcomes such as the number of support tickets resolved or the number of successful hires is directly proportional to the value we want to measure. Second, what share do we take? Simply going by the 10x rule of SaaS pricing guidelines, we can claim one-tenth of what we measured. Thus, measuring outcomes becomes imperative. We have built Valmi to ingest outcomes as the first step. The added complexity that Valmi addresses is where legacy billing systems sputter.\n\nWhy Legacy Billing Systems Don't Cut It\n\nLet's start with the cost argument. Building AI systems is expensive. There are ineffective paths in workflows and autonomous agents that simply fail. LLM costs hit COGS linearly, whereas the marginal cost in traditional SaaS systems is negligible. SaaS generates ~70% gross margins. While cost is an important element in the case of AI agents, legacy systems, such as Stripe and Zuora, are inadequate to capture it.\n\nSecondly, the pricing model. The seat-based model works against selling AI agents, since the seat-based model is under attack from two forces. One is the decrease in the number of human workers required. By pricing against seats, you are setting your AI agents up for decline, not for growth. The other is worse: It does not capture the human-equivalent value, as discussed above. Even the usage-based models that legacy systems support do not distinguish between activity and outcomes.\n\nTo effectively price AI agents, we need to measure outcomes, and observe and allocate costs. To evaluate margin contraction, we also need to understand where outcomes and costs diverge, including in aggregate, for which agents and for which customer instances. Therefore, the top AI agent developers who use outcome-billing, such as Harvey, Sierra and Usepropane, put together two sources: one to track cost information and the other to measure value. And they unified these two sources of information in a single system. Valmi helps you do that very easily. You can bring up the whole billing infrastructure on your premises. We have made it available under a permissive license. No need to do it yourself.\n\nThe Unreliability Problem (And How to Sell Despite It)\n\nOutcome measurement serves a greater purpose. AI is unreliable and not deterministic. We simply do not understand when it succeeds and when it fails. Consequently, it is incumbent upon the buyer of your AI agents to demand proof of value. It is simply easier for you to convince and onboard buyers if you switch to outcome-billing. Why? You assume the risk of failure of your AI agents. But, the buyer simply pays for agent's performance and pays nothing for its failure. To prove the value and help you convince your buyers, Valmi supports customer dashboards that show outcomes such as ticket resolution percentage. Your buyers can view and embed these dashboards in their workflows.\n\nTo sum it up, we have built Valmi, and made available open-source SDKs and free to deploy packages, to address the imperative for your AI agents. It solves outcome-billing that provides proof of value and cost tracking that exposes margin contraction. It lets you simulate and set prices for your AI agents and quickly onboard your customers. We understand hybrid models, combining seat-based, activity and outcomes, will be required in the transitory phase of billing models. Valmi supports all of these as well. Try it out for free or deploy it within your premises.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to put a halt to the multi-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure buildout — at least for now.\n\nIn a video posted to social media on Tuesday, the Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate said he would begin pushing for a national moratorium on the construction of AI data centers.\n\nHe argued that AI, which he called one of the most \"transformative technologies in the history of humanity,\" is moving too rapidly for lawmakers and citizens to keep up.\n\n\"This moratorium will give democracy a chance to catch up with the transformative changes that we are witnessing and make sure that the benefits of these technologies work for all of us, not just the wealthiest people on Earth,\" Sanders said.\n\nWhile Sanders is not the only AI critic on Capitol Hill, his planned proposal would go further than most. He is likely the first national politician to call for a moratorium on the construction of data centers, which are the primary infrastructure needed to support the expansion of AI.\n\nMajor tech firms like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Apple have collectively spent hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 on capital expenditures — much of it going toward the chips, servers, and data centers that form the backbone of the AI boom. And they've told investors that they expect to spend even more AI spending in 2026.\n\n\"This process is moving very, very quickly, and we need to slow it down,\" Sanders said. \"We need all of our people, all of our people involved in determining the future of AI, and not just a handful of multi-billionaires.\"\n\nI will be pushing for a moratorium on the construction of data centers that are powering the unregulated sprint to develop & deploy AI.\n\nThe moratorium will give democracy a chance to catch up, and ensure that the benefits of technology work for all of us, not just the 1%. pic.twitter.com/PoV5ziA4oQ\n\nThe Democratic socialist senator listed three major reasons for slowing down the advancement of AI: the fact that it's being promoted by wealthy tech titans, the potential for AI-driven job losses, and the technology's impact on human interaction.\n\n\"Think for a moment about a future when human beings are not interacting with each other and are spending virtually all of their time with devices instead of people,\" Sanders said. \"Is that the kind of future you want? Well, not me.\"\n\nAt this point, it's unlikely that Sanders's vision comes to fruition.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has taken the opposite path, encouraging the rapid construction of data centers in a bid to win the AI race with China.\n\nBut skepticism of AI is continuing to grow on Capitol Hill, with some lawmakers warning about a potential AI bubble and others aiming to limit minors' use of AI chatbots.",

    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence is driving a shift in what companies look for in new hires.\n\nWhile experience has always been a key factor for job seekers, education level matters less and less compared to skill set, enabling companies to \"expand their talent pipelines and keep pace with roles that evolve faster than traditional education can,\" says Lauren Winans, CEO at human resources consulting firm Next Level Benefits.\n\nAI is accelerating the trend, as more organizations seek data science, machine learning, data analytics, and related skills — skills that you essentially learn through doing and repetition, not by going to class.\n\nIndeed, several companies, including Google and IBM, have dropped their degree requirements for some roles in favor of skills-based hiring.\n\nPlus, a quarter of employers said they planned to stop requiring bachelor's degrees this year, instead prioritizing relevant experience, according to a 2025 ResumeTemplates survey of 1,000 US hiring managers.\n\nSkills-based hiring is an \"operational necessity,\" as organizations adopt AI initiatives and require staff to design, build, and manage AI systems and processes, says Anthony Donnarumma, CEO of the recruiting agency 24 Seven.\n\nPlus, relying on skills over degrees reduces the time it takes to fill roles and improves productivity because applicants are \"job-ready,\" he says.\n\nIt also helps organizations remain agile and adapt to changing demands, adds Lisa Highfield, principal director of research and advisory services at McLean & Company, an HR research and consulting firm.\n\nA skills-based approach creates new opportunities for employees, too, Highfield says. It can increase workforce diversity and create paths for career advancement, Winans adds.\n\n\"Workers are able to compete on the value of their skills — not their resume format or educational history — which can lead to better job matches, higher engagement, and longer-term career growth,\" Donnarumma says.\n\nAt the other end, AI-based screening and hiring tools are offering companies ways to automate skill-based hiring, says Kara Ayers, senior vice president of global talent acquisition for Xplor Technologies, a payment and commerce software company that's already made the shift, prioritizing skills, experience, and potential over college degrees in its new hires — and using AI to do it.\n\nXplor Technologies began using the AI-powered applicant tracking system SmartRecruiters in 2022 to help them organize and classify the skills needed for each role, Ayers says.\n\n\"These tools allow us to analyze resumes and profiles for competencies rather than filtering by degree, and we use AI-driven predictive analytics to match candidates based on skills alignment and potential,\" she explains.\n\nSince adopting this approach, Ayers says the company has reduced its reliance on recruiting agencies, saving about $3 million. It also fills roles faster — often in under 30 days, compared to more than 60 days in the past — and has improved the quality of new hires, who are now better matched to a role's competencies.\n\nThat said, using AI to review applicants based on skills depends on organizations having \"a clean, well-structured framework, consistent job architecture, reliable performance data, and HR systems that can integrate skills analytics into hiring workflows,\" Winans says.\n\nThey also need data showing the skills they already have and what they need for the future, Highfield says. And historical workforce data showing how people succeed within the company, Donnarumma adds.\n\nTransitioning to skills-based hiring can be time and resource-intensive, Highfield says. Leadership teams also may need to rethink their traditional hiring practices and beliefs about the value of degrees, Donnarumma says.\n\nAI gives companies tools to build a process that's \"more accurate, more inclusive, and far more aligned with the future of work,\" Donnarumma says.\n\nHowever, AI bias remains a \"real concern,\" he says. Organizations must incorporate governance into AI-driven hiring, including ensuring team members understand AI and can manage its use effectively and objectively.\n\nAyers says it's crucial to highlight the benefits of AI while also emphasizing governance.\n\n\"It is important to be thoughtful about how AI is used and to thoroughly vet the tools in place,\" she says. \"Both candidates and companies should maintain authenticity and find the right balance in how much they rely on AI.\"",

    "description": "A professor says colleges risk losing autonomy as AI deals and corporate agendas shape teaching, assessment, and how students learn to think.",
    "fullText": "Universities risk surrendering their intellectual autonomy to Silicon Valley's influence as they rush to adopt AI, one professor says.\n\nIn an essay for the Civics of Technology Project — an education platform analyzing technology's societal impact — Bruna Damiana Heinsfeld, an assistant professor of learning technologies at the University of Minnesota, said that colleges are allowing Big Tech to reshape what counts as knowledge, truth, and academic value.\n\nFrom multimillion-dollar partnerships with AI vendors to classrooms infused with corporate branding, she said, universities are shifting toward a model where technological tools are bundled with the identity of the companies behind them.\n\nAs academic leaders scramble to look \"AI-ready,\" Heinsfeld warned that the sector is drifting from critical inquiry toward compliance, risking a future in which Silicon Valley, not educators, sets the terms of learning.\n\nHeinsfeld said AI tools promote a worldview where efficiency is presumed to be a virtue, scale is inherently desirable, and data becomes the default language of truth.\n\nUniversities adopting these systems without critical examination risk teaching students that the logic of Big Tech is not merely useful but inevitable, she added.\n\nHeinsfeld pointed to California State University as an example of that shift on full display.\n\nThe university signed a $16.9 million contract in February to roll out ChatGPT Edu across 23 campuses, providing more than 460,000 students and 63,000 faculty and staff with access to the tool through mid-2026.\n\nIt hosted an AWS-powered \"AI camp\" in the summer, where students arrived to find Amazon branding everywhere, including corporate slogans, AWS notebooks, and promotional swag.\n\nAnother academic said the problem is already playing out in the day-to-day mechanics of learning.\n\nKimberley Hardcastle, a business and marketing professor at Northumbria University in the UK, told Business Insider that universities must overhaul how they design assessments now that students' \"epistemic mediators\" — the tools that help them make sense of the world — have fundamentally changed.\n\nHardcastle advocates requiring students to demonstrate their reasoning: how they arrived at a conclusion, which sources they consulted beyond AI, and how they verified information against primary evidence, she said.\n\nShe said students also need deliberate \"epistemic checkpoints,\" moments designed into coursework where they must pause and ask: \"Am I using this tool to enhance my thinking or replace it? Have I engaged with the underlying concepts or just the AI's summary? Do I understand, or am I just recalling information?\"\n\nFor Heinsfeld, the risk is that corporations will dictate what constitutes legitimate knowledge. For Hardcastle, it's that students will no longer understand how to assess truth for themselves.\n\nBoth say universities must remain the space where students are taught to think, not just how to operate tools.\n\n\"Education should remain the space where we confront the architectures of our tools,\" Heinsfeld wrote. Otherwise, \"it risks becoming the laboratory of the very systems it should critique.\"\n\nHardcastle made a similar point, adding that this future will be shaped not only by institutional decisions but by every moment a student accepts an AI-generated answer without knowing how to question it.",

Not only do they need to have coding skills, but they also must know how to operate vibecoding tools and stay up to date with new AI models.\n\nAnthropic leader Boris Cherny looks for something else: \"Side quests.\"\n\n\"When I hire engineers, this is definitely something I look for,\" he said on \"The Peterman Pod.\"\n\nCherny's definition of side quests includes \"cool weekend projects,\" like someone who's \"really into making kombucha.\" It's a sign that the engineer is curious and interested in other things, he said.\n\nMuch of Cherny's own growth came from his side projects. Cherny is now a key figure at Anthropic. He created Claude Code, a tool that is now popular with engineers across the country.\n\n\"These are well-rounded people,\" he said. \"These are the kind of people I enjoy working with.\"\n\nCherny also said he prefers that his new hires be \"generalists.\"\n\nHe gave the example of an engineer who can code, but is also able to work on product and design. That all-star engineer also seeks out user feedback.\n\n\"This is how we recruit for all functions, now,\" he said. \"Our project managers code, our data scientists code, our user researcher codes a little bit.\"\n\nCherny isn't alone in pushing for jobs to become more generalist. Figma CEO Dylan Field said in October that AI was causing job titles to merge, resulting in everyone being a \"product builder.\"\n\nWhat else is Anthropic looking for? For some time, it monitored whether candidates use AI in their applications.\n\nIn May, Business Insider reported that Anthropic asked candidates for certain jobs not to use AI in their written responses so the company could test their \"non-AI-assisted communication skills.\"\n\nAnthropic changed its policy in July, allowing candidates to seek out assistance from Claude.\n\nFor the younger engineers, a job at Anthropic may be hard to come by. In May, CPO Mike Krieger said on \"Hard Fork\" that he was focused on hiring experienced engineers — and had \"some hesitancy\" with entry-level workers.\n\nOn the podcast, Cherny said that his love of generalists came from his career trajectory. Working at startups since 18, Cherny had to do everything, he said.\n\n\"At big companies, you get forced into this particular swim lane,\" he said. \"It's just so artificial.\"",

    "title": "How ChatGPT's New Image Generator Stacks Up Against Gemini's Nano Banana Pro",
    "description": "Get ready for the battle of the next-gen AI image editors.",
    "fullText": "Following the major image editing upgrades added to Google Gemini back in August—under the whimsical codename Nano Banana—it's OpenAI's turn to supercharge the tools you get for image manipulations inside ChatGPT. The new update is called GPT Image 1.5, and is rolling out now for all users.\n\nOne of the key improvements here, as was the case with Nano Banana, is the way that ChatGPT can now edit a specific part of an image while keeping everything else consistent. You can add or remove something, or change the color or style of something, without ending up with an entirely different looking picture.\n\nAnother feature ChatGPT has now borrowed from Gemini: the ability to combine multiple images together in one scene. Want you and your best friend in front of Sydney Harbour Bridge? No problem—just supply the source pictures and the AI will do the rest. You can also change visual styles while maintaining consistent details.\n\nOpenAI says the new image editor and generator is able to follow instructions \"more reliably,\" and render pictures up to four times faster than before. Text can be more varied in style and size, and images should be more realistic and error-free in general—though OpenAI also admits there's still room for improvement.\n\nIt's the best image generator tool we've ever seen in ChatGPT, and it all looks impressive at first glance—but how does it stack up in practice against Gemini and Nano Banana? I put the two models to the test via the $20-per-month plan on both platforms (that's ChatGPT Plus and Google AI Pro, respectively) to see how they compared.\n\nOpen up ChatGPT on the web or on mobile and you'll see there's a new Images tab on the left-hand navigation pane. This takes you to a library of your existing pictures, together with some new prompts for creating images. You get some suggestions for prompts, plus an assortment of preset portrait image styles you can apply.\n\nI tested out the new GPT Image 1.5 model by getting ChatGPT to generate a busy tech journalist, a lamp in the middle of an empty warehouse, and a cartoon-style rolling landscape of hills in the fog. I then got Gemini to create the same pictures with the same prompts. While the results were pretty varied, in terms of quality and realism they were pretty equal—the occasional issue with weird physics and repetition, but nothing too bad.\n\nBoth ChatGPT and Gemini are now quite competent at clean image edits, too: Both AI bots seamlessly switched the journalist's clothing to a shirt and tie without touching any other part of the picture. This would have taken a significant amount of time to do manually, even by a Photoshop expert, and shows just how transformative AI imaging is becoming.\n\nColor changes were all handled with aplomb, but the AIs struggled a bit with perspective changes, where I asked to see the same shot from another angle. In these cases, instructions were less well-followed and the images were less consistent (as new areas needed to be rendered), though ChatGPT did a little better than Gemini at getting good results.\n\nThe classic \"remove an object from this picture\" challenge was handled with aplomb: Both Gemini and ChatGPT were able to remove a cottage from the countryside scene with surgical precision, leaving everything else intact. Again, these are the kind of time-intensive image edits that would previously have needed a lot of careful effort, and that can now be done in seconds.\n\nAnother talent ChatGPT and Gemini now have is being able to combine images together. So you can have separate photos of you and your parents, put them together in the same shot, and then add in a background of wherever you like. You can get perfect family photos without actually gathering together your relatives together or going anywhere.\n\nThis was an area where Gemini and ChatGPT did struggle a bit more: The editing dexterity was still impressive, but the results didn't always look like a single, coherent scene. Lighting is sometimes off, or elements from different images appear at different scales, and you'll have to do a bit more tweaking and editing and reprompting to get everything right.\n\nChatGPT did fare slightly better at blending different images and elements together, and changing the overall look of a picture. When I tried to get the AIs to mix all my images together in a moody film noir shot, ChatGPT produced something pretty consistent—the Gemini effort looked a lot more like a cut-and-paste job.\n\nIt can be fun remixing photos again and again—adding new people, changing the weather, moving the location—and both these bots are now capable of some rather incredible results. Remixing photos of family and friends will be popular, but it's not all that easy: With people you know, any generative AI that gets added tends to look wrong, because neither ChatGPT nor Gemini knows exactly what these people look like, how they smile, how they're built, or how they tend to stand or sit.\n\nIn terms of ChatGPT vs. Gemini, they're both at a high level now—a level that puts advanced Photoshop-style editing capabilities at everyone's fingertips. If either AI model has the edge right now, it's ChatGPT's, but there's not much in it. It's also going to be fascinating to see where these image editing capabilities go next.",

    "fullText": "Commons committee monitoring revolving door that gave jobs to George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Tony Blair\n\nWhen the billionaire chief executive of AI chipmaker Nvidia threw a party in central London for Donald Trump’s state visit in September, the power imbalance between Silicon Valley and British politicians was vividly exposed.\n\nJensen Huang hastened to the stage after meetings at Chequers and rallied his hundreds of guests to cheer on the power of AI. In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.\n\n“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.\n\nBut his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.\n\nStarmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.\n\nNot done, Huang called on to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.\n\nThis week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn Chat GPT maker Open AI hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.\n\nHe was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.\n\nThey followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that but said he was paid “extremely well”.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.\n\nTBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.\n\nThe Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is currently investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”\n\nJobs with the biggest US AI companies can be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also require comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI to inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.\n\nSelling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.\n\nBritain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.\n\nThe revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco start-up incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.\n\nCivil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year took a senior director general role in the government’s digital service.",

    "fullText": "In my six months of looking for work, I’ve found that from fake ads to AI screening software, the search is more soul-destroying than ever\n\nAs I apply for yet another job, I look at the company’s website for context. I’ve now read their “what we do” section four or five times, and I have a problem – I can’t figure out what they do. There are two possibilities here. One: they don’t know what they do. Two: what they do is so pointless and embarrassing that they dare not spell it out in plain English. “We forge marketing systems at the forefront of the online wellness space” translates to something like “we use ChatGPT to sell dodgy supplements”.\n\nBut understanding what so many businesses actually do is the least of my worries. I’m currently among the 5% of Brits who are unemployed. In my six months of job hunting, my total lack of success has begun to make me question my own existence. Just like when you repeat a word over and over until it loses all meaning, when you apply repeatedly for jobs in a similar field, the semantics of the entire situation begin to fall apart like a snotty tissue. About one in five of my job applications elicit a rejection email, usually bemoaning the sheer number of “quality applicants” for the position. For the most part, though – nothing. It’s almost like the job never existed in the first place, and it’s possible that it didn’t.\n\nIn 2024, 40% of companies posted listings for “ghost jobs”, nonexistent positions advertised to create the illusion that the company is doing well enough to take on new employees. And this seems like an all-too-easy way to lie about your success. Regulation of job ads is mostly the remit of the Advertising Standards Authority, which – in all its might – has the power to … have a misleading job ad taken down. So with no particularly harsh consequences for employers, why not go on a pretend hiring spree? Ethics in the job market seem to have gone out the window, and the idea of wasting the time of thousands of hapless jobseekers doesn’t seem to matter much.\n\nEven if the job you’re applying for exists, next comes the hurdle of the AI HR bot. While it’s difficult to find any hard data on just how many employers are using AI to filter applications (sometimes favouring men over women, if a now-scrapped algorithm used by Amazon is anything to go by), articles and Reddit threads about how to game the bots and get in the right “key words” now abound. According to an Atlantic article from earlier this year: “Young people are using ChatGPT to write their applications; HR is using AI to read them; no one is getting hired.” And let’s say your CV and cover letter do make it past the robot gatekeepers, it’s possible that your interview will be conducted by yet another bot. Although I haven’t had the pleasure of an interview, AI or otherwise, since I began my latest job search, the possibility of not coming into contact with a single human during most of the process to becoming the dodgy supplements social media marketing manager looms large and dreadful.\n\nWhile this scramble for jobs is mostly being framed as a problem for graduates, I can confirm – as someone who graduated 15 years ago bang into a recession – not only is this the worst job market I’ve ever seen, but it’s also impacting people like me with many years’ experience. During my last period of job hunting, about three years ago, I was at least getting interviews. Interviews with humans, to boot. Given all the skilled people I know who can’t seem to land interviews for even entry-level positions, I’m certain that I’m not an outlier. I’m also convinced that we’re facing a crisis in which middle-class jobs have mutated into rare and disturbing beasts.\n\nWhen, according to its job ad, an indie pet food company called something like Flopsies is looking for a “rock star” and a “unicorn” to revolutionise its social media presence, you know that the job market has become high on its own farts. Ill-defined franken-jobs, requiring everything from SEO expertise to video-editing skills (all for a salary of £27,000 and free protein bars that taste like hay) require cult-like dedication. First, you must convince the fine people at Flopsies that it has been your dream since exiting your mother’s birth canal to sell pet food. You would cut off your own hands for the privilege, and quickly learn to write copy for them by smashing your face into a keyboard. You will convey this in a 400-word cover letter, written in your own blood. This cover letter will then be redirected into the ether by an AI filter, because you didn’t use the phrase “optimising algorithmic relevancy” in it. You will never hear from Flopsies again. You will start this process again and repeat it until you are seen fit for an interview in which you have a few minutes to convince a bot that you’re fit for purpose as both a worker and a human being.\n\nThe hiring process has become so mechanised, both figuratively and literally, that it’s hard to believe that the people who end up being hired aren’t merely the best at gaming the system. And frankly, all power to them. It’s no skin off my nose if the dodgy supplement or pet-food jobs go to people who are incredible at creating the illusion that they live and breathe pet food and/or dodgy supplements. But in this oh-so-streamlined process, what happens to those of us who can’t or won’t play the game? Of all the applications I’ve sent out recently, I wonder how many have been looked at by humans. There’s only so much shouting into the void about your ability to use a CMS you can do before you give up and start Googling things like: “Can I sell a kidney on Vinted?”\n\nEleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and Diva",

    "fullText": "Family members can be sweet and relentless but how can we aid our relatives in the age of new tech and device addiction\n\nDon’t get The Long Wave delivered to your inbox? \nI don’t want to sound dramatic but, a few weeks ago, something happened that has completely changed how I view online material. I fell for AI-generated content. For someone who is constantly squabbling with older relatives about how little they question what they see online, this was a profoundly unsettling and humbling experience. And it made me think about how, during this holiday period, we could all use this as an opportunity to approach those conversations with the “WhatsApp aunties” more sensitively.\n\nFrom ‘WhatsApp Aunties’ to ‘AI Aunties’\n\nI think I have the perfect sample of WhatsApp aunties. Sadly displaced from Sudan due to war, a permanently online group of women, some direct aunts, some not, but all aunties nonetheless, sit in a control room of sorts in their different cities and send out daily broadcasts that simulate as much as possible the interactions and updates they would have shared had they still been living in the same place. They even have office hours. One can divine the start of the day in their respective locations as they clock in and the forwards begin: First, it is morning greetings, maybe an embellished picture of Quranic verses or a graphic of flowers, wishing you a good day.\n\nThen, the hardcore stuff. Snippets of videos from war zones back home, clipped debates between political antagonists, and sometimes entire YouTube episodes of interviews. After this news shift comes the lighter one (secretly my favourite): TikTok and Instagram reels of Arab celebrities with too much plastic surgery accompanied by scream emojis, footage from family and friend weddings across the world, captioned with love heart eyes. The stream is interspersed with the longest voice memos you will ever receive, asking how you are and telling you how they are with an introductory and concluding prayer session. It is sweet and relentless.\n\nAll of this is dumped with an abandon that suggests no understanding of or respect for phone memory limitations. Whenever my mother casually mentions that her phone is acting up and mutters something about no space, my heart sinks. I know that hours and hours of deletions of grainy videos are upon me. But most galling is how much fake content it includes. The WhatsApp aunties have become AI aunties. This was frankly a problem even before AI became so sophisticated, but it is now much, much worse. There is the harmless stuff; cats hugging babies or penguins feeding themselves with cutlery. I try not to get too agitated by this or point out that it’s fake. But when it’s videos of Taylor Swift endorsing the pro-Palestine movement, it’s impossible to let it slide.\n\nThe result is a series of exchanges that are both saddening and enraging. Aunties will either take it personally, like I am disrespecting them by implying they can’t tell what’s real or not, and double down. Or they will express genuinely innocent beliefs in the veracity of online content, imbuing the internet with the same standards of TV or radio they grew up with.\n\nTelling the aunties that something is entirely fake is like asking them to imagine a TV news broadcast is not real. Also, they are actually receiving news broadcast clips on their phones that are not real. You end up sounding like the crazy one, trying to explain that a living, breathing, walking, talking person is just pixels generated from prompts.\n\nIn a recent episode of Subway Takes, comedian Ola Labib said we shouldn’t try to convince elders that AI content isn’t real. Her argument: Let them have their little comforts. I kind of get that, what harm is it doing really? But there is an emotional element to it as well. Policing elders’ content feels to me like a manifestation of a deep-seated fear that they’re losing it, that their faculties are waning, as they succumb to old age and the bewildering assaults of new tech and device addiction. I think it is truly distressing for people to see parents and relatives increasingly become addicted to their phones and become slightly addled, a window into a sort of premature senility.\n\nBut there are social and political reasons too, for pushing back. Aunties (and, to a lesser degree, uncles) have a huge amount of disseminative power and a lot of free time. They wield a formidable authority, particularly in diaspora communities, both as enforcers of values, as organisers and sponsors of social events, and generally as gatekeepers of community interactions and upholders of norms. Collectively and individually, they are forces to be reckoned with, which makes disagreements even more challenging and fraught with risks of falling foul of powerful elders. But they are force multipliers in terms of spreading fake content that is politically inflammatory or conspiratorial, and when unchallenged, they contribute to the general degradation of the information ecosystem and its associated political fallout.\n\nSo, I would say talk to them, keep talking to them, but do it kindly, with time and explanation, rather than frustration and bewilderment. Maybe just acknowledge the content first before pointing out its fakery – a “really cool!” followed a little while later with a “actually, do you think that’s real? I’m not sure”. Also, furnish them with the “tells”: video glitches, lack of shadows, weird blinking. Bear in mind what the world looks like to them. It is a place that is changing too rapidly to assimilate how it is happening. Our elders are also, simply, getting older. With that comes all sorts of uncertainties and unsettlement; loneliness, loss of identity as work is retired from, and children age out of parenting. Exacerbating that are the vast distances that now often separate elders from their kin and peers. Online content and its constant exchange are about so much more than sharing information; it is a new language, almost phatic, for trying to connect.\n\nRemember that the tech is evolving so quickly that even the most savvy have to be vigilant. I now have to be on alert after admiring a song with album cover art, a music video, a richly talented singer and fantastic accompanying chorus. After days of trying to hunt down the artist, I was thunderstruck to find out it was all AI. It will happen to all of us. Welcome me to the aunties brigade. Please be kind. Break it to me gently.",

    "fullText": "AI promises to have far-reaching effects in music-making. While some welcome it as a compositional tool, many have deep concerns. Here are some of your responses\n\nAI-generated music is flooding streaming platforms, and it seems to be here to stay. Last month, three AI songs reached the highest spots on Spotify and Billboard charts. Jorja Smith’s label has called for her to receive a share of royalties from a song thought to have trained its original AI-generated vocals on her catalogue, which were later re-recorded by a human singer.\n\nWith this in mind, we asked for your thoughts on music composed by AI, the use of AI as a tool in the creation of music, and what should be done to protect musicians. Here are some of your responses.\n\nI have already found AI songs being added into jazz playlists and “radio stations” on Spotify. There was one song I actually liked, so I did some digging and found out it was a group with a generic name that had around three to five albums all released in 2025. Then I noticed the next track and the track followed the same path. It was really irksome. History, I hope, shows that people do value human flaws in art. Sometimes it helps us feel seen or not alone. I don’t understand how a completely computer-generated sound based on what’s come before could do that. Then again, some people fall in love with LLMs. I just think everything should be labelled somehow. Give people the choice. Make sure there are protections in place like forcing social feeds and music platforms to give consumers the ability to filter out AI-generated content. Casey, 37, Chicago, US\n\nThere’s no heart in music generated entirely by AI, and encouraging it is hurting the livelihoods of musicians. It is also very important not to call music made by AI “composed”. That word gives AI prompters far more credit and muddies the waters as to what composition is. The only people served by AI music are companies like Spotify, and major record labels who would no doubt rather not have to pay artists at all.\n\nAs for working with AI, I once recorded an album with my band and lost the stem tracks before we finished the final mix, but we were able to use an AI tool that could isolate certain instruments in the masters and boost them to get the mix we wanted. That seems to me an example of positive AI usage, and something that wouldn’t have been possible before AI. A composer like Ben Nobuto is also an example of someone who has used AI as a starting point for building real, human music. It’s probably too late now, but all musicians with work on streaming sites should probably have been paid as their work was likely used as training data. Additionally, musicians should be able to opt out of their work being used to train LLMs just like cookies on a website. Jon, 30, musician and music teacher, Switzerland\n\nI believe music needs a human component to be of any value. Music composed by AI has, from what I have heard, a big problem with simplistic or visible lyrics and a lack of emotional content.\n\nBut I am happy with musicians using AI as a tool. It brings professional quality recordings to those unable to hire a studio, orchestra or vocalist and so on. I have been writing songs for decades – in the 80s I couldn’t afford a Portastudio (four-track cassette recorder), so I used two single-track machines instead to play and record simultaneously. Now I can upload my songs to Suno (a generative AI program) and create new arrangements of them close to my original intention. It is great to be able to write for voices other than my own. Even so, some of my family and friends tell me they prefer my original versions. Mike Lee, 67, ex-photographer and teacher, Southampton\n\nAI-generated music is a copyright nightmare and is stopping creativity. We don’t have to accept it, and we don’t have to use it. The most irksome thing is non-creatives believing themselves to be artists, using AI to create and claiming it as their own art, when it’s an amalgamation of stolen work. Not sculpted with their own hands, not conceived in their own minds. Frankly, I find it embarrassing when someone proudly declares using it. Artists are already marginalised, but there is a kickback against, for example, TV slop, and a growing demand for audiences – in all forms – to not be treated like idiots. Artists are the answer to this, not AI.\n\nIf you can harness it to your advantage as an assistive tool, then by all means use it. The danger is to become reliant on AI. There should be a clear payment scheme, similar to PRS and PPL where AI shows exactly which items have been used to create. Or a watermark on copyrighted material. Nicole Vardon-Martin, 37, events and stage manager, Dagenham\n\nWhen social media and streaming services are flooded with digitally regurgitated stuff, it becomes harder to find the pieces with personal decisions behind them. I like knowing there’s a story behind the songs I get stuck in my head. I don’t think generative AI is the neutral tool many describe it to be, both because of its strain on the earth and because anything used by these algorithms has to come from somewhere, and keep coming, for what they chuck together to seem original.\n\nBlatantly copying someone else’s work doesn’t become “taking inspiration” because some software has mixed it around. Yes, there are musicians who use only their own work to generate “new” music, but in my opinion this is quite an insular and thoughtless way of creating. Generative AI will always, eventually, become bland without new content to sustain it, and more AI-generated work cannot fill that void. Charlotte, student, Cornwall\n\nIn my home studio I use AI to help mix and master music. I can see that it might be tempting to use an AI voice on your composition if you can’t sing – but why not go out to an open mic and see if you can find a real, living voice? Where would Burt Bacharach and Hal David be without all the brilliant singers who interpreted their songs? Who knows what a real musician will add to your music.\n\nI might be tempted to use AI to write a song but then I suspect my own musical abilities would atrophy and I would become quickly dependent on the technology. I don’t know enough about how copyright would work in these circumstances, but we need to protect human creativity and one way is to go out and see live music, commission people to write it, and to buy music directly from the artist if you can, avoiding those streaming services that pay very little and seem to be actively promoting fake artist profiles.

The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

    "fullText": "OpenAI seeking to strike latest deal in its efforts to pay for huge spending on datacentres\n\nAmazon is in talks to invest more than $10bn (£7.5bn) in OpenAI, in the latest funding deal being struck by the startup behind ChatGPT.\n\nIf it goes ahead, the market valuation of OpenAI could rise above $500bn, according to The Information, a tech news site that revealed the negotiations.\n\nAmazon, which is best known as an online retailer, is also the world’s largest datacentre provider and its investment would help OpenAI pay for its commitments to rent capacity from cloud computing companies – including Amazon.\n\nOpenAI said last month it would spend $38bn on capacity from Amazon Web Services – the company’s datacentre arm – over seven years. The Information said that OpenAI planned to use Amazon’s Trainium chips, which compete with Nvidia and Google’s chips. It also reported that Amazon’s financing could lead to a broader fundraising round with other investors.\n\nOpenAI’s spending commitment on compute – the chips and servers that power its chatbot – is $1.4tn over the next eight years, a figure far in excess of its reported $13bn in annual revenues.\n\nAs a result, the lossmaking company has been seeking further funding and has converted its main business into a for-profit corporation. Its main longtime backer, Microsoft, has taken a stake of roughly 27% in a deal that valued OpenAI at $500bn.\n\nOpenAI is also considering an initial public offering – selling its shares to the general public – in a move that could value the company at up to $1tn, according to Reuters.\n\nOther deals struck by OpenAI this year include Oracle spending $300bn on building datacentres in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI is expected to pay back roughly the same amount to use the sites.\n\nIn another transaction with Nvidia, OpenAI will pay in cash for chips and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.\n\nOpenAI announced on Tuesday that it had hired the former UK chancellor George Osborne to develop relationships with governments around the world and broker national-level AI projects.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has declared a “code red” staff alert to lead a fightback against competitors led by Google, whose update of its Gemini AI tool gave it an edge over rivals including ChatGPT.\n\nThe Amazon talks reportedly include discussing commercial opportunities and selling a corporate version of ChatGPT to the online retailer.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment. Amazon has been approached for comment.",

    "description": "Trump’s AI “Manhattan Project” will fail if DOGE cuts are kept, critics say.",
    "fullText": "Described as a “historic national effort” to “invest in AI-enabled science to accelerate scientific advancement,” Trump claimed his mission would address key challenges to American energy dominance, innovation, and national security.\n\nThis mission, Trump boasted, would be a game-changer to science akin to putting a man on the moon or firing the first nuclear weapons. By building “an integrated AI platform” trained on “the world’s largest collection” of federal scientific data sets, he promised, the government could set off cascades of scientific breakthroughs.\n\nAccess to such a platform, Trump imagined, would supercharge top US labs, powering AI agents to do tasks like quickly test hypotheses and automate research workflows to speed up discoveries.\n\nHowever, the mission crucially depends on strengthening collaboration between public, private, and academic sectors. And Trump’s order is concerningly vague on how those partnerships will be structured and funded at a time when many scientists have been sidelined due to a flurry of Trump orders earlier this year that eliminated their funding or removed them from their labs.\n\nTo critics, including scientists, policy experts, advocates, and historians, Trump’s order seems divorced from reality, given that he spent the past year attacking some of the very institutions the Genesis Mission would seem to depend on. Trump also seemed unclear about what can be achieved with AI and confused about how scientific progress is actually made, some critics suggested.\n\nAmong the critics was Arati Prabhakar, who served as the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden administration. Prabhakar told Ars that Trump’s crippling cuts to government science agencies, research grant funding freezes, and attacks on universities must be repaired or his mission will fail.\n\n“After the Trump administration has inflicted so much damage to valuable datasets and publicly funded research, the new executive order is a Band-Aid on a giant gash,” Prabhakar said.\n\nAlso skeptical of Trump’s plans is Kathryn Kelley, executive director for the Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation, an educational nonprofit representing more than 100 of “the nation’s most forward-thinking universities and computing centers,” CASC’s LinkedIn said.\n\nHer group is specifically dedicated to Genesis Mission-aligned goals, “advocating for the use of the most advanced computing technology to accelerate scientific discovery for national competitiveness, global security, and economic success.” And while Trump’s initiative could be considered “a step in the right direction,” Kelley told Ars that she shares Prabhakar’s concerns.\n\n“Many research institutions and national laboratories continue to experience funding uncertainty, program disruptions, and workforce instability stemming from earlier cuts,” Kelley told Ars.\n\nParticular pain points considered critical to address for Genesis Mission to move forward include reversing “impacts on staffing, ongoing research, and student pipelines,” she suggested.\n\nIn one prominent example, some Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts targeting workers at the National Science Foundation hit hardest in the branch designed to accelerate technology development across a wide range of research settings in the US. DOGE slashed workers there simply because it was the youngest directorate at NSF with the most workers in transition when Trump took office. As courts weighed legal challenges to cuts, whistleblowers warned that Trump was aiming to politicize and dismantle NSF.\n\n“Large-scale initiatives like Genesis rely on highly skilled personnel, robust infrastructure, and sustained program support—some of the very resources at NSF and other federal agencies that were disrupted,” Kelley told Ars. “Rebuilding trust, re-establishing lost programs, and stabilizing the research workforce will be essential to make this mission feasible.”\n\nCritics urged that Trump’s attacks on science also included messing with government datasets that scientists depend on. Since Trump’s second term started, scientists have watched valuable data get censored or scrubbed from government websites. Some researchers have rushed to recreate datasets independently with the help of the Internet Archive.\n\nPrabhakar pointed out that some “datasets that could improve health and prevent disasters are eroding or even disappearing due to this administration,” while universities training “the next generation of great researchers and innovators have reduced or even stopped graduate admissions because of Trump’s assault.”\n\nWithout a massive undertaking to undo moves that critics have said undermined both US science and trust in it, Trump’s dreams of launching AI models that would propel a million moonshots could go down in history as merely hype.\n\n“Without robust data and research and without people’s trust, America won’t lead in AI,” Prabhakar said.\n\nFor people in the science community, it’s hard to square Trump’s aggressive cuts from earlier this year with the broad ambition of Genesis Mission. Frustratingly, the president demands that scientists make discoveries on his timeline, without acknowledging AI’s limitations or how his attacks on science could be driving away talent that could help labs advance AI.\n\nIn many fields, scientists are still exploring how AI can aid research. Trump’s order appears to politicize science by focusing on areas he favors—like critical materials, nuclear energy, biotechnology, and quantum computing—despite their limited AI applications or data-quality challenges. Meanwhile, critics noted that it overlooks areas where “supercharging” AI could perhaps be more impactful—but where Trump notably does not want to leave his mark—like climate science or vaccine research.\n\nIt also lays out aggressive timelines for results, demanding that the Department of Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, “demonstrate an initial operating capability of the Platform for at least one of the national science and technology challenges” identified in less than a year (270 days). Ideally, Trump’s mission will have generated significant discoveries in key fields within the next three years before he leaves office, his order outlined.\n\nPaul Josephson, a Colby College professor and expert in the history of 20th-century science and technology, told Ars that Genesis Mission deadlines differ from John F. Kennedy’s 10-year timeline to reach the moon.\n\nTrump’s order “shows tremendous ignorance of how science and technology work,” Josephson said. The White House is saying, “Tell me what your discoveries will be and how many there will be in three years,” Josephson said, expecting that “we can pick the places where we want discoveries and make them happen.”\n\n“That’s not anything like how science works,” Josephson told Ars, reducing Genesis Mission to “a vision without policy” and “a hope without funding.”\n\nTo Josephson, Trump’s order sounded “more like it came out of Silicon Valley” than out of talks with government scientists, seemingly rushing approvals of industry partnerships and incentives without mentioning what resources would be available to fund gutted labs or train the next generation of scientists. It’s perhaps notable that the order is DOE-centric and does not place the same emphasis on contributions from universities or national labs funded by NSF and the National Institutes of Health as it does on industry partners.\n\nKelley told Ars that “many public datasets are already being used effectively in research and industry” in the ways that Trump intends his AI platform to amplify. However, “there are areas—such as advanced nuclear research or emerging energy technologies—where datasets are limited.” And Trump risks reducing Genesis Mission to bluster by claiming that an AI platform could drive breakthroughs to the major challenges he flagged in the short term.\n\n“There is a real risk that the EO’s ambitious framing could overpromise what AI can achieve in the near term without addressing foundational data gaps,” Kelley told Ars. “That said, even partial progress in these areas could provide valuable insights, but expectations need to be realistic.”\n\nJust as important as asking where Genesis Mission funding is coming from or who the funding is going to, Chris R. Glass asks: “Where’s the talent coming from?”\n\nTrump’s order does not forecast that, only vaguely referencing support for universities training scientists. This comes, of course, after the administration revoked an estimated $1.5 billion in federal grant money in 2025. Those grant cuts shrank the pipeline for PhD students at an “unprecedented rate,” Axios reported.\n\nA Boston College professor who researches global student mobility and the impact of emergent technology on learning, Glass told Ars that Trump has notably left international talent out of his AI plans, despite the prominent roles that both “domestic and international scientists play in our current leadership” in AI.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed, Glass warned that “America is losing research scientists,” who are seeking more stable environments to set up their lives and conduct long-term studies.\n\nAs the Trump administration has attacked immigrants, other governments like the European Union and China have benefited by offering friendlier visa systems to attract the best and brightest minds graduating from US universities. Of course, of the two, China is America’s bigger AI rival. Earlier this year, China began heavily recruiting American scientists spooked by Trump’s grant funding cuts, and Glass confirmed that China has continued those efforts with the AI race heating up. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be going the other direction, recently requiring a $100,000 payment for some skilled workers seeking non-immigrant visas.\n\nThroughout 2025, US universities’ ability to attract international students showed resilience, but “we’re on thin ice,” Glass told Ars, with that resilience “waning.”\n\nCurrently, the US “is ranked the lowest among top destinations for its safety and welcoming and the lowest for its post-graduation visa policies,” Glass said, noting that doctoral students must affirm that they do not intend to immigrate, even though the majority of STEM PhD students stay in the US after graduating.\n\n“They want to stay, and we want them to stay,” Glass told Ars.\n\nAnother concerning outcome of Trump cuts that could hamper Genesis Mission: Entire research groups at many institutions were “displaced”—removed from their labs and left to work in cubicles without access to their equipment, Glass told Ars.\n\n“I think scientists want to go where the best sciences are being done, but eventually these kinds of friction points and these hostile policies make them redirect elsewhere, even temporarily redirect, earn their doctorate in Europe and hope that the policy environment in the US changes,” Glass said.\n\nTo turn it around, Glass made several recommendations in his op-ed to help retain PhD graduates and create stable pathways for high-value talents. That includes suggesting that the Trump administration consider fast-tracking green cards for students in fields that Genesis Mission depends on, including AI and machine-learning researchers, quantum computing scientists, and semiconductor engineers.\n\nHe also thinks the US should “unlock the O-1A visa for researchers and entrepreneurs” by redefining what makes someone an “extraordinary” talent and creating dedicated “founder tracks” for international talent, as Britain and Singapore do. That visa is “uncapped yet underused,” Glass said, only approving 4,500 STEM candidates in 2023.\n\nWithout changes to the visa system, the US “risks redirecting those talent flows,” he said. “And like a river, once those talent flows get redirected, they are very difficult to reverse.”\n\nAnd it won’t just be international talents jumping ship, Glass suggested, but also possibly US scientists forced to continue navigating potentially more of Trump’s cuts and indirect costs in the coming years.\n\n“I think that’s the kind of thing that slowly eats away at someone’s desire to continue to do science in the United States,” Glass said.\n\nGlass told Ars that he expects the US to stay on a “downward trajectory,” driving away talent in 2026, which Josephson suggested “will damage science both for the short and long term.”\n\n“Many universities figured out a one-year contingency plan, but reality will set in if funding continues to be cut,” Glass said.\n\nCASC’s Kelley told Ars that like university international student recruitment, “the US research ecosystem continues to be resilient, but the gap between ambitious goals and the current capacity must be carefully managed.”\n\n“While the Genesis Mission signals strong intentions to invest in science and technology, its success will depend on aligning resources, rebuilding workforce capacity, and thoughtfully integrating AI and data capabilities where they are most effective,” Kelley said.\n\nA scientist might be best positioned to understand the nuance that requires, but Josephson noted that Trump tasked his Science Advisor, Michael Kratsios, with leading the initiative. Unlike prior officials serving in that role, Kratsios is not a scientist and has no PhD, earning his BA in politics. Instead, Kratsios has strong industry ties, previously serving as chief of staff for venture capitalist Peter Thiel and managing director of a company called Scale AI.\n\nTo Josephson, Kratsios as head of the mission—which “seems to be totally based on faith in AI and datasets to do everything”—makes the initiative seem more aligned with Silicon Valley ambitions than public good. That could be a problem since historically, it has never worked when governments attempt to “pick winners” or pass industrial policy with claims that “if we do this, we will come out on top.”\n\n“It’s a belief in AI as the cure or the panacea for all the world’s problems to ensure we’re a dominant technological power, but ignoring climate change, race, gender, anything that is important in daily life,” Josephson said.\n\nJosephson is also an expert in Russian and Soviet history, explaining that precedent shows there are “tremendous dangers” of governments controlling which sciences are funded. In some ways, he thinks Genesis Mission “smells of Putin,” he told Ars, warning that Trump’s attempts to hoard and censor science in 2025 have been “as damaging to science and technology in the world’s leading centers as totalitarian regimes have been.”\n\n“It reflects the general timbre of the Trump administration toward the scientific enterprise,” he suggested, saying that the president has embraced the “authoritarian view” that he “has the right to pick and choose which fields and which branches merit more support and which should not be funded at all.”\n\nJules Barbati-Dajches, an analyst for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), told Ars that in addition to cuts, Trump recently “weakened federal agency policies (called scientific integrity policies) that were specifically in place to protect federal agency science from political interference.” This further threatens scientific integrity, Barbati-Dajches warned in August.\n\nUCS has tracked “instances of science being sidelined, ignored, or misused by the federal government” across “multiple presidential administrations” for two decades, Barbati-Dajches told Ars. And although their methodology was recently updated, the current Trump administration stands out, as “the rate and impact of attacks on science we’ve observed over the past nine months far outpace anything UCS has tracked before,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nAdditionally, UCS has documented “cases of the administration using AI in their reports and research that raise concern” that AI initiatives like Genesis Mission may promote dubious claims to serve “politicized” outcomes, Barbati-Dajches said.\n\n“This altogether paints a very troubling picture,” Barbati-Dajches said. “Scientific innovation and discovery are exciting, important, and can help inform federal policy and guidance. But as history tells us (and recent history even more so), science in the federal government needs protective guardrails to keep it independent and free from undue influence.”\n\nWith Trump pushing for rapid buildouts of AI data centers—sparking widespread backlash among Americans—Barbati-Dajches noted that UCS has documented his administration making “policy choices and decisions that benefit favored interests (including tech and fossil fuel companies) over the health and safety of the public and planet.” Genesis Mission appears to follow that trend, critics suggested, along with Trump’s most recent executive order threatening to block state AI laws, which many consider a gift to the tech industry.\n\n“And meanwhile, most Americans are clear they don’t trust AI and want it regulated—but this administration has opposed even basic guardrails,” Prabhakar said.\n\nPlanning to closely monitor Genesis Mission, UCS is keen to get answers to many questions, such as “who will have access to the platform that’s being created as part of this initiative” and “who will own or will benefit from the outputs of this type of program?”\n\nJosephson said that it’s unlikely Genesis Mission will advance much before the midterm elections. In the next steps, Congress will have to approve funding for the mission, as its broad ambitions, if supported, would surely require structure to continue across multiple administrations.\n\nTo Barbati-Dajches, it’s critical that Genesis Mission is “viewed in the context of [the Trump administration’s] pattern of anti-science actions.”\n\n“One of my main concerns is that this type of mission is being funded in the name of science and innovation when the administration has continuously and methodically attacked federal scientific systems since Inauguration Day,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Genesis Mission will amount to anything but hype. But Josephson noted that perhaps the most blustery part of Trump’s order was a claim that “from the founding of the Republic, scientific discovery and technological innovation have driven American progress and prosperity.”\n\nThe US only began funding research in the back half of the 19th century, Josephson said, “but the amount of money coming from the federal government to the sciences was limited until the Manhattan Project.” After that, the US emerged as a “leading scientific power” in the Cold War, not by racing for “global technology dominance,” as Trump wants, but by embracing science as a “national good.”\n\nAs it stands now, Genesis Mission’s biggest flaw might stem from Trump’s disdain for DEI, which fueled his attacks on science and universities all year, Josephson suggested.\n\n“Funding science and technology and allowing the scientific community through peer review to determine what is the best science and to give funding to encourage young people to enter the science pipeline and to ensure that there are more women and people of color in the scientific community, so that more and more brains are taking part—there’s none of that in the Genesis Mission,” Josephson said.",

    "fullText": "Computer vision and robotics applications ranging from augmented reality to robot autonomy in large-scale environments require spatio-temporal memory frameworks that capture both geometric structure for accurate language-grounding as well as semantic detail. Existing methods face a tradeoff, where producing rich open-vocabulary descriptions comes at the expense of real-time performance when these descriptions have to be grounded in 3D.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing. It leverages such semantic understanding to build a hierarchical 4D scene graph (SG), which acts as an effective globally spatially and temporally consistent memory representation. DAAAM constructs 4D SGs with detailed, geometrically grounded descriptions while maintaining real-time performance. We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning.\n\nWe thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark. We further curate an extended OC-NaVQA benchmark for large-scale and long-time evaluations. DAAAM achieves state-of-the-art results in both tasks, improving OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over the most competitive baselines, respectively. We release our data and code open-source.",

    "description": "America's job market is paralyzed — and white-collar workers are struggling to land roles. The real culprit is high interest rates, not AI.",
    "fullText": "When Gbenga Ajilore thinks about America's job market, a few things keep him up at night: The slowing demand for entry-level talent, tariff chaos, and high interest rates.\n\n\"There is going to come a point where AI is just a part of everything that we do, but we're not there yet,\" Ajilore, who is chief economist at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, said, adding, \"The economy is paralyzed.\"\n\nThe labor market is showing clear signs of weakness. Long-term unemployment has been trending upward, and the share of Americans looking for work recently eclipsed the number of available roles. Alongside a steady drum of layoff headlines, unemployment ticked up more than expected last month to 4.6%. Young people are having trouble breaking in, older workers are hesitant to retire, and with the \"flattening\" of many companies, the middle rungs of the career ladder are crumbling. Only healthcare and construction showed substantial growth. It's been called the white-collar recession, an unwelcome awakening for Americans who hoped their college degree would translate to long-term stability and a comfortable salary.\n\nGiven the timing, it's easy to villainize artificial intelligence. C-Suite leaders across industries have said they're \"all in on AI,\" often to the dismay of rank-and-file employees. The tech is quickly reshaping how workers are assessed on the job and how companies define productivity. It's even shaking up the hiring process: My colleagues have talked to job seekers who submitted hundreds of résumés without landing a role, as HR departments are swamped by AI-assisted applications. Economists and investors can't agree if chatbots are the future of the workforce or a vastly overblown bubble.\n\nBut, in shouldering the blame for America's job market woes, AI has become a scapegoat for something else: The economy itself is deteriorating. Years of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation, along with slowing wage growth and restrictive trade policies, have created an environment where businesses are slashing budgets and the middle class is living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nIf you're frustrated by a lower-than-expected raise or the inability to land a new gig, don't blame the robots. Blame Jerome Powell.\n\nThere is no better example of the AI-is-wrecking-the-job-market fears than the so-called \"Scariest Chart in the World.\" The chart has popped up in X and Bluesky posts, news reports, and a thick stack of Substack newsletters. The simple, two-line chart tracks two pieces of data: the S&P 500 and the number of US job vacancies since 2015. The two run closely together for the first couple of years, but there is a decided break in 2022 — the stock market continues to soar, and the number of available jobs begins to decline. AI doomers are quick to point out that the date those two lines diverged corresponds to the public launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The implication being that the explosion of large language models immediately began replacing thousands of jobs while pouring money into Wall Street.\n\nAs chatbots and AI tools make employees more productive — drafting emails, writing code, and streamlining administrative tasks — and employers more profitable, the thinking goes, there will be less need for hiring human workers. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence from high-profile companies to support the idea. Nvidia wants employees to use AI \"for every task possible,\" Microsoft is \"rethinking\" its business model for the AI age, Big Law is hoping AI can make its services faster and cheaper, and top banks and consulting firms are transferring some tasks from people to bots.\n\nBut is AI already replacing a bunch of jobs? Probably not.\n\nAjilore thinks the AI-sparked white collar downturn is \"overblown.\" Many companies are \"using AI as a cheat code as opposed to something that makes them more efficient,\" he said, \"With the cheat code, you actually end up making mistakes and cutting corners.\" He believes that both chatbots and Corporate America's tech strategy have a long way to go before AI truly disrupts the workforce.\n\nEven Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, isn't sold on AI's effects on the current job market. When asked about the technology during the Fed's December meeting, Powell said AI \"is part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet.\"\n\nThere's also an important piece of context missing from \"The Scariest Chart in the World\": the federal funds rate. Decided eight times a year by Powell and his colleagues on the all-important (and dully-named) Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed funds rate is the key interest rate that anchors all types of loans. For banks and businesses, the number determines how easily and cheaply they can borrow money. For consumers, Fed rates impact everything from home prices to auto loans and credit card rates.\n\nWhen interest rates are low, businesses can access debt more affordably, which helps them fuel growth and hiring. As the fed fund rate increases, however, the price of borrowing rises too. This can help keep inflation in check, but higher rates make it more expensive for companies to operate, meaning that many are seeking other areas to cut costs — often at the expense of employees.\n\nIt's true that the S&P 500 and job openings began to diverge right as ChatGPT launched, but that's also when interest rates started to climb. Between early 2022 and late 2024, federal funds jumped by over 5 percentage points. This was a reshaping of monetary strategy meant to curb soaring prices and cool off a too-hot economy, and it was a major break with nearly a generation of previous policy. The Fed originally slashed interest rates to zero in 2008 to address the fallout from the financial crisis, and in the following 12 years, the benchmark interest rate never rose above 2.4%. Following the emergency measures of the early pandemic, the dramatic hikes of 2022 were a sign that the zero-interest-rate era of the 2010s had officially come to an end.\n\nThis sudden interest rate rise was a turning point many businesses. «tweaked the wording here since it was similar to a sentence in the graf above Hiring boomed in the early pandemic: Job openings skyrocketed to record highs as tech and business fields scrambled to snap up new talent. The Beige Book — a collection of quotes and insights gathered from business owners across the country by the various regional Federal Reserve banks — provides a valuable window into the thinking of hiring managers and executives during this period. Labor market commentary across 2021 and 2022 Beige Books tend to reference \"modest to strong\" job growth, robust hiring demand, and a shortage of workers, with very few mentions of interest rates. This changed when the Fed started hiking rates. One note in the November 2022 edition of the Beige Book said that \"Interest rates and inflation continued to weigh on activity,\" another said \"labor demand weakened overall,\" pointing to layoffs in tech, finance, and real estate. Both blue-collar and white-collar sectors felt the brunt of interest rates that year, citing steep borrowing costs as a central reason they're not hiring. Americans, meanwhile, stopped quitting their jobs as vacancies dried up, and the job market saw its biggest layoff spike since the 2020 shutdown.\n\nCorporate America began to lean into \"efficiency\" rhetoric alongside rising rates. Reduced bureaucracy and red tape, along with a smaller workforce, were sold by the C-Suite as a profit panacea in the face of higher financing costs. Leaders at Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others spoke about hiring freezes and job cuts as a productivity bet versus a financial issue.\n\nThe trend continued: An October 2023 Beige Book note said many sectors \"reduced hiring plans\" and were \"rightsizing\" their budgets because of rising rates. Fast forward to today, and businesses are still grappling with the increased cost of funding, even as Powell and the Fed have moved slowly to lower their benchmark rate. In October's Beige Book, businesses big and small mentioned layoffs and attrition more so than new hiring. Beige Book reports over the past year suggest that AI is contributing to hiring softening in certain areas, such as call centers and accounting firms, but not widespread job displacement. Instead, \"uncertainty\" and \"tariffs\" were two of the most frequently mentioned words by companies such as Tesla, JPMorgan, and Whirlpool during earnings calls.\n\nBut saying the need for layoffs is the result of a long-term change in the cost of financing isn't very sexy. Better to point to AI as both an excuse for layoffs and a way to give investors hope for the future. Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the real estate firm Redfin, said many companies are struggling to balance profits with the steep cost of borrowing money. This is especially true in the housing sector, she said, because it's sensitive to the federal funds rate. She said fields like tech are similarly vulnerable.\n\n\"I think that what's happening is just simple economics,\" she said, adding, \"But when you say that you're going to do layoffs or you're not going to be hiring as much, it doesn't sound very good to investors. It sounds a lot better if you say that you're seeing all these productivity enhancements because of AI.\"\n\nEach recent technological development — computers, cellphones, the internet — has reshaped the job market and the workplace, but people tend to underestimate the timeline. Economists said it will take years, possibly decades, before we have concrete evidence that AI is replacing jobs on a large scale. And AI may create thousands of jobs as it makes others obsolete.\n\n\"I think the overall evolution of the technology is going to be a lot slower than both the optimists and doomers think,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics and trade at the right-leaning Cato Institute. AI has developed rapidly, and while it can perform basic tasks, it is still a long way from replacing human judgment, creativity, and decision-making. \"There will certainly be disruptions, that's inevitable,\" he said. \"But it won't be cataclysmic.\"\n\nThe job market is in a rut — but chatbots aren't the sole, or even the main, culprit.\n\nDespite the weakening job market numbers, the Federal Reserve has cut rates three times this year, a cautious policy stance brought on by economic precarity. Recent Fed reports show that trade policy and inflation are keeping Powell and company from cutting rates at a faster pace, even as the employment outlook weakens. It has also sparked division within the central bank itself: The December meeting saw the highest number of Fed members disagreeing with the interest rate committee's final decision since 2019. Economic projections also show the median committee member expects one rate cut in 2026, less than projected at this time last year. The moves signal an economic situation that isn't catastrophic, so long as Powell plays his cards carefully.\n\nA pattern of cuts could start bringing relief for borrowers, but it will take time for the economy to recover — and there are still steep headwinds. Fast-changing tariffs are exacerbating the impact of high rates, making many businesses hesitant to invest or spend money. As Lincicome put it, \"Tariff uncertainty is really a drag on the job market because companies are saddled with millions, if not billions, of dollars in additional taxes and tariff costs.\"\n\nDeclining immigration due to Trump's deportation policies is also part of the equation: Fewer immigrants in the workforce is contributing to a slowing labor force participation rate. Ajilore also said that the sweeping cost-cutting strategy of DOGE for the federal workforce added fuel to the corporate world's \"efficiency\" crusade. It all adds up to some extremely valid job anxiety for workers.\n\nEconomists expect the market to grow and adapt alongside new technology — and the AI takeover forecast is far less grim than most people realize. The chatbot revolution may come someday. But, for better or worse, the real headliner is the federal funds rate.\n\nAllie Kelly is a reporter on Business Insider's Economy team.

    "fullText": "Sometimes I use ChatGPT and it seems stunningly obvious that AI is going to have a transformative effect on my life. I use it more every day.\n\nAnd other times I find myself yelling at ChatGPT in ALL CAPS, because it can't do basic, simple tasks — ones I could reasonably farm out to a 5th grader. Or even worse: It can't do basic tasks but won't tell me it can't do them, and tries to fudge a result instead. And that makes me wary of using it again.\n\nIt turns out that the AI business has a great term for this dichotomy: \"The jagged frontier,\" coined in a 2023 research paper. Here's another way of putting it, via Reuters:\n\n\"It might be a Ferrari in math but a donkey at putting things in your calendar,\" said Anastasios Angelopoulos, the CEO and cofounder of LMArena, a popular benchmarking tool.\"\n\nThat quote comes from a report looking at the struggles various businesses have had implementing AI in their work. It's a theme we've been hearing a lot about over the last few months, like the MIT study that found that 95% of companies were getting \"zero return\" on their AI investment.\n\nThis issue is core to the \"Is AI a bubble and when will it pop?\" question, of course. Which is a very important question, with some $2 trillion in investment in play.\n\nBut I think it's not the only question: The tech isn't going away, so many of us are unquestionably going to be using AI in all kinds of ways, no matter what.\n\nSo a more practical question is: What kind of tasks can AI do reliably well today — reliably enough that businesses (and the rest of us) can use it day in and day out — and which ones are going to take a while to sort out? And which ones may never be something we can hand over to AI?\n\nThis is a pretty good summary of the ongoing experiments we're working out in real time, right now.",

    "title": "Inside Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's AI revolution",
    "description": "Internal documents and executive interviews reveal sweeping organizational shifts to radically reshape how the company builds and funds its products.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella views AI as an existential threat, a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and a chance to cement his legacy at the top of the tech industry.\n\nThe mission is both personal and professional for the Nadella, who is pushing the company to rethink how it operates at every level. That's according to internal Microsoft documents obtained by Business Insider, and interviews with leaders, managers, and other employees at the software giant.\n\nSweeping organizational shifts include high-profile executive changes and mandates for teams to work faster and leaner — all designed to consolidate power around AI leaders and radically reshape how the company builds and funds its products.\n\n\"Satya is pushing on intensity and urgency,\" one Microsoft executive told Business Insider. That's putting pressure on some Microsoft veterans to decide whether they want to stay and commit to the mountain of work it's going to take to complete Nadella's AI revolution.\n\n\"You've gotta be asking yourself how much longer you want to do this,\" this executive added.\n\nNadella is having conversations with executives to sign on for the transformation, or leave, people familiar with the matter said. Many of these people asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters, although one top executive spoke openly with Business Insider about the CEO's overhaul and Microsoft's AI future.\n\nNadella this year appointed a new CEO of Microsoft's commercial business to free up time to focus on the technical work necessary for his AI ambitions.\n\nAccording to an internal memo, Nadella also started a weekly AI accelerator meeting and corresponding Teams channel to speed the pace of AI work and get more ideas from across the company.\n\nExecutives do not present in these new meetings. Instead, lower-level technical employees are encouraged to speak and share what they're seeing from the AI trenches. This is designed to avoid top-down AI leadership, and is intentionally a bit messy and chaotic, according to people familiar with the new approach.\n\nOther major executive changes are looming. Three Microsoft executives told Business Insider that longtime Office and Windows boss Rajesh Jha has been mulling retirement. Insiders are also chattering about the possibility that Charlie Bell, who runs Microsoft cybersecurity, could retire.\n\nMicrosoft's spokesman Frank Shaw said the company does not expect any changes in the short term to its senior leadership team, of which Bell and Jha are both members.\n\nMicrosoft recently promoted Judson Althoff, its longtime sales chief, to an expanded role as CEO of the company's commercial business.\n\nAlthoff's promotion is intended to give Nadella and the company's engineering leaders more time to focus on AI, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider, which described this moment as \"a tectonic AI platform shift.\"\n\nNadella has shifted to saying the company is in the \"middle innings\" rather than the \"early innings\" of AI, a cricket term, and started saying he wants to see the game through, one of the people said.\n\n\"This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work — across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation — to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift,\" Nadella wrote.\n\nPractically, that's meant Althoff is spending more time as the face of Microsoft at events such as the recent Ignite conference, the first one in Nadella's tenure when the company CEO didn't deliver the keynote.\n\nOne executive told Business Insider the move seems to be paying off so far by giving Nadella \"extra bandwidth to really lead the company in learning, leveraging, and building AI.\"\n\n\"Satya is 100% engaged with leading the company to learn and embrace AI,\" this person said. \"The Judson move was brilliant. It actually allows Satya more time to advance the company in its AI journey. Satya spends a good amount of time in meetings you could characterize as AI learning, product, and engineering.\"\n\nNadella recently announced new marching orders for executives in another Teams channel, this one exclusively for Microsoft corporate vice presidents and above. The CEO said the company is at a turning point at least as significant as the shift to cloud computing and needs to completely rethink its business model.\n\n\"We all have to work and act like ICs in our own orgs, constantly learning and unlearning,\" Nadella wrote, referring to Individual Contributors, someone who is focused on technical work rather than managing people.\n\n\"I chuckle a bit each time someone sends me a note about talking to a friend at an AI start-up, about how differently they're working, how agile, focused, fast they are,\" the CEO added. \"The reality is that this work is also happening right here at Microsoft under our noses! It's our jobs as leaders to seek this out, empower it, cultivate it, and learn from our own early in career talent who are reinventing the new production function!!\"\n\nAsha Sharma, Microsoft CoreAI product president, who joined in 2024, said the company has shifted its operations dramatically in her short tenure. Nadella's new \"production function\" is about using AI to radically change how the company creates, builds, and delivers products and services.\n\nWhen she joined, the AI industry would crank out a big new foundation model roughly every six months. Then, releases happened every six weeks. Today, AI is changing so quickly that it's forcing Microsoft to rethink not just its products but the entire way software is made, Sharma said in an interview arranged by the company.\n\nFor decades, software development has worked like an assembly line. You take a set of inputs — people, time, resources — and transform them into output. Scaling production required scaling those inputs.\n\n\"AI breaks that relationship,\" she said.\n\nAI agents, data, and intelligence now act as a new type of scalable unit that can generate software, insights, and decisions without a corresponding increase in engineering hours or budget. That means the marginal cost of creating something new drops dramatically, Sharma explained, and teams can now spend more on \"judgment, taste, and problem-solving.\"\n\nWith so much changing, it's natural that leadership evolves — and Microsoft insiders expect more changes at the top.\n\nJha, a veteran executive who oversees famous Microsoft products such as Office and Windows, has been mulling retirement, according to three executives who spoke to Business Insider.\n\nStill, one of these executives noted that Jha has a newfound excitement about the company's AI potential, so he could stick around for Nadella's new intense era.\n\nIf Jha leaves, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky might succeed him, these executives said. Roslansky has been running LinkedIn since 2020 and Microsoft recently expanded Roslansky's role to include Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and the Microsoft 365 Copilot application, according to an internal announcement from Nadella in June.\n\nRoslansky started reporting to Jha for his new duties as executive vice president of Office, and to Nadella in his capacity as LinkedIn CEO, according to organizational charts viewed by Business Insider.\n\nCharles Lamanna, president of the business and industry Copilot group responsible for building AI tools like low-code applications, also moved to report to Jha at the time, and is taking on a bigger profile within the company, the people said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Meet one of BlackRock's top technologists who is supercharging its investment teams with AI",
    "description": "Kirsty Craig recently earned the distinction of tech fellow, partly because of her efforts to transform how BlackRock's investors work.",
    "fullText": "For 15 years, BlackRock's Kirsty Craig has operated as a kind of \"translator\" inside the world's largest asset manager, sitting between portfolio managers making big bets and engineers building the systems that help inform those decisions to get both sides aligned on driving returns.\n\nThis skill set is part of what earned Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, the title of Tech Fellow, one of the firm's high technological distinctions, held by only two dozen of its thousands of engineers. Craig is one of five new fellows that the firm announced on December 16, recognized for supercharging the asset manager's investment team. This year, she is the only woman and the only fellow who works outside of Aladdin, the lucrative spine of BlackRock's investment technology.\n\nWhen it comes to her impact on how $13.5 trillion money manager BlackRock uses AI, Craig said she's especially proud of her role in Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. The \"virtual investment analyst\" was unveiled by Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein at the firm's investor day in June.\n\nIt leverages AI to automate workflows and research, as many firms race to adopt the technology to speed up what were once monthslong investment processes.\n\nNow, as a fellow, Craig is even more embedded in BlackRock's efforts to stay ahead, as the firm continues to center on technological prowess.\n\nAt first, Craig wasn't sure she'd become a tech fellow, largely because her work is different than most of the other fellows who work squarely within BlackRock's data analytics and risk platform, Aladdin. Her team of around 60 software engineers, data engineers, and data scientists \"sits at the horizontal\" across various investment capabilities to help drive investment research.\n\nShe found out about the honor at the beginning of the month when a meeting was added to her calendar.\n\nWhen she heard the news, Craig started by telling the manager who had nominated her, her sponsor during the application process, her team, and her family, \"but they've got no idea what it means,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nNish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and the co-executive sponsor of the fellows program, said that existing tech fellows knew Craig not only for her innovation with AI in investing, but for her collaborative efforts. He described Craig as an \"AI native,\" and added that her team is at the \"tip of the spear\" when it comes to applying AI to investment.\n\nCraig's time at different offices — Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia — has, she thinks, given her a strong foundation of horizontal leadership across teams.\n\n\"I am responsible for really trying to find the dial movers across data, AI, and technology that really help our investment pillars drive investment research,\" she said of her work.\n\nCraig has learned how to communicate with both investors and Aladdin technologists, and said that building deep trust with both groups has been key to her success.\n\n\"If you put both of those different personalities or personas together, quite often they're talking above or below each other. They struggle to connect. So for me, it's really been being able to translate both and then come up with a strategy in the middle,\" she said.\n\nFor Craig, being a woman in a position of visible leadership is \"a huge honor.\" Of the 24 tech fellows, five are women, including Craig. Women make up 43.8% of BlackRock's global workforce and 33.1% of senior leadership, according to data from January 1, 2025, posted on the firm's site.\n\nCraig said being involved in BlackRock's women and LGBTQ+ resource groups has informed her other work at the firm, especially in how they've taught her how to collaborate with people from across divisions and explain complicated topics.\n\n\"If anything has probably helped me with, one, building my network; two, softer presentation skills; and then three, around how to communicate with impact,\" Craig said. With the title, she hopes to help more junior female technologists \"lean in.\"\n\nFor Ajitsaria, it's also important to have a diversity of expertise in the program and ensure that fellows represent all arms of BlackRock.\n\nWhen it comes to driving technology strategy itself, Craig said she's excited to keep figuring out how to leverage AI in active investing. Right now, her team is thinking about how to expand the scope of agentic research, potentially to areas like fixed income and macro investing.\n\nAs she continues to soak up the news, Craig is also preparing for a very different big life change. Her partner is scheduled to give birth in early January, so, with the due date mere weeks away, Craig said they've kept all celebrating fairly tame so far.\n\n\"We did go out for a meal. Nothing has been purchased, apart from cribs and bottles,\" she said. \"Definitely some more celebrating will be done post January 6.\"",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, dismissed bitcoin as \"worthless,\" and revisited his GameStop bet.",
    "fullText": "The mysterious Michael Burry has pulled back the curtain over the past six weeks, revealing his views on everything from bitcoin and meme stocks to the AI boom and the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame was previously known for posting cryptic warnings on X, only to swiftly delete them and go silent for months or years at a time.\n\nHe has now closed his hedge fund to outside cash, and shifted his focus to writing about his personal investments and sharing his financial analyses on Substack.\n\nBusiness Insider trawled through Burry's Substack, X posts, and a recent podcast interview with author Michael Lewis to gather the key insights and details he has shared so far.\n\nBurry returned to X in late October after going quiet in April 2023. His commentary since then has centered on concerns of a historic bubble in AI.\n\nHe has warned that the tech companies leading the charge are seeing a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, overinvesting in equipment such as Nvidia chips and data centers, dragging out depreciation to inflate their short-term earnings, destroying shareholder value through excessive stock-based compensation, and signing \"give-and-take\" contracts with one another to keep the buzz going.\n\nBurry — who shot to fame after his lucrative bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled by Lewis in \"The Big Short\" — has also compared AI mania to the dot-com and housing bubbles, predicting it too will end in disaster.\n\nHe has labeled OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time,\" saying it's \"hemorrhaging cash.\" He has disclosed bets against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir, and predicted the AI bubble will burst within two years. He has also advised investors who've won big on high-flying assets to cash out their winnings.\n\n\"I think the stock market could be in for a number of bad years,\" he told Lewis during what might be his final interview, per his Substack.\n\nBurry also said that bitcoin trading at $100,000 was \"the most ridiculous thing\" as it's \"not worth anything,\" and called it \"worse than a tulip bulb\" because it has enabled so much crime. The most popular cryptocurrency now trades below $90,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Burry revealed that he has owned gold since 2005, and described Google-parent Alphabet as the \"value investor's favorite\" among mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nBurry told Lewis that the Fed has \"done a lot of damage\" since its founding more than a century ago.\n\nHe said the US central bank doesn't do \"anything very helpful,\" and the Treasury could just have a department to set interest rates and control the money supply instead.\n\nBurry has also warned that the US banking system is showing signs of \"fragility,\" and banks are \"getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nMoreover, he has defended his past comments on the regional banking fiasco, pandemic-fueled inflation, and a potential meme-stock crash, saying his calls were largely on the money.\n\nHe has shared details of his personal portfolio, including that he has emulated most of his fund's positions and owns shares of Lululemon, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn a Monday post, he revisited his sale of GameStop shortly before the meme stock skyrocketed in January 2021, saying he had \"no idea what was coming.\" He also teased a future post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\nBurry's other revelations so far include the fact that he has known Nvidia's finance chief, Colette Kress, for years, and bought the chipmaker's stock in 2017 or 2018.\n\nAs promised in his Substack's name, \"Cassandra Unchained,\" Burry is speaking freely for the first time in many years — and may just be getting started.",

    "fullText": "Tech companies are snapping up former world leaders and politicians — and OpenAI is the latest to join the party.\n\nThe ChatGPT maker has hired former British chancellor George Osborne to run the global arm of its Stargate AI infrastructure initiative.\n\n\"I recently asked myself the question: what's the most exciting and promising company in the world right now? The answer I believe is OpenAI,\" wrote Osborne, who ran the UK Treasury from 2010 to 2016, in a Tuesday X post confirming the move.\n\nOsborne takes the role of managing director and head of OpenAI for Countries, an initiative launched by the AI startup in May that will see OpenAI partner with nations to build data centers and expand its $500 billion Stargate project beyond the US.\n\nThe former finance minister, who was a member of parliament in the right-leaning Conservative party until 2017, is the latest ex-British political heavyweight to join a US tech firm.\n\nRishi Sunak, the former UK prime minister, took on roles at OpenAI rival Anthropic and Microsoft as an advisor in October, while ex-deputy prime minister Nick Clegg worked as a senior executive on Meta's global affairs team from 2018 until stepping down at the start of 2025.\n\nBritish political salaries are dwarfed by the earnings of even midlevel employees at US tech companies. British prime ministers earn an annual salary of around £174,000 ($232,000), while salaries for research engineers at Meta can be as high as $400,000.\n\nOsborne's arrival comes as OpenAI continues to bulk up its executive ranks. The AI startup hired former Instacart and Meta exec Fidji Simo as its new CEO of applications in May, and this week hired veteran Google executive Albert Lee to lead its mergers and acquisitions team.",

    "title": "What job seekers and employers need to learn about AI and hiring, according to Indeed's top marketer",
    "description": "Indeed's CMO explains how AI hiring tools benefit employers and job seekers, urging both to optimize recruitment strategies for better results.",
    "fullText": "Job openings were down in 2025, yet employers still struggled to find the right skills match for their open positions, according to Indeed's 2026 US Jobs and Hiring Trends Report.\n\nThat paradox is a focus for James Whitemore, who joined Indeed as chief marketing officer in June 2025, the same month former CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba returned to lead the company once again. \n\nWhitemore told Business Insider that both companies and candidates have to reorient how they share information, add more details and nuance to postings and profiles, and move towards natural language to optimize for AI.\n\nThese shifts are central to two new AI tools the company rolled out for job seekers and employers in September, called Career Scout and Talent Scout, and an API integration for employers, called Indeed Connect, which is launching in January 2026.\n\nWhitemore also shared how Indeed's marketing team is using AI to maximize its first-party data, and uncanny experiences with synthetic audience testing.\n\nThe following interview is edited for length and clarity.\n\nBusiness Insider: What do employers need to know about hiring using AI tools?\n\nJames Whitemore: We're trying to shift the whole conversation from job search to one that is more proactive, where a potential employer is sourcing and screening for the right candidates, rather than the candidates having to go find the job.\n\nSo first, when you are looking for candidates, how do companies build their profiles? A lot of large-scale employers have really complex search strings that they use to source candidates.\n\nWith our new tools, you're not using search strings anymore. You are using real-language descriptions of skills, personality traits, and educational backgrounds. Teaching employers how to use the tools and how to form searches, describe candidates, and the type of people that they want, is key.\n\nThen to make the AI tools work effectively, there is much more ongoing communication about the candidate, so much more disposition sharing about who moved through the interview process and why some people were screened out versus other people who moved forward. That way you can constantly teach the platforms what worked for them.\n\nSo bringing all this together can be automated?\n\nYes, we call it Indeed Connect, which is basically an API-to-API integration between the Indeed platforms and the company's HR tech stack. The benefit that brings employers is that they can use those screening and sourcing tools across multiple sources of candidates.\n\nMost large-scale employers will have their own databases of candidates, and they're looking at other third parties, but you can use a consistent set of sourcing tools across all of those candidates, not just the ones that are coming in from Indeed.\n\nJob seekers are frustrated with the hiring process. What do they need to know in order to stand out in AI-assisted search?\n\nYou want yourself to be as searchable as possible when employers are using advanced sourcing and screening tools.\n\nThe key thing is to make sure that you have a full and complete profile, and that the profile goes beyond your resume. A resume is a historical look back at what you have done in the past. What most employers are really interested in is what you are capable of doing in the future.\n\nWhen I think about our own team, we're looking for somebody who understands marketing, but also general-purpose people who understand a business process, who can be used effectively across multiple tasks.\n\nResumes typically don't bring out soft skills. Completing your profiles and talking about what makes you tick and what excites you in \"about me\" sections is important, so that as those profiles get screened, you are much more likely to show up as somebody who is an adaptable, curious type of person.\n\nWhat are other best practices for job seekers today?\n\nTo be successful, you need to be very focused on the type of jobs you want. Mass-applying to jobs that aren't a good fit for you is not going to get you anywhere other than frustrated.\n\nAlso, it's OK to be constantly looking. The concept of \"come look for a job when you need a job\" is not the right way to be thinking about it. You should be passively open to understanding what jobs are open to you on an ongoing basis, rather than just coming to look for a job when you need a change for some reason.\n\nThat's the concept Indeed is moving to, from a place where you come to look for a job to a place where you expose your skills, your capabilities, your ambitions to potential employers, and those employers can find you when they need someone with your skills.\n\nHow is Indeed's marketing team using artificial intelligence?\n\nMarketing is one of the disciplines that has the opportunity to be most transformed by the use of AI tools. A big element is understanding and segmenting audiences in ways that we've never been able to do before.\n\nAt Indeed, we have rich first-party audience data. We know who people are, what their job histories are, education, salaries, and much more data than a lot of CMOs have to work with.\n\nBeing able to take that data and compare it to third-party databases — that technology is rapidly evolving. Then it's being able to take those audience segments and run them against mass-scale media databases, so that you understand exactly where those people are consuming content across digital, print, radio, and TV.\n\nThe ability to test messages against a synthetic audience is also fascinating. We're running synthetic marketing tests versus traditional tests, and the synthetic tests are just as accurate. Then you can take that data and feed it into the content engines, so that you are producing personalized content for audiences at scale.\n\nIt's amazing to see how it's constantly evolving, so quickly. Part of the message to the team is that marketing has got to be at the leading edge of AI. We do a lot of work with our vendors, bringing them to demo their platforms and talk about their roadmaps.\n\nHow do you manage the variety of marketing AI systems and vendors?\n\nI'm interviewing right now for a senior director of marketing transformation who will lead that group. It is so important to have somebody who is really on point to lead the discussions.\n\nWe purposely didn't call it \"head of AI\" because it's really looking at the processes, the workflows, the way that we work with others around the organization, as well as all the tools and technology, which is so important to get right.",

    "description": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.",
    "fullText": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.\n\nThe launch of the “US Tech Force” is designed to address a technical and early career talent gap across the government, according to Scott Kupor, the director of the Office of Personnel Management which is spearheading the program. The effort comes amid a broader war for AI talent, with tech companies offering sizable salaries and other perks to attract top engineers and researchers.\n\nOPM plans to hire an initial cohort of 1,000 early career software engineers, data scientists, project managers and AI experts to be placed across government agencies for the two-year program. It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

    "description": "The Google DeepMind CEO warns that some early AI startups are overvalued and the current pace of funding won't last.",
    "fullText": "Demis Hassabis has a blunt message for parts of the AI startup world: Some of this looks unsustainable.\n\nThe DeepMind cofounder and CEO said in an episode of \"Google DeepMind: The Podcast\" published Tuesday that there are likely \"bubbles\" forming in today's AI funding frenzy, particularly among early-stage startups raising money at huge valuations.\n\nSome startups \"basically haven't even got going yet,\" he said, yet are raising at \"tens of billions of dollars valuations just out of the gate.\"\n\n\"It's sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. You know, my guess is probably not, at least not in general,\" he added.\n\nHassabis drew a distinction between those sky-high seed rounds and the large tech companies pouring billions into AI infrastructure. There's \"a lot of real business\" underpinning Big Tech's valuations, he said.\n\nAI is \"overhyped in the short term\" but \"still underappreciated in the medium to long-term,\" he added.\n\nHassabis said an \"over-correction\" is imminent for any major technology shift like AI, especially when it goes from skepticism to obsession quickly.\n\n\"When we started DeepMind, no one believed in it,\" he said. \"Fast forward 10, 15 years, and now, obviously, it seems to be the only thing people talk about in business.\"\n\nThat kind of swing often pushes valuations too far and too fast. \"It's almost an overreaction to the underreaction,\" he said.\n\nHassabis also said he isn't worried about whether AI is in a bubble — he's focused on his job. Google DeepMind builds the AI models that power Google's products, including Gemini, and leads the company's frontier AI research.\n\nHassabis' comments come as AI startups continue to rake in soaring valuations.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last week that young founders — some of whom are fresh out of school — are raising millions for their AI startups. Many have dropped out to ride the AI wave, pulling in top investors and talent.\n\nA Stanford graduate dropout raised $64 million for her AI math startup earlier this year. Carina Hong, the founder of Axiom Math, even recruited top AI talent from Meta and Google Brain.\n\nThe 16 young founders Business Insider spoke with this year have secured over $100 million in funding.\n\nBut not everyone is buying the hype. Howard Marks, the cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management, said on an episode of \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast published last week that investors are flocking to AI startups with little track record.\n\n\"Do you want to have a novel entrepreneurial startup pure play which has no revenues and no profits today, but could be a moonshot if it works?\" the billionaire asked.\n\n\"Or do you want to invest in a great tech company, which is already existing and making a lot of money where AI could be incremental but not life-changing? It's a choice.\"",

Now, OpenAI has answered.\n\nThe ChatGPT creator announced the rollout of a new flagship image generator on Tuesday, which the company says is capable of making faster, more precise edits to an AI image while maintaining details.\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Images, powered by our flagship new image generation model.\n\n- Stronger instruction following\n- Precise editing\n- Detail preservation\n- 4x faster than before\n\nRolling out today in ChatGPT for all users, and in the API as GPT Image 1.5. pic.twitter.com/NLNIPEYJnr\n\nBut the more eye-catching change for many user will likely be the improvements to image quality and the AI model's ability to follow specific instructions.\n\nOpneAI said the new model offers \"clear improvements across a range of cases.\" In one example, the company showed off the differences between the old and new image model when prompted to generate a photorealistic scene in 1970s Chelsea, London.\n\nIn another example touting use cases for businesses using the company's image API, OpenAI compared the outputs showing a mechanic working on a car.\n\nWhile a model's ability to generate photorealistic images has become a popular point of comparison in the AI race, OpenAI's latest model can also generate animated images, graphics, and other styles of artwork.\n\nPerhaps to boost awareness of that, the company is rolling out a new Images feature within the ChatGPT app. While AI image generation was previously available within ChatGPT, OpenAI says the new dedicated Images feature is designed to \"spark inspiration and make creative exploration effortless.\"\n\nThe news comes just over three weeks after Google released its Nano Banana Pro AI image model alongside its flagship Gemini 3 LLM — both of which have received widespread praise and reignited the debate around whether Google had begun to overtake OpenAI in the AI race.\n\nGoogle's new AI image generator was lauded for its hyper-realistic AI images, which some people used over Thanksgiving to make it appear as if they had famous guests at the holiday dinner table.\n\nYuchen Jin, the cofounder and CTO of the startup Hyperbolic Labs, called OpenAI's new model \"Nano Banana Pro level in my tests.\"",

    "description": "The biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model.",
    "fullText": "AI was big in 2025, but so were many other developments and worries.\n\nThe biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model. Let’s start, shall we?\n\nWhile most of the money went to proprietary models, open source AI datasets, orchestration frameworks, evaluation tools and guardrail stacks have all seen gains.\n\nSuch open source AI efforts as Common Corpus, along with the  dozens of AI projects hosted by the Linux Foundation’s AI & Data group are enabling us to use community infrastructure for generative AI rather than relying solely on proprietary APIs, making open AI stacks a serious option for businesses and users.\n\nWhile the open source AI definition remains controversial, and very few AI projects fully qualify as open source by the strict requirements of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) AI definition, AI remains built on a foundation of open source software. The debate over open weights, data and training code will continue, but even the most proprietary large language models (LLMs) couldn’t exist without open source programs.\n\nAgentic AI, owes everything to open source. To orchestrate our latest generation of AI agents, we’re using several programs.\n\nThe most important of these, at this early stage of the game, appears to be the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is an open standard and open source implementation for uniformly connecting agents to tools, files, databases and other systems.\n\nMCP is increasingly the “plumbing layer” under many agents and IDE assistants, and there are numerous open source MCP servers and toolkits that let any compatible agent framework plug into the same tools.\n\nMCP isn’t the only agentic AI middleware that’s speeding up:\n\nA Linux Foundation report released in August showed that venture capital‑backed commercial open source companies have outperformed comparable closed‑source vendors over the last 25 years.\n\nThat report, alongside open source adoption data from an April OSI survey, which from 96% of organizations are maintaining or increasing open source software use, has cemented commercial open source as the default way to build software.\n\nTogether, these reports are driving more funding, more mergers and acquisitions, and more “open core plus services” strategies around critical open source projects.\n\nOf course, we knew that. After all, a 2024 Harvard Business School study already showed that  96% of commercial programs rely on open source and that the total value of open source code comes to a cool $8.8 trillion. That still doesn’t stop companies that made the mistake of confusing open source as a software development model with a business model; it never was. It never will be.\n\nSo it is that in 2025, we saw more companies move from open source to fauxpen source. For example, the ScyllaDBteam announced in December 2024 that it would move to a single “ScyllaDB Enterprise” stream under a source‑available license.\n\nAt the library level, there have been high‑profile examples of previously permissive projects switching quietly to source‑available, paid‑for‑commercial‑use terms, such as the Fluent Assertions .NET testing library moving, this past January, from Apache‑2.0 to a proprietary source‑available license with per‑developer fees.\n\nThen, there’s the DevOps program Puppet. Although Puppet’s core codebase is still under the Apache 2.0 open source license, its commercial parent company, Perforce, has changed how official builds are distributed and licensed.\n\nWhat changed is that new “hardened” binaries and packages built by Puppet/Perforce are now shipped from a private repository. The Puppet Core End User License Agreement (EULA) offers a free tier capped at 25 nodes, with commercial licensing required for additional nodes. Effectively, this makes Puppet a source-available program, even though the code is technically still open.\n\nThe result in Puppet’s case is the same as we’ve seen in other such attempts to close once open source projects: Unhappy programmers have forked the project. The fork is known as OpenVox.\n\nThese forked projects, which include Elasticsearch with its fork OpenSearch, Redis with the Valkey fork, and Terraform with the OpenTofu fork, have been somewhat successful. All four forks have achieved meaningful traction, but at different scales and under different definitions of  “success.”\n\nOpenSearch appears to be the most successful. It reports strong growth, including double‑digit, 78%, year‑over‑year download increases and a roster of major members such as Amazon Web Services, Canonical, SAP and Uber.\n\nValkey has also proven to be popular. The latest release, Valkey 9, is reported to be far faster than the newest version of Redis. In particular, Valkey users report that it’s consistently ahead of comparable Redis releases on raw throughput, especially on larger, memory‑heavy workloads where Valkey’s multithreaded I/O and cache‑prefetching kick in.\n\nWhile OpenSearch and Valkey have both advanced beyond their parent projects, Terraform vs. OpenTofu is another story. People still see OpenTofu and Terraform as differing only in their licenses. Over the last few months, though, that’s been changing as OpenTofu, which joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in April, steers more of its own course. Latest releases now include state encryption, a feature the Terraform community has wanted for years, and early variable evaluation.\n\nFinally, OpenVox continues to present itself as a “soft fork.” Its directors want it to stay 100% compatible with Puppet so it can serve as a drop-in replacement for Puppet deployments. That, however, appears to no longer be possible, as Gene Liverman, the leader of OpenVox, wrote, “We can no longer guarantee that our modules will work with Puppet Core or Puppet Enterprise.”\n\nFrom the project maintainers’ viewpoint, Perforce is breaking compatibility. For now, though, OpenVox is essentially a healthy, community lifeboat rather than a full‑scale Puppet replacement ship.\n\nDespite the simple fact that we all depend on open source, all too many projects remain underfunded. Others, such as NET 6, are still popular, but their maintainers have quit supporting them. What’s a user to do?\n\nThis isn’t a new problem. Back in 2021, Tidelift, a security company that also financially supported open source maintainers, found that 46% of open source project maintainers received no pay at all. Almost as bad, even those who were paid, a mere 26% earn more than $1,000 per year for their work.\n\nThings have not improved. In fact, they’ve gotten worse. In 2024, Tidelift’s latest results showed that now 60% of open source maintainers are unpaid.\n\nAs  an open letter signed by 10 open source foundations  and published in September pointed out, “Most of these [open source] systems operate under a dangerously fragile premise: They are often maintained, operated, and funded in ways that rely on goodwill, rather than mechanisms that align responsibility with usage.”\n\nSo it is that, according to the open letter, “a small number of organizations absorb the majority of infrastructure costs, while the overwhelming majority of large-scale users, including commercial entities that generate demand and extract economic value, consume these services without contributing to their sustainability.”\n\nA specific example that I’ve been covering is how FFMpeg, which is used by everyone who watches videos over the Internet, is horribly underfunded, even as major companies such as Amazon, Google and Netflix depend on its code. There are many other such projects. This can not continue.\n\nThe answer is that companies must — Must — start financially supporting mission-critical open source projects. The cost to do this is minute compared to the damage they’d suffer if these projects folded or were hit by a major security problem.\n\nIn 2024, the xz data compression library code, which had been deliberately infected with malware, came close to inserting a backdoor into Fedora, Red Hat’s community Linux. Had it been successful, it might have ended up in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its clones.\n\nThis would have led to the greatest Linux security disaster to date. We dodged a bullet.\n\nUnfortunately, the open source software supply chain security is under sustained, high-volume attack, with npm- and PyPI-focused campaigns escalating.\n\nSeveral high-impact campaigns in 2025 centered on compromising open source package ecosystems, especially npm.\n\nIn November, researchers from Wiz, Aikido, and others detailed a “Shai-Hulud 2.0” wave of trojanized npm packages that exfiltrated developer and CI/CD credentials from environments using popular libraries tied to major Software as a Service and cloud tooling.\n\nTens of thousands of malicious repos were spun up as part of the campaign. GitLab’s vulnerability research team also reported a separate widespread npm supply chain attack that harvested credentials for GitHub, npm, and major clouds and propagated by infecting additional packages owned by victims.\n\nThese are not one-off instances. Industry threat reports in 2025 describe a surge in software supply chain attacks overall, with October setting a new monthly record, and open source ecosystems featuring prominently among the targets.\n\nAnalysis from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 and other research teams notes that attackers increasingly prefer compromising maintainer accounts and publish pipelines rather than core source repos, because this path can silently poison trusted packages at scale.\n\nA study by ReversingLabs, released in March, reported that, while observed open source malware packages have declined somewhat, the risk has shifted toward leaked developer secrets and build-time exposures.\n\nResearchers examining popular npm, PyPI, and RubyGems components continue to find hard-coded credentials, weak application hardening, and exposed data inside widely used binaries deployed in enterprises. That kind of mistake was stupid back in the ’80s, when I first encountered it in production software, and it’s unforgivable today.\n\nMaking matters worse, security companies such as JFrog and Veracode report that exploding dependency graphs, faster release cycles, and heavy reuse of open source libraries mean a single malicious or vulnerable package can ripple through thousands of downstream applications in days.\n\nThis dense interconnection makes the blast radius of attacks like the npm-focused campaigns in 2025 significantly larger than that of many earlier open source incidents, especially when the target libraries appear in 20 to 30% of scanned cloud environments.\n\nWhat can we do about it? We must more broadly adopt software bills of materials (SBOMs), Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)-style attestations, and tools from the Open Source Software Foundation ecosystem to track provenance and integrity of open source components.\n\nOpenSSF and its partners highlight initiatives such as Sigstore for keyless signing, Scorecard for automated project risk assessment, and the Open Source Project Security Baseline, which aim to give both maintainers and consumers clearer security expectations.\n\nEvery year, I tell people that they must take security more seriously. Lately, as open source supply chain violations become ever more common, I’ve been saying you must ensure the code in your supply chain is both safe and written by someone trustworthy.\n\nLooking ahead, I can only redouble these warnings. Now we’ve already had serious security breaches in the last few years. You remember: Solarwinds, JetBrains TeamCity, and Apache Log4j should all come to mind quickly. As bad as those were, worse security disasters lie ahead if we don’t take open source supply chain security much more seriously.",

The survey was weighted to be representative of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 who live with their parents by age, gender, race and ethnicity, household income, and other categories.\n\nHere are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology­­­.\n\nThis research was reviewed and approved by an external institutional review board (IRB), Advarra, an independent committee of experts specializing in helping to protect the rights of research participants.\n\nEven as teens express mixed feelings about social media’s impact, these sites remain a key part of their lives, with some using them “almost constantly.”\n\nNow, AI chatbots, like ChatGPT and Character.ai, are getting teens’ attention. Roughly two-thirds report using chatbots, including about three-in-ten who do so daily, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 1,458 U.S. teens ages 13 to 17.\n\nYoung people turn to a variety of platforms, but YouTube stands out for being used by nearly all teens. Roughly nine-in-ten report ever using it.\n\nTeens widely use three other platforms:\n\nFewer use Facebook (31%) and WhatsApp (24%). And no more than about one-in-five say the same of Reddit or X (formerly Twitter).\n\nToday’s online landscape for teens is marked by both stability and new trends.\n\nWhatsApp is one platform that stands out for its growth in recent years. Today, roughly a quarter of teens say they use WhatsApp, up from 17% in 2022.\n\nX and Facebook have declined in use over the past decade. Today, 16% of teens use X, down from 23% in 2022 and 33% in 2014-15. And Facebook, once the go-to platform for teens, is used today by about three-in-ten teens. This is far lower than the 71% in 2014-15, though on par with 2022.\n\nThe shares of teens who use other sites or apps, like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, have stayed relatively stable in recent years.\n\nJump to read about teens’ online experiences: Online platform use by demographic groups | Frequency of online platform use | Use of AI chatbots | Frequency of chatbot use | Internet use\n\nTeen use of specific online platforms varies across demographic groups – including when it comes to gender, race and ethnicity, age and household income.\n\nTeen girls are more likely to use Snapchat and Instagram. For example, 61% of girls say they use Snapchat, compared with 49% of boys.\n\nMeanwhile, boys are more likely to use Reddit (21% vs. 12%) and YouTube (94% vs. 89%).\n\nThere are differences in use by race and ethnicity across all the platforms asked about except Reddit. Black teens are more likely than their White or Hispanic peers to use Instagram, TikTok, X, Snapchat and YouTube. For example, 82% of Black teens say they use Instagram. This drops to 69% among Hispanic teens and is even lower for White teens (55%). And Black teens are more likely than Hispanic teens to use Facebook.1\n\nWhatsApp is used by a larger share of Hispanic and Black teens than White teens.\n\nOlder teens stand out from younger teens in using nearly every platform we ask about. For instance, three-quarters of 15- to 17-year-olds say they use Instagram, compared with 44% of 13- to 14-year-olds.\n\nYouTube is the only site measured that older and younger teens are equally likely to use.\n\nTeens in households with lower and middle incomes are more commonly using TikTok and Facebook, a largely similar pattern to previous years.\n\nFor instance, 46% of teens living in households earning less than $30,000 a year say they use Facebook. Similarly, 39% of those in households with incomes between $30,000 and $74,999 say the same. However, this drops to 27% among teens in households earning $75,000 or more.\n\nIn a pattern seen in previous Center surveys, a larger share of teens who identify as Democrats than Republicans say they use TikTok, Instagram, Reddit and YouTube.\n\nFor example, there is a large partisan gap for TikTok: 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning teens say they use TikTok, compared with 60% of Republicans and Republican leaners.\n\nYouTube is not only widely used, but it’s also the platform the most teens visit on a daily basis. Roughly three-quarters of teens say they use it every day.\n\nSomewhat smaller shares report going on two other platforms daily: TikTok (61%) and Instagram (55%).\n\nJust under half say they visit Snapchat every day (46%), while far fewer say the same of Facebook (20%).\n\nOverall, teen daily use of these platforms remains relatively stable from past years.\n\nSocial media is not only a daily feature in the lives of teens, some report using these platforms “almost constantly.” About one-in-five teens say this of TikTok and YouTube.\n\nFewer describe their use of Instagram and Snapchat as almost constant (12% for each). And just 3% say this of Facebook.\n\nAcross these five platforms, 36% of teens use at least one of these sites almost constantly.\n\nThe share of teens who say they are on TikTok almost constantly ticked up slightly to 21% this year, from 16% in 2022. The shares who report using YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook almost constantly have changed little since 2022.\n\nThere are some gender differences in frequency of using these sites or apps.\n\nSlightly larger shares of teen girls than boys report being on TikTok and Instagram almost constantly. Teen boys are more likely than girls to visit YouTube this often (20% vs. 13%).\n\nSimilar rates of girls and boys say they use Snapchat and Facebook almost constantly.\n\nBlack and Hispanic teens are particularly likely to report being on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram almost constantly.\n\nFor example, 35% of Black teens say they’re on YouTube almost constantly, compared with 23% among Hispanic teens. Both groups are much more likely than White teens (8%) to say this.\n\nThere are only small or no racial or ethnic differences in visiting Snapchat or Facebook almost constantly.\n\nAI chatbots have become more common in daily life, from education to entertainment. For the first time, we asked teens about their overall use of chatbots, how often they use them and which ones they turn to.\n\nA majority of teens say they use chatbots. Roughly two-thirds of teens (64%) say they ever use an AI chatbot. Fewer (36%) do not use this tool.\n\nWhile many teens use chatbots, there are some differences across demographic groups:\n\nAbout three-in-ten teens say they use AI chatbots every day, including 16% who do so several times a day or almost constantly.\n\nDaily use of chatbots differs somewhat by race and ethnicity as well as age:\n\nIn addition to understanding their overall use, we also asked teens about their use of six specific chatbots.\n\nChatGPT (59%) is by far the most widely used chatbot and the only one we measured that a majority of teens use.\n\nThis is more than twice the rate of the next most commonly used chatbots: Gemini (23%) and Meta AI (20%).\n\nFewer say they use Copilot, Character.ai and Claude.\n\nBlack and Hispanic teens are more likely than their White peers to say they use Gemini and Meta AI.\n\nBlack and White teens differ modestly in their use of ChatGPT and Character.ai.\n\nThere are no significant differences in use for Copilot or Claude.\n\nTeens ages 15 to 17 are more likely than those 13 to 15 to report using ChatGPT and Meta AI.\n\nChatGPT use is more common among teens in higher-income households. About six-in-ten teens living in households earning $75,000 or more (62%) say they use it. That compares with 52% of teens living in households earning less than $75,000.\n\nMeanwhile, lower- and middle-income teens are more likely to use Character.ai. Some 14% of teens in households with incomes of less than $75,000 report using it. This is double the rate among teens in households with incomes of $75,000 or more (7%).\n\nGo to the appendix for a full breakdown of AI chatbot use by demographic groups.\n\nThe survey also explores how often teens use the internet.\n\nNearly all U.S. teens (97%) say they use the internet daily, including four-in-ten who say they are almost constantly online.\n\nThe share of teens who say they’re online almost constantly is much higher today than a decade ago, though it’s a slight dip from last year.\n\nBlack (55%) and Hispanic teens (52%) are about twice as likely as White teens (27%) to say they’re online almost constantly.\n\nBeing online almost constantly is more common for older teens. While 43% of 15- to 17-year-olds report being online almost constantly, 34% of 13- and 14-year-olds report this.\n\nTeens living in households that earn less than $75,000 annually are more likely than those in households earning $75,000 or more to say they use the internet almost constantly.\n\nThere are no significant differences in internet use by gender.",

    "description": "Google's TPU business is ramping up. Here's everything you need to know about Google's AI chips, and what they mean for Nvidia's dominance.",
    "fullText": "Google has been in the AI chip game for more than a decade. Now its custom hardware is moving markets.\n\nShares of Nvidia and other chipmakers tumbled last month following a report that Meta — one of Nvidia's largest customers — was exploring a deal to use Google's AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.\n\nGoogle has primarily used its TPUs for internal use, but it also leases them to external customers through the cloud. Nvidia, meanwhile, has become the dominant provider of AI chips with its graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nGoogle has a potential blockbuster business to unlock. In a research note sent December 2, Morgan Stanley projected that 5 million of Google's TPUs will be purchased in 2027 and about 7 million in 2028, significantly increasing its prior projections.\n\nHere's a breakdown of everything you need to know about TPUs, what they're used for, and when they might become a more prominent threat to Nvidia's chip dominance.\n\nOver a decade ago, Google needed more powerful and specialized compute power for the type of AI work it wanted to do. A team led by the now-CEO of Groq, Jonathan Ross, designed a new chip based on a specific type of integrated circuit for machine learning. The TPU was born.\n\nGoogle has continued to improve and refine its TPUs over the years, making them more effective at both training models and inference, the process where a trained model answers a question or performs a task. As large language models have grown in size, Google has also increased the memory bandwidth of later TPUs to handle these bigger workloads.\n\nGoogle says its latest \"Ironwood\" TPU, which the company is making widely available, is more than four times better than its predecessor for both training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPU cards, which launched in 1999, were originally designed for gaming, not AI. When researchers later discovered that the chips were useful for tasks such as training neural networks, Nvidia doubled down on the AI market.\n\nGoogle's TPUs, on the other hand, were designed for AI from the get-go. Being more specialized means they're more efficient than Nvidia's chips at some tasks, and faster for running select AI models. They have something called a systolic array, which lets a more constant stream of data pass through the chip, rather than having to keep fetching more from memory.\n\nWhere Google's TPUs have a big edge is in cost at scale. It's possible to have thousands of TPUs working in tandem in a single \"pod.\" Because they are faster at some calculations than GPUs, running many TPUs at once can sometimes be more cost-efficient.\n\nThat may become more important as companies increase investments at the inference stage, which Google says its latest TPU is especially good at. That could save companies money.\n\nOne advantage that Nvidia has over Google is its CUDA software, which makes it possible for regular applications to use GPUs for general computing tasks — not just for graphics. CUDA also only works with Nvidia chips, one of the biggest points of friction stopping companies from switching to Google's chips.\n\nGoogle is trying to change that. For example, there is a lot of industry demand to have TPUs better support Pytorch, a popular tool for building AI applications that was created inside Meta. Google is allocating more resources and attention to better supporting Pytorch, which data suggests is seeing much more demand than Google's own Tensorflow software, according to Google employees and industry experts.\n\nWhen it comes to TPUs, Google remains its own biggest customer. It uses the chips across the company to power products like Search and Maps. Its latest Gemini 3 model was trained on TPUs.\n\nWhile Google has prioritized its own needs, it has leased its TPUs to other customers. Apple used TPUs to train its in-house AI model, Business Insider previously reported. In October, Anthropic announced a blockbuster deal with Google that it says will see it using up to 1 million TPUs. Broadcom, which helps build the TPU chips for Google, revealed in its Q4 earnings call this week that it has received a total of $21 billion in orders from Anthropic for Google's Ironwood TPUs.\n\nMeta is also in early testing of Google's TPUs, according to a person familiar with the matter, although it's not clear if it will result in a long-term deal.\n\nGoogle's TPU business could be poised to explode in the coming years. In a research note this month, Morgan Stanley wrote that every 500,000 TPU chips sold could potentially add around $13 billion in revenue to Google's balance sheet in 2027.\n\nHaving TPUs isn't just a potential revenue boost for Google. It also gets a feedback loop in using TPUs to run and train its AI models, learning from them, and changing how it develops its next chips to be better at the things Google needs.\n\nNvidia's GPU is still very much the chip du jour, but other tech giants are increasingly pouring resources into their own custom chips. Amazon just announced its new Trainium3 custom AI chip, which the company says can cut the cost of training and powering AI models in half compared with a GPU.\n\nMany TPU buyers are also Nvidia customers, and some industry insiders told Business Insider that it's more likely that the rise of more specialized chips will see companies and labs diversify the chips they use, rather than going all in on one provider.\n\nThat could still hurt Nvidia, which could lose pricing power as a result of a more diverse market.\n\nHowever, even if Google's TPU business finds more momentum, it doesn't mean Nvidia will suddenly crumble overnight. Jordan Nanos, member of technical staff of research firm SemiAnalysis, said his firm believes companies, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, will all \"sell lots\" of chips in the future.\n\n\"We don't see TPU as a significant threat to Nvidia's business, but it has been a real player in the market for many years,\" said Nanos. \"It is possible that Google sells TPU servers externally in the future, to many more customers. Right now, they are very selective.\"\n\nHave something to share? Contact this reporter via email at hlangley@businessinsider.com or Signal at hughlangley.01.

    "fullText": "EVs aren't really working out for Ford, so now it's chasing the AI boom instead.\n\nThe Detroit auto giant said on Monday it would pull back from electric vehicles in a move that would cost the company $19.5 billion.\n\nIn addition to scrapping planned electric models and building more hybrids, Ford said it would repurpose its EV battery factory in Kentucky to build batteries to power data centers and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe Mustang maker added that it would invest $2 billion to scale the new energy storage business, which it said would \"leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity.\" Ford plans to deploy at least 20 gigawatt-hours of energy storage systems by the end of 2027, which is roughly equivalent to the power used by 2,000 US homes for a year.\n\nIt comes as the race to build ever more powerful AI models fuels a data center boom across the US, putting pressure on the electricity grid.\n\nFederal estimates suggest data center power demand is expected to as much as triple over the next three years, as tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure.\n\nEVs, meanwhile, are heading in the other direction. Demand has cratered in recent months after buyers rushed to purchase electric vehicles before the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit in September, and automakers are rolling back investments and betting on hybrids as they gear up for an EV winter.\n\nFord said the factory at Glendale, Kentucky, which the US automaker built as part of a joint venture with Korean battery company SK On, will produce commercial batteries for the data center industry. Another battery plant in Michigan will produce smaller units for residential use, Ford added.\n\nFord is following in the footsteps of rival Tesla, which operates a thriving energy storage business. Elon Musk's automaker raked in over $10 billion last year from selling batteries to support the grid and power people's homes.\n\nTesla's Megapack commercial batteries have been used by Musk's startup xAI at its massive \"Colossus\" supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee. In May, the AI startup reportedly deployed 168 Megapacks to help stabilize the electricity supply at the site, which is one of the largest data centers in the world.\n\nFord's bet on energy storage comes as the company overhauls its wider EV strategy.\n\nThe Blue Oval announced on Monday it would cancel plans to build some large electric vehicles, and turn its F-150 Lightning electric pickup into an \"extended range\" EV with an additional gas generator.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley told Bloomberg on Monday that the move was the result of the EV market in the US shrinking and \"the customer changing their decision.\"\n\n\"The EV market in the US went from 12% of the industry to only five, and that really, in the end, was the big decider for us,\" he said.",
