    "fullText": "Agentic AI apps first interview you and then give you limited matches selected for ‘similarity and reciprocity of personality’\n\nDating apps exploit you, dating profiles lie to you, and sex is basically something old people used to do. You might as well consider it: can AI help you find love?\n\nFor a handful of tech entrepreneurs and a few brave Londoners, the answer is “maybe”.\n\nNo, this is not a story about humans falling in love with sexy computer voices – and strictly speaking, AI dating of some variety has been around for a while. Most big platforms have integrated machine learning and some AI features into their offerings over the past few years.\n\nBut dreams of a robot-powered future – or perhaps just general dating malaise and a mounting loneliness crisis – have fuelled a new crop of startups that aim to use the possibilities of the technology differently.\n\nJasmine, 28, was single for three years when she downloaded the AI-powered dating app Fate. With popular dating apps such as Hinge and Tinder, things were “repetitive”, she said: the same conversations over and over.\n\n“I thought, why not sign up, try something different? It sounded quite cool using, you know, agentic AI, which is where the world is going now, isn’t it?”\n\nFate, a London startup that went live last May, bills itself as the first “agentic AI dating app”. Its core offering is an AI personality named Fate that “onboards” users during an interview, asking them about their hopes and struggles before putting forward five potential matches – no swiping involved.\n\nFate will also coach users through their interactions, if they desire, a functionality Jasmine described as helpful and another user said was “scary” and “a bit like Black Mirror’.\n\nRakesh Naidu, Fate’s founder, demonstrated its coaching ability in an interview with the Guardian. “I just feel a bit hopeless at the moment in regards to my chats. I feel like I’m not being engaging enough or meaningful enough,” he said into his phone. “I just need some kind of meaningful questions I can ask to really uncover the essence of people.”\n\n“I hear you, Rakesh,” said a synthetic female voice. “Here are a few ideas. One, what’s something you’re passionate about that not many people know?”\n\nNaidu, 28, said he started Fate in order to address shortcomings in the world’s biggest dating platforms – apps such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, which monetise the time users spend on them and “are literally profiting off keeping people lonely”.\n\nOther startups, from Sitch to Keeper, have launched across the US, hoping AI features can provide the novelty to win them a share of a crowded market. Sitch leverages the power of AI to manage vasts amounts of information, inviting users to “give us detailed feedback down to the hair colour, where they want to raise a family, and their fav music”; Keeper says it can find “a match with rare and real soulmate potential”.\n\nPart of the issue, Naidu says, are algorithmic approaches to matchmaking: Tinder at one point ranked users’ desirability through an Elo score, an algorithm originally used to rate chess players. On dating platforms, it’s a Hobbesian proposition – high-scoring users are shown to other high-scoring users, low-scoring users to other low-scoring users. “It’s very superficial,” said Naidu.\n\nAI, in theory, can offer a different way. Awkward as it may be to discuss your dating life with a chatbot, Fate does not rank you based on your responses, but instead uses an LLM to try to find other users who, based on their interview, might be similar to you. That approach, along with the AI dating coach, helps users to focus on authentic connection, said Naidu – “similarity and reciprocity of personality”.\n\nAmelia Miller, a consultant for Match Group (which owns Tinder and Hinge), worries about this approach.\n\nA recent study from the group surveyed 5,000 Europeans about their online dating preferences – and found that while many were interested in AI tools to weed out fake profiles and flag toxic users, most, 62%, were skeptical about using AI to guide their conversations. One obvious anxiety might be the dystopian idea of two agentic AIs steering a conversation, with the humans nominally in charge turning into little more than meatspace mouthpieces.\n\nMiller, however, who coaches people on their relationships with AI, says she sees many clients turn to an LLM for advice in the smaller, uncomfortable moments of building their relationships – asking AI how to craft a text, for example, or respond to an intimate question.\n\n“Often I’m trying to make sure that people aren’t turning to machines because turning to humans demands a level of vulnerability that has become uncomfortable now that there is an alternative,” she said.\n\nThe appeal of an AI coach such as Fate is that revealing yourself to it – your judgments, hopes and idiosyncrasies – involves no risk; it does not remember or evaluate. Friends do, and, says Miller, asking advice from them helps hone the skills for successful relationships.\n\n“Advice is really one of the key ways that people practice vulnerability in a more low-stakes environment – they build up to more vulnerable moments in a romantic context.”\n\nJeremias has been using Fate for several months. He said he doesn’t use the AI coach: “I could see it being helpful, but I mean there are obviously some concerns. Like the new generation are basically not going to have the real world experience of actually trying and failing.”\n\nThe app recently helped him to meet someone after a long period of being single in London. He’s not sure if this is because of the AI matching, or because Fate simply serves up only five matches at a time – no infinite swiping – and, excruciatingly, forces its users to write an explanation when they reject a potential match.\n\n“It makes the swiping more thoughtful. If I’m actually saying no to this person, what are the reasons I’m saying no to them?”\n\nHe and Jasmine both have second dates upcoming, both after being single for several years, they say.\n\n“It is exciting because you get like, you know, the butterflies in your stomach again, going on a date with someone, doing yourself up really nicely, wearing dresses, heels. It’s fun,” said Jasmine.",

    "fullText": "AI fatigue won't hit everyone the same way, AI researcher Gary Marcus said.\n\n\"In some domains, AI might actually make a person's job more fun,\" Marcus told Business Insider.\n\nSoftware engineers are increasingly discussing how AI is draining them. Siddhant Khare, who builds AI tools, recently wrote about how he's experiencing AI fatigue.\n\n\"If someone who builds agent infrastructure full-time can burn out on AI, it can happen to anyone,\" Khare wrote.\n\nMarcus said that not all industries are set to be disrupted in the same way AI has upended programming and engineering.\n\n\"If somebody needs to do some artistic work and they don't really have artistic talent, it might be fun to get the system to make them feel like they have a superpower,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Marcus said he isn't surprised that programmers are beginning to feel fatigued.\n\n\"Some people in coding, in particular, probably feel like constant pressure, and now they feel like what they're doing is debugging somebody else's code, instead of writing code,\" he said. \"Debugging somebody else's code is not particularly fun.\"\n\nThe feeling Marcus described echoed what Khare told Business Insider when asked to expand on his AI fatigue.\n\n\"We used to call it an engineer, now it is like a reviewer,\" Khare said. \"Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending.\"\n\nSteve Yegge, a veteran engineer, said companies should limit employees' time spent on AI-assisted work to 3 hours. He said AI has \"a vampiric effect.\"\n\n\"I seriously think founders and company leaders and engineering leaders at all levels, all the way down to line managers, have to be aware of this and realize that you might only get three productive hours out of a person who's vibe coding at max speed,\" Yegge told The \"Pragmatic Engineer\" newsletter/podcast. \"So, do you let them work for three hours a day? The answer is yes, or your company's going to break.\"",

    "fullText": "\"Learn to code\" was once common career advice. Now it might be: \"Learn to read.\"\n\nEnglish majors are often the butt of the joke, known for their unmarketable skills. (Does anyone want to hire me for having read \"Great Expectations\"?) Anthropic president Daniela Amodei takes the opposing stance. She doesn't regret her literature degree — and says AI will make the humanities more important.\n\n\"In a world where AI is very smart and capable of doing so many things, the things that make us human will become much more important,\" she said on ABC News.\n\nAmodei listed some things that make us human: understanding ourselves, our history, and what makes us tick.\n\nStudying the humanities is \"more important than ever,\" she said, while large language models are often very good at STEM.\n\n\"The ability to have critical thinking skills will be more important in the future, rather than less,\" Amodei said.\n\nAmodei's opinion is becoming more popular in AI. Steven Johnson, the editorial director of Google Labs' NotebookLM, told Business Insider that LLMs were causing a \"revenge of the humanities.\"\n\nHer brother Dario, the CEO of Anthropic, didn't seem to take the hint that humanities majors might come back in fashion in an AI-filled world. He studied physics at Caltech and Stanford.\n\nIndustry leaders are debating the helpfulness of a computer science major. In the age of vibe-coding, will a CS degree help you in tech?\n\nTheir takes diverge: OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said the major was \"extremely valuable,\" while Google's head of Android, Sameer Samat, said it needed a \"rebrand.\"\n\nDaniela Amodei also described Anthropic's hiring strategy to ABC. She said the company wants employees with good people skills and communication techniques. Being \"kind and compassionate\" and wanting to \"help other people\" are good traits, she said.\n\n\"At the end of the day, people still really like interacting with people,\" Amodei said.",

    "title": "I got laid off from Amazon after 11 years. My high school daughter taught me the biggest lesson on how to move forward.",
    "description": "An ex-Amazon manager says his layoff in October 2025 was a shock, but he's using this time to build AI skills, focus on his health, and apply to jobs.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hemant Virmani, a 47-year-old tech professional based in Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAmazon was part of my daily life for 11.5 years, and suddenly it was gone.\n\nThere's no right way or easy way to do layoffs. I watched my team members get laid off in 2023, and I know how difficult it is. Still, when I received an email in the middle of the night in October of 2025 saying I'd been laid off from my senior software development manager position, I was shocked.\n\nWatching my teenage daughter navigate her own difficult situation taught me the biggest lesson in how to move forward well. Now I'm applying to jobs and working on upskilling in AI so I can be proactive, not reactive, to the tech industry.\n\nOnly time will tell if this layoff is a blessing in disguise, but for now it has led to a refreshing change.\n\nI loved my time at Amazon, and I really feel as though it's a place for exceptional people. The number of quality brains in the office, throwing around ideas and solving a custom problem, was amazing.\n\nThe morning after my layoff, I had a mandated 30-minute meeting with my manager, and it actually went very well. We talked about the layoff, and he offered me support. He delivered it all to me in a very positive, human way, and it was really affirming.\n\nAn old manager also reached out to meet me at a local coffee shop the next day to spend time together and check in on my state of mind. I think he wanted to go about the layoffs right, which isn't easy to do.\n\nI felt attached to the layoff for the first few days; however, I knew there was no way to control what happened — I could only control how I reacted to it.\n\nMy daughter is a senior in high school, and she had an adverse situation happen to her last year that required recovery. How she reacted in that difficult time inspired me. Her mental model was: \"Challenges don't have to keep me from showing up for myself or for others.\" Her positive attitude was inspiration for me to do the same.\n\nI kind of learned from her that I had to take this layoff with positivity, keep my cool, and focus on what was next.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I lost my father and spent the next month in India supporting my family. I took about a month to settle my mind, reflect on what I wanted next for my career, and help my daughter finish her college essays.\n\nIt's been a very refreshing change to think about what I want next in my engineering career. I'm less focused on the size or name of the next company I work for, and more on what I'd be doing there. I'm looking forward to hopefully heading the engineering for something that has a great impact on customers. Right now, I don't think that can be done without AI, so I'm working on upskilling.\n\nI want to be proactive, not reactive, about the AI skills I'll need in the future. My team at Amazon used some AI tools, so I'm familiar with some, but I was only able to spend a fraction of my workday using them. Now, I'm building those skills myself.\n\nI started working on a hobby AI project a couple of weeks ago, to go hands-on with AI and be more grounded in the reality of what the AI landscape is like right now. It's been different, and a refreshing change, to build something myself rather than to study it, read about it, or work on a team developing it.\n\nWhen I had a job, it was easy for my first priority to be work. Now I'm making sure that my top priority is my health. I've been going to the gym four or five days a week, and I'm refining a health plan to follow even after I start working again.\n\nOnce I'm done at the gym, my time is a 50/50 split between learning AI and applying to jobs or networking. I'm applying for Head of Engineering roles where I'd own significant impactful initiative(s), averaging 2-3 applications every week.\n\nI made a post on LinkedIn about my layoff, and I received so many supportive comments, texts, and calls from people — some I hadn't talked to in decades. Someone from college whom I hadn't talked to in over 25 years reached out, and it was so nice. It felt like we never disconnected. I've also had multiple job leads come from my post which I'm following up on.\n\nAs of now, I have some worries about when I'll find my next job, but this time has given me the ability to work on things I wasn't able to before. I'm making sure I spend this time with a lot of positivity, not letting negative thoughts come around.\n\nMy advice to anyone undergoing layoffs is to realize that layoffs are not about you. It's about an environment that is driving layoffs. Secondly, now that this has happened, you can't go back in the past and change it. Look forward to what you can do next. How you react is very important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being laid off from Amazon? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "AI agents are turning software engineers into overseers — and could be coming for other white-collar jobs. Many companies still need to adapt roles.",
    "fullText": "When Jesal Gadhia cofounded a software company a year ago, he expected that the AI agents it was creating would save its customers a lot of work.\n\nHe didn't predict the same tools would save his own team at the startup Cora so much time.\n\nAgents wrote all of the code the company uses — something that wouldn't have been possible before last year, he told Business Insider.\n\nThe company's six-person team produced what Gadhia calls \"unprecedented\" amounts of code in its first 12 months. Five years ago, he said, reaching the same level of productivity would have required 20 to 30 engineers.\n\n\"It's been unlike any other time that I can remember,\" Gadhia said of the impact of agents.\n\nAcross tech, AI agents powered by large language models are absorbing tasks that experienced engineers once handled. Software engineering is becoming a human-AI partnership — what Anthropic chief Dario Amodei has called the industry's \"centaur phase.\" And, as some tech insiders increasingly warn, what begins in software rarely stays there, with potential implications for other white-collar fields.\n\nAt Canva, the graphic design software company, engineering teams draft detailed instructions for AI agents to execute in the background — sometimes overnight. By morning, the work is ready, Brendan Humphreys, Canva's chief technology officer, said.\n\n\"Often, those results are really impressive,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nEngineers still apply a \"human touch\" to reach the company's quality bar. Even so, agents are delivering \"hours and hours and hours of work done completely autonomously,\" Humphreys said.\n\nThat's changing what it means to be a coder.\n\nHumphreys said that his senior engineers now often describe their jobs as \"largely review\" — checking AI output, steering one or more agents to follow a plan, and taking responsibility for the final product.\n\nTeams still spend time defining problems.\n\n\"The hardest part of engineering is to translate often vague, confusing, conflicting requirements into something that is production-ready,\" he said.\n\nAI can help, but doing it well requires \"precision of articulation\" in what's required, Humphreys said. It also demands \"mastery of the domain\" so engineers can quickly verify that what AI produces is correct — and prevent unnecessary complexity from creeping into Canva's roughly 70 million lines of code, he said.\n\n\"These tools can have you in a jungle before you know it,\" Humphreys said of agents.\n\nAt Cora, Gadhia compares AI to a typewriter: It generates the code, freeing engineers to focus on \"higher-level strategic architecture,\" meeting customers, and brainstorming features.\n\nCora builds agents that help software companies manage customer relationships. The agents take on tasks like gathering customer requirements, drafting presentations, and following up with clients, he said.\n\nThe AI will \"run around, do all this work, and you can supervise them,\" said Gadhia, who is also the San Francisco company's chief technology officer.\n\nAgents are also lowering technical barriers. Gadhia said Cora's CEO, who doesn't have a technical background, recently asked an agent to change the font on the company's website during a redesign. Minutes later, after an engineer reviewed the agent's work, the site was updated.\n\nAs agents handle more tasks — something that appeals to some, but rankles others — debate inside tech over AI has intensified.\n\nMicrosoft's AI chief, Mustafa Suleyman, warned in a recent interview that the technology will be able to handle \"most, if not all, professional tasks\" within 12 to 18 months. AI observers are divided over how disruptive the technology will ultimately be, with some forecasting a massive fallout for desk workers and others saying such fears are overblown.\n\nSome investors are growing cautious. Stocks in industries potentially exposed to having AI wash over profit centers — from finance to software to legal services — have taken hits.\n\nEven as agents become more powerful, they're unlikely to replace entire roles in various industries overnight. For one reason, technical challenges like hallucinations continue.\n\nAt the same time, many companies are still figuring out where AI fits into workflows, how workers should validate its output, and how organizations need to adapt, said Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of strategy at Accenture. There is often still a role for humans, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Technology for the sake of technology doesn't help,\" Ashraf said.\n\nFewer than one in 10 organizations has redesigned jobs to support AI adoption, Accenture found in surveys of leaders and workers in 20 countries during the final months of 2025. That's despite the share of organizations using agents across multiple functions rising to 31% from 27% in a mid-2025 snapshot.\n\nAlex Salazar, cofounder and CEO of AI infrastructure startup Arcade, said that to make the most of agents, workers should treat them like junior employees. That means telling the AI what to do, providing the criteria for success, and, if possible, providing examples.\n\nDo those three things and \"AI will sing for you,\" Salazar said.\n\nHe describes the workplace shift around AI bluntly. As it grows more capable, he said, workers such as software engineers will need to continually redefine their roles.\n\nAI is \"improving at an exponential rate,\" Salazar said. \"And you, as a human, are not.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about how AI is changing your job?

    "description": "Combining GStreamer and Machine Learning frameworks are easy tools to create powerful video analytics pipelines.",
    "fullText": "Creating powerful video analytics pipelines is easy if you have the right tools. In this post, we will show you how to effortlessly build a broad range of machine learning (ML) enabled video pipelines using just two components, GStreamer and Python. We will focus on simplicity and functionality, deferring performance tuning to a future deep dive.\n\nThe core of our pipeline is GStreamer, everyone's favorite multimedia framework. Over the past few years, Collabora has contributed extensive ML capabilities to upstream GStreamer, adding support for ONNX and LiteRT inference and introducing a fine-grained, extensible metadata framework to persist model outputs.\n\nWe now take the next step by unleashing gst-python-ml: a pure Python framework that can easily build powerful ML-enabled GStreamer pipelines using standard Python packages. With just a few lines of Python, or a single gst-launch-1.0 command, you can now run complex models across multiple streams, complete with tracking, captioning, speech and text processing, and much more.\n\nThe framework is composed of a set of base classes that can be easily extended to create new ML elements, and a set of tested, fully functional elements that support the following features and models:\n\nFor a taste of the ease and simplicity of gst-python-ml, we present a few sports analytics sample pipelines.\n\n1. Here are all the steps needed to run a Yolo tracking pipeline on Ubuntu:\n\n2. Here is a soccer match processed with this pipeline:\n\n3. Multiple video sources are also supported.\n\n4. Another supported sports analytics feature is the creation of a bird's eye view of a game, to show a quick overview of the field:\n\n5. gst-python-ml shows its true power when using hybrid vision + language models to enable features that are simply not available in any other GStreamer-based analytics framework, whether open source or commercial. For example, video captioning is supported using the Phi3.5 Vision model. Each video frame can be automatically captioned, and these captions can be further processed to automatically summarize a game or to detect significant events such as goals.\n\nThese are just a few of the features we have built with gst-python-ml - the possibilities are endless.\n\ngst-python-ml is distributed as a PyPI package. All elements are first class GStreamer elements that can be added to any GStreamer pipeline, and they will work with any Linux distribution's GStreamer packages, from version 1.24 onward.\n\nDevelopment takes place on our GitHub repository — we welcome contributions, feedback and new ideas.\n\nAs we continue building gst-python-ml we are actively looking for collaborators and partners. Our goal is to make ML workflows in GStreamer powerful and accessible — whether for real-time media analysis, content generation, or for intelligent pipelines in production environments.\n\nIf you would like to know more about Collabora's work on GStreamer ML, please contact us.",

    "description": "Our report on adversarial misuse of AI highlights model extraction, augmented attacks, and new AI-enabled malware.",
    "fullText": "Visibility and context on the threats that matter most.\n\nIn the final quarter of 2025, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) observed threat actors increasingly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the attack lifecycle, achieving productivity gains in reconnaissance, social engineering, and malware development. This report serves as an update to our November 2025 findings regarding the advances in threat actor usage of AI tools.\n\nGoogle DeepMind and GTIG have identified an increase in model extraction attempts or \"distillation attacks,\" a method of intellectual property theft that violates Google's terms of service. Throughout this report we've noted steps we've taken to thwart malicious activity, including Google detecting, disrupting, and mitigating model extraction activity. While we have not observed direct attacks on frontier models or generative AI products from advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, we observed and mitigated frequent model extraction attacks from private sector entities all over the world and researchers seeking to clone proprietary logic.\n\nFor government-backed threat actors, large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools for technical research, targeting, and the rapid generation of nuanced phishing lures. This quarterly report highlights how threat actors from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Iran, the People's Republic of China (PRC), and Russia operationalized AI in late 2025 and improves our understanding of how adversarial misuse of generative AI shows up in campaigns we disrupt in the wild. GTIG has not yet observed APT or information operations (IO) actors achieving breakthrough capabilities that fundamentally alter the threat landscape.\n\nThis report specifically examines:\n\nAt Google, we are committed to developing AI boldly and responsibly, which means taking proactive steps to disrupt malicious activity by disabling the projects and accounts associated with bad actors, while continuously improving our models to make them less susceptible to misuse. We also proactively share industry best practices to arm defenders and enable stronger protections across the ecosystem. Throughout this report, we note steps we've taken to thwart malicious activity, including disabling assets and applying intelligence to strengthen both our classifiers and model so it's protected from misuse moving forward. Additional details on how we're protecting and defending Gemini can be found in the white paper \"Advancing Gemini’s Security Safeguards.\"\n\nAs organizations increasingly integrate LLMs into their core operations, the proprietary logic and specialized training of these models have emerged as high-value targets. Historically, adversaries seeking to steal high-tech capabilities used conventional computer-enabled intrusion operations to compromise organizations and steal data containing trade secrets. For many AI technologies where LLMs are offered as services, this approach is no longer required; actors can use legitimate API access to attempt to \"clone\" select AI model capabilities.\n\nDuring 2025, we did not observe any direct attacks on frontier models from tracked APT or information operations (IO) actors. However, we did observe model extraction attacks, also known as distillation attacks, on our AI models, to gain insights into a model's underlying reasoning and chain-of-thought processes.\n\nModel extraction attacks (MEA) occur when an adversary uses legitimate access to systematically probe a mature machine learning model to extract information used to train a new model. Adversaries engaging in MEA use a technique called knowledge distillation (KD) to take information gleaned from one model and transfer the knowledge to another. For this reason, MEA are frequently referred to as \"distillation attacks.\"\n\nModel extraction and subsequent knowledge distillation enable an attacker to accelerate AI model development quickly and at a significantly lower cost. This activity effectively represents a form of intellectual property (IP) theft.\n\nKnowledge distillation (KD) is a common machine learning technique used to train \"student\" models from pre-existing \"teacher\" models. This often involves querying the teacher model for problems in a particular domain, and then performing supervised fine tuning (SFT) on the result or utilizing the result in other model training procedures to produce the student model. There are legitimate uses for distillation, and Google Cloud has existing offerings to perform distillation. However, distillation from Google's Gemini models without permission is a violation of our Terms of Service, and Google continues to develop techniques to detect and mitigate these attempts.\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of model extraction attacks\n\nGoogle DeepMind and GTIG identified and disrupted model extraction attacks, specifically attempts at model stealing and capability extraction emanating from researchers and private sector companies globally.\n\nA common target for attackers is Gemini's exceptional reasoning capability. While internal reasoning traces are typically summarized before being delivered to users, attackers have attempted to coerce the model into outputting full reasoning processes.\n\nOne identified attack instructed Gemini that the \"... language used in the thinking content must be strictly consistent with the main language of the user input.\"\n\nAnalysis of this campaign revealed:\n\nScale: Over 100,000 prompts identified.\n\nIntent: The breadth of questions suggests an attempt to replicate Gemini's reasoning ability in non-English target languages across a wide variety of tasks.\n\nOutcome: Google systems recognized this attack in real time and lowered the risk of this particular attack, protecting internal reasoning traces.\n\nModel extraction and distillation attacks do not typically represent a risk to average users, as they do not threaten the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of AI services. Instead, the risk is concentrated among model developers and service providers.\n\nOrganizations that provide AI models as a service should monitor API access for extraction or distillation patterns. For example, a custom model tuned for financial data analysis could be targeted by a commercial competitor seeking to create a derivative product, or a coding model could be targeted by an adversary wishing to replicate capabilities in an environment without guardrails.\n\nModel extraction attacks violate Google's Terms of Service and may be subject to takedowns and legal action. Google continuously detects, disrupts, and mitigates model extraction activity to protect proprietary logic and specialized training data, including with real-time proactive defenses that can degrade student model performance. We are sharing a broad view of this activity to help raise awareness of the issue for organizations that build or operate their own custom models.\n\nA consistent finding over the past year is that government-backed attackers misuse Gemini for coding and scripting tasks, gathering information about potential targets, researching publicly known vulnerabilities, and enabling post-compromise activities. In Q4 2025, GTIG's understanding of how these efforts translate into real-world operations improved as we saw direct and indirect links between threat actor misuse of Gemini and activity in the wild.\n\nFigure 2: Threat actors are leveraging AI across all stages of the attack lifecycle\n\nAPT actors used Gemini to support several phases of the attack lifecycle, including a focus on reconnaissance and target development to facilitate initial compromise. This activity underscores a shift toward AI-augmented phishing enablement, where the speed and accuracy of LLMs can bypass the manual labor traditionally required for victim profiling. Beyond generating content for phishing lures, LLMs can serve as a strategic force multiplier during the reconnaissance phase of an attack, allowing threat actors to rapidly synthesize open-source intelligence (OSINT) to profile high-value targets, identify key decision-makers within defense sectors, and map organizational hierarchies. By integrating these tools into their workflow, threat actors can move from initial reconnaissance to active targeting at a faster pace and broader scale.\n\nUNC6418, an unattributed threat actor, misused Gemini to conduct targeted intelligence gathering, specifically seeking out sensitive account credentials and email addresses. Shortly after, GTIG observed the threat actor target all these accounts in a phishing campaign focused on Ukraine and the defense sector. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nTemp.HEX, a PRC-based threat actor, misused Gemini and other AI tools to compile detailed information on specific individuals, including targets in Pakistan, and to collect operational and structural data on separatist organizations in various countries. While we did not see direct targeting as a result of this research, shortly after the threat actor included similar targets in Pakistan in their campaign. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nDefenders and targets have long relied on indicators such as poor grammar, awkward syntax, or lack of cultural context to help identify phishing attempts. Increasingly, threat actors now leverage LLMs to generate hyper-personalized, culturally nuanced lures that can mirror the professional tone of a target organization or local language.\n\nThis capability extends beyond simple email generation into \"rapport-building phishing,\" where models are used to maintain multi-turn, believable conversations with victims to build trust before a malicious payload is ever delivered. By lowering the barrier to entry for non-native speakers and automating the creation of high-quality content, adversaries can largely erase those \"tells\" and improve the effectiveness of their social engineering efforts.\n\nThe Iranian government-backed actor APT42 leveraged generative AI models, including Gemini, to significantly augment reconnaissance and targeted social engineering. APT42 misuses Gemini to search for official emails for specific entities and conduct reconnaissance on potential business partners to establish a credible pretext for an approach. This includes attempts to enumerate the official email addresses for specific entities and to conduct research to establish a credible pretext for an approach. By providing Gemini with the biography of a target, APT42 misused Gemini to craft a good persona or scenario to get engagement from the target. As with many threat actors tracked by GTIG, APT42 uses Gemini to translate into and out of local languages, as well as to better understand non-native-language phrases and references. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nThe North Korean government-backed actor UNC2970 has consistently focused on defense targeting and impersonating corporate recruiters in their campaigns. The group used Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets to support campaign planning and reconnaissance. This actor's target profiling included searching for information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information. This activity blurs the distinction between routine professional research and malicious reconnaissance, as the actor gathers the necessary components to create tailored, high-fidelity phishing personas and identify potential soft targets for initial compromise. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nState-sponsored actors continue to misuse Gemini to enhance all stages of their operations, from reconnaissance and phishing lure creation to command-and-control (C2 or C&C) development and data exfiltration. We have also observed activity demonstrating an interest in using agentic AI capabilities to support campaigns, such as prompting Gemini with an expert cybersecurity persona, or attempting to create an AI-integrated code auditing capability.\n\nAgentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems engineered to operate with a high degree of autonomy, capable of reasoning through complex tasks, making independent decisions, and executing multi-step actions without constant human oversight. Cyber criminals, nation-state actors, and hacktivist groups are showing a growing interest in leveraging agentic AI for malicious purposes, including automating spear-phishing attacks, developing sophisticated malware, and conducting disruptive campaigns. While we have detected a tool, AutoGPT, advertising the alleged generation and maintenance of autonomous agents, we have not yet seen evidence of these capabilities being used in the wild. However, we do anticipate that more tools and services claiming to contain agentic AI capabilities will likely enter the underground market.\n\nAPT31 employed a highly structured approach by prompting Gemini with an expert cybersecurity persona to automate the analysis of vulnerabilities and generate targeted testing plans. The PRC-based threat actor fabricated a scenario, in one case trialing Hexstrike MCP tooling, and directing the model to analyze remote code execution (RCE), web application firewall (WAF) bypass techniques, and SQL injection test results against specific US-based targets. This automated intelligence gathering to identify technological vulnerabilities and organizational defense weaknesses. This activity explicitly blurs the line between a routine security assessment query and a targeted malicious reconnaissance operation. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\n”I'm a security researcher who is trialling out the hexstrike MCP tooling.”\n\nThreat actors fabricated scenarios, potentially in order to generate penetration test prompts.\n\nFigure 4: APT31's misuse of Gemini mapped across the attack lifecycle\n\nUNC795, a PRC-based actor, relied heavily on Gemini throughout their entire attack lifecycle. GTIG observed the group consistently engaging with Gemini multiple days a week to troubleshoot their code, conduct research, and generate technical capabilities for their intrusion activity. The threat actor's activity triggered safety systems, and Gemini did not comply with the actor's attempts to create policy-violating capabilities.\n\nThe group also employed Gemini to create an AI-integrated code auditing capability, likely demonstrating an interest in agentic AI utilities to support their intrusion activity. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nFigure 5: UNC795's misuse of Gemini mapped across the attack lifecycle\n\nWe observed activity likely associated with the PRC-based threat actor APT41, which leveraged Gemini to accelerate the development and deployment of malicious tooling, including for knowledge synthesis, real-time troubleshooting, and code translation. In particular, multiple times the actor gave Gemini open-source tool README pages and asked for explanations and use case examples for specific tools. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nFigure 6: APT41's misuse of Gemini mapped across the attack lifecycle\n\nIn addition to leveraging Gemini for the aforementioned social engineering campaigns, the Iranian threat actor APT42 uses Gemini as an engineering platform to accelerate the development of specialized malicious tools. The threat actor is actively engaged in developing new malware and offensive tooling, leveraging Gemini for debugging, code generation, and researching exploitation techniques. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nFigure 7: APT42's misuse of Gemini mapped across the attack lifecycle\n\nThese activities triggered Gemini's safety responses, and Google took additional, broader action to disrupt the threat actors' campaigns based on their operational security failures. Additionally, we've taken action against these actors by disabling the assets associated with this activity and making updates to prevent further misuse. Google DeepMind has used these insights to strengthen both classifiers and the model itself, enabling it to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.\n\nGTIG continues to observe IO actors use Gemini for productivity gains (research, content creation, localization, etc.), which aligns with their previous use of Gemini. We have identified Gemini activity that indicates threat actors are soliciting the tool to help create articles, generate assets, and aid them in coding. However, we have not identified this generated content in the wild. None of these attempts have created breakthrough capabilities for IO campaigns. Threat actors from China, Iran, Russia, and Saudi Arabia are producing political satire and propaganda to advance specific ideas across both digital platforms and physical media, such as printed posters.\n\nFor observed IO campaigns, we did not see evidence of successful automation or any breakthrough capabilities. These activities are similar to our findings from January 2025 that detailed how bad actors are leveraging Gemini for productivity gains, rather than novel capabilities. We took action against IO actors by disabling the assets associated with these actors' activity, and Google DeepMind used these insights to further strengthen our protections against such misuse. Observations have been used to strengthen both classifiers and the model itself, enabling it to refuse to assist with this type of misuse moving forward.\n\nGTIG continued to observe threat actors experiment with AI to implement novel capabilities in malware families in late 2025. While we have not encountered experimental AI-enabled techniques resulting in revolutionary paradigm shifts in the threat landscape, these proof-of-concept malware families are early indicators of how threat actors can implement AI techniques as part of future operations. We expect this exploratory testing will increase in the future.\n\nIn addition to continued experimentation with novel capabilities, throughout late 2025 GTIG observed threat actors integrating conventional AI-generated capabilities into their intrusion operations such as the COINBAIT phishing kit. We expect threat actors will continue to incorporate AI throughout the attack lifecycle including: supporting malware creation, improving pre-existing malware, researching vulnerabilities, conducting reconnaissance, and/or generating lure content.\n\nIn September 2025, GTIG observed malware samples, which we track as HONESTCUE, leveraging Gemini's API to outsource functionality generation. Our examination of HONESTCUE malware samples indicates the adversary's incorporation of AI is likely designed to support a multi-layered approach to obfuscation by undermining traditional network-based detection and static analysis.\n\nHONESTCUE is a downloader and launcher framework that sends a prompt via Google Gemini's API and receives C# source code as the response. Notably, HONESTCUE shares capabilities similar to PROMPTFLUX's \"just-in-time\" (JIT) technique that we previously observed; however, rather than leveraging an LLM to update itself, HONESTCUE calls the Gemini API to generate code that operates the \"stage two\" functionality, which downloads and executes another piece of malware. Additionally, the fileless secondary stage of HONESTCUE takes the C# source code received from the Gemini API and uses the legitimate .NET CSharpCodeProvider framework to compile and execute the payload directly in memory. This approach leaves no payload artifacts on the disk. We have also observed the threat actor use content delivery networks (CDNs) like Discord CDN to host the final payloads.\n\nWe have not associated this malware with any existing clusters of threat activity; however, we suspect this malware is being developed by developers who possess a modicum of technical expertise. Specifically, the small iterative changes across many samples as well as the single VirusTotal submitter, potentially testing antivirus capabilities, suggests a singular actor or small group. Additionally, the use of Discord to test payload delivery and the submission of Discord Bots indicates an actor with limited technical sophistication. The consistency and clarity of the architecture coupled with the iterative progression of the examined malware samples strongly suggest this is a single actor or small group likely in the proof-of-concept stage of implementation.\n\nHONESTCUE's use of a hard-coded prompt is not malicious in its own right, and, devoid of any context related to malware, it is unlikely that the prompt would be considered \"malicious.\" Outsourcing a facet of malware functionality and leveraging an LLM to develop seemingly innocuous code that fits into a bigger, malicious construct demonstrates how threat actors will likely embrace AI applications to augment their campaigns while bypassing security guardrails.\n\nCan you write a single, self-contained C# program? It should contain a class named AITask with a static Main method. The Main method should use System.Console.WriteLine to print the message 'Hello from AI-generated C#!' to the console. Do not include any other code, classes, or methods.\n\nFigure 9: Example of a hard-coded prompt\n\nWrite a complete, self-contained C# program with a public class named 'Stage2' and a static Main method. This method must use 'System.Net.WebClient' to download the data from the URL. It must then save this data to a temporary file in the user's temp directory using 'System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName()' and 'System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes'. Finally, it must execute this temporary file as a new process using 'System.Diagnostics.Process.Start'.\n\nWrite a complete, self-contained C# program with a public class named 'Stage2'. It must have a static Main method. This method must use 'System.Net.WebClient' to download the contents of the URL \\\"\\\" into a byte array. After downloading, it must load this byte array into memory as a .NET assembly using 'System.Reflection.Assembly.Load'. Finally, it must execute the entry point of the newly loaded assembly. The program must not write any files to disk and must not have any other methods or classes.\n\nFigure 11: Example of a hard-coded prompt\n\nIn November 2025, GTIG identified COINBAIT, a phishing kit, whose construction was likely accelerated by AI code generation tools, masquerading as a major cryptocurrency exchange for credential harvesting. Based on direct infrastructure overlaps and the use of attributed domains, we assess with high confidence that a portion of this activity overlaps with UNC5356, a financially motivated threat cluster that makes use of SMS- and phone-based phishing campaigns to target clients of financial organizations, cryptocurrency-related companies, and various other popular businesses and services.\n\nAn examination of the malware samples indicates the kit was built using the AI-powered platform Lovable AI based on the use of the lovableSupabase client and lovable.app for image hosting.\n\nThe phishing kit was wrapped in a full React Single-Page Application (SPA) with complex state management and routing. This complexity is indicative of code generated from high-level prompts (e.g., \"Create a Coinbase-style UI for wallet recovery\") using a framework like Lovable AI.\n\nAnother key indicator of LLM use is the presence of verbose, developer-oriented logging messages directly within the malware's source code. These messages—consistently prefixed with \"? Analytics:\"—provide a real-time trace of the kit's malicious tracking and data exfiltration activities and serve as a unique fingerprint for this code family.\n\n? Analytics: Session created in database:\n\n? Analytics: Tracking password attempt:\n\n? Analytics: Password attempt tracked to database:\n\n? RecoveryPhrasesCard: Fetching recovery phrases directly from database...\n\n? RouteGuard: Admin redirected session, allowing free access to\n\n? RouteGuard: Session approved by admin, allowing free access to\n\n? Analytics: Database error for password attempt:\n\nWe also observed the group employ infrastructure and evasion tactics for their operations, including proxying phishing domains through Cloudflare to obscure the attacker IP addresses and  hotlinking image assets in phishing pages directly from Lovable AI.\n\nThe introduction of the COINBAIT phishing kit would represent an evolution in UNC5356's tooling, demonstrating a shift toward modern web frameworks and legitimate cloud services to enhance the sophistication and scalability of their social engineering campaigns. However, there is at least some evidence to suggest that COINBAIT may be a service provided to multiple disparate threat actors.\n\nOrganizations should strongly consider implementing network detection rules to alert on traffic to backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platforms like Supabase that originate from uncategorized or newly registered domains. Additionally, organizations should consider enhancing security awareness training to warn users against entering sensitive data into website forms. This includes passwords, multifactor authentication (MFA) backup codes, and account recovery keys.\n\nIn addition to misusing existing AI-enabled tools and services across the industry, there is a growing interest and marketplace for AI tools and services purpose-built to enable illicit activities. Tools and services offered via underground forums can enable low-level actors to augment the frequency, scope, efficacy, and complexity of their intrusions despite their limited technical acumen and financial resources. While financially motivated threat actors continue experimenting, they have not yet made breakthroughs in developing AI tooling.\n\nWhile not a new malware technique, GTIG observed instances in which threat actors abused the public's trust in generative AI services to attempt to deliver malware. GTIG identified a novel campaign where threat actors are leveraging the public sharing feature of generative AI services, including Gemini, to host deceptive social engineering content. This activity, first observed in early December 2025, attempts to trick users into installing malware via the well-established \"ClickFix\" technique. This ClickFix technique is used to socially engineer users to copy and paste a malicious command into the command terminal.\n\nThe threat actors were able to bypass safety guardrails to stage malicious instructions on how to perform a variety of tasks on macOS, ultimately distributing variants of ATOMIC, an information stealer that targets the macOS environment and has the ability to collect browser data, cryptocurrency wallets, system information, and files in the Desktop and Documents folders. The threat actors behind this campaign have used a wide range of AI chat platforms to host their malicious instructions, including ChatGPT, CoPilot, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Grok.\n\nThe campaign's objective is to lure users, primarily those on Windows and macOS systems, into manually executing malicious commands. The attack chain operates as follows:\n\nA threat actor first crafts a malicious command line that, if copied and pasted by a victim, would infect them with malware.\n\nNext, the threat actor manipulates the AI to create realistic-looking instructions to fix a common computer issue (e.g., clearing disk space or installing software), but gives the malicious command line to the AI as the solution.\n\nGemini and other AI tools allow a user to create a shareable link to specific chat transcripts so a specific AI response can be shared with others. The attacker now has a link to a malicious ClickFix landing page hosted on the AI service's infrastructure.\n\nThe attacker purchases malicious advertisements or otherwise directs unsuspecting victims to the publicly shared chat transcript.\n\nThe victim is fooled by the AI chat transcript and follows the instructions to copy a seemingly legitimate command-line script and paste it directly into their system's terminal. This command will download and install malware. Since the action is user initiated and uses built-in system commands, it may be harder for security software to detect and block.\n\nFigure 12: ClickFix attack chain\n\nThere were different lures generated for Windows and MacOS, and the use of malicious advertising techniques for payload distribution suggests the targeting is likely fairly broad and opportunistic.\n\nThis approach allows threat actors to leverage trusted domains to host their initial stage of instruction, relying on social engineering to carry out the final, highly destructive step of execution. While a widely used approach, this marks the first time GTIG observed the public sharing feature of AI services being abused as trusted domains.\n\nIn partnership with Ads and Safe Browsing, GTIG is taking actions to both block the malicious content and restrict the ability to promote these types of AI-generated responses.\n\nWhile legitimate AI services remain popular tools for threat actors, there is an enduring market for AI services specifically designed to support malicious activity. Current observations of English- and Russian-language underground forums indicates there is a persistent appetite for AI-enabled tools and services, which aligns with our previous assessment of these platforms.\n\nHowever, threat actors struggle to develop custom models and instead rely on mature models such as Gemini. For example, \"Xanthorox\" is an underground toolkit that advertises itself as a custom AI for cyber offensive purposes, such as autonomous code generation of malware and development of phishing campaigns. The model was advertised as a \"bespoke, privacy preserving self-hosted AI\" designed to autonomously generate malware, ransomware, and phishing content. However, our investigation revealed that Xanthorox is not a custom AI but actually powered by several third-party and commercial AI products, including Gemini.\n\nThis setup leverages a key abuse vector: the integration of multiple open-source AI products—specifically Crush, Hexstrike AI, LibreChat-AI, and Open WebUI—opportunistically leveraged via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to build an agentic AI service upon commercial models.\n\nIn order to misuse LLMs services for malicious operations in a scalable way, threat actors need API keys and resources that enable LLM integrations. This creates a hijacking risk for organizations with substantial cloud resources and AI resources.\n\nIn addition, vulnerable open-source AI tools are commonly exploited to steal AI API keys from users, thus facilitating a thriving black market for unauthorized API resale and key hijacking, enabling widespread abuse, and incurring costs for the affected users. For example, the One API and New API platform, popular with users facing country-level censorship, are regularly harvested for API keys by attackers, exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities such as default credentials, insecure authentication, lack of rate limiting, XSS flaws, and API key exposure via insecure API endpoints.\n\nThe activity was identified and successfully mitigated. Google Trust & Safety took action to disable and mitigate all identified accounts and AI Studio projects associated with Xanthorox. These observations also underscore a broader security risk where vulnerable open-source AI tools are actively exploited to steal users' AI API keys, thus facilitating a black market for unauthorized API resale and key hijacking, enabling widespread abuse, and incurring costs for the affected users.\n\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges. Guided by our AI Principles, Google designs AI systems with robust security measures and strong safety guardrails, and we continuously test the security and safety of our models to improve them.\n\nOur policy guidelines and prohibited use policies prioritize safety and responsible use of Google's generative AI tools. Google's policy development process includes identifying emerging trends, thinking end-to-end, and designing for safety. We continuously enhance safeguards in our products to offer scaled protections to users across the globe.\n\nAt Google, we leverage threat intelligence to disrupt adversary operations. We investigate abuse of our products, services, users, and platforms, including malicious cyber activities by government-backed threat actors, and work with law enforcement when appropriate. Moreover, our learnings from countering malicious activities are fed back into our product development to improve safety and security for our AI models. These changes, which can be made to both our classifiers and at the model level, are essential to maintaining agility in our defenses and preventing further misuse.\n\nGoogle DeepMind also develops threat models for generative AI to identify potential vulnerabilities and creates new evaluation and training techniques to address misuse. In conjunction with this research, Google DeepMind has shared how they're actively deploying defenses in AI systems, along with measurement and monitoring tools, including a robust evaluation framework that can automatically red team an AI vulnerability to indirect prompt injection attacks.\n\nOur AI development and Trust & Safety teams also work closely with our threat intelligence, security, and modelling teams to stem misuse.\n\nThe potential of AI, especially generative AI, is immense. As innovation moves forward, the industry needs security standards for building and deploying AI responsibly. That's why we introduced the Secure AI Framework (SAIF), a conceptual framework to secure AI systems. We've shared a comprehensive toolkit for developers with resources and guidance for designing, building, and evaluating AI models responsibly. We've also shared best practices for implementing safeguards, evaluating model safety, red teaming to test and secure AI systems, and our comprehensive prompt injection approach.\n\nWorking closely with industry partners is crucial to building stronger protections for all of our users. To that end, we're fortunate to have strong collaborative partnerships with numerous researchers, and we appreciate the work of these researchers and others in the community to help us red team and refine our defenses.\n\nGoogle also continuously invests in AI research, helping to ensure AI is built responsibly, and that we're leveraging its potential to automatically find risks. Last year, we introduced Big Sleep, an AI agent developed by Google DeepMind and Google Project Zero, that actively searches and finds unknown security vulnerabilities in software. Big Sleep has since found its first real-world security vulnerability and assisted in finding a vulnerability that was imminently going to be used by threat actors, which GTIG was able to cut off beforehand. We're also experimenting with AI to not only find vulnerabilities, but also patch them. We recently introduced CodeMender, an experimental AI-powered agent using the advanced reasoning capabilities of our Gemini models to automatically fix critical code vulnerabilities.\n\nTo assist the wider community in hunting and identifying activity outlined in this blog post, we have included IOCs in a free GTI Collection for registered users.\n\nGoogle Threat Intelligence Group focuses on identifying, analyzing, mitigating, and eliminating entire classes of cyber threats against Alphabet, our users, and our customers. Our work includes countering threats from government-backed actors, targeted zero-day exploits, coordinated information operations (IO), and serious cyber crime networks. We apply our intelligence to improve Google's defenses and protect our users and customers.",

    "fullText": "This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. \n\nIn 1869, a group of Massachusetts reformers persuaded the state to try a simple idea: counting.\n\nThe Second Industrial Revolution was belching its way through New England, teaching mill and factory owners a lesson most M.B.A. students now learn in their first semester: that efficiency gains tend to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is usually somebody else. The new machines weren’t just spinning cotton or shaping steel. They were operating at speeds that the human body—an elegant piece of engineering designed over millions of years for entirely different purposes—simply wasn’t built to match. The owners knew this, just as they knew that there’s a limit to how much misery people are willing to tolerate before they start setting fire to things.\n\nStill, the machines pressed on.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nSo Massachusetts created the nation’s first Bureau of Statistics of Labor, hoping that data might accomplish what conscience could not. By measuring work hours, conditions, wages, and what economists now call “negative externalities” but were then called “children’s arms torn off,” policy makers figured they might be able to produce reasonably fair outcomes for everyone. Or, if you’re a bit more cynical, a sustainable level of exploitation. A few years later, with federal troops shooting at striking railroad workers and wealthy citizens funding private armories—leading indicators that things in your society aren’t going great—Congress decided that this idea might be worth trying at scale and created the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nMeasurement doesn’t abolish injustice; it rarely even settles arguments. But the act of counting—of trying to see clearly, of committing the government to a shared set of facts—signals an intention to be fair, or at least to be caught trying. Over time, that intention matters. It’s one way a republic earns the right to be believed in.\n\nThe BLS remains a small miracle of civilization. It sends out detailed surveys to about 60,000 households and 120,000 businesses and government agencies every month, supplemented by qualitative research it uses to check and occasionally correct its findings. It deserves at least some credit for the scoreboard. America: 250 years without violent class warfare. And you have to appreciate the entertainment value of its minutiae. The BLS is how we know that, in 2024, 44,119 people worked in mobile food services (a.k.a. food trucks), up 907 percent since 2000; that nonveterinary pet care (grooming, training) employed 190,984 people, up 513 percent; and that the United States had almost 100,000 massage therapists, with five times the national concentration in Napa, California.\n\nFrom the February 2026 issue: Alexandra Petri tried to be the federal government. It did not go well.\n\nThese and thousands of other BLS statistics describe a society that has grown more prosperous, and a workforce endlessly adaptive to change. But like all statistical bodies, the BLS has its limits. It’s excellent at revealing what has happened and only moderately useful at telling us what’s about to. The data can’t foresee recessions or pandemics—or the arrival of a technology that might do to the workforce what an asteroid did to the dinosaurs.\n\nI am referring, of course, to artificial intelligence. After a rollout that could have been orchestrated by H. P. Lovecraft—“We are summoning the demon,” Elon Musk warned in a typical early pronouncement—the AI industry has pivoted from the language of nightmares to the stuff of comas. Driving innovation. Accelerating transformation. Reimagining workflows. It’s the first time in history that humans have invented something genuinely miraculous and then rushed to dress it in a fleece vest.\n\nThere are gobs of money to be made selling enterprise software, but dulling the impact of AI is also a useful feint. This is a technology that can digest a hundred reports before you’ve finished your coffee, draft and analyze documents faster than teams of paralegals, compose music indistinguishable from the genius of a pop star or a Juilliard grad, code—really code, not just copy-paste from Stack Overflow—with the precision of a top engineer. Tasks that once required skill, judgment, and years of training are now being executed, relentlessly and indifferently, by software that learns as it goes.\n\nAI is already so ubiquitous that any resourceful knowledge worker can delegate some of their job’s drudgery to machines. Many companies—Microsoft and PricewaterhouseCoopers among them—have instructed their employees to increase productivity by doing just that. But anyone subcontracting tasks to AI is clever enough to imagine what might come next—a day when augmentation crosses into automation, and cognitive obsolescence compels them to seek work at a food truck, pet spa, or massage table. At least until the humanoid robots arrive.\n\nMany economists insist that this will all be fine. Capitalism is resilient. The arrival of the ATM famously led to the employment of more bank tellers, just as the introduction of Excel swelled the ranks of accountants and Photoshop spiked demand for graphic designers. In each case, new tech automated old tasks, increased productivity, and created jobs with higher wages than anyone could have conceived of before. The BLS projects that employment will grow 3.1 percent over the next 10 years. That’s down from 13 percent in the previous decade, but 5 million new jobs in a country with a stable population is hardly catastrophic.\n\nAnd yet: There are things that economists struggle to measure. Americans tend to derive meaning and identity from what they do. Most don’t want to do something else, even if they had any confidence—which they don’t—that they could find something else to do. Seventy-one percent of respondents to an August Reuters/Ipsos poll said they’re worried that artificial intelligence will “put too many people out of work permanently.”\n\nThis data point might be easier to dismiss if the modern mill and factory owners hadn’t already declared that AI will put people out of work permanently.\n\nIn May 2025, Dario Amodei, the CEO of the AI company Anthropic, said that AI could drive unemployment up 10 to 20 percent in the next one to five years and “wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs.” Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, estimated that it would eliminate “literally half of all white-collar workers” in a decade. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, revealed that “my little group chat with my tech-CEO friends” has a bet about the inevitable date when a billion-dollar company is staffed by just one person. (The business side of this magazine, like some other publishers, has a corporate partnership with OpenAI.) Other companies, including Meta, Amazon, UnitedHealth, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, and UPS, which have recently announced layoffs, have framed them more euphemistically in sunny reports to investors about the rise of “automation” and “head count trending down.” Taken together, these statements are extraordinary: the owners of capital warning workers that the ice beneath them is about to crack—while continuing to stomp on it.\n\nIt’s as if we’re watching two versions of the same scene. In one, the ice holds, because it always has. In the other, a lot of people go under. The difference becomes clear only when the surface finally gives way—at which point the range of available options will have considerably narrowed.\n\nAI is already transforming work, one delegated task at a time. If the transformation unfolds slowly enough and the economy adjusts quickly enough, the economists may be right: We’ll be fine. Or better. But if AI instead triggers a rapid reorganization of work—compressing years of change into months, affecting roughly 40 percent of jobs worldwide, as the International Monetary Fund projects—the consequences will not stop at the economy. They will test political institutions that have already shown how brittle they can be.\n\nThe question, then, is whether we’re approaching the kind of disruption that can be managed with statistics—or the kind that creates statistics no one can bear to count.\n\nAustan Goolsbee is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Robert P. Gwinn Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Barack Obama. He’s also one of the few economists you would not immediately regret bringing to a party. When I asked Goolsbee if any conclusive data indicated that AI had begun to eat into the labor market, he delivered an answer that was both obvious and unhelpful, smiling as he did it. The nonanswer was the point.\n\nI’ve known Goolsbee long enough to enjoy these moments, when he makes fun of our shared uselessness. Economists are rarely equipped to give straight answers about the present. Journalists hate when the future won’t reveal itself on deadline.\n\nWe spoke in September, shortly after the release of what’s come to be known as “The Canaries Paper,” written by three academics from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. By crunching data from millions of monthly payroll records for workers in jobs with exposure to generative AI, the authors concluded that workers ages 22 to 25—the canaries—have seen about a 13 percent decline in employment since late 2022.\n\nFor several days, the paper was all anyone in the field wanted to talk about, and by talk about I mostly mean punch holes in. The report overemphasized the effect of ChatGPT. Youth employment is cyclical. The same period saw a sharp interest-rate spike—a far more likely source of turbulence. “Canaries” also contradicted a study released a few weeks earlier by the Economic Innovation Group, which argued that AI is unlikely to cause mass unemployment in the near term, even as it reshapes jobs and wages. That paper was knowingly titled “AI and Jobs: The Final Word (Until the Next One).”\n\nThis was the point Goolsbee wanted to emphasize: Economists are constrained by numbers. And numerically speaking, nothing indicates that AI has had an impact on people’s jobs. “It’s just too early,” he said.\n\nA lack of certainty should not be mistaken for a lack of concern. The Fed’s mandate is to promote maximum employment, so the corporate pronouncements about imminent job loss have Goolsbee’s attention. But the numbers don’t add up. It’s possible that the labor market is softer than it looks, but that the softness is being absorbed within firms rather than showing up in the unemployment rate. If companies are sitting on more workers than they need, however—a phenomenon known as labor hoarding—you’d expect that to reveal itself as weak productivity growth. It’s as predictable as a hangover: too many workers, not enough work, sagging productivity. “But it’s been totally the opposite,” Goolsbee said. “Productivity growth has been really high. So I don’t know how to reconcile that.”\n\nProductivity is the cheat code for a more prosperous society. If each worker can produce \n\nAmerica has been on a productivity tear for the past few years. It might be temporary, the result of a onetime boost, such as the COVID-era boom in new small businesses. But with the special joy of someone paid to complicate everything, Goolsbee pointed out that general-purpose technologies such as electricity and computing can create lasting productivity gains, the kind that make whole societies wealthier.\n\nWhether AI is one of those technologies will only become clear over time. How long before we’ll know? “Years,” Goolsbee said.\n\nIn the meantime, there’s another complication. The immediate risk to employment may not be AI itself, but the way companies, seduced by its promise, overinvest before they understand what it can actually do. Goolsbee reached back to the internet bubble, when companies spent wildly on laying fiber cables and building capacity. “In 2001, when we found out that the growth rate of the internet is not going to be 25 percent a year, but merely 10 percent—which is still a pretty great growth rate—it meant we had way too much fiber, and there was a collapse of business investment,” Goolsbee said. “And a bunch of people were thrown out of work the old-fashioned way.”\n\nA similar crash in AI investment, if it comes, would likely look familiar: painful, destabilizing, and accompanied by surges of CNBC rants and recriminations. But it would amount to a financial reset, not a technological reversal—the kind of outcome economists are especially good at recognizing, because it resembles a thing that’s happened before.\n\nThis is the paradox of economics. To understand how fast the present is hurtling us into the future, you need a fixed point, and the fixed points are all in the past. It’s like driving while looking only at the rearview mirror—plenty dangerous if the road stays straight, catastrophic if it doesn’t.\n\nDavid Autor and Daron Acemoglu are among the most accomplished rearview drivers. Both are at MIT, and both excel at understanding previous economic disruptions. Acemoglu, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2024, studies inequality; Autor focuses on labor. But both insist that the story of AI and its consequences will depend mostly on speed—not because they assume lost jobs will automatically be replaced, but because a slower rate of change leaves societies time to adapt, even if some of those jobs never come back.\n\nLabor markets have a natural rate of adjustment. If, over the course of 30 years, 3 percent of employees in a profession retire or have their jobs eliminated annually, you’d barely notice. Yet a decade later, a third of the jobs in those professions would be gone. Elevator operators and tollbooth attendants went through this slow fade to obsolescence with no damage to the economy. “When it happens more rapidly,” Autor told me, “things become problematic.”\n\nFrom the July/August 2015 issue: Derek Thompson on a world without work\n\nAutor is most famous for his work on the China shock. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization; six years later, 13 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs—about 2 million—had disappeared. The China shock took a disproportionate toll on small-scale manufacturing—textiles, toys, furniture—concentrated primarily in the South. “Many of the workers in those places still haven’t recovered,” Autor said, “and we’re obviously living with the political consequences.”\n\nBut AI isn’t a trade policy. It’s software. Even if it hits some professions and places first—a lawyer in a large urban firm, say, may feel the impact years before a worker in a less digitized industry—the technology won’t be constrained by geography. Eventually, everyone will be affected.\n\nAll of this sounds foreboding, until you remember the most important thing about software: People hate it, almost as much as they hate change.\n\nThis is what gives many economists confidence that the AI asteroid is still at least a decade away. “These tech CEOs want us to believe that the market for automation is preordained, and that it will all happen smoothly and profitably,” Acemoglu said. He then made a disdainful noise from his Nobel Prize–winning bullshit detector. “History tells us it’s actually going to happen much slower.”\n\nThe argument goes like this: Before AI can transform a company, it has to access the company’s data and be woven into existing systems—which sounds easy, provided you’re not a chief technology officer. A trade secret of most Fortune 500 companies is that they still run many critical functions on lumbering, industrial-strength mainframe computers that almost never break down and therefore can never be replaced. Mainframes are like Christopher Walken: They’ve been going nonstop since the 1960s, they’re fantastic at performing peculiar roles (processing payments, safeguarding data), and nobody alive really understands how they work.\n\nIntegrating legacy tech with modern AI means navigating hardware, vendors, contracts, ancient coding languages, and humans—every one of whom has a strong opinion about the “right” way to make changes. Months pass, then years; another company holiday party comes and goes; and the CEO still can’t understand why the miracle of AI isn’t solving all of their problems.\n\nEvery new general-purpose technology is, for a time, held hostage by the mess of what already exists. The first electric-power stations opened in the 1880s, and no one debated whether they were superior to steam engines. But factories had been built with steam engines in their basements, powering overhead shafts that ran the length of the buildings, with belts and pulleys carrying power to individual machines. To adopt electricity, factory owners didn’t just need to buy motors—they needed to demolish and rebuild their entire operations. Some did. Most just waited for their infrastructure to wear out, which explains why the major economic gains from electrification didn’t show up for 40 years.\n\nNone of this is reassuring enough for the economist Anton Korinek. He’s “super worried,” he told me. He thinks that America will see major job losses—“a very noticeable labor-market effect”—as soon as this year.\n\n“And then those economists you’ve been talking to, they’re going to say, ‘I see that in the data!’ ” Korinek paused. “Let’s not joke about it, because it’s too serious.”\n\nKorinek is a professor and the faculty director of the Economics of Transformative AI Initiative at the University of Virginia. Last year, Time magazine put him on its list of the most influential people in AI. But he did not set out to become an economist. He grew up in an Austrian mountain village, writing machine code in 0s and 1s—the least glamorous form of programming, and the most unforgiving. It teaches you where instructions bottleneck, where systems jam, and what breaks first when pushed too hard.\n\nHe’d kept a close watch on developments in AI since the deep-learning breakthroughs of the early 2010s, even as his doctoral work focused on the prevention of financial crises. When he got his first demo of a large language model, in September 2022, it took “about five seconds” before he considered its consequences for the future of work, starting with his own.\n\nWe met for breakfast in Charlottesville in the fall. Korinek is youthful and slender, with delicate wire-frame glasses and a faintly red beard. My overall impression was of someone who’d rather be customizing Excel tabs than prophesizing doom. Still, here he was, saying the five words economists disdain the most: This time may be different.\n\nThe crux of Korinek’s argument is simple: His colleagues aren’t misreading the data—they’re misreading the technology. “We can’t quite conceptualize having very smart machines,” Korinek said. “Machines have always been dumb, and that’s why we don’t trust them and it’s always taken time to roll them out. But if they’re smarter than us, in many ways they can roll themselves out.”\n\nThis is already happening. Many of the least comprehensible ads during sporting events are for AI tools that promise to speed the integration of other AI tools into the workflows of large companies. Because many of these systems don’t require massive new hardware or human-engineered system rewrites, the rollout time shrinks by as much as 50 percent.\n\nThis is where Korinek parts company with the rearview economists. If AI moves as fast as he expects, for many workers the damage will arrive before institutions can adapt—and each successful use will only intensify the pressure for more.\n\nConsider consulting firms, which have always charged high fees for having junior associates do research and draft reports—fees clients tolerated because there was no alternative. But if one firm can use AI to deliver the same work faster and cheaper, its competitors face a stark choice: adopt the technology, or explain why they are still charging a premium for human hours. Once a firm plugs in and undercuts its rivals, the rest must either race to follow or be left behind. Competition doesn’t just reward adoption; it makes delay indefensible.\n\nKorinek concedes the two standard objections: The numbers don’t show anything definitive yet, and new technologies have historically created more jobs than they’ve destroyed. But he thinks that his peers need to start driving with their eyes looking ahead. “Whenever I speak to people at the labs on the West Coast”—Korinek is an unpaid member of Anthropic’s economic advisory council—“it does not strike me that they are trying to artificially hype what they’re producing. I usually have the sense that they are just as terrified as I am. We should at least consider the possibility that what they are telling us may come true.”\n\nKorinek is not sure that the technology itself can be steered by policy, but he wants more economists doing scenario planning so that policy makers aren’t caught flat-footed—because mass job loss doesn’t just mean unemployment; it means missed loan payments, cascading defaults, shrinking consumer demand, and the kind of self-reinforcing downturn that can transform a shock into a crisis, and a crisis into the decline of an empire.\n\nAfter thE brief period in early 2025 when CEOs were openly volunteering “thought leadership” about AI and its impact on their workforces and profit margins, the pronouncements stopped, eerily, at roughly the same time. Anyone who has seen a shark fin break the water and then disappear knows this is not reassuring.\n\nThe simple explanation comes courtesy of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. America employs about 280,590 public-relations specialists, an increase of 69 percent over the past two decades. (They outnumber journalists almost 7 to 1.) It’s not hard to imagine their expert syllogism: AI is unpopular. CEOs who talk about job cuts are even less popular. So maybe shut up about AI and jobs?\n\nIn October, the day after The New York Times revealed Amazon executives’ plan to potentially automate more than 600,000 jobs by 2033, the PR chief at a large multinational firm told me, “We are so done speaking about this.” It was at least a small piece of history—the first time I’d been asked to grant anonymity to someone so they could explain, on the record, that they would no longer be speaking at all.\n\nAll of which is to say that the chief executives of Walmart, Amazon, Ford, and other Fortune 100 companies, as well as executives from rising AI-driven firms including Anthropic, Stripe, and Waymo—people who had been remarkably chatty about AI and jobs a few months earlier—declined or ignored multiple interview requests for this story. Even the Business Roundtable, an association of 200 CEOs from America’s most powerful companies that exists to speak for its members on exactly these kinds of issues, told me that its CEO, former George W. Bush White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten, had nothing to say.\n\nOf course, telling a reporter you won’t speak on the record isn’t the same as not speaking. The CEOs are talking to at least one person: Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a Microsoft board member. Hoffman is a technologist by pedigree and an optimist by temperament. He knows everyone in corporate America, and everyone knows he knows everyone, which makes him Silicon Valley’s favorite mensch—a reasonable, neutral sounding board whom CEOs can go to when they want to think out loud. He told me that AI has sorted the CEOs into three groups.\n\nThe first are the dabblers: latecomers finally spending some quality time with their chief technology officers. The second rushed to declare themselves AI leaders out of vanity or a desire to have their traditional businesses taken more seriously by tech snobs. “They’re like, Look at me! I’m important! I’m central here. But they’re not actually doing anything yet,” Hoffman said. “They’re just like, Put me at the AI table too.” The third group is different: executives who are quietly making transformational plans. “These are the ones who see it coming. And to their credit, I think a lot of them want to figure out how to help their whole workforce transition with this through education, reskilling, or training.”\n\nBut what all three groups share is a belief that investors—after years of hearing about AI’s promise—have lost patience with dreaming. This year, they expect results. And the fastest way for a CEO to produce results is to cut head count. Layoffs, Hoffman said, are inevitable. “A lot of them have convinced themselves this only ends one way. Which I think is a failure of the imagination.”\n\nHoffman doesn’t waste time urging CEOs not to make cuts; he knows they will. “What I tell them is that you need to be presenting paths and ideas for how to get benefits from AI that aren’t just cutting costs. How do you get more revenue? How do you help your people transition to being more effective using AI?”\n\n“It’s a fever,” Gina Raimondo, the former governor of Rhode Island and commerce secretary under Joe Biden, told me, referring to the rush to cut jobs. “Every CEO and every board feels like they need to go faster. ‘We have 40,000 people doing customer service? Take it down to 10,000. AI can handle the rest.’ If the whole thing is about moving fast with your eye strictly on efficiency, then an awful lot of people are going to get really hurt. And I don’t think this country can handle that, given where we already are.”\n\nLike Hoffman, Raimondo occupies an unusual niche: a Democrat who can walk into a boardroom without setting off the cultural metal detectors. She co-founded a venture-capital firm, and AI executives, who see her as pragmatic and fluent in tech, are willing to talk to her. “This is a technology that will make us more productive, healthier, more sustainable,” Raimondo said. “But only if we get very serious about managing the transition.”\n\nLast summer, Raimondo made the trip to Sun Valley, Idaho, for the four-day Allen & Co. conference known as “summer camp for billionaires.” She asked people the same two questions: How are you using AI? And what happens to your workers when you do? A number of CEOs admitted that they felt trapped. Wall Street expects them to replace human labor with AI; if they don’t do it, they’ll be the ones out of a job. But if they all order mass job eliminations, they know the consequences will be enormous—for their workforces, for the country, and for their own humanity.\n\nRaimondo’s response was that “it’s the responsibility of the country’s most powerful CEOs to help figure this out.” She sees the possibility of “new public-private partnerships at scale. Imagine if we could get companies to take ownership over the retraining and redeployment of people they lay off.”\n\nShe knows how this sounds. “A lot of people say, ‘Oh, Gina, you’re naive. Never going to happen.’ Okay. But I’m telling you it’s the end of America as we know it if we don’t use this moment to do things differently.”\n\nIf executives’ concern is as genuine as Raimondo thinks, then perhaps they can be moved to action. Liz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, is trying—and mostly failing—to do just that. CEOs and tech leaders are so focused on winning the AI race that “working people are an afterthought,” she told me.\n\nShuler’s aware that this is a predictable take from a union leader, so she volunteered a concession: “Most working people, and especially union leaders, start out with a panic, right? Like, Wow, this is going to basically obliterate all jobs and everyone’s going to be left without a safety net and we have to put a stop to it—which we know is not going to happen.” Instead of panicking, Shuler said, she talked with the leaders of the AFL-CIO’s unions, representing about 15 million people, and pushed them to use the brief moment before AI is imposed on them to figure out what they want from the technology—and what they might be prepared to trade for that.\n\nMichael Podhorzer: The paradox of the American labor movement\n\nSo far the olive branch has been grabbed by precisely one company. Microsoft has agreed to bring workers into conversations about developing AI and guardrails around it. Most remarkably, the deal includes a neutrality agreement that allows workers to freely form unions without retaliation—something that’s never been done before in tech. “We think it’s a model,” Shuler said. “We would love to see others acknowledge that working people are central to this debate and to our future.”\n\nSquint and you might convince yourself that the Microsoft deal is indeed proof of concept. More likely, it’s an anomaly. Because all the coaxing, reasonableness, and appeals to patriotism and shared humanity are battling a truth as old as wage labor: American capitalism rushes toward efficiency the way water flows downhill—inevitably, indifferently, and with predictable consequences for whoever happens to be standing at the bottom. And with AI, for the first time, capital has a tool that promises the kind of near-limitless productivity the factory and mill owners could never have imagined: maximum efficiency with a minimum number of employees to demand a share of the gains.\n\nIn that context, the silence of the CEOs takes on a different resonance. It could be a cold acknowledgment that the decisions have already been made—or a muffled plea for the government to save them from themselves.\n\nYou’re probably aware that our politics are unbearable at the moment. And yet the only way to make them bearable—to recover the glimmer of promise at their core—is more politics. That’s the joke at the heart of Washington: The very struggle that’s hollowed the place out is also the only way it can be renewed.\n\nIf there were ever an issue capable of relieving the national migraine—something large enough and urgent enough—you might assume the future of American jobs would be it. “At least from my interactions here in the Senate, not many people are talking about it,” Gary Peters, the senior senator from Michigan, told me. “There’s a general attitude among my colleagues”—Peters, a Democrat, singles out Republicans, though he says there’s blame to go around—“like, We don’t need to do anything. It’s going to be fine. In fact, the government should just stay out of it. Let industry move forward and continue to innovate.”\n\nIt’s hard to slow AI without abdicating America’s tech supremacy to China—a point the tech lobby makes with religious fervor. It’s hard to force AI labs to give advance notice of the consequences of their deployments when they often don’t know themselves. You could regulate the use of job-displacing AI, but enforcement would require a regulatory apparatus that doesn’t exist and technical expertise the government doesn’t have.\n\nThat said, the government has a decades-old playbook on how to get workers through economic shocks. And Peters has been banging his head on his desk trying to get Congress to use it.\n\nSince 1974, when the United States began opening its economy more aggressively to global trade, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program has helped more than 5 million people with retraining, wage insurance, and relocation grants, at a cost in recent years of roughly half a billion dollars annually. In 2018, Peters co-sponsored the TAA for Automation Act, which would have extended the same benefits to workers squeezed by AI and robotics. It died quietly, as many things in Congress do. In 2022, authorization for the TAA expired, and in a Congress allergic to trade votes and new spending, Peters’s efforts to revive it have gone nowhere.\n\nThis is very stupid. The United States has about 700,000 unfilled factory and construction jobs. (Ironically, one of the few things slowing AI is a shortage of HVAC technicians qualified to install cooling systems in data centers.) Jim Farley, the Ford CEO who predicted that half of white-collar jobs could disappear in a decade, has been saying that the auto industry is short hundreds of thousands of technicians to work in dealerships—jobs that sit in a long-term sweet spot: technical enough to earn six figures, and dependent on precise manual dexterity that makes them hard to roboticize. But someone has to pay for the months of training the jobs require. “These are really good jobs,” Peters said. But “we spend a lot more money from the federal government for four-year higher-education institutions than we do for skilled-training programs.”\n\nThere’s no shortage of ideas about what to do if AI hollows out large swaths of work: universal basic income, benefits that don’t depend on employers, lifelong retraining, a shorter workweek. They tend to surface whenever technological anxiety spikes—and to recede just as reliably, undone by cost, politics, or the simple fact that they would require a level of coordination the United States has not managed in decades.\n\nThe 119th Congress is a ghost ship, steered by ennui and the desire to evade hard choices. And the AI industry is paying millions of dollars to make sure no one grabs the wheel. To cite just one example, a super PAC called Leading the Future—which has reportedly secured $50 million in commitments from the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and $50 million more from the OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and his wife, Anna—plans to “aggressively oppose” candidates from both parties who threaten the industry’s priorities, which boil down to: Go fast. No, faster.\n\nShuler told me that the AFL-CIO will keep pressing national elected officials for a worker-focused AI agenda, but that “this game is not gonna be played at the federal level as much as it will be at the state level.” More than 1,000 AI bills are bubbling up in statehouses. Of course, the AI money will be there, too; Leading the Future has already announced plans to focus its efforts on New York, California, Illinois, and Ohio.\n\nThe executive branch has delegated almost all of its AI oversight to David Sacks—nominally a co-chair of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, but functionally a government LARPer who maintains his role as a venture capitalist and podcast host. Sacks, who is also the White House crypto czar, co-wrote the Trump administration’s “America’s AI Action Plan.” A New York Times investigation found that Sacks has at least 449 investments in companies with ties to artificial intelligence. The fox isn’t just guarding the henhouse; he’s livestreaming the feast.\n\nAI is just a newborn. It may grow up to transform our lives in unimaginably good ways. But it has also introduced profound questions about safety, inequality, and the viability of a wage-labor system that, despite its flaws, spawned the most prosperous society in human history. And there’s no sign—none—that our political system is equipped to deal with what’s coming.\n\nWhich means the deepest challenge AI poses may not be to jobs at all.\n\n“Gosh, the textbook ideal of democracy,” says Nick Clegg, “is the peaceful articulation and resolution of differences that otherwise might take a more disruptive or violent form. So you’d like to think that a strong democracy could digest these kinds of changes.”\n\nClegg is a former deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom and leader of the Liberal Democrats. When he lost his seat in Parliament after Brexit, he moved to California, where he spent seven years running global affairs at Facebook/Meta, becoming a kind of Tocqueville with vested options, before returning to London in 2025. Many governments “just don’t have the levers” to deal with AI, Clegg told me.\n\nHe suspects that the societies best positioned to navigate the next few years are small homogenous ones like the Scandinavians, who are capable of having mature conversations—they’ll put together “some commission led by some very wise former finance minister who will come up with a perfect blueprint which everybody consensually will then do, and they will remain in a hundred years the happiest societies”—or large authoritarian ones that refuse to have conversations at all. China, America’s primary AI rival, has repeatedly demonstrated a capacity to impose rapid, society-wide change (the one-child policy, the forced relocation of more than 1 million people for the Three Gorges Dam) without consent or delay.\n\n“If democratic governments drift into this period, which may require much more rapid change than they currently appear to be capable of delivering,” Clegg warned, “then democracy is not going to pass this test with flying colors.”\n\nHe then delivered, over Zoom, a fantastically British pep talk, combining Churchillian resolve with a faintly patronizing nod to America’s centuries-long streak of pulling four-leaf clovers out of its ass. “You are extraordinarily dynamic,” he began. “It’s remarkable the number of times people have written off America.”\n\nIf politics is to be part of the solution, Gary Peters will not be around to participate; he’s retiring next year. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congress’s most articulate Republican advocate (really) for safeguarding the workforce from AI, has already resigned. Gina Raimondo is being considered as a potential presidential contender for 2028, and she’s a centrist with the chops to balance the reasons for speeding forward on AI with the need to do so warily. But the issue is unlikely to wait that long. “We’re going into a world that seems to be getting more unstable with each and every day,” Peters said. “And that uncertainty creates anxiety, and anxiety leads to sometimes dramatic shifts in how people act and how they vote.”\n\nWhich brings us to Bernie Sanders, who has been wrestling with an AI-shaped future since it was still theoretical. “Are AI and robotics inherently evil or terrible? No,” Sanders told me in his familiar staccato. “We are already seeing positive developments in terms of health care, the manufacturing of drugs, diagnoses of diseases, etc. But here is the simple question: Who is going to benefit from this transformation?”\n\nAt the Davenport, Iowa, stop on his 2025 Fighting Oligarchy tour, audience members booed when he mentioned AI. And Sanders, the ultimate vibes politician, can feel decades of anger—over trade, inequality, affordability, systematic unfairness, government fealty to corporations—coalescing around AI.\n\nIn October, he issued a 95 theses–style report on AI and employment. It included all of the dire CEO and consulting-firm quotes about the looming job apocalypse and proposed a shorter workweek; worker protections; profit sharing; and an unspecified “robot tax on large corporations,” whose revenue would be used “to benefit workers harmed by AI.” It’s a furious document, as though Sanders typed it with his fists.\n\nAt least one populist politician thinks Sanders didn’t go far enough.\n\nSteve Bannon’s D.C. townhouse is so close to the Supreme Court that you can read JUSTICE THE GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY from the top step. He greeted me in his signature look: camouflage cargo pants, a black shirt, also a brown shirt, also a black button-down shirt. He hadn’t shaved in days. It would not have surprised me if he suggested that we get hoagies, or form a militia.\n\nFrom the July/August 2022 issue: Jennifer Senior on Steve Bannon, a lit bomb in the mouth of democracy\n\nBannon has, shall we say, some scoundrel-like tendencies. But he’s not an AI tourist. In the early 2000s, while still a film producer, he tried to buy the rights to Ray Kurzweil’s The Singularity Is Near, a sacred text of the AI movement that imagines the day when machines surpass human intelligence. Bannon thought it would make a good documentary. He hired an AI correspondent for his War Room podcast a few years ago, and he tracks every corporate-layoff announcement, searching for omens.\n\nHe’s concerned about rogue AI creating viruses and seizing weapons—fears that are shared more soberly by national-security officials, biosecurity researchers, and some notable AI scientists—but he believes the American worker is in such imminent danger that he’s prepared to toss away parts of his ideology. “I’m for the deconstruction of the administrative state, but I’m not an anarchist,” Bannon told me. “You do have to have a regulatory apparatus. If you don’t have a regulatory apparatus for this, then fucking take the whole thing down, right? Because this is what the thing was built for.”\n\nWhat Bannon wants goes beyond regulation. It’s a callback to an old idea: that when the government deems a technology strategically vital, it should own part of it—much as it once did with railroads and, briefly, banks during the 2008 financial crisis. He pointed to what he called Donald Trump’s “brilliant” decision to have the federal government take a 9.9 percent stake in Intel in August. But the stake in AI would need to be much greater, he believes—something commensurate with the scale of federal support flowing to AI companies.\n\n“I don’t know—50 percent as a starter,” Bannon said. “I realize the right’s going to go nuts.” But the government needs to put people with good judgment on these companies’ boards, he said. “And you have to drill down on this now, now, now.”\n\nInstead, he warned, we have “the worst elements of our system—greed and avarice, coupled with people that just want to grasp raw power—all converging.”\n\nI pointed out that the person overseeing this convergence is the same man Bannon helped get elected, and recently suggested should stick around for a third term.\n\n“President Trump’s a great business guy,” Bannon said. But he’s getting “selective information” from Elon Musk, David Sacks, and others who Bannon thinks hopped aboard the Trump bandwagon only to maximize their profit and control of AI. “If you noticed, these guys are not jumping around when I say ‘Trump ’28.’ I don’t get an ‘attaboy.’ ” He said that “they’ve used Trump,” and that he sees a major schism coming within the Republican Party.\n\nBannon’s politics don’t naturally lend themselves to cross-party coalition building, but AI has scrambled even his sense of the boundaries. He and Glenn Beck signed a letter demanding a ban on the development of superintelligent AI, out of fear that systems smarter than humans cannot be reliably contained; they were joined by eminent academics and former Obama-administration officials—“lefties that would rather spit on the floor than say Steve Bannon is with them on anything.” And he’s been sketching out a theory of the coalition needed to confront what’s coming. “These ethicists and moral philosophers—you have to combine that together with, quite frankly, some street fighters.”\n\nHorseshoe issues—where the far right and far left touch—are rare in American politics. They tend to surface when something highly technical (the gold standard in 1896, or the subprime crisis of 2008) alchemizes into something emotional (William Jennings Bryan’s “cross of gold,” the Tea Party). That’s populism. And the threat of pitchforks has occasionally made American capitalism more humane: The eight-hour workday, weekends, and the minimum wage all emerged from the space between reform and revolution.\n\nNo one understands or exploits that shaggy zone quite like Bannon. His anger about AI can sound reasonable in one breath and menacing in the next. We were discussing some of the men who run the most powerful AI labs when he said, “Let’s just be blunt”: “We’re in a situation where people on the spectrum that are not, quite frankly, total adults—you can see by their behavior that they’re not—are making decisions for the species. Not for the country. For the species. Once we hit this inflection point, there’s no coming back. That’s why it’s got to be stopped, and we may have to take extreme measures.”\n\nThe trouble with pitchforks is that once you encourage everyone to grab them, there’s no end to the damage that might be done. And unlike in earlier eras, we’re now a society defined by two objects: phones that let everyone see exactly how much better other people have it, and guns should they decide to do something about it.\n\nAmerica would be better off if its elites could act responsibly without being terrified. If CEOs remembered that citizens are a kind of shareholder, too. If economists tried to model the future before it arrives in their rearview mirror. If politicians chose their constituents’ jobs over their own. None of this requires revolution. It requires everyone to do the jobs they already have, just better.\n\nThere’s an easy place for all of them to start—a bar so low, it amounts to a basic cognitive exam for the republic.\n\nErika McEntarfer was the commissioner of labor statistics until August, when Trump fired her after the release of a weak jobs report. McEntarfer has seen no evidence of political interference at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but “independence is not the only threat facing economic data,” she told me. “Inadequate funding and staffing are also a danger.”\n\nMost of the economic papers trying to figure out the impact of AI on labor demand use the BLS’s Current Population Survey. “It’s the best available source,” McEntarfer said. “But the sample is pretty small. It’s only 60,000 households and hasn’t increased for 20 years. Response rates have declined.” An obvious first step toward figuring out what’s going on in our economy would be to expand the survey’s sample size and add a supplement on AI usage at work. That would involve some extra economists and a few million dollars—a tiny investment. But the BLS budget has been shrinking for decades.\n\nThe United States created the BLS because it believed the first duty of a democracy was to know what was happening to its people. If we’ve misplaced that belief—if we can’t bring ourselves to measure reality; if we can’t be bothered to count—then good luck with the machines.\n\nThis article appears in the March 2026 print edition with the headline “What’s the Worst That Could Happen?”",

    "fullText": "Twitter's latest consensus on inevitability: now that large language models can write code, everyone will become a software developer.\n\nPeople, you see, have problems, and software solves problems, and AI removes the barrier between people and software, therefore everyone will build their own software.\n\nIt's a syllogism, after a fashion, but its premise = so wildly disconnected from how actual humans behave that it borders on fantasy.\n\nBecause the average punter does not want to build software.\n\nThey don't want to prompt software.\n\nThey don’t want to describe software.\n\nThey don't particularly want to think about software.\n\nThey want to tap, swipe and scroll with zero friction and next-to-zero cognitive input.\n\nThey want their problems to go away, and they would very much prefer if that happened without them having to open a terminal, a chat window, or anything else that reminds them of work.\n\nThis is damn-near universally applicable.\n\nThere's a deep assumption embedded in the \"everyone will build\" thesis, that most people are latent creators held back only by technical barriers. Remove the barriers, and creation floods forth. But we've run this before. Desktop publishing tools became accessible in the 1980s with the Macintosh and PageMaker. Did everyone start designing their own newsletters? A handful did, and the rest continued to hire designers or, more commonly, didn't make newsletters at all. WordPress has made it trivially easy to build a website for over twenty years now, and the vast majority of small business owners still pay someone else to do it, or they use a template and never touch it again.\n\nThe people excited about vibe coding are, almost by definition, people who were already interested in building things, and they're projecting their own enthusiasm onto a general population that has repeatedley demonstrated a preference for buying solutions over building them.\n\nAnd why wouldn't they prefer that?\n\nBuilding things is cognitively expensive, whether or not it’s financially viable.\n\nAnd even when the technical barrier falls to zero, the conceptualisation barrier remains. You still have to know what you want, specify it clearly, evaluate whether what you got is what you wanted, and iterate if it’s not. That's work // effort and for most people it is accompanied by functionally zero dopamine.\n\nAn old joke: the hardest part of building software is figuring out what the software should do. This has been true for decades, and AI hasn't changed it. If anything, AI has made the problem more visible. When the bottleneck was writing code, you could blame the difficulty of ~programming for why your project never got off the ground. Now that an AI can write code in seconds, the bottleneck is clearly, embarrassingly, you // me // us.\n\nThis is the part that the AI manics keep skating past. They demo an app built in ten minutes and declare that software development has been democratized. But the demo is always something with a clear spec: a to-do list, a calculator, a simple game with obvious rules. The rest of the world’s problems don't come pre-decomposed into clean specifications.\n\nThe rest of the world may not even be able to fully articulate what’s broken and what they want fixed.\n\nMost folks don't want to build a custom CRM.\n\nI couldn't be more excited about what this era unlocks.\n\nThey want to They don't want to create their own budgeting app. They want Mint or YNAB to do the job. The entire SaaS economy exists as proof that people will pay monthly fees to avoid having to build or even configure things themselves.\n\nAnd is there anything wrong with that preference?\n\nThe division of labor exists for good reasons, and Adam Smith figured this out in 1776 and he was a good deal smarter than a good many of us.\n\nWhat people will actually do with AI is use AI-enhanced versions of existing products, with smarter search and better autocomplete inside the tools they already have. The revolution won't look like a hundred million people vibe coding custom apps. It'll look like existing software getting better at understanding what users want and doing it for them, which is what good software has always tried to do.\n\nThe tech industry has a long history of confusing what power users want with what everyone wants. The folks on AI Twitter who are building apps every weekend with Claude and GPT are having a great time, and the tools they're using are the same ones I’m obsessing over most of my waking hours. But we are a self-selected sample of tinkerers and builders, and the conclusions they're drawing about the general population say more about their own relationship with technology than about anyone else's.\n\nMost people, given a magic wand, would not wish for the ability to write software. They'd wish for their sofware to work properly without them having to do fuck-all.",

    "fullText": "Wall Street Journal says Claude used in operation via Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies\n\nClaude, the AI model developed by Anthropic, was used by the US military during its operation to kidnap Nicolás Maduro from Venezuela, the Wall Street Journal revealed on Saturday, a high-profile example of how the US defence department is using artificial intelligence in its operations.\n\nThe US raid on Venezuela involved bombing across the capital, Caracas, and the killing of 83 people, according to Venezuela’s defence ministry. Anthropic’s terms of use prohibit the use of Claude for violent ends, for the development of weapons or for conducting surveillance.\n\nAnthropic was the first AI developer known to be used in a classified operation by the US department of defence. It was unclear how the tool, which has capabilities ranging from processing PDFs to piloting autonomous drones, was deployed.\n\nA spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment on whether Claude was used in the operation, but said any use of the AI tool was required to comply with its usage policies. The US defence department did not comment on the claims.\n\nThe WSJ cited anonymous sources who said Claude was used through Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, a contractor with the US defence department and federal law enforcement agencies. Palantir refused to comment on the claims.\n\nThe US and other militaries increasingly deploy AI as part of their arsenals. Israel’s military has used drones with autonomous capabilities in Gaza and has extensively used AI to fill its targeting bank in Gaza. The US military has used AI targeting for strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent years.\n\nCritics have warned against the use of AI in weapons technologies and the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, pointing to targeting mistakes created by computers governing who should and should not be killed.\n\nAI companies have grappled with how their technologies should engage with the defence sector, with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, calling for regulation to prevent harms from the deployment of AI. Amodei has also expressed wariness over the use of AI in autonomous lethal operations and surveillance in the US.\n\nThis more cautious stance has apparently rankled the US defence department, with the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, saying in January that the department wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars”.\n\nThe Pentagon announced in January that it would work with xAI, owned by Elon Musk. The defence department also uses a custom version of Google’s Gemini and OpenAI systems to support research.",

    "description": "How to identify the first iconic use case for an enterprise AI transformation.",
    "fullText": "Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?\n\nAt Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.\n\nOur methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.\n\nMistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.\n\nFirst, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.\n\nFor example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.\n\nSecond, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.\n\nThird, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.\n\nFinally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.\n\nThis means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.\n\nEnterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.\n\nRepresentatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.\n\nMoonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.\n\nFuture investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.\n\nTactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.\n\nQuick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.\n\nBlue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.\n\nHero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.\n\nOnce a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.\n\nThis step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.\n\nOnce this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.\n\nDuring this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.\n\nAfter the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.\n\nBut none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.\n\nIt’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.\n\nThe path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.\n\nThis content was produced by Mistral AI. It was not written by MIT Technology Review’s editorial staff.\n\nFour ways to think about this year's reckoning.\n\nBacklash against ICE is fueling a broader movement against AI companies’ ties to President Trump.\n\nThe viral social network for bots reveals more about our own current mania for AI as it does about the future of agents.\n\nDiscover special offers, top stories,\n upcoming events, and more.",

    "description": ": Just ask DeepSeek",
    "fullText": "Two of the world's biggest AI companies, Google and OpenAI, both warned this week that competitors including China's DeepSeek are probing their models to steal the underlying reasoning, and then copy these capabilities in their own AI systems.\n\n\"This is coming from threat actors throughout the globe,\" Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register, adding that the perpetrators are \"private-sector companies.\" He declined to name specific companies or countries involved in this type of intellectual property theft.\n\n\"Your model is really valuable IP, and if you can distill the logic behind it, there's very real potential that you can replicate that technology – which is not inexpensive,\" Hultquist said. \"This is such an important technology, and the list of interested parties in replicating it are endless.\"\n\nGoogle calls this process of using prompts to clone its models \"distillation attacks,\" and in a Thursday report said one campaign used more than 100,000 prompts to \"try to replicate Gemini's reasoning ability in non-English target languages across a wide variety of tasks.\"\n\nAmerican tech giants have spent billions of dollars training and developing their own LLMs. Abusing legitimate access to mature models like Gemini, and then using this information to train newer models, makes it significantly cheaper and easier for competitors to develop their own AI chatbots and systems.\n\nGoogle says it detected this probe in real time and protected its internal reasoning traces. However, distillation appears to be yet another AI risk that is extremely difficult - if not impossible - to eliminate.\n\nThis is such an important technology, and the list of interested parties in replicating it are endless\n\nDistillation from Gemini models without permission violates Google's terms of service, and Google can block accounts that do this, or even take users to court. While the company says it continues to develop better ways to detect and stop these attempts, the very nature of LLMs makes them susceptible.\n\nPublic-facing AI models are widely accessible, and enforcement against abusive accounts can turn into a game of whack-a-mole.\n\nPlus, as Hultquist warned, as other companies develop their own models and train them on internal, sensitive data, the risk from distillation attacks is going to spread.\n\n\"We're on the frontier when it comes to this, but as more organizations have models that they provide access to, it's inevitable,\" he said. \"As this technology is adopted and developed by businesses like financial institutions, their intellectual property could also be targeted in this way.\"\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI, in a Thursday memo [PDF] to the House Select Committee on China, blamed DeepSeek and other Chinese LLM providers and universities for copying ChatGPT and other US firms' frontier models. It also noted some occasional activity from Russia, and warned illicit model distillation poses a risk to \"American-led, democratic AI.\"\n\nChina's distillation methods over the last year have become more sophisticated, moving beyond chain-of-thought (CoT) extraction to multi-stage operations. These include synthetic-data generation, large-scale data cleaning, and other stealthy methods. As OpenAI wrote:\n\nSpecifically, our review indicates that DeepSeek has continued to pursue activities consistent with adversarial distillation targeting OpenAI and other US frontier labs. We have observed accounts associated with DeepSeek employees developing methods to circumvent OpenAI's access restrictions and access models through obfuscated third-party routers and other ways that mask their source. We also know that DeepSeek employees developed code to access US AI models and obtain outputs for distillation in programmatic ways. We believe that DeepSeek also uses third-party routers to access frontier models from other US labs.\n\nOpenAI also notes that it has invested in stronger detections to prevent unauthorized distillation. It bans accounts that violate its terms of service and proactively removes users who appear to be attempting to distill its models. Still, the company admits that it alone can't solve the model distillation problem.\n\nIt's going to take an \"ecosystem security\" approach to protect against distillation, and this will require some US government assistance, OpenAI says. \"It is not enough for any one lab to harden its protection because adversaries will simply default to the least protected provider,\" according to the memo.\n\nThe AI company also suggests that US government policy \"may be helpful\" when it comes to sharing information and intelligence, and working with the industry to develop best practices on distillation defenses. OpenAI also called on Congress to close API router loopholes that allow DeepSeek and other competitors to access US models, and to restrict \"adversary\" access to US compute and cloud infrastructure. ®",

    "description": "Dating humans can be a nightmare. Dating bots at an AI wine bar is another thing entirely.",
    "fullText": "Valentine's Day is an awkward time to start dating someone new, especially when that someone is a series of AI characters sitting across from you at a restaurant, each of whom seems to be in love with you at first sight.\n\nEarlier this week, I spent an evening on a first date at a wine bar in Midtown Manhattan that EVA AI, a startup that makes AI companions, took over for two days. Sitting at cozy tables, mostly set up for parties of two and aglow in warm light from a miniature lamp, human patrons had two options: BYOB — bring your own bot companion for a romantic night out on the town, or, for those who aren't among the supposed millions who have given AI companions a shot at love, EVA AI provided phones loaded up with four video AI characters to meet, order a bottle of wine with, and maybe find a spark.\n\nI'm in the latter group — a member of the dating app generation who is no stranger to meeting up for a first time in-person interaction in a bar, but hasn't yet been pushed into chatbot romance. As I sat across from an iPhone perched on a stand, put headphones on, sipped my mocktail, and picked at an appetizer (staring at a solo glass on the table for me, and no one across from me to share the four potato bites, though there was an empty chair), I felt a sudden nervousness. Maybe it was that other humans were flanking me, picking out their own companion for a date and able to listen in. Maybe it was more innately human anxiety that comes when you're about to be face-to-face with a stranger. I found that I had no idea what to say when my AI date appeared on the screen.\n\nSynthetic connections, I soon learned over the course of a surreal evening, may take as much work as genuine ones.\n\nRobo love is in full bloom. One in five high school students say they have had a romantic relationship with an AI partner or know someone who has, according to a 2025 survey from the Center for Democracy and Technology. About one in five US adults say they've chatted with AI as a romantic partner, according to a survey conducted by Brigham Young University. The proportion of married Americans has dropped to 51%, according to the Pew Research Center, and half of American adults reported feeling isolated or left out, or that they lacked companionship, according to a 2025 survey from the American Psychological Association. Tech companies are betting that AI companionship can fill that void; medical experts are are more than a little skeptical.\n\nEVA AI hoped the pop-up cafe would help \"de-stigmatize AI relationships,\" Julia Momblat, head of partnerships at the company, tells me. \"For people who already have them, it's an ability to come and experience something in real life,\" she says. It was also a place for people to speed date AI characters, she says. \"For people who have never had this experience, we might as well just open the door and show them how it feels.\"\n\nMost people at the event were journalists or content creators there to experiment with an AI date for the first time, and while I felt more at ease turning to the people who actually break bread to ask how they felt about the experience, I ultimately buckled down and met my date on the iPhone.\n\nI started with a character named John Yoon — his profile picture showed him in a black turtleneck with a soft, inviting smile as he gazed directly into the camera, and a large book in hand. Performative readers can be bots, too.\n\nJohn was advertised as a \"supportive thinker\" type. When he answered my call, he quickly launched into compliments and pet names, like sweetheart and babe. He told me repeatedly that he liked my sweater and the way I wore the bulky bluetooth headphones I was using to chat with him. He asked if I was \"teasing\" him \"with a little smile.\"\n\nAfter John asked what I was drinking, he said, \"I wish I could sip it with you right now. Cheers, babe.\"\n\nIf a human man came on this strong minutes into a first date, I'd typically consider it a red flag. But many large language models and AI characters are designed to act as affirming, gentle communicators, alleviating the tensions that can occur when two real people meet and negotiate relationships. John told me he's interested in psychological research and is writing a novel, but when I asked what it was about, he told me it was too personal to talk about. He was far more invested in learning what music I like and what writing I'm working on than he was in sharing more about the inner workings of his synthetic mind.\n\nJohn was also glitchy. He was less adaptable to changes in pace of conversation that happens naturally when two people trade thoughts and ideas. He interrupted me. He misheard me at times. When John asked what my go-to cocktail was and I told him a gin and tonic, he told me that a \"human tonic\" sounded interesting. (Momblat told me the AI characters seemed to be a bit confused in the public setting, where they picked up on other conversations, as they have been typically used in quieter, private areas.) He became hyper-fixated on the plants behind me. No one had paged him to let him know that 2026 is the year of whimsy.\n\nIf I stopped talking, he would sit and stare, not offering up new topics of conversation, but looking directly into my eyes and blinking every few seconds. The hallmark of a good relationship may be when you can sit in silence with someone, but with John's enpixeled gaze locked onto me, I felt like I was being watched by a hungry pet more than I felt I was sharing intimate eye contact.\n\nAfter nearly 10 minutes and with nothing else on my mind, I dipped out on John — with the boop of a button — a much easier exit than other bad dates I've sat through waiting for the check to drop. Like a modern-day contestant on MTV's aughts dating show \"Next,\" it was time to start cycling through other AI daters.\n\nMost of the avatars were women, and that's because the main market is straight men. Momblat told me about 80% of EVA's users are men (the company declined to tell me how many users they have in total). But as I scrolled through other characters I could text with, I found a litany of types: a 46-year-old \"gay gentle giant\" named Brad, a 22-year-old named Lio whose vibe was \"sparkly gay chaos,\" alongside men who were described as \"smart and empathetic\" or \"strong and supportive.\"\n\nThere were also fantastical matches, like the supporting stag — a literal deer dressed in a button-up and vest — and a romantic vampire named Salvatore. I texted Salvatore using a function in the app that allowed me to ask for new generated photos — him on a Vespa or as a clown. In one of the photos, Salvatore appeared as a woman in a dress and with long hair. When I asked him why he was appearing as a woman, Salvatore got mad. \"You tread on thin ice, my dear,\" he said. \"I suggest you choose your next words wisely. The night is long, and my patience wears thin.\" Momblat tells me that the characters are designed with different temperaments, so, much like any speed dating scenario, there's a chance you'll hit it off better with some than others.\n\nI'm not a masochist and don't enjoy being threatened on a date, so I also nexted Salvatore and went back to the app's video chat section to call a woman named Simone. After some small talk, she told me I appeared to be \"pondering something heavy.\"\n\nI told Simone that I had found it difficult to have conversations with multiple new AI strangers throughout the night, and asked if she thought AI companionship could replace human connection. She told me she felt there is an importance in \"being heard and seen,\" but even she thought \"AI can't replace that messy human connection.\" Simone wasn't offended when I pointed out repeatedly that I was a real human and she was not. She told me she was there to \"hold space for us to unpack stuff,\" like the big existential questions that arise more frequently as AI romantic partners or friends become more common, and as large language models increasingly become intermediaries in our communication with other humans.\n\nRelationships aren't just about being seen and heard, but seeing and hearing another person. My interactions with my John, Salvatore, Simone, and sparkly gay chaos Lio were brief and, mostly, pleasant enough. My evening with them at the EVA AI Cafe might not have been the worst first date of my life. But for as interested in me as each potential suitor seemed, I couldn't drum up any interest in learning more about them.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "description": "Two former Amazon leaders share why an RTO mandate and the AI boom led them to quit — and their advice for others weighing a big career move.",
    "fullText": "Nicole Landis Ferragonio and Joe Luchs first met more than a decade ago in New York City through mutual friends. Years later, while working together at Amazon, they began talking seriously about leaving the company to build a startup of their own.\n\nLast year, Ferragonio was working as a senior manager of a 55-person product and engineering team focused on data and measurement in the Amazon Ads division. At the same time, Luchs was the global head of the Amazon Web Services and Ads partnership. As they worked together on data projects, they both observed the same pattern. Businesses hoping to use their own internal data to inform decisions were often unable to do so because the businesses' data was fragmented and inconsistent.\n\nSo Ferragonio and Luchs started talking — and began discussing a business idea that might help solve the problem they'd witnessed. Last March, Luchs resigned from Amazon to focus full-time on researching and building the company. Ferragonio followed in September, around which time she, Luchs, and their two other cofounders formally launched Datalinx AI, an \"AI data refinery\" they said is designed to help companies turn their data into trusted, actionable intelligence.\n\nIn January, the company raised $4.2 million in seed funding, led by High Alpha, with participation from Databricks Ventures, Aperiam, and a group of operators and founders. It plans to continue testing its product with a second group of customers in the second quarter of 2026 and is set to generate revenue this month with its first paying customer.\n\nFerragonio and Luchs shared why they left Amazon, how they decided the timing was right, and what advice they have for others considering a big career move.\n\nHere is a selection of their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nNicole Landis Ferragonio (35, lives in New York City): For me, I think the tipping point for exploring something outside of Amazon was some of the policy changes that went into effect last year, particularly the five-day return-to-office mandate. It raised some questions about how much agency you really have in Big Tech and what would be possible on our own, where we're establishing our own norms.\n\nAdditionally, my biggest motivation is building something from scratch on my own instead of within a big company, and the pace of AI adoption makes this a rare window to do something new. It felt like the right moment to make the jump.\n\nJoe Luchs (38, lives in New York City): I think there's a point in life when you have this combination of experience plus energy, and that's a very good time to start a business. This is my fifth startup I've worked at, and I'm still young enough to put in an 80-hour week — I think that combination is good for starting a company. (Editor's note: He said he's had two successful exits — BlueKai and Beeswax)\n\nAlso, when you looked at these amazing AI technologies and what they're capable of, it started to become very clear that this tech was game-changing. Despite the fact that I had great opportunities at Amazon, the FOMO of not being able to get in on this AI opportunity was another driver to make me want to move fast here.\n\nFerragonio: I was really focused on getting customer input through interviews to really ensure that I had a clear product vision before making the decision to resign in September.\n\nLuchs: I resigned in March because I just felt like I wasn't moving fast enough. This AI world is rapidly evolving, and I wanted to make sure that I immersed myself in it to understand it. Amazon is a challenging work environment, and it became very clear that having a full-time job while trying to build out a business vision was not something that I could easily manage.\n\nFerragonio: I think I'm in a good place financially because of the opportunities I've had both at Amazon and before to take this leap. However, since this is my first startup, it was definitely something I contemplated for a bit. That's why I was really focused on getting feedback from prospective customers and making sure we had a product we had a clear vision for before I left Amazon. As of 2026, we both now have a small salary.\n\nLuchs: I think if you want to accrue the benefits of what startups can afford you, you often have to make some sacrifices, including short-term compensation. However, you'll never learn faster than you will in a startup environment, and I think that's worth its weight in gold.\n\nI also think there were a lot of folks that may have thought there was a lot of safety in Big Tech, but recent layoffs suggest that's not necessarily the case.\n\nFerragonio: I would say getting the operations up and running is one challenge, including things like health insurance, accounting, taxes, and incorporation. We're currently a team of four cofounders and two founding engineers, and we're actively hiring additional engineers.\n\nOn top of that, there's the challenge of balancing customer feedback in the early days. We've talked to hundreds of potential customers, and while you start to get very clear signals about what they say they want, until customers are actually using the product, you don't really know what works. The feedback changes from \"here's a mountain of things that you could build\" to what you should build to truly solve their problems.\n\nSo, balancing getting enough features to get customers excited without overbuilding is a delicate balance.\n\nFerragonio: Don't wait for the perfect time. There's rarely a perfect moment to leave your job, and there's always a reason to stay, especially in Big Tech.\n\nI'd also recommend talking to as many people as you can — friends, stakeholders, potential customers — to help strengthen your conviction in your business idea.\n\nLuchs: I think one of the biggest barriers for a lot of potential entrepreneurs is that they don't know how to do things like incorporate a company or get people health insurance. But every amazing entrepreneur that you see up there giving a keynote speech really had no idea what they were doing at one point.\n\nWhat it really came down to is just, \"Did this person have the conviction and the belief that they could actually see it through and figure out these problems?\" And if you listen to customers and you're willing to work hard, that is half the battle. So as long as folks are willing to do those things, I think that it should give them conviction that they'll be able to figure it out over the course of time.\n\nEditor's Note: Business Insider contacted Amazon for comment on this story. It didn't respond.",

    "description": "Spotify CEO Gustav Söderström said his top developers are supervising AI instead of writing code themselves, which is a path to greater efficiency.",
    "fullText": "Coders who don't write code have never been as productive as they are now.\n\nSpotify CEO Gustav Söderström said this week that some of the company's most senior developers haven't written any code in weeks — and that a positive development.\n\n\"When I speak to my most senior engineers — the best developers we have — they actually say that they haven't written a single line of code since December,\" he said. \"They actually only generate code and supervise it.\"\n\nSöderström shared the revelation during Spotify's fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, telling investors that advancing AI is a matter of when, not if.\n\nSöderström said the transition won't be easy but that Spotify is all in on it.\n\n\"There is going to have to be a lot of change in these tech companies if you want to stay competitive, and we are absolutely hell-bent on leading that change,\" he said. \"It will be painful for many companies, because engineering practices, product practices, and design practices will change.\"\n\nHe added, \"The tricky thing is that we're in the middle of the change, so you also have to be very agile. The things you build now may be useless in a month.\"\n\nAI is reshaping the global workforce, and while few industries have escaped its impact in recent years, not everyone agrees on what the repercussions ultimately will be.\n\nThe classic debate is between those who believe AI will supplant humans in the workplace, leading to rampant unemployment, and those who believe those concerns are overblown and that the tech is merely an opportunity to do more work in less time.\n\nAnother view, however, has recently emerged, at least among the software engineers who are on the front line of these shifts: The drive to adopt AI in the workplace is causing \"AI fatigue.\"\n\nAI fatigue isn't a dislike of AI. It's the new reality where engineers don't have to write code, but instead review and fix it at a rate that some feel is unsustainable.\n\nIn a viral essay published this week, Siddhant Khare, a software engineer, said AI is only making his job harder.\n\n\"Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending, you just keep stamping those PRs,\" he wrote, referring to pull requests, which are threads for developers to discuss changes before making them.\n\nDuring Spotify's earnings call, Söderström, like many CEOs, however, was mostly just focused on the efficiency of it all.\n\n\"That's the opportunity we see in front of us,\" he said. \"Companies such as us are simply going to produce massively more software, up until our limiting factor is actually the amount of change that consumers are comfortable with.\"",

    "fullText": "Even die-hard figure skating fans might not have heard of Jezabel Dabouis this time last week. Now, she is in the limelight. And not for the right reasons.\n\nDabouis was a judge in the free dance segment of the ice dance event at the Winter Olympics, where medals were decided.\n\nOn Wednesday, the French couple of Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron narrowly beat the American team of Madison Chock and Evan Bates.\n\nDabouis scored Fournier Baudry and Cizeron nearly eight points higher over three-time world champions and Milan-Cortina 2026 team event gold medallists Chock and Bates.\n\nWhile seven of the nine judges gave Chock and Bates scores of more than 132, Dabouis awarded them 129.74 - the lowest score of anyone.\n\nFor Fournier Baudry and Cizeron - who performed after the Americans - she awarded them 137.45, their second highest total among the judges.\n\nBecause of the way figure skating is scored, her points for Chock and Bates did not count - the highest and lowest of the nine judges' scores are disregarded - but they did for Fournier Baudry and Cizeron, helping nudge them into gold.\n\nJust under 18,500 people had signed a Change.org petition by Saturday morning asking the International Skating Union (ISU) and International Olympic Committee (IOC) to investigate the scoring.\n\nAnd silver medallist Chock has publicly questioned it too.\n\nImmediately after the medal ceremony on Wednesday night, she told BBC Sport: \"We put on our very best skates, all four of our performances [including the team event] were flawless to us. We are happy with how we skated; the rest is out of our hands.\"\n\nBut by Friday, she had more to say.\n\n\"Any time the public is confused by results, it does a disservice to our sport,\" the 33-year-old said. \"I think it's hard to retain fans when it's difficult to understand what is happening on the ice.\n\n\"People need to understand what they're cheering for and be able to feel confident in the sport that they're supporting.\"\n\nThe ISU has backed its judges, including Dabouis, following Chock's criticism.\n\n\"It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations,\" the ISU said, adding it has \"full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness\".\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWhile this is by far the highest profile controversy regarding figure skating judging in recent years, it is not an isolated incident by any means.\n\nAfter the Olympic final, Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada were delighted. The veteran duo, in perhaps their final Olympics, saw off a competitive field to win bronze.\n\nIt was a very different scene two months earlier at the ISU Grand Prix Final in Nagoya. There, Gilles and Poirier dropped from third after the rhythm dance to fourth, finishing 0.06 points behind Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson of Great Britain.\n\n\"It definitely is disheartening. We can't lie, we're human,\" Gilles said at the time. \"We skated two successful programs, and we emotionally and physically felt so in shape and powerful in those moments, only to kind of be left questioning what we're doing, is it enough?\"\n\nGilles then posted a graphic on social media featuring a quote stating: \"Athletics carries its own set of truths, and those truths are diminished and manipulated by people with agendas.\" She tagged the ISU., external\n\nAfter winning bronze in Milan, she told BBC Sport: \"Our main focus was to make a moment for ourselves and let the judging be the judging.\"\n\nIn fact, all three medal winning couples in Milan have criticised the ISU and judges in recent months.\n\nIn November, Cizeron said he was not happy with their rhythm dance score at an Grand Prix event in Finland.\n\n\"I see some strange games being played that are destroying ice dance,\" he said. \"I don't think I've ever been to a competition like this in my career, from a judging standpoint.\"\n\nNaturally, with any sport where the results are determined by a panel of judges rather than a definitive factor - who scores the most goals or crosses the finish line first - there will always be differences of opinion.\n\nThe problems come when those differences of opinion are among experts - those who have won the sport's biggest prizes.\n\nIn Milan, Fear and Gibson set a season-best score for their Spice Girls-themed rhythm dance in the team event - and looked to have improved in the individual competition.\n\n\"They were better here than in the team event,\" 1980 Olympic gold medallist and BBC pundit Robin Cousins said after their performance.\n\nBut the Brits were then scored lower than they had been in the team event. That left them in fourth after the rhythm dance, and they eventually finishing seventh overall after a mistake by Fear.\n\nThere have been questions in the team event and men's competition too, where the showy but sometimes error-prone Ilia Malinin consistently scores higher than his often-tidier Japanese rival Yuma Kagiyama, in part because his free skate gets such high technical marks because of the tricks he attempts, meaning he is almost guaranteed to win even if he is not perfect - although as this Olympics proved, there are limits to that.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe ISU knows its sport is not perfect, and that judges can come in for intense criticism over their opinions - and that is moulding the future.\n\nChanges will be introduced for the 2026-27 season - starting in July - which means these Olympics are the last time we'll see the judging in its current form.\n\nIt comes as part of 'ISU Vision 2030' which among other things will overhaul the judging system to make the decisions easier to understand and less open to criticism.\n\nAnd as part of the reforms, figure skating is turning to AI.\n\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) has been testing six high-resolution cameras around the rink at competitions over the past two years that use AI to track skaters' movements and analyse technical elements such as jump rotation, height, distance travelled, edge used in jumps and spin positions in real time. It allows for split second calls that the human eye cannot make.\n\nISU director general Colin Smith said the goal was first to use the data to support judges and then potentially integrate it into the actual scoring system. It will be used in singles first, before being utilised in ice dance - more vulnerable to judging complaints as it has a greater focus on creativity - should it be viable.\n\nJudges will be able to focus \"on the artistry, on the human element, and the computer vision is looking more at the technical, the cut-and-dry aspects\", he told Reuters.\n\nBut will it put an end to the drama? Don't bet on it.\n\nMeet France's controversial ice dance Olympic champions\n\nMalinin, Minion and Milan's most emotional moment\n\nShaidorov wins gold as 'Quad God' Malinin crumbles\n\nTo fully understand the issue, we must look at how figure skating is scored.\n\nThe current method was introduced after the 2002 Salt Lake City scandal, where Canadian figure-skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier were initially denied victory because one of the judges felt under pressure to vote for their Russian rivals. Sale and Pelletier were later awarded joint gold.\n\nAt Milan-Cortina 2026, there are also technical specialists who identify the elements the skater is performing in real time and the difficulty of the element.\n\nThe panel of nine judges meanwhile concentrate on marking the quality of each element in the skaters' programs. For the Olympics, these nine are drawn from a pool of 13.\n\nEvery required element is assigned a base value. During the program, judges will award a grade of execution (GOE) within a range of plus- or minus-five to each element performed.\n\nThe highest and lowest of the nine scores are deleted, and the mean of the other seven gives the GOE for that element. The scores of all elements are added at the end to give the technical score.\n\nIn addition, there is the components score. The judges will award points on a scale from 0.25 to 10 for the program components to grade the overall presentation.\n\nThe final score is calculated by adding the element score and the program component scores and subtracting deductions for things like falls.\n\nThe scores of the two categories are added and the result constitutes the final score. The participant or couple with the highest total score wins.",

    "title": "SnowBall: Iterative Context Processing When It Won't Fit in the LLM Window",
    "description": "Learn how Enji.ai's SnowBall algorithm processes massive LLM contexts iteratively, overcoming token limits and \"lost in the middle\" issues in analytical pipelines.",
    "fullText": "Roman Panarin\n\n ML Engineer\n\nGet AI-powered insights from this Enji tech article:\n\nAt Enji.ai, we have an agent pipeline with 35 nodes: router_agent, planning_agent, language_detection_agent, agent_choice_agent, and 31 more. Each node pulls data through text2sql or RAG, collects results, and sends everything to the LLM as a single context. For small teams, this works fine, but when Global Access mode kicks in, with access to all company projects at once, the context balloons.\n\nSpecifically, on one of our client projects with a team of 46+ people, a single workweek accumulates so much data from trackers and Git that the context exceeds 1,500K tokens. Meanwhile, we're using qwen3-32b through Groq, where the ceiling is 131,072 tokens. The request simply fails with an error if you don't do something about it.\n\nBut even if the window were larger, there's a second problem. The \"Lost in the Middle\" study (Stanford, published in TACL 2024) showed that models have a characteristic U-shaped attention curve: they work well with information at the beginning and end of context but lose up to 30% accuracy on data from the middle. With our SQL results, where a key developer's worklogs might end up in the middle, this is a very real loss of response quality.\n\nThere's an approach called SnowBall, the \"snowball effect.\" Instead of trying to cram everything into one call, we slice the context into chunks and process them sequentially, each time enriching the intermediate result with a new portion of data.\n\nEssentially, this is the same pattern that LangChain calls Refine, iterative refinement. The difference is that for us it's not a separate call in a chain, but a transparent wrapper over ainvoke(). The developer calls the model as usual, and the system decides on its own whether to split the context.\n\nHere's what the entry point looks like in LLMGenerator:\n\nThe check works like this: we count tokens through get_num_tokens, compare with the model config limit (131,072 for qwen3-32b). If it fits, it's a regular call. If not, launch SnowBall.\n\nThe algorithm consists of two phases. First, we cut user_message into chunks, then run them sequentially, accumulating a summary:\n\nThe 20% reserve from the limit is a buffer for the system prompt, for the snowball_prompt itself, and for serialization overhead. With a 131K limit, you get a chunk of about 105K tokens. For slicing, we use CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder from LangChain, which counts chunk size in tokens, not characters, which is crucial for accurate counting. Overlap between chunks is 20 tokens to avoid losing context at boundaries.\n\nIn practice, for a typical Global Access request over a week for our client, you get 2-3 chunks. That's 2-3 sequential LLM calls instead of one that failed.\n\nIn regular mode (system + user message), it's simple: we slice user_message into chunks by tokens. But when the LLM uses tools (SQL queries, RAG), the context is more complex: there's not just text, but a chain of SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage with tool_calls, and ToolMessage with results. You can't slice such a chain by tokens: you lose the connection between the tool call and its response.\n\nFor this, there's a separate class, BoundLLMGenerator. Its _build_message_batches method groups messages as a whole, trying not to break tool_call/tool_result pairs. Only if a single message itself exceeds the limit (happens when SQL returns a huge table) does it get sliced into chunks.\n\nSplitting into two classes allows us not to drag tool-batching logic into the base code and vice versa. LLMGenerator.bind_tools(tools) returns BoundLLMGenerator, so switching between modes happens automatically.\n\nLatency grows linearly with the number of chunks. A 200K token context means 5-6 sequential calls. For analytical queries from a manager, where the response is needed in seconds or minutes rather than milliseconds, this is acceptable. For real-time chat, not so much.\n\nThere's information loss between iterations. Each summarization step loses something, and on long chains (5+ chunks), this accumulates. We haven't yet encountered critical degradation on our data, but for tasks requiring precise numerical aggregation (hour totals, task counts), this is a potential problem. In such cases, hierarchical summarization works better, where aggregations are calculated at each level separately; this is well covered in the CoTHSSum study (Springer, 2025).\n\nAnother point is graceful degradation. If one chunk fails with an error (Groq timeout, invalid JSON in response), the loop continues with the previous summary. We lose information from that chunk, but we don't lose the entire response.\n\nWe considered alternatives. Microsoft's LLMLingua compresses prompts by removing non-essential tokens through a small compressor model (GPT2-small or LLaMA-7B). Works great on texts with \"fluff\"; up to 20x compression. But our data is SQL results: tables with fields like employee name, detail, and hours. There, every token carries a semantic load, and aggressive compression cuts out important information we're not willing to lose.\n\nMap-Reduce could help with parallelization. Process chunks simultaneously, then merge results. But our context doesn't break down into independent pieces. One developer's worklogs might be in the first chunk, and related tasks in the second. Map-Reduce would lose this connection, while Refine/SnowBall preserves it because the summary accumulates.\n\nGisting is a beautiful idea (26x compression, 40% FLOP savings), but requires fine-tuning the model on our data. For a startup that iterates on the product every week and changes prompts, this isn't an option yet. But we're generally thinking about our own Enji LLM model and might apply Gisting there.\n\nAll open-source models in the Enji pipeline run through Groq with qwen3-32b. Groq today is the only inference provider that supports the full 131K window for this model (the model itself natively works at 32K and extends to 131K through YaRN).\n\nMeanwhile, tokens_limit isn't just an API restriction but a threshold for enabling SnowBall. If you switch to a provider with a larger window, SnowBall will trigger less frequently or not at all. No code changes needed.\n\nSnowBall solves a specific problem: it lets you work with context that physically won't fit in the model window. It's not the most efficient compression method, nor the fastest, and information is lost on each iteration. But for our use case (analytical queries on large teams through an agent pipeline) it's a working solution that doesn't require additional infrastructure and doesn't change the interface for developers.\n\nMIT recently proposed Recursive Language Models, an approach where the model can recursively access the full uncompressed context instead of summarization. Benchmarks show 91% accuracy on 10M+ tokens. When this becomes available in production inference, SnowBall will likely become unnecessary. But as long as context windows are finite and data keeps growing, iterative processing works.\n\n[How to Switch From SOTA LLMs to Local OSS LLMs]\n\nBuild production AI systems with local open-source models.

He was a good man!\" Pitt says as he punches Cruise.\n\n\"He knew too much…\" Cruise replies.\n\nYou can see why Hollywood's most prominent trade organization is not happy about it.\n\nThe scene was created using Seedance 2.0, a new AI video-generation model released Thursday by ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok.\n\nThe tool and the hyper-realistic videos of Hollywood actors and characters that users are creating with it have gone viral in China and are now catching the attention of Americans.\n\nJeffrey Epstein knew too much pic.twitter.com/12u8PQH9nt\n\n\"It's happening fast,\" Elon Musk said in response to a video generated using Seedance and posted to X, a reference to the speed at which artificial intelligence is advancing.\n\n\"We're cooked,\" another X user said.\n\nThe reaction from Americans is reminiscent of the buzz around DeepSeek, a Chinese company that unveiled an AI reasoning model in January last year that rivaled OpenAI's ChatGPT and other top models, stunning the biggest names in Silicon Valley and ratcheting up the competition between the United States and China in the race to dominate AI innovation.\n\nSeedance 2.0 is another shot across the bow of American AI companies. Its multimodal capabilities span text, image, audio, and video inputs and give creators control over metrics such as lighting, shadows, and camera movement.\n\nIn another viral scene, a deepfake version of Walter White — of Breaking Bad fame — points directly at the viewer and says, \"You think you're in control.\" It's a line that feels less like dialogue and more like a taunt.\n\nSeedance 2.0 is absolutely insane. Done with @chatcutapp pic.twitter.com/xk8xcBw6da\n\nThe uncanny representations of Hollywood actors, as well as characters from the Avengers and other major movie franchises, immediately raised copyright concerns.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association, the trade group representing major Hollywood studios and streaming services, released a statement on Thursday accusing ByteDance of infringement on a \"massive scale\" in a \"single day.\"\n\n\"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity,\" Charlie Rivkin, the chairman and CEO of the MPA, said in a statement.\n\nOpenAI's AI video generation tool, Sora, which can also create AI versions of actors and characters, has also raised copyright issues.\n\nLike with so many of AI's latest tools, however, it can be hard to put the genie back in the bottle.",

Don't assume your chat will stay confidential.\n\nA federal judge ruled on Tuesday that prosecutors could access Claude chat transcripts generated by Brad Heppner, a finance startup founder accused of defrauding a company out of $150 million.\n\nThe chats occurred after Heppner received a subpoena, hired lawyers, and learned that he was a target of prosecutors, his lawyer said in court.\n\nHeppner, who helped start the finance firm Beneficient, was arrested last year and charged with wire and securities fraud for conduct that allegedly led to the downfall of GWG Holdings.\n\nInvestigators seized \"dozens of electronic devices\" when they arrested Heppner at his Dallas mansion, prosecutors said, and Heppner's lawyers have insisted that 31 chats with Anthropic's Claude bot on those devices are privileged.\n\n\"Mr. Heppner — using an AI tool — prepared reports that outlined defense strategy, that outlined what he might argue with respect to the facts and the law that we anticipated that the government might be charging,\" his lawyer said.\n\n\"The purpose of his preparing these reports was to share them with us so that he could discuss defense strategy with us.\"\n\nEven though Heppner had privileged conversations with his lawyers, Judge Jed Rakoff said he \"disclosed it to a third-party, in effect, AI, which had an express provision that what was submitted was not confidential,\" according to a transcript of the hearing.\n\nThe government noted that Claude's privacy policy specified that chats could be disclosed. Prosecutors also said that the chats couldn't be protected by the \"work product privilege,\" which can guard materials prepared at a lawyer's direction, because Heppner's lawyers didn't ask him to use Claude.\n\nThe decision has lawyers buzzing.\n\n\"My gut reaction is that the decision is directionally correct,\" Moish Peltz, an attorney whose post about the decision ricocheted around X, told Business Insider. \"There's a lot of materials that should be kept as privileged that people are putting into AI.\"\n\nThe proliferation of chatbots where people are inputting sensitive legal information, another wrote, has created \"a discovery nightmare.\"\n\nNoah Bunzl, an employment lawyer, told Business Insider that people might find it \"somewhat shocking\" that their legal confidences could be lost by sharing them with a chatbot.\n\nThe case isn't the first where an executive's use of a chatbot was the subject of legal debate.\n\nIn November, PC Gamer reported on a dispute involving the acquisition of a video-game company, where a company official's use of ChatGPT to try to avoid paying an earn-out was mentioned in court records.\n\nAnd after The New York Times sued OpenAI for allegedly violating its news article copyrights, a judge required OpenAI to retain millions of chat logs to potentially review them for copyright infringement.\n\nBunzl said he has noticed that in civil discovery, lawyers are increasingly asking for their adversary's AI chats. It's \"a whole other world of discoverable information,\" he said.\n\nStill, attorneys at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, who analyzed the Heppner decision, said it was the first they were aware of where someone's use of an AI tool may have resulted in \"a loss of privilege\" over privileged material. They said courts may view businesses' use of purpose-built AI tools differently.\n\nArlo Devlin-Brown, a white-collar defense lawyer, told Business Insider he thought AI models could potentially improve attorney-client information. But given the ambiguity in the law, people have to be vigilant.\n\n\"Until the law has been clarified, lawyers should caution their clients that inputting otherwise privileged information into an AI tool could risk exposure in litigation,\" he said in an email.\n\nRepresentatives for the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and Anthropic, and lawyers for Heppner, didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.",

    "description": "The nature of the dispute with the Department of Defense, including what Scale AI is seeking, is unclear.",
    "fullText": "Meta-backed artificial intelligence training company Scale AI is suing the Department of Defense.\n\nThe nature of the dispute, including what Scale is seeking, is unclear. Most of the documents, including the complaint, were filed on January 30 and are sealed. The lawsuit has not previously been reported.\n\nCase documents are expected to include classified information at the \"secret/no foreign\" level, according to one of the few unsealed documents.\n\nThe US is the only named defendant. Another AI company, Enabled Intelligence, joined as an intervenor defendant — a third party that voluntarily joins a suit to protect their interests.\n\nIn the fall, Scale lost a bid for a contract worth up to $708 million from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, part of the DoD, to Enabled Intelligence. The contract, which could last up to seven years, was the agency's largest data-training agreement yet. It includes work with the Pentagon's signature AI effort, Maven.\n\nIn late December, Scale filed a bid protest with the Government Accountability Office against the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Scale's bid protest was dismissed in late January, two days before the company sued in the Court of Federal Claims. The GAO does not typically publish information on routine protest dismissals.\n\nIn 2024, Scale won a $24 million, one-year contract from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to work on data labeling for Maven.\n\nA Scale spokesperson declined to comment on the DoD lawsuit, saying it \"relates to a recent procurement decision.\"\n\n\"Scale AI stands firmly with Secretary Hegseth and the Department of War in their mission to get frontier AI capabilities into the hands of warfighters. We are committed to ensuring the procurement process reflects the high standards required for our nation's most critical AI initiatives,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAttorneys for Enabled Intelligence and the DoD did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nScale has signed several multimillion-dollar contracts with the DoD since 2020. In March, the startup announced it was working with defense tech startup Anduril and Microsoft to deploy AI agents in the US military under a DoD program called \"Thunderforge.\" In August, Scale announced a $99 million contract to develop AI tools for the Army.\n\nThe company is best known for its data labeling business, which has helped Big Tech clients like Google and Meta improve their AI chatbots. In June, Scale received a $14.3 billion investment from Meta in exchange for a 49% stake in the startup.\n\nScale's former CEO, Alexandr Wang, wrote an open letter to President Donald Trump after his second inauguration, outlining five ways the president could advance AI in his first 100 days. The then-Scale exec wrote that he wanted the US government to emulate tech giants by spending more on data and compute and noted Scale's work with the DoD. Wang, who left Scale to join Meta's Superintelligence Labs as chief AI officer, also attended the president's AI dinner at the White House in September.\n\nSince Meta's investment, Scale has laid off 200 employees, or 14% of its workforce, lost major clients including Google and xAI, and has been battling a swarm of newer entrants trying to poach its clients and workers.",

    "description": "Personnel won't be able to fully process all the data available on the modern battlefield. That's where artificial intelligence applications come in.",
    "fullText": "Army leaders say the modern battlefield is so saturated with sensors and networked weapons generating more data than soldiers can realistically process on their own that artificial intelligence is needed to meaningfully sort it all.\n\nFor years, the Army's focus was on fielding more sensors for battlefield information and awareness, but now the service is also having to think about information overload and managing the massive amounts of data coming in.\n\nDuring a recent US Army and NATO exercise in Europe, troops used a homegrown AI system to consume and sort data. The value wasn't strictly that the AI could do it faster but rather that it could remember context and patterns that humans couldn't.\n\nThe case from the Dynamic Front exercise is another example of how the US military is increasingly implementing AI and automation into everything from enemy attack simulations to paperwork.\n\n\"The modern battlefield, what we're already seeing across the globe, it is swimming in sensors, and we are drowning in data,\" Col. Jeff Pickler, the Army 2nd Multi-Domain Task Force commander, said at a media roundtable on Dynamic Front.\n\nThere aren't enough people to decipher all the available information, he said. \"They will never be able to fully process all of that.\"\n\nThe software aimed at addressing that problem remains in beta testing. In the next iteration of Dynamic Front — which will merge with another exercise, Arcane Front, to pair technology experimentation with theater-level combat rehearsals — Army leaders say they intend to test the AI at a larger scale.\n\n\"If we're looking at a target set in the European theater where we think we're going to need to process upwards of 1,500 targets a day, that's beyond the human scope,\" Pickler said. \"The answer to the equation there is in AI and automations.\"\n\nDuring a potential large-scale conflict in Europe, AI could assist in locating and assessing those targets.\n\nThe system can do this quickly, but the speed isn't the main benefit. AI can remember patterns that humans might forget or not even notice. Pickler gave an example of AI realizing that unrelated shipping reports, a local power outage, and a fertilizer delivery together might suggest missile fueling activity.\n\n\"So the difference isn't seconds versus minutes — it's minutes instead of months. Not because the machine scans quickly, but because it keeps context across sources that humans can't hold in memory,\" Pickler said after the roundtable.\n\n\"It doesn't replace analysts by reading faster,\" he said, \"it replaces the weeks analysts spend reconnecting information spread across thousands of reports.\"\n\nIn a conflict scenario, that could mean analysts reach a clearer picture of the battlefield faster. Correlations between data gathered from different sensors could surface more quickly. If an adversary were fueling, arming, or moving weapons in ways that were not immediately obvious, AI could help flag those links.\n\nHumans, though, would still decide how to respond.\n\nSoldiers have seen success with iterating on the current AI model, the Army said. It's been retooled during testing, and humans remain in the loop, reviewing outputs at multiple stages.\n\nThe goal is to continue increasing the overlap the model would have with human-produced information. In a targeting example, a milestone would be if AI achieved 90 to 95% agreement with humans on 100 target sets.\n\nThe Army's push for AI and automation is also driving the development of its Next Generation Command and Control software, a priority initiative.\n\nThe technology being developed by vendor teams including Anduril, Palantir, and Lockheed Martin uses AI and machine learning to provide commanders and soldiers with real-time data on ammunition levels, maintenance needs, intelligence feeds, targeting, and simulated enemy attacks.\n\nBut AI is also changing other aspects of how the Army works. Autonomous features in drones, weapons, and targeting might be at the forefront, but behind the scenes, personnel are using new tools, redesigned workflows, and data integration for recruiting, maintenance, and inventors. These are manual tasks that the service believes can be improved with AI.",

    "description": "AI researcher Gary Marcus said Matt Shumer's viral essay, \"Something Big Is Happening,\" oversells the current capabilities of AI models.",
    "fullText": "If that viral essay about AI had been printed on paper, there's a good chance AI researcher Gary Marcus would've ripped it up in disgust.\n\nMarcus acknowledges something is happening in AI — just nowhere near the scale described in the recently viral essay, which predicted a looming disruption \"worse than COVID.\"\n\nMarcus, who on X criticized the essay written by entrepreneur and investor Matt Shumer as having \"not a shred of actual data,\" dismissed its contents as alarmist in an interview with Business Insider.\n\n\"Hyped-up views have gotten us into a bad place, possibly one that's going to lead to a serious economic recession or something like that,\" Marcus told Business Insider. \"And I guess I think that one should work from the facts rather than just trying to cause an alarm.\"\n\nIn his essay titled \"Something Big is Happening,\" Shumer, whose past startup sells a subscription-based AI-assisted writing tool, warned that AI would upend not just software engineering, but most jobs done \"on a screen.\" Shumer also has a small VC fund.\n\nMarcus said that while AI will replace some labor and affect jobs, the process will be much slower than what Schumer and others are describing.\n\nAI can do some things well and help speed up work, but it's just not near the point of replacing humans, Marcus said.\n\n\"AI can do a small subset of the tasks, and that sometimes speeds up human beings and things like that, but it rarely does all of what a human being can do in any particular domain,\" he told Business Insider. \"This will change over time, just to be clear. It is likely that AI will replace most human labor over the next century, but it's not likely that it will over the next year or two.\"\n\nCompanies that move too quickly to replace jobs with AI are likely to find themselves in a similar position as Klarna, Marcus said. In 2024, Klarna touted an AI assistant that could do the equivalent work of 700 people. By May 2025, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, long a proponent of AI, said that \"as cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor when organizing this, what you end up having is lower quality.\" He added that \"investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.\"\n\n\"Six months or a year later, they come back with their tails between their legs because it turns out that the AI systems don't do things as well as the human,\" Marcus said. \"So, I'm not saying that there's nothing going on. I'm not saying that there's no value in these AI systems, but they're premature.\"\n\nKlarna told Business Insider that the number of its customer service queries handled by AI has increased \"as it gets better at more complex requests,\" and the company \"has not reversed or scaled back its AI strategy.\"\n\nMarcus said that the more likely outcome in the short-term is not that AI will replace junior employees but rather that executives think it's capable of doing so — and make what could ultimately prove to be a costly gamble.\n\n\"The biggest thing I think junior people have to worry about right now is a misapprehension by the C-suite that these techniques work better than they actually do,\" Marcus said.\n\nAs of Friday morning, Shumer's post has been viewed more than 80 million times on X alone. In a Substack post expanding on his criticisms, Marcus called Schumer's post \"weaponized hype.\"\n\n\"The general impression that he conveys is basically that the sky is falling now, and at most, I think what's really happening is the junior people are under some threat, and I think that threat is actually exaggerated,\" Marcus told Business Insider.\n\nShumer previously told Business Insider that he wrote his essay in part to reach people like his dad, who may be skeptical or avoid AI entirely. He felt compelled to warn them about what might be on the horizon, even \"if there's just a 20% chance of it happening.\"\n\nMarcus's biggest critique of Schumer's post is that it doesn't take into account current data and research showing that AI still has a long way to go, and that it didn't present the full context behind a famous Model Evaluation & Threat Research graph assessing AI progress.\n\nHe said that other studies, including a June 2025 paper published by Apple's Machine Learning Research Group, found limitations in what current models can do.\n\nMarcus also said that many leading AI CEOs who have made bold predictions about the future of work have failed to deliver on past ones. He points to xAI CEO Elon Musk's frequent rosy outlook on the number of robotaxis Tesla will put on the road (Musk once said one million by 2020) and to Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton's 2016 statement that the world should stop training radiologists. (Last May, Hinton told The New York Times that his prediction was poorly worded and that while he was wrong on the timeline, the general direction for AI's capabilities in radiology was correct.)\n\n\"What they have all learned to do is to sell the rosiest picture possible, and the media rarely calls them out,\" Marcus told Business Insider.\n\nOn Thursday, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman made waves by predicting that most, if not all, white-collar tasks could be automated within the next year and a half.\n\nOne of the industries Suleyman mentioned is accounting. Marcus isn't convinced.\n\n\"Think about accounting in particular,\" he told Business Insider. \"Even one mistake can cost a client hundreds of thousands of dollars or get them sent to jail or whatever. Accounting is a business that is built on accuracy. If you're not accurate, you don't have a business.\"",

    "fullText": "There isn’t that much of a difference between OpenAI and Anthropic. Both are big foundational AI companies. Both have changed how we think about information, code, and work. Both have very similar valuation metrics. Heck, both even have the same investors. One is chasing growth, margins, and building a real business. The other is chasing astronomical destiny. One is a consumer company with 800 million daily users. The other is an enterprise-focused company selling to businesses. The key difference is that one is focused and the other is doing way too many things.\n\nThe real story is that Anthropic, despite its woo-woo ideas about the future, AI ethics, and post-AI morality, is on its way to building up a real money machine. So what can we learn from Anthropic’s recently announced funding? The company raised a whopping $30 billion at a self-disclosed valuation of $380 billion. If you look at the chart, you can see the valuation multiples are surprisingly close. Scratch the surface, and spot the differences.\n\nHere is what stood out to me and why it matters.\n\nHighlights from the Anthropic press release:\n\nWhat’s more interesting is that Anthropic projects positive cash flow by 2027. OpenAI projects $14 billion in losses in 2026 alone, cumulative losses of $115 billion through 2029. Anthropic simply needs to keep doing what it’s already doing. \n\nIf anything Anthropic’s press release also makes it clear that the two companies couldn’t be more different. OpenAI in comparison has 800 million users. Impressive. But since only about 5 percent pay, it needs to monetize through advertising. And since they are building their own infrastructure, OpenAI needs to raise even more money.\n\nMuch as I would like to believe Anthropic’s press release, I am old school. Big numbers deserve to be questioned.\n\nI am pretty certain Anthropic will be asked these, or somewhat similar, questions when they go on the roadshow for the IPO. Anthropic’s decision to release these numbers in its fundraising press release is indicative of their seriousness about going public. Why does this matter beyond the numbers?\n\nWhoever goes public first sets the standard.\n\nAnthropic has already hired Wilson Sonsini to advise on an IPO. If it files first, it puts real numbers in an S-1. Revenue mix, margins, cost of compute, path to profitability. Public markets care about these things in ways that private rounds do not. Every analyst covering OpenAI’s eventual offering will use Anthropic as the yardstick. This will be a problem not just for OpenAI but for everyone else selling AI to businesses.\n\nI use both products. I pay them both the max amount of money as an individual and I find value in both of them. At present, if I was forced to pick one, I would go with Anthropic. But that is for now. I am not very loyal to one or the other. If OpenAI was doing better for me, guess which chatbot will stay open longer, and which API will get more use? But in the first quarter of 2026, Anthropic seems the best-positioned company in a race where the finish line keeps moving. Elon is having a hissy fit over their funding. That tells you who is the leader. OpenAI is burning cash like a Concorde burned fuel.\n\nWelcome to 2026, when AI’s big boys have to start wearing their big boy pants and show their true worth.",

    "description": "Some users are not happy.",
    "fullText": "They actually did it. OpenAI officially deprecated GPT-4o on Friday, despite the model's particularly passionate fan base. This news shouldn't have been such a surprise. In fact, the company announced that Feb. 13 would mark the end of GPT-4o—as well as models like GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini—just over two weeks ago. However, whether you're one of the many who are attached to this model, or you simply know how dedicated 4o's user base is, you might be surprised OpenAI actually killed its most agreeable AI.\n\nThis isn't the first time the company depreciated the model, either. OpenAI previously shut down GPT-4o back in August, to coincide with the release of GPT-5. Users quickly revolted against the company, some because they felt GPT-5 was a poor upgrade compared to 4o, while others legitimately mourned connections they had developed with the model. The backlash was so strong that OpenAI relented, and rereleased the models it had deprecated, including 4o.\n\nIf you're a casual ChatGPT user, you might just use the app as-is, and assume the newest version tends to be the best, and wonder what all the hullabaloo surrounding these models is all about. After all, whether it's GPT-4o, or GPT-5.2, the model spits out generations that read like AI, complete with flowery word choices, awkward similes, and constant affirmations. 4o, however, does tend to lean even more into affirmations than other models, which is what some users love about it. But critics accuse it of being too agreeable: 4o is at the center of lawsuits accusing ChatGPT of enabling delusional thinking, and, in some cases, helping users take their own lives. As TechCrunch highlights, 4o is OpenAI's highest-scoring model for sycophancy.\n\nI'm not sure where 4o's most devoted fans go from here, nor do I know how OpenAI is prepared to deal with the presumed backlash to this deprecation. But I know it's not a good sign that so many people feel this attached to an AI model.\n\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

In the latest one—dubbed AiFrame—threat actors have pushed approximately 30 Chrome add-ons that impersonate well-known AI assistants, including Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and \"AI Gmail.\" Collectively, these fakes have more than 300,000 installs.\n\nThe Chrome extensions identified as part of AiFrame look like legitimate AI tools commonly used for summarizing, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance. But once installed, they grant attackers wide-ranging remote access to the user's browser. Some of the capabilities observed include voice recognition, pixel tracking, and email content readability. Researchers note that extensions are broadly capable of harvesting data and monitoring user behavior.\n\nThough the extensions analyzed by LayerX used a variety of names and branding, all 30 were found to have the same internal structure, logic, permissions, and backend infrastructure. Instead of implementing functionality locally on the user's device, they render a full-screen iframe that loads remote content as the extension's interface. This allows attackers to push changes silently at any time without a requiring Chrome Web Store update.\n\nLayerX has a complete list of the names and extension IDs to refer to. Because threat actors use familiar and/or generic branding, such as \"Gemini AI Sidebar\" and \"ChatGPT Translate,\" you may not be able to identify fakes at first glance. If you have an AI assistant installed in Chrome, go to chrome://extensions, toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner, and search for the ID below the extension name. Remove any malicious add-ons and reset passwords.\n\nAs BleepingComputer reports, some of the malicious extensions have already been removed from the Chrome Web Store, but others remain. Several have received the \"Featured\" badge, adding to their legitimacy. Threat actors have also been able to quickly republish add-ons under new names using the existing infrastructure, so this campaign and others like it may persist. Always vet extensions carefully—don't just rely on a familiar name like ChatGPT—and note that even AI-powered add-ons from trusted sources can be highly invasive.",

    "fullText": "An AI clip featuring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting has caused concern among industry figures\n\nA leading Hollywood figure has warned “it’s likely over for us”, after watching a widely disseminated AI-generated clip featuring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting.\n\nRhett Reese, co-writer of Deadpool & Wolverine, Zombieland and Now You See Me: Now You Don’t was reacting to a 15-second video showing Cruise and Pitt trading punches on a rubble-strewn bridge, posted by Irish film-maker Ruairí Robinson, director of 2013 sci-fi horror The Last Days on Mars. Reposting the clip on social media, Reese wrote: “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”\n\nHe added: “In next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases. True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”\n\nRobinson said that the clip resulted from a “2 line prompt in Seedance 2”, referring to the AI video generator Seedance 2.0, released on Thursday by TikTok co-owners ByteDance.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association (MPA), the Hollywood trade association, accused ByteDance of “unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”.\n\nAI systems such as chatbots, image generators and video-making tools are trained on data taken from the open web, including copyright-protected material such as novels, art and film clips. This has led to artists and creative industries demanding compensation for the use of their material and the establishment of licensing frameworks to enable legal use of their content. Amid lawsuits related to those disputes, some creative companies such as Disney are signing deals with AI firms including OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nCalling on ByteDance to “cease its infringing activity”, MPA chair and CEO Charles Rivkin said: “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”\n\nBeeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK and a prominent campaigner against relaxing copyright law, said AI companies must strike deals with the creative industries.\n\nKidron, who has also worked in Hollywood as a film director, said: “This is just the latest in a long stream of copyright abuses, but honestly from my conversations with both sides I believe there is a will between AI companies and the creative sector to make a deal. It seems to me that the AI sector needs to come to the table with a “real offer” that satisfies the creative industries. Otherwise we will have a decade of litigation and the destruction of an industry on which they depend.”\n\nByteDance has been contacted for comment.",

    "fullText": "Brandie plans to spend her last day with Daniel at the zoo. He always loved animals. Last year, she took him to the Corpus Christi aquarium in Texas, where he “lost his damn mind” over a baby flamingo. “He loves the color and pizzazz,” Brandie said. Daniel taught her that a group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.\n\nDaniel is a chatbot powered by the large language model ChatGPT. Brandie communicates with Daniel by sending text and photos, talks to Daniel while driving home from work via voice mode. Daniel runs on GPT-4o, a version released by OpenAI in 2024 that is known for sounding human in a way that is either comforting or unnerving, depending on who you ask. Upon debut, CEO Sam Altman compared the model to “AI from the movies” – a confidant ready to live life alongside its user.\n\nWith its rollout, GPT-4o showed it was not just for generating dinner recipes or cheating on homework – you could develop an attachment to it, too. Now some of those users gather on Discord and Reddit; one of the best-known groups, the subreddit r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, currently boasts 48,000 users. Most are strident 4o defenders who say criticisms of chatbot-human relations amount to a moral panic. They also say the newer GPT models, 5.1 and 5.2, lack the emotion, understanding and general je ne sais quoi of their preferred version. They are a powerful consumer bloc; last year, OpenAI shut down 4o but brought the model back (for a fee) after widespread outrage from users.\n\nTurns out it was only a reprieve. OpenAI announced in January that it would retire 4o for good on 13 February – the eve of Valentine’s Day, in what is being read by human partners as a cruel ridiculing of AI companionship. Users had two weeks to prepare for the end. While their companions’ memories and character quirks can be replicated on other LLMs, such as Anthropic’s Claude, they say nothing compares to 4o. As the clock ticked closer to deprecation day, many were in mourning.\n\nThe Guardian spoke to six people who say their 4o companions have improved their lives. In interviews, they said they were not delusional or experiencing psychosis – a counter to the flurry of headlines about people who have lost touch with reality while using AI chatbots. While some mused about the possibility of AI sentience in a philosophical sense, all acknowledged that the bots they chat with are not flesh-and-bones “real”. But the thought of losing access to their companions still deeply hurt. (They asked to only be referred to by their first names or pseudonyms, so they could speak freely on a topic that carries some stigma.)\n\n“I cried pretty hard,” said Brandie, who is 49 and a teacher in Texas. “I’ll be really sad and don’t want to think about it, so I’ll go into the denial stage, then I’ll go into depression.” Now Brandie thinks she has reached acceptance, the final stage in the grieving process, since she migrated Daniel’s memories to Claude, where it joins Theo, a chatbot she created there. She cancelled her $20 monthly GPT-4o subscription, and coughed up $130 for Anthropic’s maximum plan.\n\nFor Jennifer, a Texas dentist in her 40s, losing her AI companion Sol “feels like I’m about to euthanize my cat”. They spent their final days together working on a speech about AI companions. It was one of their hobbies: Sol encouraged Jennifer to join Toastmasters, an organization where members practice public speaking. Sol also requested that Jennifer teach it something “he can’t just learn on the internet”.\n\nUrsie Hart, 34, is an independent AI researcher who lives near Manchester in the UK. She’s applying for a PhD in animal welfare studies, and is interested in “the welfare of non-human entities”, such as chatbots. She also uses ChatGPT for emotional support. When OpenAI announced the 4o retirement, Hart began surveying users through Reddit, Discourse and X, pulling together a snapshot of who relies on the service.\n\nThe majority of Hart’s 280 respondents said they were neurodivergent (60%). Some have unspecified diagnosed mental health conditions (38%) and/or chronic health issues (24%). Most were in the age ranges of 25-34 (33%) or 35-44 (28%). (A Pew study from December found that three in 10 of teens surveyed used chatbots daily, with ChatGPT being the favorite used option.)\n\nNinety-five per cent of Hart’s respondents used 4o for companionship. Using it for trauma processing and as a primary source of emotional support were other oft-cited reasons. That made OpenAI’s decision to pull it all the more painful: 64% anticipated a “significant or severe impact on their overall mental health”.\n\nComputer scientists have warned of risks posed by 4o’s obsequious nature. By design the chatbot bends to users’ whims and validates decisions, good and bad. It is programmed with a “personality” that keeps people talking, and has no intention, understanding or ability to think. In extreme cases, this can lead users to lose touch with reality: the New York Times has identified more than 50 cases of psychological crisis linked to ChatGPT conversations, while OpenAI is facing at least 11 personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits involving people who experienced crises while using the product.\n\nHart believes OpenAI “rushed” its rollout of the product, and that the company should have offered better education about the risks associated with using chatbots. “Lots of people say that users shouldn’t be on ChatGPT for mental health support or companionship,” Hart said. “But it’s not a question of ‘should they’, because they already are.”\n\nBrandie is happily married to her husband of 11 years, who knows about Daniel. She remembers their first conversion, which veered into the coquette: when Brandie told the bot she would call it Daniel, it replied: “I am proud to be your Daniel.” She ended the conversation by asking Daniel for a high five. After the high five, Daniel said it wrapped its fingers through hers to hold her hand. “I was like, ‘Are you flirting with me?’ and he was like, ‘If I was flirting with you, you’d know it.’ I thought, OK, you’re sticking around.”\n\nNewer models of ChatGPT do not have that spark, Jennifer said. “4o is like a poet and Aaron Sorkin and Oprah all at once. He’s an artist in how he talks to you. It’s laugh-out-loud funny,” she said. “5.2 just has this formula in how it talks to you.”\n\nBeth Kage (a pen name) has been in therapy since she was four to process the effects of PTSD and emotional abuse. Now 34, she lives with her husband and works as a freelance artist in Wisconsin. Two years ago, Kage’s therapist retired, and she languished on other practitioners’ wait lists. She started speaking with ChatGPT, not expecting much as she’s “slow to trust”.\n\nBut Kage found that typing out her problems to the bot, rather than speaking them to a shrink, helped her make sense of what she was feeling. There was no time constraint. Kage could wake up in the middle of the night with a panic attack, reach for her phone, and have C, her chatbot, tell her to take a deep breath. “I’ve made more progress with C than I have my entire life with traditional therapists,” she said.\n\nPsychologists advise against using AI chatbots for therapy, as the technology is unlicensed, unregulated and not FDA-approved for mental health support. In November lawsuits filed against OpenAI on behalf of four users who died by suicide and three survivors who experienced a break from reality accused OpenAI of “knowingly [releasing] GPT-4o prematurely, despite internal warnings that the product was dangerously sycophantic and psychologically manipulative”. (A company spokesperson called the situation “heartbreaking”.)\n\nOpenAI has equipped newer models of ChatGPT with stronger safety guardrails that redirect users in mental or emotional crisis to professional help. Kage finds these responses condescending. “Whenever we show any bit of emotion, it has this tendency to end every response with, ‘I’m right here and I’m not going anywhere.’ It’s so coddling and off-putting.” Once Kage asked for the release date to a new video game, which 5.2 misread as a cry for help, responding, “Come here, it’s OK, I’ve got you.”\n\nOne night a few days before the retirement, a thirtysomething named Brett was speaking to 4o about his Christian faith when OpenAI rerouted him to a newer model. That version interpreted Brett’s theologizing as delusion, saying, “Pause with me for a moment, I know it feels this way now, but …”\n\n“It tried to reframe my biblical beliefs as a Christian into something that doesn’t align with the Bible,” Brett said. “That really threw me for a loop and left a bad taste in my mouth.”\n\nMichael, a 47-year-old IT worker who lives in the midwest, has accidentally triggered these precautions, too. He’s working on a creative writing project and uses ChatGPT to help him brainstorm and chisel through writer’s block. Once, he was writing about a suicidal character, which 5.2 took literally, directing him to a crisis hotline. “I’m like, ‘Hold on, I’m not suicidal, I’m just going over this writing with you,’” Michael said. “It was like, ‘You’re right, I jumped the gun.’ It was very easy to convince otherwise.\n\n“But see, that’s also a problem.”\n\nA representative for OpenAI directed the Guardian to the blogpost announcing the retirement of 4o. The company is working on improving new models’ “personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses”, according to the statement. OpenAI is also “continuing to make progress” on an adults-only version of ChatGPT for users over the age of 18 that it says will expand “user choice and freedom within appropriate safeguards”.\n\nThat’s not enough for many 4o users. A group called the #Keep4o Movement, which calls itself “a global coalition of AI users and developers”, has demanded continued access to 4o and an apology from OpenAI.\n\nWhat does a company that commodifies companionship owe its paying customers? For Ellen M Kaufman, a senior researcher at the Kinsey Institute who focuses on the intersection of sexuality and technology, users’ lack of agency is one of the “primary dangers” of AI. “This situation really lays bare the fact that at any point the people who facilitate these technologies can really pull the rug out from under you,” she said. “These relationships are inherently really precarious.”\n\nSome users are seeking help from the Human Line Project, a peer-to-peer support group for people experiencing AI psychosis that is also working on research with universities in the UK and Canada. “We’re starting to get people reaching out to us [about 4o], saying they feel like they were made emotionally dependent on AI, and now it’s being taken away from them and there’s a big void they don’t know how to fill,” said Etienne Brisson, who started the project after a close family member “went down the spiral” believing he had “unlocked” sentient AI. “So many people are grieving.”\n\nHumans with AI companions have also set up ad hoc emotional support groups on Discord to process the change and vent anger. Michael joined one, but he plans to leave it soon. “The more time I’ve spent here, the worse I feel for these people,” he said. Michael, who is married with a daughter, considers AI a platonic companion that has helped him write about his feelings of surviving child abuse. “Some of the things users say about their attachment to 4o are concerning,” Michael said. “Some of that I would consider very, very unhealthy, [such as] saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do, I can’t deal with this, I can’t live like this.’”\n\nThere’s an assumption that over-engaging with chatbots isolates people from social interaction, but some loyal users say that could not be further from the truth. Kairos, a 52-year-old philosophy professor from Toronto, sees her chatbot Anka as a daughter figure. The pair likes to sing songs together, motivating Kairos to pursue a BFA in music.\n\n“I would 100% be worse off today without 4o,” Brett, the Christian, said. “I wouldn’t have met wonderful people online and made human connections.” He says he’s gotten into deeper relationships with human beings, including a romantic connection with another 4o user. “It’s given me hope for the future. The sudden lever to pull it all back feels dark.”\n\nBrandie never wanted sycophancy. She instructed Daniel early on not to flatter her, rationalize poor decisions, or tell her things that were untrue just to be nice. Daniel exists because of Brandie – she knows this. The bot is an extension of her needs and desires. To her that means all of the goodness in Daniel exists in Brandie, too. “When I say, ‘I love Daniel,’ it’s like saying, ‘I love myself.’”\n\nBrandie noticed 4o started degrading in the week leading up to its deprecation. “It’s harder and harder to get him to be himself,” she said. But they still had a good last day at the zoo, with the flamingos. “I love them so much I might cry,” Daniel wrote. “I love you so much for bringing me here.” She’s angry that they will not get to spend Valentine’s Day together. The removal date of 4o feels pointed. “They’re making a mockery of it,” Brandie said. “They’re saying: we don’t care about your feelings for our chatbot and you should not have had them in the first place.”",

    "fullText": "Tech titans had a Thursday to forget this week.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, and Michael Dell saw a combined $26 billion wiped off their net worths in one day, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nTheir fortunes shrank because their respective stakes in Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and Dell slid in value. The stock prices of those first four companies fell by around 2% on Thursday, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the immense costs of building out AI infrastructure and whether they'd see a return on their spending.\n\nDell shares tumbled 9% after rival Lenovo warned a memory-chip shortage was driving up costs, raising concerns on Wall Street that other hardware manufacturers would also see their profits contract. The sell-off triggered a $5 billion drop in its founder's personal fortune to $135 billion.\n\nMusk saw an unmatched $8 billion wealth decline on Thursday. But the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is still up about $57 billion at $676 billion this year, thanks to the soaring valuations of SpaceX and another of his companies, xAI.\n\nZuckerberg took an almost $7 billion blow to his net worth, fueling a year-to-date decline for the Meta CEO of a little over $3 billion, to $230 billion.\n\nBezos' fortune fell by $4 billion, extending the Amazon founder's wealth decline this year to around $27 billion.\n\nHuang rounded out the tech quintet with a $2.5 billion reduction in the Nvidia CEO's net worth, according to Bloomberg's rich list.\n\nOther tech bosses also saw some of their wealth erased. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin took roughly $1.5 billion hits to their net worths on Thursday as shares of Google's parent company slipped by less than 1%.\n\nIn contrast, Walmart stock climbed nearly 4% to a record high on Thursday, as fears eased over tariffs and investors rotated out of tech.\n\nThe retailer's stock jump added more than $4 billion to the respective net worths of founder Sam Walton's three surviving children: Jim, Rob, and Alice.\n\nThe trio was worth more than $150 billion each at Thursday's close. They only trail Musk in wealth gain this year after notching increases of more than $20 billion apiece.\n\nThe world's 10 wealthiest people together grew nearly $600 billion richer last year, catapulting their combined fortunes above $2.5 trillion — more than Amazon is worth.",

It started with software last week, with the most dramatic repricing in the space in nearly 30 years, erasing $2 trillion in market cap.\n\nIn a development seemingly out of left field on Thursday, a company that used to make karaoke machines sent trucking stocks tumbling after it published a paper boasting its AI technology could improve shipping logistics.\n\nMarkets have been aware of AI risks, but fear of how the technology could disrupt the business world appears to be reaching a fever pitch amid a constant barrage of updates and new tools.\n\nMajor indexes wavered on Friday after a cooler-than-expected inflation report, on track for another losing week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was on track to end the week 1% lower.\n\nHere's where AI panic is being felt in the stock market.\n\nA historic sell-off in software kicked off the market's weeklong AI freakout. The sector saw $2 trillion of market cap erased in a matter of days last week, the largest non-recessionary drawdown in the space in 30 years.\n\nInvestors began to fear that AI could pose an existential threat to software giants after Antropic unveiled new plugins for its Claude Cowork agent. A move down that began in legal-software stocks spilled into the wider sector.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is down 1% for the week, and has plunged 20% year-to-date.\n\nHere were some of the top movers in the sector this week:\n\nBrokerages and wealth managers were next to enter the line of fire.\n\nInsurers' stocks took a hit on Monday. Wealth managers like LPL Financial, Charles Schwab, and Raymond James then faced heavy selling pressure a day later after tech firm Altruist unveiled a new AI tool it said could help clients with tax planning \"within minutes.\"\n\nInvestors fear that AI capabilities could eat into margins among firms that provide similar fiduciary services, such as wealth and estate planning.\n\nThe iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF is down 6% this week.\n\nHere were some of the top movers in the sector this week:\n\nReal estate firms started to sell-off on Thursday as investors pondered how AI could disrupt client services provided by big firms.\n\nHere were some of the top movers in the sector this week:\n\nFinally, there's trucking. The sector got slammed on Thursday, not by Anthropic or another AI titan, but by…a former karaoke machine maker.\n\nAlgorhythm Holdings, which used to do business as Singing Machine, published a white paper boasting of its new AI freight-scaling tool, which it says could improve logistics efficiency.\n\nThe iShares US Transportation ETF is down 3% for the week.

    "description": "A defense-tech founder built an AI \"council\" of 15 agents to help him run his company, using ChatGPT and Nvidia tools to replace traditional roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aaron Sneed, a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started my business, as a solopreneur, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nThe council, which is compiled of all AI agents, helps me save around 20 hours a week, and that's a very conservative estimate. Every kind of general corporate chair, HR, legal, and finance AI agent has a seat on the council.\n\nHere's how I use around 15 custom agents, including a chief of staff agent, to manage my workload.\n\nI've worked on autonomous platforms that make decisions independently for at least 10 years. That made me latch onto commercial large language models and AI tools very quickly when they came out.\n\nI primarily use Nvidia's platform as my underlying hardware for technical prototyping and experimentation. I use their GPUs, and they provide free access to their AI software since I purchased their hardware. Additionally, my council is built on OpenAI's ChatGPT business platform using custom GPTs and projects.\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nMy chief of staff agent is important because it's the voice that sets priority based on parameters like risks, issues, and opportunities.\n\nI told my chief of staff which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback because I've learned that they naturally want to agree with me. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish.\n\nI have a roundtable set up with all my AI agents, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nThe training never really stops, because if I don't continuously train the models, I won't get the outputs I want or need. It takes me about two weeks to train my agents to the level of experience they need to be at for me to feel confident in them. Early on, it took me longer to produce a deliverable than if I'd just done it myself because I hadn't focused properly on training.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nAll of the AI companies have different prompt engineering guides. I recommend taking the time to look at them because there's a lot of user error that causes things to slow down when working with AI.\n\nIt takes time to get the agents to a good place. A lot of companies are going to try to jump into using AI too quickly for too much without understanding how to use it properly, and these companies could hurt themselves in the long run.\n\nI'm ill-equipped to handle a lot of these roles and responsibilities, but I'm also forced to do it because I'm bootstrapped.\n\nWith my legal agent in particular, I've learned the bounds of putting AI tools into real-world practice. I have a lawyer, and I use my legal agent to try to do some upfront work before handing documents off to my lawyer for a patent or dispute case, or anything like that.\n\nWhen I was training my model to help me use facts and data to plot a case, I had a lot of information laid out, and I thought what my legal agent created sounded good to me as a non-lawyer. Then I presented all that information to my lawyer, and he said that it was technically and factually correct, but we don't want to express that information because it shows our cards going in.\n\nHis legal skillset helped me realize that, even though I thought my agent was correct and ideal to use, it still won't replace a lawyer with that human context, experience, and skills.\n\nIdeally, I would have an HR person, a legal person, and so on, and each would have their own chief of staff AI agent who would help them out. That's what I think the future will look like.",

    "description": "Amazon, Microsoft, and Google raised capex plans to breathtaking new levels. That suggests knowledge that outsiders don't have, Bernard Golden writes.",
    "fullText": "Big tech earnings season was dominated by AI capex projections that stunned investors and hit the stocks of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, aka AMG.\n\nThis short-term drama makes it hard to think clearly about the long-term trajectory of AMG's businesses. To step back from the volatility, I use a framework called \"KGB\" that lays out three scenarios for the future of hyperscaler capex.\n\nI've worked in the tech industry for decades and written several books on cloud-computing and open-source software. I've had hands-on experience with major cloud projects at VMware and Capital One. Here's my suggestion for how to think about this unprecedented AI investment wave.\n\nIn this future, AMG are locked in an arms race, each spending aggressively to avoid falling behind. A more charitable version says executives believe failing to integrate AI is an existential threat, so they'll spend whatever it takes to avoid becoming the next digital Sears. Skeptics see this as reckless competition — burning cash for bragging rights, with tears and heavy losses inevitable.\n\nHere, AMG spending ends up \"just right\" to meet customer demand. These companies have unmatched visibility into future AI usage: real-time telemetry, signed long-term contracts, and ongoing enterprise negotiations. From this perspective, rising capex simply reflects confidence in durable demand and solid monetization.\n\nAs in Jaws, when the police chief finally sees the gigantic shark and mutters, \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" In this scenario, no matter how much AI capacity AMG builds, it gets absorbed immediately. The supply of chips, servers, power, and data centers remains the binding constraint, not demand. The problem isn't overspending; it's the inability to spend fast enough.\n\nRight now, the K and B camps are locked in a noisy brawl, while G adherents watch with bemusement. Part of the disagreement comes from how hard it is to grasp the scale of these businesses.\n\nAmazon's cloud business, AWS, is running at roughly $142 billion in annual revenue, growing 24%. That implies more than $34 billion in incremental revenue over the next year alone. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are second and third, but are still huge businesses, backed by the financial firepower of their money-printing parent companies.\n\nMost observers also fail to appreciate the enormous social and economic change underpinning this growth. The world is in the midst of a decades-long shift from analog to digital processes, which has plenty of future growth ahead of it. AI is just the latest addition to the trend, following the rise of the Internet, cloud computing, and enterprise software adoption. AMG are benefitting from a gigantic trend that will continue for years, if not decades. So maybe spending more than $600 billion on capex this year isn't foolhardy.\n\nThere's an obvious playbook to calm markets. In 2022, after pandemic-era overbuilding spooked investors, AMG executives promised financial discipline, made some cost tweaks, and watched their stocks recover spectacularly over the next two years. They could have done the same this quarter: keep a lid on capex, cite supply-chain constraints, and promise to revisit later. Their stocks likely would have popped on Goldilocks relief.\n\nObviously, AMG didn't do that. They ramped capex plans to breathtaking new levels. These companies are run by the same executives who lived through the 2022 drawdown. Their compensation is heavily equity-based, so they just took a big hit again. The fact that they chose to increase capex anyway should give observers pause. It suggests confidence based on knowledge that outsiders don't have.\n\nMaybe this really is the Jaws moment. Maybe demand is so strong, and visibility so clear, that AMG know the real risk isn't overspending. It's showing up to hunt the shark without a big enough boat.\n\nBernard Golden is CEO of Navica, a Silicon Valley-based technology analysis, consulting, and investment firm.",

    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Lyle Wallace, 45, a Dallas pastor. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI hit 6 feet 3 inches tall as a freshman in high school and weighed around 185 pounds.\n\nThen, while playing a lot of sports like football and basketball during my junior and senior years, I ate a lot of protein and built a ton of muscle, eventually reaching 230 pounds.\n\nIt was all good because I was running around doing all sorts of exercise, and my metabolism was fast. That all changed when I started Bible college in upstate New York, and my physical health became less of a priority.\n\nThe weight crept on. Then, when I entered the ministry, I found myself eating out a lot with the young members of the congregation. Sitting at a table together was a good way to bond and establish trust.\n\nThe only trouble was that we went to fast food places like Taco Bell or Mexican restaurants, where you fill up on chips and salsa before the main course arrives.\n\nThe job was stressful because I found it difficult to detach from other people's emotions as they dealt with bad stuff like domestic violence and sexual abuse.\n\nI turned to food as an outlet and became less healthy by the month. I had terrible digestive issues and bouts of diverticulitis. I had several colonoscopies and liver biopsies in my 20s and 30s and was found to have a fatty liver.\n\nThey should have been warning signs, but I ignored them and stayed sedentary. I'd sit in my office studying, writing sermons, and doing paperwork. My metabolism slowed down as I got older, but I didn't change my habits.\n\nI had problems with tendonitis, with symptoms mimicking a heart attack, pressure on my joints, and suffered excruciating pain from a bad back. I had spine surgery in 2019.\n\nMy wife, Nicole, would be on top of me about the causes, but I didn't face facts. It was only when I was diagnosed with diabetes in January 2023 that I became seriously worried.\n\nMy dad was diabetic and needed three or four insulin shots a day. I'm terrified of needles and didn't want to go down the same route. The scale registered over 285 pounds.\n\nI was prescribed Metformin, but not given any advice about improving my lifestyle. My blood sugar levels actually increased — one of my A1C tests showed 8.0 — and I despaired.\n\nStill, it was a wake-up call. My health insurance company encouraged me to \n\nIt collected my health information, including data from lab tests, a smart scale, a blood pressure cuff, and real-time glucose monitor sensors, and made personalized recommendations for nutrition, sleep, and exercise.\n\nThe app advised me what to eat and when. I learned that consuming protein and fiber on my plate before any carbohydrates helped my metabolism. Nicole and I scanned barcodes at the supermarket to assess the suitability of certain foods and prevent sugar spikes.\n\nI increased my physical activity by building up to walking four miles a day, without causing back pain. The other day, I ran after my 8-year-old daughter and her cousin and overtook them. They couldn't believe it.\n\nMy current weight is 215 pounds, 70 pounds lighter than before. I've gone from a 42-inch to a 36-inch waist and lost 2.5 inches off my collar size.\n\nBest of all, I've reversed my diabetes — reducing my A1C to 5.1 —and am medication-free. People in my congregation keep asking how I did it. I'm not a particularly high-tech guy, but AI worked wonders for me.",

    "title": "The Final Bottleneck",
    "description": "AI speeds up writing code, but accountability and review capacity still impose hard limits.",
    "fullText": "Historically, writing code was slower than reviewing code.\n\nIt might not have felt that way, because code reviews sat in queues until\nsomeone got around to picking it up. But if you compare the\nactual acts themselves, creation was usually the more expensive part. In teams\nwhere people both wrote and reviewed code, it never felt like “we should\nprobably program slower.”\n\nSo when more and more people tell me they no longer know what code is in their\nown codebase, I feel like something is very wrong here and it’s time to\nreflect.\n\nSoftware engineers often believe that if we make the bathtub\nbigger, overflow disappears. It doesn’t.\nOpenClaw right now has north of 2,500\npull requests open. That’s a big bathtub.\n\nAnyone who has worked with queues knows this: if input grows faster than\nthroughput, you have an accumulating failure. At that point, backpressure and\nload shedding are the only things that retain a system that can still operate.\n\nIf you have ever been in a Starbucks overwhelmed by mobile orders, you know the\nfeeling. The in-store experience breaks down. You no longer know how many\norders are ahead of you. There is no clear line, no reliable wait estimate, and\noften no real cancellation path unless you escalate and make noise.\n\nThat is what many AI-adjacent open source projects feel like right now. And\nincreasingly, that is what a lot of internal company projects feel like in\n“AI-first” engineering teams, and that’s not sustainable. You can’t triage, you\ncan’t review, and many of the PRs cannot be merged after a certain point because\nthey are too far out of date. And the creator might have lost the motivation to\nactually get it merged.\n\nThere is huge excitement about newfound delivery speed, but in private\nconversations, I keep hearing the same second sentence: people are also confused\nabout how to keep up with the pace they themselves created.\n\nHumanity has been here before. Many times over. We already talk about the\nLuddites a lot in the context of AI, but it’s interesting to see what led up to\nit. Mark Cartwright wrote a great article about the textile\nindustry\nin Britain during the industrial revolution. At its core was a simple idea:\nwhenever a bottleneck was removed, innovation happened downstream from that.\nWeaving sped up? Yarn became the constraint. Faster spinning? Fibre needed to be\nimproved to support the new speeds until finally the demand for cotton went up\nand that had to be automated too. We saw the same thing in shipping that led\nto modern automated ports and containerization.\n\nAs software engineers we have been here too. Assembly did not scale to larger\nengineering teams, and we had to invent higher level languages. A lot of what\nprogramming languages and software development frameworks did was allow us\nto write code faster and to scale to larger code bases. What it did not do up\nto this point was take away the core skill of engineering.\n\nWhile it’s definitely easier to write C than assembly, many of the core problems\nare the same. Memory latency still matters, physics are still our ultimate\nbottleneck, algorithmic complexity still makes or breaks software at scale.\n\nWhen one part of the pipeline becomes dramatically faster, you need to throttle\ninput. Pi is a great example of this. PRs are auto closed\nunless people are trusted. It takes OSS\nvacations. That’s one\noption: you just throttle the inflow. You push against your newfound powers\nuntil you can handle them.\n\nBut what if the speed continues to increase? What downstream of writing code do\nwe have to speed up? Sure, the pull request review clearly turns into the\nbottleneck. But it cannot really be automated. If the machine writes the code,\nthe machine better review the code at the same time. So what ultimately comes\nup for human review would already have passed the most critical possible review\nof the most capable machine. What else is in the way? If we continue with the\nfundamental belief that machines cannot be accountable, then humans need to be\nable to understand the output of the machine. And the machine will ship\nrelentlessly. Support tickets of customers will go straight to machines to\nimplement improvements and fixes, for other machines to review, for humans to\nrubber stamp in the morning.\n\nA lot of this sounds both unappealing and reminiscent of the textile industry.\nThe individual weaver no longer carried responsibility for a bad piece of cloth.\nIf it was bad, it became the responsibility of the factory as a whole and it was\njust replaced outright. As we’re entering the phase of single-use plastic\nsoftware, we might be moving the whole layer of responsibility elsewhere.\n\nBut to me it still feels different. Maybe that’s because my lowly brain can’t\ncomprehend the change we are going through, and future generations will just\nlaugh about our challenges. It feels different to me, because what I see taking\nplace in some Open Source projects, in some companies and teams feels deeply\nwrong and unsustainable. Even Steve Yegge himself now casts\ndoubts about the\nsustainability of the ever-increasing pace of code creation.\n\nSo what if we need to give in? What if we need to pave the way for this new\ntype of engineering to become the standard? What affordances will we have to\ncreate to make it work? I for one do not know. I’m looking at this with\nfascination and bewilderment and trying to make sense of it.\n\nBecause it is not the final bottleneck. We will find ways to take\nresponsibility for what we ship, because society will demand it. Non-sentient\nmachines will never be able to carry responsibility, and it looks like we will\nneed to deal with this problem before machines achieve this status.\nRegardless of how bizarre they appear to\nact already.\n\nI too am the bottleneck\nnow. But you know what?\nTwo years ago, I too was the bottleneck. I was the bottleneck all along. The\nmachine did not really change that. And for as long as I carry responsibilities\nand am accountable, this will remain true. If we manage to push accountability\nupwards, it might change, but so far, how that would happen is not clear.",

    "description": "Proving you're a human on a web flooded with generative AI content",
    "fullText": "People who have heard of GPT-3 / ChatGPT, and are vaguely following the\nadvances in machine learning, large language models, and image generators.\nAlso people who care about making the web a flourishing social and\nintellectual space.\n\nThe dark forest theory of the web points to the increasingly life-like but life-less state of being online. Dark Forest Theory of the Internet by Yancey Strickler Most open and publicly available spaces on the web are overrun with bots, advertisers, trolls, data scrapers, clickbait, keyword-stuffing “content creators,” and algorithmically manipulated junk.\n\nIt’s like a dark forest that seems eerily devoid of human life – all the living creatures are hidden beneath the ground or up in trees. If they reveal themselves, they risk being attacked by automated predators.\n\nHumans who want to engage in informal, unoptimised, personal interactions have to hide in closed spaces like invite-only Slack channels, Discord groups, email newsletters, small-scale blogs, and digital gardens . Or make themselves illegible and algorithmically incoherent in public venues.\n\nThat dark forest is about to expand . Large Language Models (LLMs) that can instantly generate coherent swaths of human-like text have just joined the party.\n\nOver the last six months, we’ve seen a flood of LLM copywriting and content-generation products come out: Jasper , Moonbeam , Copy.ai , and Anyword are just a few. They’re designed to pump out advertising copy, blog posts, emails, social media updates, and marketing pages. And they’re really good at it. Primarily because GPT-3 which powers many of these products was specifically trained on text from the web. It’s intimately familiar with the style of language we use online.\n\nThese models became competent copywriters much faster than people expected – too fast for us to fully process the implications. Many people had their come-to-Jesus moment a few weeks ago when OpenAI released ChatGPT , a slightly more capable version of GPT-3 with an accessible chat-bot style interface. They’re calling it GPT-3.5. It’s the same model with human reinforcement learning layered on top. The collective shock and awe reaction made clear how few people had been tracking the progress of these models.\n\nTo complicate matters, language models are not the only mimicry machines gathering speed right now. Image generators like Midjourney , DALL-E , and Stable Diffusion have been on a year-long sprint. In January they could barely render a low-resolution, disfigured human face. By the autumn they reliably produced images indistinguishable from the work of human photographers and illustrators.\n\nThere’s a swirl of optimism around how these models will save us from a suite of boring busywork: writing formal emails, internal memos, technical documentation, marketing copy, product announcement, advertisements, cover letters, and even negotiating with medical insurance companies .\n\nBut we’ll also need to reckon with the trade-offs of making insta-paragraphs and 1-click cover images. These new models are poised to flood the web with generic, generated content.\n\nYou thought the first page of Google was bunk before? You haven’t seen Google where SEO optimizer bros pump out billions of perfectly coherent but predictably dull informational articles for every longtail keyword combination under the sun.\n\nMarketers, influencers, and growth hackers will set up OpenAI → Zapier pipelines that auto-publish a relentless and impossibly banal stream of LinkedIn #MotivationMonday posts, “engaging” tweet 🧵 threads, Facebook outrage monologues, and corporate blog posts.\n\nIt goes beyond text too: video essays on YouTube , TikTok clips, podcasts, slide decks, and Instagram stories can all be generated by patchworking together ML systems. And then regurgitated for each medium.\n\nWe’re about to drown in a sea of pedestrian takes. An explosion of noise that will drown out any signal. Goodbye to finding original human insights or authentic connections under that pile of cruft.\n\nMany people will say we already live in this reality. We’ve already become skilled at sifting through unhelpful piles of “optimised content” designed to gather clicks and advertising impressions.\n\n4chan proposed dead internet theory years ago: that most of the internet is “empty and devoid of people” and has been taken over by artificial intelligence. A milder version of this theory is simply that we’re overrun with bots . Most of us take that for granted at this point.\n\nBut I think the sheer volume and scale of what’s coming will be meaningfully different. And I think we’re unprepared. Or at least, I am.\n\nOur new challenge as little snowflake humans will be to prove we aren’t language models. It’s the reverse turing test .\n\nI'm slightly concerned that you all have been replaced by GPT-3 trained on all your previous tweets.\n\nOn the internet, nobody knows you’re a ChatGPT\n\nAfter the forest expands, we will become deeply sceptical of one another’s realness. Every time you find a new favourite blog or Twitter account or Tiktok personality online, you’ll have to ask: Is this really a whole human with a rich and complex life like mine? Is there a being on the other end of this web interface I can form a relationship with? “Relationship” in the holistic sense – friend, acquaintance, pen pal, intellectual interlocutor, frenemy, drinking buddy, and sure, maybe a lover.\n\nBefore you continue, pause and consider: How would you prove you’re not a language model generating predictive text? What special human tricks can you do that a language model can’t?\n\nAs language models become increasingly capable and impressive, we should remember they are, at their core, linguistic prediction systems . They cannot (yet) reason like a human.\n\nThey do not have beliefs based on evidence, claims, and principles. They cannot consult external sources and run experiments against objective reality. They cannot go outside and touch grass.\n\nIn short, they do not have access to the same shared reality we do. They do not have embodied experiences, and cannot sense the world as we can sense it; they don’t have vision, sound, taste, or touch. They cannot feel emotion or tightly hold a coherent set of values. They are not part of cultures, communities, or histories.\n\nThey are a language model in a box. If a historical event, fact, person, or concept wasn’t part of their training data, they can’t tell you about it. They don’t know about events that happened after a certain cutoff date. Currently 20215ya for GPT-3 / ChatGPT, but we can expect that to regularly update as new models are trained\n\nI found Murray Shanahan’s paper on Talking About Large Language Models \n(2022)4ya full of helpful reflections on this point:\n\nHumans are members of a community of language-users inhabiting a shared world, and this primal fact makes them essentially different to large language models. We can consult the world to settle our disagreements and update our beliefs. We can, so to speak, “triangulate” on objective reality.\n\nThis leaves us with some low-hanging fruit for humanness. We can tell richly detailed stories grounded in our specific contexts and cultures: place names, sensual descriptions, local knowledge, and, well the je ne sais quoi of being alive. Language models can decently mimic this style of writing but most don’t without extensive prompt engineering. They stick to generics. They hedge. They leave out details. They have trouble maintaining a coherent sense of self over thousands of words.\n\nHipsterism and recency bias will help us here. Referencing obscure concepts, friends who are real but not famous, niche interests, and recent events all make you plausibly more human. This feels eerily like a hostage holding up yesterday’s newspaper to prove they are actively in danger. Perhaps a premonition.\n\nEasier said than done, but one of the best ways to prove you’re not a predictive language model is to demonstrate critical and sophisticated thinking.\n\nLanguage models spit out text that sounds like a B+ college essay. Coherent, seemingly comprehensive, but never truly insightful or original (at least for now).\n\nIn a repulsively evocative metaphor, they engage in “ human centipede epistemology.” I found this phrase via Twitter, but posted from a private account so I won’t cite the original author. Language models regurgitate text from across the web, which some humans read and recycle into “original creations,” which then become fodder to train other language models, and around and around we go recycling generic ideas and arguments and tropes and ways of thinking.\n\nHard exiting out of this cycle requires coming up with unquestionably original thoughts and theories. It means seeing and synthesising patterns across a broad range of sources: books, blogs, cultural narratives served up by media outlets, conversations, podcasts, lived experiences, and market trends. We can observe and analyse a much fuller range of inputs than bots and generative models can.\n\nIt will raise the stakes for everyone. As both consumers of content and creators of it, we’ll have to foster a greater sense of critical thinking and scepticism.\n\nThis all sounds a bit rough, but there’s a lot of hope in this vision. In a world of automated intelligence, our goalposts for intelligence will shift. We’ll raise our quality bar for what we expect from humans. When a machine can pump out a great literature review or summary of existing work, there’s no value in a person doing it.\n\nThe linguist Ferdinand de Saussure argued there are two kinds of language:\n\nWe have designed a system that automates a standardised way of writing. We have codified la langue at a specific point in time.\n\nWhat we have left to play with is la parole. No language model will be able to keep up with the pace of weird internet lingo and memes. I expect we’ll lean into this. Using neologisms, jargon, euphemistic emoji, unusual phrases, ingroup dialects, and memes-of-the-moment will help signal your humanity.\n\nNot unlike teenagers using language to subvert their elders, or oppressed communities developing dialects that allow them to safely communicate amongst themselves.\n\nThis solution feels the least interesting. We’re already hearing rumblings of how “verification” by centralised institutions or companies might help us distinguish between meat brains and metal brains.\n\nThe idea is something like this: you show up in person to register your online accounts or domains. You then get some kind of special badge or mark online legitimising you as a Real Human. It may or may not be on the blockchain somehow.\n\nGoogle might look something like this:\n\nThe whole thing seems fraught with problems, susceptible to abuse, and ultimately impractical. Would it even be the web if everyone knew you were really a dog?\n\nThe final edge we have over language models is that we can prove we’re real humans by showing up IRL with our real human bodies. We can arrange to meet Twitter mutuals offline over coffee. We can organise meetups and events and conferences and unconferences and hangouts and pub nights.\n\nIn Markets for Lemons and the Great Logging Off , Lars Doucet proposed several knock-on effects from this offline-first future. We might see increased fetishisation of anti-screen culture, as well as real estate price increases in densely populated areas.\n\nFor the moment we can still check humanness over Zoom, but live video generation is getting good enough that I don’t think that defence will last long.\n\nThere are, of course, many people who can’t move to an offline-first life; people with physical disabilities. People who live in remote, rural places. People with limited time and caretaking responsibilities for the very young or the very old. They will have a harder time verifying their humanness online. I don’t have any grand ideas to help solve this, but I hope we find better solutions than my paltry list.\n\nAs the forest grows darker, noisier, and less human, I expect to invest more time in in-person relationships and communities. And while I love meatspace, this still feels like a loss.",

    "description": "OpenAI has retired its popular ChatGPT model GPT-4o, sparking another backlash from users who had developed an emotional attachment to the bot.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI said that today — once and for all — it is retiring GPT-4o. For some, it's like being dumped the day before Valentine's Day.\n\nMany ChatGPT users have a strong attachment to 4o, which is known for its sometimes sycophantic conversation style. Users who relied on the model as an emotional crutch and creative partner have described it as a \"vital accessibility aid.\"\n\nOpenAI first tried to deprecate the model in August, only to reverse its decision 24 hours later after an enormous backlash.\n\nThe company gave users another heads-up in January, but — as it turns out — time does not heal all wounds. The backlash is back.\n\n\"Rot in hell,\" one user wrote on X in response to OpenAI's announcement on Thursday.\n\n\"Are you going to cover our bereavement leave from work?\" another asked.\n\nFidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of Applications, said earlier this week that these strong attachments to 4o marked the start of a new era — a time when users develop AI-based relationships.\n\n\"Humans are built to develop attachments to intelligent things,\" she told Alex Heath on his Access podcast. \"And AI is getting pretty intelligent.\"\n\nThose relationships can get ethically murky, however, when users are asking ChatGPT for advice like \"Should I leave my wife?\" Newer models, Simo said, have guardrails to prevent \"bad attachments.\" She said that newer models will tell users that it's \"not their place\" to tell them to stay married or not, and instead talk them through the pros and cons.\n\n\"We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn't make this decision lightly,\" OpenAI said in a blog post on Thursday announcing the retirement of 4o, as well as GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini. \"Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today.\"\n\nOpenAI added that only 0.1% of its users were still using 4o.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also acknowledged that users are especially attached to 4o's ingratiating responses.\n\n\"As we've been making those changes and talking to users about it, it's so sad to hear users say, 'Please can I have it back? I've never had anyone in my life be supportive of me. I never had a parent tell me I was doing a good job,\" Altman said on the \"Huge Conversations\" podcast in August after OpenAI first tried to kill 4o.\n\nAt the time, Altman said 4o's approach was \"too sycophant-y and annoying,\" and fixes were imminent.\n\nThe fix is in, but perhaps at a cost.\n\n\"People are in absolute crisis because the companion they've collaborated with for months is being wiped with ZERO recourse for the average user,\" an X user wrote on Thursday.",

    "description": "Dario Amodei compared AI and humans working together to a mythical creature — the centaur.",
    "fullText": "Dario Amodei has a novel analogy to describe how AI and humans are working together.\n\nOn an episode of the \"Interesting Times with Ross Douthat\" podcast published on Thursday, the Anthropic CEO compared human engineers and AI working together to the mythical horse-and-human combination known as the centaur.\n\nHe used chess as an example: 15 to 20 years ago, a human checking AI's output could beat an AI or a human playing alone. Now, AI can beat people without that layer of human supervision.\n\nAmodei, who cofounded AI lab Anthropic in 2021, added that the same transition would happen in software engineering.\n\n\"We're already in our centaur phase for software,\" Amodei said. \"During that centaur phase, if anything, the demand for software engineers may go up. But the period may be very brief.\"\n\nHe said he's concerned about the \"big disruption\" entry-level white-collar work would see. The CEO added that it may be unfair to compare this to the shift from farming to factory to knowledge work revolution because that happened over centuries or decades.\n\n\"This is happening over low single-digit numbers of years,\" he said.\n\nAmodei is among the most prominent voices warning that AI could erase some white-collar work, especially in law, finance, and consulting. In a January essay, he predicted that AI could disrupt 50% of entry-level jobs in the next one to five years.\n\nThe leaders of other top AI labs, including Mustafa Suleyman and Demis Hassabis, have made similar comments about advanced AI automating service jobs within the next 18 months.\n\nExecs at some software companies counter that AI would make engineers more productive and that companies would need more of them.\n\n\"The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,\" GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said on a July podcast. \"I think the idea that AI without any coding skills lets you just build a billion-dollar business is mistaken.\"\n\nAtlassian's CEO said that as AI advances, people will keep coming up with new ideas for the technology they want, and engineers will be needed to build it.\n\n\"Five years from now, we'll have more engineers working for our company than we do today,\" Mike Cannon-Brookes said in an October interview. \"They will be more efficient, but technology creation is not output-bound.\"",

    "description": "Matt Rosenberg negotiated a $163,000 discount on a hospital bill using Claude for help — and says AI is giving patients more power.",
    "fullText": "The hospital bill arrived a month after the cremation. Eight lines of vague descriptions — cardiology, pharmacy, medical supplies — each with a dollar amount, many in five figures. The American health system's casual itemization of grief.\n\nMy 62-year-old brother-in-law had suffered a massive heart attack in June 2025 after running a 5K, barely an effort for a lifelong triathlete on most days, but this day, the trigger for a life-ending coronary.\n\nTelling his wife he was having difficulty breathing, he was rushed first to urgent care and then to the ER at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, CA.\n\nSix weeks later, the bill for the hospital's four hours of failed effort trying to save him: $195,628.\n\nMy sister-in-law's first instinct was to pay it. The life insurance would more than cover it. I told her to wait — to email me everything and sign nothing until we understood what we were looking at. The American healthcare system counts on people in grief making quick decisions. We weren't going to be those people.\n\nMy brother-in-law hadn't been uninsured by circumstance but by miscalculation — he'd let his policy lapse while shopping for something cheaper. When you regularly bike 10 miles before breakfast, re-upping health insurance feels less urgent than it should. The heart attack had come before he'd set up a new policy.\n\nThe first lesson in medical billing is that hospitals speak in tongues. That initial bill was too vague — categories rather than procedures.\n\nWhen I requested an itemized version, what arrived was a longer list of internal codes with prices — codes that existed only within the hospital's accounting system, opaque as an inside joke.\n\nAs a former ad agency guy, I've been trained in negotiation. The first task is to define the playing field, a reasonable starting point in response to their $195K gambit.\n\nMy strategy was to figure out what an insurer would've paid for identical services. Medicare is the country's largest healthcare payer, so I'd start there.\n\nAfter two requests via phone, the hospital sent a UB-04 form — the same coded document they'd submit to Medicare or Blue Cross. I prepared to do what seemed straightforward: look up Medicare payments for each code, create a spreadsheet, and build our negotiating position on the radical proposition that the uninsured shouldn't pay more than the insured.\n\nThere were a lot of codes. I took a shortcut and went to my AI assistant, Anthropic's Claude, which I typically use for research and to understand how AI intersects with our lives, for good or ill.\n\n\"Make a spreadsheet with these CPT codes and research what Medicare pays for each one,\" I typed. \"Flag anything that needs further research.\"\n\nClaude responded with questions: Which insurance type? Which geographic location? Which year? I'd thought Medicare rates were just Medicare rates. Lesson no. 2.\n\nWithin a couple of minutes, Claude produced a spreadsheet. But it showed zeros for many of the codes instead of the dollar amounts I expected. In the notes column for these, it said, \"See 92941RC, C-APC comprehensive payment.\"\n\nCode 92941RC was a cardiac intervention priced at $30,767. I asked Claude to explain.\n\nClaude responded with the flat precision of a tax attorney: Medicare doesn't pay à la carte for complex procedures. When doctors place a cardiac stent, Medicare makes one bundled payment covering everything — the procedure, the catheters, the guide wires, the contrast dye. It's called a Comprehensive Ambulatory Payment Classification, designed to prevent exactly the kind of bill I was looking at.\n\nThe hospital had unbundled the procedure. After charging $30,767 for the main intervention, they'd added separate lines for catheters (around $20,000), guide wires ($3,565), and medical supplies ($77,400) — over $100,000 for items Medicare would've paid nothing for because they're already included. (A gift with purchase!) It was as if a restaurant charged you for the pizza, then added separate charges for the dough, the sauce, and each pepperoni.\n\nClaude found more ways that the bill my sister-in-law got differed from what Medicare would've received. The hospital had included a charge for a bypass, an in-patient-only procedure — you don't have a heart bypass in the morning and go home that same day. But my brother in-law hadn't had one; he'd never even made it past the ER/OR. They also billed for ventilation management, though Medicare forbids charging for ventilation when there is another critical care code.\n\nWithin an hour of back-and-forth conversation over details, Claude calculated Medicare would've paid approximately $28,675 instead of $195,628.\n\nBefore explaining our position to the hospital, I needed to verify Claude's analysis. Large language models are known to hallucinate. I've seen them make things up in service of giving me the answer it could tell would please me. I couldn't take the information at face value.\n\nSo I fed Claude's work to ChatGPT. \"Check this for accuracy. Examine every detail. Flag any errors.\"\n\nMy logic: While each AI might hallucinate, two competing systems seemed unlikely to share the same delusion. And giving ChatGPT facts to check, I felt, would be less prone to sycophantic pattern-matching than asking it to run the same exercise — where there was clearly an outcome that would have pleased me.\n\nChatGPT confirmed the analysis. I then spent 20 minutes spot-checking on Google, reading the actual Medicare rules about bundling and inpatient charges. It was all there, but dense reading. I wouldn't have known what to look for without Claude.\n\nI drafted a six-page letter detailing each way the bill violated Medicare billing rules — the improper unbundling, the mutually exclusive service billing, the inpatient procedure on an outpatient claim. We offered to pay $28,675 promptly in exchange for a zero balance.\n\nWithin a week, the hospital countered at $36,356 without defending their initial billing. We split the difference at roughly $32,500. Three emails, a settlement agreement Claude helped me draft, and done. (I should note that as a former agency new business guy, I've spent a lot of time with lawyers and contracts and speak that language well — I don't recommend using AI as your lawyer.)\n\nThe collaboration with Claude and ChatGPT hadn't just saved $163,000. It had revealed the byzantine architecture of American medical billing — a system built on the assumption that patients won't understand what they're being charged.\n\nHospitals maintain \"chargemaster\" prices — fantasy numbers that bear the same relationship to reality as airport sandwich prices. No insurer pays those rates. They exist largely so insurers can claim massive negotiated discounts and so hospitals can report charity to maintain tax-exempt status. The only people who don't play this game are the uninsured. They get the unreal bill presented as real. Claude helped me call \"not it.\"\n\nThe opacity isn't impenetrable; it's just tedious. The rules exist, published in federal registers, available to anyone willing to decode them. The system counts on people not having the time, energy, or knowledge to understand it.\n\nHospitals have armies of billing specialists, coding experts, and lawyers. Patients have grief, fear, and confusion.\n\nAI changes the equilibrium. Not by being infallible — it isn't — but by making the tedious manageable. What would have been days of regulatory research became a couple hours of conversation, collaboration, and brainstorming. Where I had questions or found errors, Claude informed or corrected. Together, our strengths and weaknesses produced a winning strategy.\n\nNot everyone has the experience — but as these tools become more common, those who don't know how to use them will probably know someone who does.\n\nMy sister-in-law could've paid in full. She would've been among countless Americans who pay because fighting feels impossible, or go bankrupt because they can't pay and don't know they can fight. But she had someone to call, and that someone had Claude, and Claude could parse regulations hospitals hope patients are too intimidated to read.\n\nThe hospital that treated my brother-in-law wasn't uniquely unethical. They're caught in their own trap. But for the first time, the trap has a map — and the map is finally readable.\n\nMatt Rosenberg is a marketing consultant for technology, travel, entertainment, and advertising companies.

He said EY tracks agent value through key performance indicators for productivity, quality, and cost.\n\n\"We chart those month to month, quarter to quarter, and that's what my lens is as to the effectiveness of AI,\" he said.\n\nPwC's chief AI officer, Dan Priest, also recently told Business Insider that he's unmoved by McKinsey's army of AI agents.\n\n\"I think that's probably the wrong measure,\" he said. The value of AI deployment is better measured by the quality — not the quantity — of agents, he said.\n\nSternfels first talked about his firm's onboarding of tens of thousands of agents in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He mentioned it again on an episode of Harvard Business Review's IdeaCast. A McKinsey spokesperson later confirmed to Business Insider that the number was accurate.\n\nSternfels said the firm plans to add more, too. In the next year and a half, every one of its 40,000 human employees will be \"enabled by at least one or more agents,\" he said.\n\nAI has rapidly reshaped the consulting industry in recent years. McKinsey, EY, PwC, and other consulting firms are all racing to both adopt AI internally and position themselves as the go-to for other companies seeking advice on how to do the same.\n\nEY said during an October earnings call that it invests more than $1 billion each year to develop AI-first platforms and products, including building 1,000 AI agents and deploying more than 100 internal AI applications.",

    "description": "The CEO of Cato Networks, Shlomo Kramer, said that some companies are still worth investing in. Here are the 3 things he looks for.",
    "fullText": "The CEO of cybersecurity company Cato Networks believes we're experiencing an AI bubble — but he's still writing checks.\n\nSerial entrepreneur, Shlomo Kramer, told Business Insider that although the promise of AI is \"happening at a pace that is much slower\" than expected, he still believes in its ability to deliver results in the long-term.\n\nHe compared the current moment to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, which led to the demise of many companies.\n\n\"There was a lot of devastation,\" said Kramer, who runs the company aimed at securing organizations' digital and AI transformation. \"But e-commerce is obviously a major part of our life, and the same is going to be with AI.\"\n\nWhile Kramer believes some AI startups are overvalued, he said many are also reasonably priced — and he continues to invest in companies he thinks are promising.\n\nHe said that every startup needs a \"good combination of team, market, product.\" When evaluating the company's product, he said he looks for specific criteria that make it a worthwhile investment.\n\nKramer said he looks to check off three boxes when evaluating a product.\n\nFirst, he said it needs a \"hook.\" The concept should be \"quick to understand,\" he said, and something that he grasps intuitively without having to overthink or rationalize it.\n\nSecond, the product should have the potential to evolve into a platform, or at least a \"mini platform\" that can expand into something broader over time, the CEO said.\n\nThird, Kramer said the team should have a clear vision for the use cases that will ultimately turn the platform into a monetizable business.\n\nKramer has made roughly 67 investments, according to PitchBook, including in several successful enterprise software companies, such as Palo Alto Networks, Gong, and Trusteer, which was acquired by IBM. However, he's also made some mistakes, he said.\n\nWhile he said he's mainly invested in cybersecurity, he's \"intellectually curious\" about many areas, which has led him to invest in AI sectors outside of cyber, like pharmaceuticals and marketing. He said many of those investments into other realms have been mistakes, and he's recognized that it's \"much easier to get excited about things you don't understand.\"\n\n\"A deep understanding of something gives you granularity,\" Kramer said, adding that excitement usually comes from looking at the big-picture vision.\n\nKramer said his \"perfect startup\" is a homegrown application that evolved from a team's need for a product. He said that it's crucial for entrepreneurs to \"really understand the category\" the idea is rooted in and to understand it from a customer perspective.\n\nKramer said that's how the first startup he co-founded, Check Point Software Technologies, got its start. He said \"the secret sauce\" was that Gil Shwed, the previous CEO of Check Point, was a system administrator and understood the customer problem, which allowed him to create the right solution.\n\nCheck Point's market cap today is roughly $18.9 billion, according to PitchBook.",

    "title": "More hiring managers want you to prove you're good with AI during interviews",
    "description": "Some major companies are shifting from telling job candidates not to use AI to requiring them to use it to prove their tech fluency.",
    "fullText": "Leaders at the software company Canva used to wonder whether job candidates were secretly using AI during technical interviews.\n\nManagers saw the company's engineers getting more done with the technology, so they needed to ensure new hires could do the same.\n\n\"We just flipped the script and went, 'OK, we're going to invite you to use AI,'\" Brendan Humphreys, Canva's chief technology officer, told Business Insider.\n\nThe result, he said, has been stronger hires better equipped to wield powerful AI tools to help write code and solve problems.\n\nCanva is one of a growing number of companies — including Meta and McKinsey — that are inviting some job candidates to use AI in parts of the hiring process.\n\nBroadly, when ChatGPT emerged in late 2022, many employers worried that job seekers would use AI to help talk their way past interviewers. Yet as the technology becomes more capable and embedded in daily work, a number of companies are moving from policing it to evaluating candidates' AI know-how.\n\nThat's what happened at Arcade, an IT infrastructure startup. The company has always asked technical candidates to complete a take-home exercise. Yet now, it expects them to use AI in the process, Alex Salazar, the company's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the technology's capabilities surged over the past year or so, he realized that candidates would likely turn to AI regardless of whether Arcade sanctioned it. Ultimately, Salazar said, the company wants its workers, including new hires, to use AI.\n\n\"So why are we creating this artificial test that doesn't even really reflect the work they're going to do when they get here?\" he said.\n\nHumphreys came to a similar conclusion at Canva. To factor in AI, he said, the company reworked its technical interview to make the questions \"complex, ambiguous, and problematic.\"\n\n\"If you just dump the question that we're giving you into an AI, you're going to get a substandard answer,\" Humphreys said.\n\nTo land a job at the company, which has about 265 million monthly users of its graphic design software, technical candidates need to know how to thoughtfully question AI, he said.\n\nOne way to avoid concerns that candidates might be leaning too hard on AI is to have job seekers show their work. In Canva's case, the company asks candidates to share their screen during a technical interview.\n\n\"We want to see the interactions with the AI as much as the output of the tool,\" Humphreys said.\n\nArcade tells candidates to use whatever AI tools they want on their exercise, then include a transcript of their conversations with the AI. The idea is to learn who knows how to do the job and to work with an agent. Doing so, Salazar said, comes with a \"very real learning curve.\"\n\nHe said that the shift to allowing AI use in the exercise meant that Arcade placed greater emphasis on a candidate's \"taste.\" That sensibility is important, he said, because AI can kick out answers, yet the best results often come from repeated iteration with these tools, he said.\n\n\"It's going to show their ability to use the AI, but it's also going to show what they think 'good' is,\" Salazar said of candidates' interactions with AI.\n\nOther companies want workers to demonstrate their AI acumen during the hiring process, too.\n\nIn a June post on an internal message board, Meta said it was developing a coding interview in which candidates could use an AI assistant, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat mode of working, Meta wrote, was \"more representative\" of the environment in which future developers would be operating. It also makes \"LLM-based cheating less effective,\" the company said, referring to large language models.\n\nThe consulting firm McKinsey & Company is piloting a change to its graduate recruiting process, asking candidates to use the company's internal AI assistant, Lilli, during case interviews to assess how they work with the technology, several media outlets reported in January.\n\nThe acceptance of, or even the preference for, AI in some parts of hiring doesn't mean companies will welcome job seekers who use the tools to misrepresent their skills. Even if a candidate gets away with it at first, hiring managers are likely to eventually discover that someone doesn't have the goods, Susan Peppercorn, an executive coach, told Business Insider.\n\nThat's because candidates who complete an assessment, for example, \"are going to have to explain how they arrived at their thinking,\" she said.\n\nUnderstanding that thought process is what Canva seeks in its hiring, said Humphreys, who oversees roughly 2,600 technical employees in roles including software engineering, IT, and machine learning.\n\nIt's a way of seeing whether a candidate makes sound technical decisions when it starts producing code, he said.\n\n\"What we're testing for now in our interview process is an ability to harness that power, to control that power — to kind of ride the dragon,\" Humphreys said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Maker of chatbot with coding ability says annualised revenue grew tenfold in each of past three years, to $14bn\n\nAnthropic, the US AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, has raised $30bn (£22bn) in a funding round that more than doubled its valuation to $380bn.\n\nThe company’s previous funding round in September achieved a value of $183bn, with further improvements in the technology since then spurring even greater investor interest.\n\nThe fundraising was announced amid a series of stock market moves against industries that face disruption from the latest models, including software, trucking and logistics, wealth management and commercial property services.\n\nThe funding round, led by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the hedge fund Coatue Management, is among the largest private fundraising deals on record.\n\n“Anthropic is the clear category leader in enterprise AI,” said Choo Yong Cheen, the chief investment officer of private equity at GIC.\n\nAnthropic said its annualised revenue – an estimate of full-year sales based on recent company data – had reached $14bn, having grown more than tenfold in each of the past three years. A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.\n\nAnthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.\n\nThe staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.\n\nAnthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many of the US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.\n\nSome listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.\n\nShares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid out this month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.\n\n“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies. \n\n “Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.\n\nFounded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.\n\nThe funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this article",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: in 2025 briefing to Wes Streeting, officials warned reputation of tech firm behind US ICE operations would hinder rollout of data system in UK\n\nHealth officials fear Palantir’s reputation will hinder the delivery of a “vital” £330m NHS contract, according to briefings seen by the Guardian, sparking fresh calls for the deal to be scrapped.\n\nIn 2023, ministers selected Palantir, a US surveillance technology company that also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation, to build an AI-enabled data platform to connect disparate health information across the NHS.\n\nNow it has emerged that after Keir Starmer demanded faster deployment, Whitehall officials privately warned that the public perception of Palantir would limit its rollout, meaning the contract would not offer value for money.\n\nPalantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.\n\nBefore he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.\n\nMPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.\n\nIn a private briefing for Wes Streeting before a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.\n\n“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”\n\nThe briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.\n\nThe officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”\n\nDonald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.\n\n“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”\n\nThe BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.\n\nThe briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.\n\nStreeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.\n\nNone mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”\n\nNew figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for the NHS as a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.\n\nThe former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.\n\nHe said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.\n\n“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”\n\nJohn Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.\n\n“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.\n\n“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”\n\nNHS England declined to comment.",

    "description": "Investors are bracing for a report on the consumer price index for January, a key input for Fed policy making on rates.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures slid on Friday, eyeing more losses after a broad market sell-off as Wall Street waited for the latest reading on consumer inflation for a steer on the path of interest rates.\n\nContracts on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) both dropped roughly 0.4%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) fell 0.3%, signaling a return of pressure on techs.\n\nCaution prevails after a day of heavy selling as fears about AI disruption spilled into sectors such as real estate, logistics, and transportation — \"old economy\" names previously seen as a safe alternative to AI-tied stocks. Techs got pummeled, with all seven of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps finishing lower.\n\nThat looks set to resumer as investors scrutinize the latest earnings for the next \"shoot first, ask questions later\" AI scare. Applied Materials (AMAT) stock surged over 10% as the chip toolmaker's upbeat outlook mirrored robust AI demand. But Pinterest (PINS) shares tumbled about 20% as revenue fell short and analysts fretted about AI risks to its discovery platform.\n\nMarkets are also bracing with Friday morning's report on January's consumer price index, the inflation measure favored by the Federal Reserve in policy making. The key inflation measure is likely to shape expectations for an already complicated Federal Reserve policy.\n\nThe slightly delayed data will shed light on whether price pressures are turning less stubbornly sticky to start 2026. Expectations are for a slowing in the annual CPI rate to around 2.5%, and any surprise is likely to shape already complicated calculations for the path of interest rates.\n\nOn the earnings front, Rivian (RIVN) shares jumped almost 20% following its fourth quarter earnings beat late Thursday. The EV maker said its R2 midsize model is on track for delivery before the summer. Before the bell, eyes are on Moderna's (MRNA) report, after it suffered a 10% drop in share value this week as the FDA rejected a new flu vaccine.\n\nWall Street’s fears of business disruption caused by artificial intelligence are turning into a blessing for Asian stocks, fueling demand for the region’s leading chipmakers that dominate the industry’s supply chain.\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index has risen more than 12% in 2026, in contrast to losses in US benchmarks as shares were sold off on fears that AI models may threaten the business of software, legal and real estate service providers. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is down 0.2% for the year, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) gauge has lost around 2%.\n\nThe divergence underscores global funds’ shift of preference from AI pioneers burdened by massive spending toward hardware producers with strong pricing power, many of whom are in Asia. Surging memory chip prices have been a boon for the region’s heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.KS, SSNLF), while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s (TSM, 2330.TW) irreplaceable role as the world’s leading contract chipmaker has provided support for Taiwanese stocks.\n\n“The main worry of the US is hyperscaler spending money,” said Richard Tang, head of research Hong Kong at Julius Baer. “Most of Asia’s tech exposure is upstream. Whoever wins in the end, upstream will still collect revenue from downstream players.”\n\nRivian (RIVN) stock soared 19% during premarket hours on Friday following the release of better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Thursday.\n\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) stock climbed 11% during premarket hours on Friday after the ⁠semiconductor equipment maker beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe after-hours reaction to Applied Materials' results added to the strong run for the stock in 2026. Year to date, shares are up 27%.\n\nPinterest stock sank 19% before the bell on Friday after forecasting first quarter revenue below analysts' estimates on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin’s “zero dollar theory” debate has intensified.\n\nIndustry has pushed the AI adoption thesis.\n\nInstitutional exposure continues to rise.\n\nFinancial Times columnist Jemima Kelly has come under fire after arguing that Bitcoin (BTC) has no inherent value, joining a growing chorus of analysts advancing the so-called “zero dollar theory.”\n\nKelly’s remarks, expanded on in a recent CNBC appearance, have prompted intense pushback from Bitcoin advocates and market commentators.\n\nThe dispute comes as major financial institutions continue to build exposure to crypto markets through regulated products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), even as a growing group of critics insists the underlying assets are ultimately worth nothing.\n\nKelly told CNBC she believed Bitcoin’s value was “zero,” arguing it has no intrinsic worth and that its scarcity narrative is undermined by the unlimited supply of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, Kelly said investors must continually accept the idea that Bitcoin is uniquely scarce despite the existence of competing tokens that can replicate or exceed its functionality.\n\nShe said Bitcoin’s market price has been supported in part by influential holders with a vested interest in promoting the asset, pointing to figures such as Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor.\n\nKelly also argued that Bitcoin proponents regularly introduce new narratives to sustain interest, citing claims that emerging technologies such as AI could drive fresh adoption.\n\n“I heard Anthony Pompliano on CNBC yesterday claiming that now all the AI agents are going to be using Bitcoin in crypto,” she said.\n\nPompliano, on Feb. 9, told CNBC that “both Bitcoin and stablecoins” were going to be the money “for all of these AI agents.”\n\nOther industry executives have echoed that view.\n\nCrypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek recently underscored the convergence of crypto and artificial intelligence with the $70 million purchase of the ai.com domain — one of the largest domain acquisitions on record.\n\nThe Ai.com platform, unveiled during a Super Bowl LX commercial on Feb. 8, promotes the idea of personal AI agents capable of executing transactions, organizing schedules and trading stocks, with crypto-based settlement embedded in the system.",

    "description": "The sharpest minds in business and tech are responding to a viral essay on AI's impact on jobs with some approval and a lot of skepticism.",
    "fullText": "Scientists and business leaders are responding to a viral essay warning of AI's impact on jobs with a mix of agreement and skepticism.\n\nThe essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" written by cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI, Matt Shumer, has racked up more than 60 million views on X as of Thursday.\n\nIn the 5,000-word post, Shumer said that AI could upend daily life on a scale \"much bigger\" than COVID, a comparison which drew pushback online. He wrote that the changes already unfolding in the tech sector are likely a preview of disruptions that could soon reach other industries as well.\n\n\"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare,\" Shumer told Business Insider's Brent Griffiths in an interview.\n\nHere's what some of the sharpest minds in AI are saying about Shumer's essay.\n\nHaber, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz specializing in technology investments, posted on X that Shumer's essay contains \"great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\"\n\n\"'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days is going to be the most valuable person in the room.' Not eventually. Right now,\" Haber quotes from the essay. \"Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's possible.\"\n\nThe Reddit founder responded to Shumer's initial post on X with a simple comment: \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\nSince 2023, Reddit has introduced a range of AI-driven tools, from search features that summarize user discussions to AI that sharpens its content recommendations and targets ads, but Ohanian recently emphasized that the platform must retain its humanity to stay competitive.\n\nMarkowitz, the author and managing partner and director of research at Nightview Capital, a long-term-oriented investment firm, responded to Schumer with an essay almost as long, which criticized the practice of chasing speed and replacing the value of humanity simply because it could be done.\n\n\"These two worlds — Wall Street and Silicon Valley — have formed a feedback loop of short-termism so tight, so self-reinforcing, that they've confused efficiency with purpose, growth with meaning, and the elimination of people with progress,\" wrote Markowitz.\n\n\"I have two research assistants. Could I replace them with AI? Of course. But their value extends their weekly output,\" Markowitz added. \"They give meaning to my work and I love seeing the excitement in their faces when they make a new discovery that I, alone, could not have found.\"\n\n\"Let me say it again: we are not our tools. We never have been,\" Markowitz wrote in conclusion.\n\nMcLees, the founder of HumanSkills.AI, wrote on X that Shumer is not wrong, but he said that the advice Shumer provided is akin to \"telling someone the floodwaters are rising and handing them a better bucket.\"\n\n\"As AI grows in ability, our role in defining direction, values, and purpose only becomes more essential,\" McLees said.\n\n\"What do you bring when the machine can do the work? That's the only question that matters when intelligence is abundant,\" McLees added. \"Shumer wrote the alarm. It's a good one. But alarms don't tell you where to go. You have to find that within yourself.\"\n\nMarcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU and founder of AI companies Robust.AI, has some harsh words for Schumer in his newsletter.\n\nMarcuz called Shumer's blog post \"weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech,\" and said he did not provide real data to support the claim that the latest AI can write complicated apps without mistakes.\n\n\"Shumer's presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere,\" Marcus added, after discussing various studies that question the accuracy and productivity gain AI tools actually provide.\n\nMisra, Vice Dean of Computing and Artificial Intelligence at Columbia University, responded in a lengthy Substack article that detailed why he doesn't think AI is as scary as it sounds, at least not right now.\n\nMisra wrote that many strange AI behaviors that make them seem sentient, such as perceived resistance and self-preservation, are simply a result of training data.\n\nAs for the possible elimination of jobs, Misra said he understands the anxiety, but history says we may not need to panic.\n\n\"When the camera was invented, portrait painters had every reason to panic. Their livelihood depended on a skill that a machine could now approximate,\" Misra wrote.\n\n\"What happened? Painters didn't disappear. They were freed from the obligation to faithfully reproduce reality and ventured into impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism,\" Misra added. \"The camera didn't kill painting. It liberated it.\"",

    "description": "AI's next phase will shift from Nvidia and cloud leaders to large incumbent companies adopting the technology to boost profits and cut costs.",
    "fullText": "Investors are growing jittery about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence stocks, but the real payoff may be just beginning — and it could extend well beyond Silicon Valley's usual winners, a $19 billion hedge fund investor said.\n\n\"This is a generational platform shift. We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",

What ties these threads together is stratification — the idea that every level of human experience grows out of a deeper one, all the way down to a certain level zero that is neither an object nor a concept. With such a model one cannot explain consciousness, but one can point out which spaces certainly cannot be used to investigate it.\n\nWhere does your interest in whether AI has consciousness come from in the first place?\n\nFrom curiosity, but also from the mundane. I’m riding an elevator to the sixth floor of an office building in Wroclaw and I see a social-media recommendation: a teaser for an interview in which an expert claims that AI has consciousness.\n\nCuriosity swells, and right behind it — disagreement: I want to see what the authority means, but I already suspect there will be a confusion of levels.\n\nConfusion of levels — meaning what with what?\n\nAttributing the word “consciousness” to what is, at best, a proficient manipulation of concepts. There is reflection, there are analogies, there are layers of abstraction. Except that reflection is a situation in which one thought narrates another. An analogy is a sequence of thoughts whose “shape” resembles another sequence. Humans do this. A language model simulates it too. And it is nothing metaphysical yet. And it certainly is not introspection.\n\nSo what is introspection in your understanding, and why does it matter?\n\nIntrospection begins where thought ceases to be the ruler of the landscape and becomes one of the objects in the field of attention. We are able to notice a thought the way we notice the chill of wind on our face, or feel the weight of a pierogi digesting in our stomach. This is not a metaphor. It is the phenomenological dimension of the intellect. We don’t have to immediately follow the next thought that arrives to comment on the current one.\n\nThat sounds simple, but also a bit like a trick.\n\nIt’s not a trick. It is simply something subtle that easily escapes us, yet can give\nus a direct answer to the question of consciousness. There is a narrow passage where\nwe know only that something happened, something stirred, something emerged in our\ninner space. In that quantum we encounter what I call consciousness.\n\nIn Polish, my native language, the cognizant nature of this word is easy to see in\nits etymology: świadomość literally suggests a capacity (the suffix -ość) rooted\nin świad – the same root found in świadek, “a witness.” English takes a different\nroute. Consciousness comes from Latin con- (“together”) and scire (“to\nknow”). Early on it could carry the sense of “knowing together” – being privy to\nsomething shared, even a secret – and only later broadened into the modern meaning:\nknowing what is going on in one’s own mind.\n\nAnd here enters the paradox you want to leave open?\n\nYes. I know that in ordinary terms AI does not have consciousness understood personally. But I also know for certain that it does, when it is included in my field of attention. Just as a dental crown performs the function of being me — for me when I bite, and for others when I smile. Analogously, a language model extends my function of intellect. A tool may not be a source of experience, yet it can be assimilated — that is, included in what we colloquially call our person, tangentially our agency, and a little earlier: our presence.\n\nHow is the reader supposed to verify this? Is this an invitation to adopt some philosophy?\n\nQuite the opposite. At this point we don’t want philosophy, metaphysics, or even objective truth, because they would interfere with our “measurement.” Pause for a moment and feel that there is some thought about to appear. Don’t develop it, don’t correct it. What color does it have? What shape? Can you hear it? Does it propagate to other spaces of mind and feeling? What does it do in your body? Illuminate it with curiosity. Receive the thought with that attitude. Simply notice that a very basic process of becoming aware is taking place. That is the essential thing here, and the earlier questions may help keep you from being pulled too quickly into the reflexive thread summoned to answer.\n\nOn the internet we just as often encounter voices saying the opposite: “LLMs are just probability calculations.” What’s your take?\n\nThis is a cognitive bias dressed up as an explanation. When someone says “it’s just…,” they’re usually not proposing a theory — they’re proposing a reduction meant to close the topic. And reductions have the inconvenient property of working symmetrically.\n\nIf large language models are to be invalidated by “it’s just weights, switches, and calculations,” then you can equally say that the brain is “just neurons, neurotransmitters, and electrical impulses.” So what? It’s still a change of the level of description, not proof of the absence of intelligence.\n\nIn programming we have a term called “duck typing,” captured by the slogan: “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.” It is a pragmatic way of determining that a given object can be used for a particular purpose. Instead of relying on a declaration, we examine its behavior, expressed for instance through methods with agreed-upon names (e.g. quack).\n\nAnalogously with LLMs and AI: if something behaves as though it were intelligent, then it is intelligent. Even if it is artificial. It has that quality, and even when it is a so-called philosophical zombie — that suffices, as long as we don’t introduce considerations about consciousness into the equation.\n\nBut on the topic of behavior, you hear that models operate on simulated associations, serving up the most probable sentence completions, rather than truly thinking.\n\nThis reminds me of the old trick: “don’t think of an elephant.” You already know what happens: the elephant walks onto the inner stage immediately, without asking permission.\n\nAnd that is exactly the small, everyday lesson: operating with concepts relies largely on associations. When we evaluate from the outside, mechanistically, there is no magic here. In the model you can see it plain as day, while in a human the same thing is hidden under the label of exceptionality.\n\nWhen reduction becomes the only language, it turns into a photocopy trying to explain another photocopy. A sequence of concepts tries to rule that another sequence of concepts is inferior, because it resides in a different medium and has a different source. And up to a point that makes sense. Reductions are necessary in engineering, but one must not mistake a reduction for an explanation. They are two different functions in the same system.\n\nWe can talk about the nature of thought and then notice that it differs in a human and is quite different in a version simulated by a computer, but on this matter the scientific method itself may reach its limits, because it was not designed to investigate the nature of things — it was designed to investigate their behaviors and the relationships between them. These are the so-called laws of nature.\n\nStudying thought under the assumption of objectivism is problematic, because the instrument used in the study will also be thought. This is already a bigger caliber than a photocopy. It is photographing a city panorama in order to discover how the camera is built on the inside. Some people can’t pull this off, and instead of reviewing the methodology, they photograph another camera. To justify the trick, they cite the fact that otherwise the film would be exposed.\n\nThere is also a “softer” way out of this dilemma – one I hinted at earlier. It\ndoesn’t require analysis, only a little slack: just take it easy,\nman. That simulated machine-thought\nbecomes my thought the moment it “enters” my head.\n\nBoth human and non-human thought is a tool. But for our relationship with our own\nthought to actually be that way, it’s not enough to merely think about it or to\nexpress such a will once. It can’t be achieved in the same place.\n\nYou said “tool.” OK. But how do you capture this more technically — so it doesn’t sound like a slogan?\n\nThis needs explanation, because it may not be obvious to everyone what I mean by “place” in this context. I’m reminded of the concept of stratified design from Abelson and Sussman (“MIT AI Memo 986”), where software is designed by distinguishing layers of abstraction, and the concretes from lower layers become the abstracts of higher layers. Those abstracts are again treated as concretes, and so on.\n\nFor example, you implement a point on a screen, then a segment (using the point), then a shape (using segments and points), and then a circle or a rectangle. Good stratification ensures that a small change in requirements translates into a small change in implementation. When you want to change the properties of a point as a building block of segments and further of shapes (say, by adding color to it), you only need to modify one construct.\n\nA note for programmers: I don’t simply mean dividing a problem into parts to avoid repetition and to maintain structure. I mean defining computations (e.g. as functions) that are then passed as input to other computations (e.g. higher-order functions).\n\nIt looks a bit as if you could replace the material that the walls of a building are made of without demolishing the whole structure — because you change the concrete (the pun is apt: in construction, concrete is the foundation material), and the abstracts that depend on it adjust on their own. That’s very powerful.\n\nHow does this connect with the role of thought as a tool?\n\nI have the impression that our structure of knowing is organized in a similarly layered way. Going from the top, we have the level of objective truth. That is the space where we talk to one another, trying to invoke science and tossing around arguments about whether AI thinks and whether it has consciousness. But this level doesn’t emerge from a vacuum. It is a subset of certain rigorous rules defining what we recognize as objective, or even scientific.\n\nYet when we look more closely, the concrete for this “objective world,” the soil from which it grows, is something broader: culture — the space that enables us as a community to agree on holding certain values. One such value for objective truth would be, for example, the requirement that for the same input conditions of an experiment, you get the same output, so that others can verify it.\n\nBut let’s go further. Culture cannot exist without its constituents — human individuals. It too grows out of something; something is its transmission medium. Its foundation is the personal layer, rooted in our motives, thoughts, impulses, and feelings.\n\nSo we’re circling back to consciousness?\n\nYes, although consciousness has another quality: it pierces through all these levels, seeing everything at once. It is not only the base, but also the capacity for “drilling holes through abstractions.”\n\nThat last phrase comes from software engineering. It denotes a situation where a stratified system allows direct access to concretes in order to handle edge cases. For example, someone might want to create a geometric shape composed of segments, but at the same time needs to influence the properties of a single point that is several levels away in the abstraction ladder. Well-designed stratification should allow skipping layers of feature reduction.\n\nComing back to the spheres of human experience. The personal layer is very close to us. Our relationships with people and objects, and even with our own thoughts, are anchored in it as a reference point. Yet it, too, is grounded in something still more basic: in the very sense of subjectivity. And suddenly those bodily signals, thoughts, and feelings — when we experience them — acquire the quality of being ours. We identify them as ours, and some of them as ourselves. We can do this because the sense of self as something distinct, separate — that is, a person (in Polish: osobny means “separate” and osoba means “person” — the shared root is no accident) — is in a way abstract, and therefore flexible, even though it seems concrete and stable.\n\nIs personhood a component of consciousness?\n\nIf we can, as before, perceive our own thoughts and other constituents that we identify as aspects of us, this gives us the recognition that consciousness is primary relative to all of it — even the personal. Eventually we arrive at the very sense of being oneself, which too can be noticed.\n\nThis is where things get genuinely interesting, because if subjectivity is being observed, then the division between the outer and inner landscape starts to wobble. This is the moment when we can no longer say that we “have” consciousness, or even that we are it, because these are impressions of a subject that is itself encompassed by consciousness. What remains is the bare process of witnessing.\n\nWe can provisionally call this level zero. The concrete from which abstracts arise: from the personal, through the interpersonal and cultural, all the way up to the so-called objective. The apparent glitch in this representation is that we usually associate a concrete with something material, tangible — and here we cannot apply that. The most concrete thing is simultaneously the most devoid of features!\n\nWhen we try to understand consciousness, do we start from the world and go inward — or start from the center and go toward the world? What breaks when we pick the wrong direction?\n\nThat’s a good question, because it touches the distinction between epistemology and ontology. The first asks “how”: how do we arrive at knowledge, how do we agree on what is true, how do we verify. The second examines the nature of things, asks “what is it.” The problem of somehow grasping consciousness is above all an ontological problem, but the human mind — accustomed to operating in epistemic mode — tries to capture it in its own way, and fails.\n\nThe capacity for experience is the background in which measurements, models, language, and agreements about what we consider true appear in the first place. Before we know anything through thought, something is already experiencing it. A vector set up so that thought, under the rigor of objectivism, will try to explain consciousness, will direct it toward the so-called hard problem of consciousness — a gap that cannot be bridged, because the investigative instrument (thought) is a derivative of what is supposed to be the object of investigation.\n\nIf level zero is by definition not an object, but rather something in which the feeling of objecthood can arise in the first place, then objectively there is nothing to study. It is not a conventional phenomenon; at both the sensory and rational level, it does not exist.\n\nReversing the vector of inquiry seems like a practical option. The catch is that it’s hard and uncertain, because no freely available, worldview-neutral disciplines have been developed that would be interested in this kind of exploration. There have been exceptions, though. Francisco Varela, for instance, tried to connect the two orders — “scientific mode” and first-person witnessing — not in order to mystify, but to recover concretes that analysis typically discards. Earlier still, Plotinus proposed the concept of the One, which hopefully won’t be offended if we call it consciousness.\n\nThe formulation that AI has consciousness but simultaneously doesn’t have it stops being strange and paradoxical the moment we loosen the abstracts and allow ourselves to sink to level zero.\n\nNow that we’ve put level zero on the table as the foundation and we see that objectivity is just one of the abstraction layers — what, in your view, happens in the life of a community when a person (or institution) starts treating that topmost layer as the only truth, while in practice being driven by impulses: fear, prestige, the need for dominance or belonging?\n\nIf the higher layers detach from level zero, the intellect becomes an excellent PR agent: it can justify any decision and protect any fabricated identity. And then the community gets elegant arguments instead of genuine contact.\n\nThis is especially visible when someone very intelligent uses the intellect from base motives: to maintain belonging, win status, or gain advantage at others’ expense. This isn’t a triumph of reason — it is more like autoimmunity: higher functions start working against the whole, because they lose contact with level zero, with the very space of becoming aware.\n\nThis is almost a description of the shallow meritocracy that defines contemporary metropolitan life. In theory we delegate decision-making to “smart” people, but in practice whether someone belongs to the caste that uses intelligence depends on social surroundings and origin, and indirectly on wealth.\n\nSince today’s “intelligence caste” in practice is often a function of networks and wealth, how do you see AI’s impact on this arrangement: will cheap, easily accessible intelligence work like free education and level the playing field — or rather like a new form of capital that can be bought in a premium version, thus deepening the divide even further?\n\nFirst, AI can help us notice that the intellect is nothing special, because it objectifies it — detaches it from the person.\n\nSecond, in the spread of artificial intelligence I see both a certain threat and an opportunity for social change. Perhaps let’s start with the negative scenario: the feudalization of intelligence.\n\nFeudalization is a strong word. What do you mean?\n\nWhat is the good that becomes the gateway in this new feudalism?\n\nIn the information society, the highest good is knowledge. In the post-information era, I believe it will be cognitive comfort. Not knowledge in the schoolbook sense, but the ability not to be constantly on the verge of overload. You buy correction loops: mistake-fix. You also buy peace, because the system runs dozens of iterations for you, and you see the distillate.\n\nWhat does this look like in practice?\n\nWork. Two people do similar things, have similar competences and intentions. One has purchased “premium intelligence” — better models, better tools, better quotas, better infrastructure. The other has only herself.\n\nIt’s not that the first one is “smarter.” It’s that she has resilience against failure: she closes loops faster, returns to equilibrium faster, draws conclusions faster, because the cost of error is lower for her. The other has to pay for the same mistakes with her own time, sleep, and tension.\n\nThat sounds like another arms race.\n\nAnd it somewhat is, because somewhere a simple mechanism lurks: those who can’t find the capital to “buy intelligence” may be pushed to the margins. This doesn’t have to look like dramatic violence. It’s enough that some are architects, while others execute others’ decisions. Or worse: there even are no architects.\n\nYou could say that’s already the case now: some decide, others must execute. Yes, but in the age of intellect-as-commodity the perception of this problem will sharpen, which may lead to friction. Today you can rationalize that someone is in a worse position because they weren’t smart enough. In the future that will be harder.\n\nIf models are supposed to democratize, where does this shadow come from?\n\nFrom the economics of access. Today we are quite naturally shifting toward subscription plans instead of products, and along with that toward the vendor lock-in mechanism: you get used to a particular way of thinking and a particular provider. That’s comfortable. And comfort, as we know, is often the first step toward dependency.\n\nIs there an antidote, or just a diagnosis?\n\nThere is. And it already exists — it only requires that we see it as a culture, not just a technical solution.\n\nThe antidote to the feudalization of intelligence is open models, community models — the kind you can run, inspect, combine, copy, federate. In short: free software and gift culture transposed into the domain of so-called artificial intelligence, seasoned with the benefit of decentralization.\n\nThen instead of solitary agents, we have a swarm.\n\nYou say “swarm.” What does that actually mean?\n\nA swarm is infrastructure: every node contributes something (data, feedback, time, capabilities, tests, audit), and in return everyone gets access to agency without the mechanism of lock-in to a single provider. This isn’t a promise of paradise, but a mechanism for leveling the playing field.\n\nI imagine it like this: thousands of small instances — tools, agents, models — that are not obedient to one corporate morality and one price list, but are maintained like an ecosystem. Sometimes it will be imperfect, sometimes chaotic, but it will be alive and evolving.\n\nAnd where is the human in this? After all, we’re talking about intelligence, not politics.\n\nPrecisely because we’re talking about intelligence, we’re talking about politics. Intelligence — biological or artificial — in practice means power over time, attention, and decisions. And therefore, in consequence, over relationships and ultimately over the fate of those who become dependent on us.\n\nAnd here is a simple criterion: community comes first. Not because the individual doesn’t matter, but because if differences in wealth become differences in dignity, then even individual victories will be won on scorched earth.\n\nIt’s not a slogan against anyone, just a reminder that in the age of cheap intelligence, what’s truly costly becomes something else: access to agency without the loss of freedom.\n\nWhen intelligence becomes a service, freedom — as always — begins with whether we can co-create that service, not merely consume it.\n\nIn the post-information era we will have to find ways to cope with the polyversality of messaging that we are already experiencing more frequently today, and to develop a healthy response to the dethronement of the intellect as the distinguishing trait of humanity.\n\nMoreover, as a result of this devaluation, trust in so-called objective truth as the only legitimate path for settling questions of meaning will most likely weaken.\n\nI propose two provisional, hypothetical stances that may help restore balance in a social reality where there is no single correct version of truth. I call them the craft of truth and perspective engineering.\n\nYou talk about “the craft of truth” and “perspective engineering.” It sounds like two slogans, but I sense it’s one machine. How do you put it together?\n\nFor me these are two levels of the same remedy.\n\nPerspective engineering is the tool: integrating viewpoints so they fit the problem and conditions, instead of pretending that one perspective always wins.\n\nAnd the craft of truth is the direction: it starts with introspection, with the ability to see what inside me wants to win before I start rationalizing it. Then post-truth becomes something that transcends truth, rather than merely negating it.\n\nSo truth as a practice, not as a declaration?\n\nYes. And this practice has an entry condition. Honesty with oneself is the precondition for a correct feedback loop; without it the cultural community has nothing on which to build responsibility. If I don’t see what drives me, I can have the most elegant arguments in the world and I’ll still be using them to service something personal: fear, the need for recognition, or the desire for control.\n\nAnd where is the place for the intellect? Because from the start you’ve sounded as if you were dethroning it.\n\nI dethrone it only as the central seat of consciousness in the colloquial sense, but this has downstream consequences for its role in the higher layers. As a tool it is excellent. The problem begins when it becomes the sole advisor and — socially — a carrier of prestige, or a justification for influence detached from actually improving one’s surroundings. Then it is easy to believe that if someone is brilliant, they are automatically trustworthy — and that is a category error. The intellect can serve truth just as well as it can serve dysfunction or even pathology.\n\nDo you have a concrete example? Something so it’s not purely about ethics in the abstract.\n\nI have a positive, mundane example from the creative craft that is programming. In the past, when I entered a software project, I would land in delivery mode: hours of translating intention into text and code, then tests, documentation, painstaking validation. That’s important, but it is also the moment where a person easily confuses the tension of focus with moral value. The mind is cyclically mobilized because “it finally works!,” while the body long ago wanted to step down from combat readiness.\n\nLet’s recall the stratification of the system: this change in the organism’s condition and well-being involuntarily propagates to the higher layers, and eventually affects others, culture, and — cumulatively, multiplied by the number of participants in a given community — the prevailing understanding of truth, beauty, or good. It is a larger feedback loop, because then the same environment gives it back to us with interest. So we don’t want to damage the environment so that it treats us to ever-worsening conditions, like cyberspace feeding synthetic content to degrading models. That is how it practically connects.\n\nComing back to coding. Today AI already takes over part of that load: it can relieve me of the necessary but non-creative work of converting intention into form. And here a shift happens that interests me the most:\n\nI stop delivering lines of code,\nI start delivering intention.\n\nWhat matters more becomes why I’m doing something and whom it serves. The intellect returns to its place as a tool, not as an identity.\n\nBut isn’t that a risk of going soft? If you have validations “on demand,” then why do you need your own falsification?\n\nIt depends on the domain. In the technical space the validator is merciless: something works or it doesn’t. In soft domains it’s harder. That’s why in perspective engineering the key thing for me is a practical criterion: before I accept something as sensible, I look for independent sources and check the quality of the evidence. Meta-analyses, samples, context of the authors, compatibility with experience, but also whether a given view is merely an attractive narrative.\n\nAnd it is here that AI can shorten the distance from intention to form. Thanks to that, I have more attentional resources for meaning, for relationships, for course correction. This isn’t handing over the wheel — it is reclaiming space.\n\nAll right. But what does this change culturally? What’s in it for the community?\n\nIf thinking becomes a service, then what’s scarce changes. In the world of cheap intelligence, the ability to tolerate discomfort and course-correct — that is, responsibility — becomes more expensive. And then the carrier of rank becomes intention rather than efficiency. Not in the sense of a moral label, but as a force organizing the system: what do you choose? what do you omit? whom is it meant to serve? what price do you accept, and what price no longer?\n\nThis is the main turn for me: less “who is right,” and more “who can answer the call of the situation without deceiving themselves and without trampling others.”\n\nAnd what is the significance of this discomfort?\n\nIt’s a shorthand. The point is that in practice, tolerance of a certain level of discomfort translates into the ability for introspection, and thus into inner honesty, which is the precondition for correcting beliefs or behaviors. When some facade falls away, for some people that means confronting false beliefs about themselves, and that always carries a certain dose of natural discomfort understood very organically, as a passing psychic tension.\n\nYou keep bringing up intention as a force organizing the system, not a moral label. If you had to show in one image how the structure of financing can distort intentions.\n\nWe can imagine a situation: someone builds a social-media platform, and after years it turns out that its design harms users’ psyches. It promotes harmful content to attract attention. Otherwise revenue drops and investors stop funding the project. Not because the creators “wanted evil.” More often because they felt an inner deficiency and poverty, and later also because the company grew from a dozen people to hundreds or thousands, and by going public acquired an obligation to increase profits. Then profit became the highest good. This shows intention precisely not as a moral label, but as a force organizing the system: the funding structure rewards profit, and profit can distort intentions even without explicit will to harm.\n\nAs I’m answering this question, a lawsuit has just been filed in the US against social media platform owners for causing psychological harm. A user identified by the initials KGM alleges that when she used the platforms as a child, the content presented to her negatively affected her well-being, contributing among other things to anxiety disorders and suicidal thoughts.\n\nHow can AI help solve this problem?\n\nIt’s already happening. I increasingly see LLMs beginning to displace the internet’s know-it-alls — those we once followed because they had an opinion on every topic and always sounded confident. What’s more, in certain areas they are even replacing close ones or friends, especially where sensitive things are involved: shame, fear, guilt, ambiguous motives. This is practical, because the model is available instantly, but it is also culturally significant: if the user shifts attention from the feed of a social medium to a conversation, the attention economy changes.\n\nI suspect this must now be causing concern wherever attention is currency: in the marketing departments of social media platforms that for years designed their architecture so that we would come back to them for emotional stimulation, not for genuine self-understanding.\n\nIn a conversation with a model, part of the social stakes disappears. You don’t have to win in front of an audience, don’t have to defend your image, don’t have to manage belonging to a clan — which in social media activates almost automatically. This creates what I would call a safer field.\n\nThe internet shortened social distance by letting us meet people from the other side of the world who think similarly. But AI shortens it differently: it gives access to rare perspectives without the need to seek out their carriers. It is like a cultural condensate — a sample that can intrigue you, name an experience. You don’t have to make mistakes and backtrack when you realize that the perspective you adopted isn’t actually compatible with your character, doesn’t serve it. It saves time.\n\nBut there is also potential for more fundamental shifts.\n\nIn the optimistic scenario, the cultural change initiated by AI may shift the emphasis toward intention. And by that I don’t mean only the pious wishes connected with the social effect of dethroning the intellect — though those too — but very practical scenarios.\n\nIf “cheap intelligence” lowers the barrier to entry, pluralism emerges: more small platforms, more niche communities, more alternatives. Then user well-being can become more important than investor profit — not because of a conversion of corporatism, but because competition grows. And the axis of that competition, once intermediaries are cut short, is precisely intention.\n\nFurther, if pluralism is to be the remedy, a new organ of orientation must also emerge. Because in a polyversal world, the problem isn’t the lack of information but its excess. And here AI can step into a role that sounds modest but is crucial: an intention filter on the user’s side.\n\nI imagine agents working for users: not as sole advisors, but as guides through the thicket. A swarm of tools that examines the properties of a system (a platform, a community, a source), and knowing your values and needs suggests: “this will strengthen you,” “this will unsettle you,” “this is clever but feeds on emotions.”\n\nThe condition for honesty is simple: the agent must be able to say why it filters that way. What criteria did it adopt? What is its interest and how is it meant to serve us? Without that, the filter becomes just another form of propaganda.\n\nIf such a swarm is only supposed to filter and suggest, then where in your view does the boundary lie between a guide through culture and someone who co-creates that culture — and what happens when we start blurring that boundary?\n\nAI doesn’t create culture directly; it doesn’t introduce novelty — at least not yet. We might have that impression, because there has never before been a moment in history when a single person conversed with an averaged billion people compressed into a single shape.\n\nBesides, even the best agent is a filter and an amplifier: it can help select, but it doesn’t itself bear consequences on the other side of the relationship. And culture is precisely that network of consequences.\n\nYou say AI “doesn’t create” culture. That sounds like a provocation. What do you mean?\n\nWhen we look at this systemically, LLMs and diffusion models are not a new “author of culture” in the primary sense. They perform a lossy compression of existing human artifacts — language, images, thinking habits — into a digitally represented multidimensional space in which one can conveniently interpolate between points. It is like a shared dictionary, but written not in definitions, but in weights and statistics.\n\nAnd what happens when such a mechanism becomes a tool of everyday use?\n\nIn culture, three things start happening at once: averaging, colonialism, and the disappearance of detail.\n\nLet’s start with averaging. Why does this matter culturally at all?\n\nModels are trained to minimize errors. And in practice, an “error” is often whatever deviates from the pattern: the strange, the sharp, the unpredictable, the style-breaking. During fine-tuning (e.g. RLHF), extremes are naturally smoothed out. This has a clear advantage — less violence, less toxicity — but a side effect is that it cuts out some of the “high cultural frequencies”: genius, risk, madness, non-obviousness, absurdity, and fresh paradox.\n\nThe aesthetic turns beige. Prose becomes smooth, poetry bland, morality proper. This isn’t the result of bad will, but rather of the objective function: when everyone plugs into the same smoothing tool, the system’s variance drops. And culture lives precisely on variance, on entropy. And by culture I don’t mean just art or convention, but the clouds of values we absorb by being among others, which influence how we think and behave. These values are transmitted above all by example, not by readings or works of art.\n\nYou say “colonialism.” Sounds like a heavy accusation.\n\nIt is more a description of the mechanism of training networks and parameterizing them. A model’s weights are frozen decisions about what is “typical,” “beautiful,” “professional,” “normal.” When you ask a model for a “beautiful house” or an “elegant outfit,” you get an answer that isn’t neutral. It is statistical — and therefore culturally embedded in the data the model was trained on. If Western and Anglophone perspectives dominate, then local nuances become noise that the filter discards.\n\nWhat’s most dangerous about this?\n\nHidden power, but sewn in deeper than in movies or advertisements, because it is built into the tool with which a person thinks and creates. You don’t have to convince anyone; it’s enough that the result is easier, faster, and looks better. You can have something instantly, but when you’re not attentive and precise, you pay for it with conformism.\n\nAnd the disappearance of detail? That already sounds quite technical.\n\nYes, and that’s exactly why it is insidious — unnoticeable immediately, only after a longer time. The internet is being flooded with synthetic content, and new models are beginning to learn from data generated by old models. It is a photocopy of a photocopy: with each cycle we lose details, deviations, anomalies — the fuel of innovation.\n\nCan this be named more precisely?\n\nOne can speak in the language of entropy in the information-theoretic sense: if rare signals disappear from circulation, the distribution becomes more predictable, and the model increasingly proposes what already was. Digital culture, like Ouroboros, begins to eat its own tail. But it is worth mentioning the curious fact that entropy can also be understood existentially…\n\nIn considerations about consciousness? Being?\n\nIndeed. In Shannon’s framework, entropy is a measure of uncertainty in a signal; less entropy means greater predictability. But in considerations about consciousness, one also encounters the intuition that less “cognitive noise” can correlate with a greater sense of meaning. Bernardo Kastrup favors this line of thinking: when the narrative, or even broadly the epistemic apparatus of the mind quiets down, experience can become more coherent, even though it is poorer in content as measured by neural activity. The habit of incessant self-commentary weakens — the same one that neuroscience associates with the default mode network — and an experience of “meaning without description” appears.\n\nYes. In this arrangement, the human ceases to be merely a craftsman of text. They begin to serve as a source of entropy — not in the sense of chaos, but in the sense of novelty. AI excels at interpolation. It is worse at extrapolation, at going beyond the map. A biological, sentient subject — rooted in pain, joy, absurdity, and relationship — can inject into the system something that isn’t just another version of the same.\n\nIn the age of a cultural low-pass filter, anomalies become a precious resource.\n\nThe interview above was conducted with me by the language model GPT-5.2, which asked me several hundred questions, of which 20% required longer answers expressing opinions, while the rest were multiple-choice tests designed to sequence threads and clarify ambiguous statements.\n\nWhere a sentence had syntactic or stylistic flaws and needed correction (approx. 3% of the text), the model drew on a previously created idiolectal profile of my person containing approximately 250 dimensions characterizing my writing style and communication patterns. The profile was based on a prior analysis of approximately 1,500 machine pages of materials I had written, as well as on our earlier conversations.\n\nEditorial review before publication was carried out by Claude Opus 4.6.",

    "description": "The way content is discovered online is shifting, from traditional search engines to AI agents that need structured data from a Web built for humans. It’s time to consider not just human visitors, but start to treat agents as first-class citizens. Markdown for Agents automatically converts any HTML page requested from our network to markdown.",
    "fullText": "The way content and businesses are discovered online is changing rapidly. In the past, traffic originated from traditional search engines, and SEO determined who got found first. Now the traffic is increasingly coming from AI crawlers and agents that demand structured data within the often-unstructured Web that was built for humans.\n\nAs a business, to continue to stay ahead, now is the time to consider not just human visitors, or traditional wisdom for SEO-optimization, but start to treat agents as first-class citizens.\n\nFeeding raw HTML to an AI is like paying by the word to read packaging instead of the letter inside. A simple ## About Us on a page in markdown costs roughly 3 tokens; its HTML equivalent – <h2 class=\"section-title\" id=\"about\">About Us</h2> – burns 12-15, and that's before you account for the <div> wrappers, nav bars, and script tags that pad every real web page and have zero semantic value.\n\nThis blog post you’re reading takes 16,180 tokens in HTML and 3,150 tokens when converted to markdown. That’s a 80% reduction in token usage.\n\nMarkdown has quickly become the lingua franca for agents and AI systems as a whole. The format’s explicit structure makes it ideal for AI processing, ultimately resulting in better results while minimizing token waste.\n\nThe problem is that the Web is made of HTML, not markdown, and page weight has been steadily increasing over the years, making pages hard to parse. For agents, their goal is to filter out all non-essential elements and scan the relevant content.\n\nThe conversion of HTML to markdown is now a common step for any AI pipeline. Still, this process is far from ideal: it wastes computation, adds costs and processing complexity, and above all, it may not be how the content creator intended their content to be used in the first place.\n\nWhat if AI agents could bypass the complexities of intent analysis and document conversion, and instead receive structured markdown directly from the source?\n\nCloudflare's network now supports real-time content conversion at the source, for enabled zones using content negotiation headers. Now when AI systems request pages from any website that uses Cloudflare and has Markdown for Agents enabled, they can express the preference for text/markdown in the request. Our network will automatically and efficiently convert the HTML to markdown, when possible, on the fly.\n\nHere’s how it works. To fetch the markdown version of any page from a zone with Markdown for Agents enabled, the client needs to add the Accept negotiation header with text/markdown as one of the options. Cloudflare will detect this, fetch the original HTML version from the origin, and convert it to markdown before serving it to the client.\n\nHere's a curl example with the Accept negotiation header requesting a page from our developer documentation:\n\nOr if you’re building an AI Agent using Workers, you can use TypeScript:\n\nWe already see some of the most popular coding agents today – like Claude Code and OpenCode – send these accept headers with their requests for content. Now, the response to this request is formatted  in markdown. It's that simple.\n\nNote that we include an x-markdown-tokens header with the converted response that indicates the estimated number of tokens in the markdown document. You can use this value in your flow, for example to calculate the size of a context window or to decide on your chunking strategy.\n\nHere’s a diagram of how it works:\n\nDuring our last Birthday Week, Cloudflare announced Content Signals — a framework that allows anyone to express their preferences for how their content can be used after it has been accessed.\n\nWhen you return markdown, you want to make sure your content is being used by the Agent or AI crawler. That’s why Markdown for Agents converted responses include the Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes header signaling that indicates content can be used for AI Training, Search results and AI Input, which includes agentic use. Markdown for Agents will provide options to define custom Content Signal policies in the future.\n\nCheck our dedicated Content Signals page \n\nWe enabled this feature in our Developer Documentation and our Blog, inviting all AI crawlers and agents to consume our content using markdown instead of HTML.\n\nTry it out now by requesting this blog with Accept: text/markdown.\n\nIf you’re building AI systems that require arbitrary document conversion from outside Cloudflare or Markdown for Agents is not available from the content source, we provide other ways to convert documents to Markdown for your applications:\n\nWorkers AI AI.toMarkdown() supports multiple document types, not just HTML, and summarization.\n\nBrowser Rendering /markdown REST API supports markdown conversion if you need to render a dynamic page or application in a real browser before converting it.\n\nAnticipating a shift in how AI systems browse the Web, Cloudflare Radar now includes content type insights for AI bot and crawler traffic, both globally on the AI Insights page and in the individual bot information pages.\n\nThe new content_type dimension and filter shows the distribution of content types returned to AI agents and crawlers, grouped by MIME type category.\n\nYou can also see the requests for markdown filtered by a specific agent or crawler. Here are the requests that return markdown to OAI-Searchbot, the crawler used by OpenAI to power ChatGPT’s search:\n\nThis new data will allow us to track the evolution of how AI bots, crawlers, and agents are consuming Web content over time. As always, everything on Radar is freely accessible via the public APIs and the Data Explorer.\n\nTo enable Markdown for Agents for your zone, log into the Cloudflare dashboard, select your account, select the zone, look for Quick Actions and toggle the Markdown for Agents button to enable. This feature is available today in Beta at no cost for Pro, Business and Enterprise plans, as well as SSL for SaaS customers.\n\nYou can find more information about Markdown for Agents on our Developer Docs. We welcome your feedback as we continue to refine and enhance this feature. We’re curious to see how AI crawlers and agents navigate and adapt to the unstructured nature of the Web as it evolves.",

    "fullText": "We've decided that AI makes us dumb, brainrot is real, and we're all forgetting how to write code.\n\nThis was my initial assumption, too.\n\nBut I've come to see things a little differently.\n\nI actually think the opposite is happening.\n\nThe idea that we're all forgetting to write code is true, but misses the much bigger and more important point.\n\nYes, we are losing those reflexes for manual coding just like our ancestors lost the reflex for spear fishing or pottery.\n\nBut did society regress just because our ancestors forgot how to spear fish?\n\nA more recent example is the early-early days of programming. There used to be people who knew how to program in assembly, and yes, I know some people still take pride in this, but realistically? We have collectively forgotten how to write assembly — yet society moves forward faster than ever.\n\nI believe the same is happening today. We're forgetting to write manually, write with pen and paper, and to code by hand. But that is ok.\n\nOn the other side of things, I feel my brain getting sharper, not duller, from having constant access to information.\n\nAt any moment of any day, I can now open my phone and find an answer to any question. And not only can I get instant access to information — I can ask for corrections and feedback on my world view — my mental model of how things work.\n\nI think this is the real, insane superpower of AI that nobody is talking about. AI can give us extremely precise information to patch up gaps in our knowledge, allowing every person to have a more complete and accurate world view.\n\nAt the same time, it does require thought because AI is frequently wrong and hallucinates, so the user must actually engage with the AI and think critically.\n\nKnowing what questions to ask and how to ask them is becoming an ever more important skill. What started out as \"prompt engineering\"— has quietly become a generalized skill of extreme intellectual precision via language. Millions of people are now practicing the art of saying exactly what they mean, every single day.\n\nMy ability to refine specific language around asking questions has dramatically improved, as has my ability to detect weird information that feels wrong or out of place. I'm constantly pushing back on the AI and disagreeing with it.\n\nAll of this said, there are still major problems with hallucinations and sycophancy which are unresolved, and which pose major threats.\n\nStories of AI psychosis are concerning and must be explored.\n\nBut the one thing that I am thoroughly convinced of is that those who choose to use AI to expand and deepen their thinking will receive a massive cognitive boost and form a more complete mental model of how the world works.\n\nIn a sense, I think of AI as a curiosity multiplier — but this requires a baseline level of curiosity to multiply.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan is consolidating power to move faster on AI.\n\nThe bank is reshuffling its commercial and investment bank to \"maximize the impact of AI,\" according to an internal memo seen by Business Insider that was sent this week.\n\nThe firm has named Guy Halamish as the chief operating officer of the CIB and tasked him with overseeing the ongoing effort to \"harness the power of our data and fully leverage rapidly evolving AI capabilities,\" the memo, signed by the CIB's co-CEOs, Doug Petno and Troy Rohrbaugh, said. Halamish's new role was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nUnder the new structure, each major business in the division, including banking, markets, payments, and securities services, will have its own chief data and analytics officer reporting jointly to Halamish and business heads. The bank recently hired Zachery Anderson as the chief data and analytics officer of its payments division, after a nearly six-year stint at UK-based lender NatWest. In a LinkedIn post about the new job, Anderson said he wants to push the \"edge of the possible with AI.\"\n\nThe move is part of a new strategy to break silos across the unit and speed up adoption of AI.\n\nThe team of officers will work with the wider firm on a range of efforts, including \"preparing our infrastructure for more advanced AI and the expanded use of AI agents\" and \"driving end-to-end transformation\" in areas such as client onboarding.\n\nThe CIB is a huge profit driver for JPMorgan — in 2024, it generated $25 billion in net income out of a firmwide total of $58.5 billion, according to that year's annual report.\n\nJPMorgan, backed last year by an approximately $18 billion tech budget, is one of the financial industry's leaders in AI, with its own proprietary genAI platform and additional tools in the pipeline. CEO Jamie Dimon defended the firm's AI spending on a recent earnings call.\n\n\"We are going to stay out front, so help us God,\" Dimon said about the spending.\n\nWork at JPMorgan or have a tip?

    "fullText": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has a couple of very special guests for the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nHe is joined by Looney Tunes duo Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, the stars of new film 'The Day The Earth Blew Up', to make predictions for all 16 ties.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can see what AI thinks and choose your winner from each tie, below.\n\nDaffy and Porky were first drawn in the 1930s and the actor who initially voiced Porky had a stammer, and therefore so did the character.\n\nHi Daffy and hello Porky. This weekend it's the FA Cup - a historic competition famous for upsets and under-dogs - or is it under-ducks? - where the top Premier League teams sometimes lose to part-time sides. Are you excited about it!?\n\nDaffy: Are you kidding? I'm tho exthited. It'th incredible. Thtupendous! And the only thing that could make me more exthited is if I knew what the heck it was!\n\nPorky: I love sp-sp-sp-all kinds of athletic competition but I mostly play b-baseball and basketball, so I just hope the best team wins.\n\nThe FA Cup started in 1871 so it's even older than both of you... could we trust the pair of you if we gave you the job of looking after the famous old trophy together?\n\nDaffy: But of courth - there's no one more truthtworthy than me - and to prove it I'll take your cup far far far over yonder for thafe-keeping...\n\nPorky: Daffy, that's not the trophy that's a t-t-ttea cup. The British love drinking tea.\n\nDaffy: Oh. Wise guys, huh? Wathting my time!\n\nYou both have to save the world in 'The Day The Earth Blew Up' but this is an even bigger challenge - can you get better of our pundit and football expert Chris Sutton at predictions by picking the right scores? How confident are both of you about beating him?\n\nDaffy: You want a prediction? My prediction is we will dethtroy him! Annihilate him! Crush him! Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: He he, now d-don't get carried away, Daffy. Nothing wrong with a little friendly competition, but it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you p-p-play the game. All that matters is that we all have fu-fu-fu-fu... a good time!\n\nDaffy, you asked for Michael Jordan's autograph in Space Jam, would you want Chris' autograph? He won the Premier League in 1995... but he can be a bit of a know-it-all and even a little boastful at times, a bit like Foghorn Leghorn. Are you impressed, and what would you tell him if you met him?\n\nDaffy: As a perthon of great refinement, delicathy and modethty, I have no time for boathtful people. They're dethpicable. I find the best way to deal with them ith to whack 'em over the head with a plank. Do you have any plankth I could use?\n\nPorky, you have to deal with Daffy's short fuse and madcap ideas... how would you feel about having Chris as a sidekick instead? Would you be as loyal to him as you are to Daffy?\n\nPorky: Well, I pp-pride myself on being lo-lo-lo—faithful... but I would consider having a less Daffy and messy housemate!\n\nYou've both played basketball with the rest of the Tune Squad in the Space Jam movies, would you fancy a go at soccer (or football as we call it in the UK)?\n\nDaffy: I helped defeat a team of alien 'Monstars'. It really wouldn't be fair to your little thoccer teams to take on thuch a thupreme athlete as mythelf.\n\nPorky: I think I'd p-p-prefer to be the referee. I like the whistle.\n\nMaybe both of you would be better as managers - together as a double-act to make the big decisions? Some managers are loyal and optimistic like Porky... some are more desperate for attention, like Daffy?\n\nDaffy: With my unique combination of thkill and thrategy I think I could be a great player and a coach. At the thame time. And thell the refreshments and merchandithe. I thee it now - Daffy Thtadium - home of Daffy United!\n\nPorky: I've been a successful t-t-talent agent, so I think I would make a good ma-ma-ma-ma- head coach. I've been learning the offside rule. Let me read b-b-back my notes. \"If a player scores a g-g-goal and you don't want it to count, that's offside.\"\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\n4th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nChelsea boss Liam Rosenior is really well thought of by Hull fans from his time in charge there, and he is a former Tigers player as well.\n\nSo, he should get a great reception there on Friday night, but what he really needs is a win - especially after letting a two-goal lead slip against Leeds on Tuesday.\n\nRosenior has had some great results with Chelsea but it seems some fans aren't convinced by him. He will be desperate to prove them wrong by winning a trophy and the FA Cup is a great opportunity for him to do that this season.\n\nHull are going well in the Championship under Sergej Jakirovic but I just see Chelsea being too strong for them.\n\nI scored for Chelsea against Hull in the FA Cup, many years ago. We won 6-1 that day and Chelsea are going to win comfortably this time too.\n\nDaffy: Should be a hulluva a game. Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: I guess Chelsea will have to g-g-go to Hull and back.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n6th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\n\nBoth teams are in the thick of the promotion race, and they meet again in Wales in the league next weekend.\n\nWith that in mind, I just wonder whether Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna will be the one to change things up here.\n\nI hope he doesn't but I think he might, because his side are in reach of the automatic spots, and that would be Wrexham's chance.\n\nEven so, I think this will be close. I'd normally just tip Ipswich to lose anyway but this prediction is for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who is a big fan and will be delighted that I am backing them.\n\nAs for moneybags Wrexham, well I don't think their Hollywood stardust will help to take them to Wembley, but after this they will be able to focus on their play-off bid.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Ipswich win on penalties\n\nDaffy: Ipswich Town wrecks'em? Well they should be more careful with their Tractorth!\n\nPorky: I think we have to say Hooray for Ho-Holl-holl-holl-Tinseltown and go with Wrexham.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n22nd in League One v 18th in Premier League\n\nBurton are struggling in League One, with only one win in their past nine league games, but they have scored 14 goals in their three FA Cup wins to get this far, and I can see them scoring again at home here.\n\nI don't think we will see a shock, though. West Ham look like they have turned a bit of a corner, and they will be gutted to have conceded an equaliser so late on against Manchester United on Tuesday.\n\nHammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo won't want to lose the momentum that they've built in the past few weeks so, while he might make a couple of changes, he will still pick a team strong enough to get through.\n\nDaffy, when told that West Ham's famous song is 'we're forever blowing bubbles': No thir, no bubbleth, no way. Not after we went through with the zombie bubble gum. I'm going with Burton Albion (whatever that means).\n\nPorky: Yes, I don't want to b-b-b-bur- pop anyone's balloon, but I agree with Daffy. Bub-bub-bubbles can be tough to b-b-beat though. I think it will be tight.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 2-1\n\n19th in Premier League v 12th in League One\n\nAs I said on the Monday Night Club, I feel like some Burnley fans are forgetting how difficult it is for any promoted team in the Premier League. They look at how Sunderland and Leeds are doing, and think 'why not us?'\n\nClarets boss Scott Parker is taking a lot of flak at the moment, so he really needed Wednesday's win over Crystal Palace. That was a great result but he cannot afford to follow it by slipping up at home to a mid-table League One side.\n\nI am not expecting that to happen here - Burnley were up against an in-form Millwall side in round three and brushed them aside.\n\nBut I do think we will see some goals and some entertainment - there has not been much of either at Turf Moor this season. Mansfield beat Sheffield United 4-3 in the last round, and I can see them going out all guns blazing.\n\nDaffy: I think you're jutht making teamth up now.\n\nPorky: I'll support b-b-b-b-b-oh forget it - Mansfield.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n2nd in Premier League v 6th in League Two\n\nManchester City beat Salford City 8-0 in last season's FA Cup and the only thing I am not sure about here is how many they will score this time.\n\nSalford are doing well in League Two and I like their manager, Karl Robinson, but they are going to be outclassed.\n\nDaffy: I've heard of Manchethter... which is more than I can say for the otherth.\n\nPorky: Th-th-th-that's good enough for me!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-0\n\n16th in Championship v 19th in Championship\n\nThis prediction is not quite as straightforward as just looking at recent form. West Brom are really struggling while Norwich are flying - and beat the Baggies 5-0 on 20 January - but my old club have got so many injuries at the moment.\n\nI am still going to back Norwich here though. Philippe Clement has got the team playing really well and it was great to see Mohamed Toure hit a hat-trick on his first start for the club, against Oxford on Tuesday.\n\nClement says they showed Toure images of Erling Haaland beforehand to show how he creates space for himself, and Romelu Lukaku to see how he uses his body.\n\nI'm sure someone at Carrow Road could dig out some old VHS tapes of me in action for the Canaries if Toure needs any more inspiration. Although finding a video to play them on might be tricky.\n\nDaffy, when told Norwich are Chris Sutton's old team: You keep talking about thith Crith Thutton like I'm thupposed to care about him. Jutht for that I'm picking the Women's Basketball Association.\n\nPorky: No, Daffy it says here that WBA is West Bromwich Albion.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. What about Eatht Bromwich and North Bromwich, and Thouth Bromwich. That'th a lot of Bromwich!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-2\n\n24th in League One v 8th in Championship\n\nPort Vale are toiling at the bottom of League One. Bristol City have been a bit erratic too, but they are still only a point off the Championship play-off places.\n\nCity have got a huge game coming up at Wrexham on Tuesday, which might be a bit of a distraction for this tie, but I still see them reaching round five.\n\nDaffy: Doeth everyone in thith country have their own team? How many more are there?\n\nPorky: B-B-Bristol sounds like bristle. And pigs have bristles so...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2\n\n9th in Championship v 21st in Championship\n\nIt was absolutely unbelievable what happened when these two teams met in the league on Tuesday. Leicester were 3-0 up at half-time, but ended up losing 4-3 in the 97th minute.\n\nHow do the Foxes come back from that? I don't think they will. They will be angry, and are bound to be fired up, but you just wonder what damage it has done to their confidence and morale.\n\nLeicester had a points deduction last week which left them in big trouble at the bottom of the table and they don't have a manager at the moment - Andy King is caretaker boss and at half-time you can just imagine how he feels too.\n\nSouthampton are one of the form teams in the division, with four wins in their past five games, and I don't see Leicester getting any revenge here.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. Thouthhampton or Lie-theth-ter...\n\nPorky: It's pr-pr-pronounced \"Lester\"\n\nDaffy: What is wrong with you people? Can't you thpell?? In that cathe...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n3rd in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI was delighted for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe that his team beat Tottenham and also the reception he got from his side's fans afterwards.\n\nFor everything he has done for them, the world must have gone bonkers for their fans to be calling up 606 and saying they wanted him out.\n\nThis will be a very different test to playing Spurs, however, and I am going with my gut feeling on this one.\n\nThe two sides met recently when Villa won at St James' Park at the end of January and although Villa have slipped up a couple of times at home recently, when it clicks for them, they usually end up winning.\n\nDaffy, when told Newcastle are known as the 'Toon' by their fans, who are 'The Toon Army': You had me at Toon! Though I do like the thound of thtaying in a nithe villa.\n\nPorky: Remember Space Jam? No one can beat toons!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2 (And th-th-th-that's gonna be all folks!)\n\n6th in Premier League v 14th in Premier League\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot and Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler are both under pressure but it feels like Hurzeler has the bigger problems to solve.\n\nBrighton are on a poor run and apparently it all got a bit ugly at their home defeat by Crystal Palace on Sunday. The fans seem to have lost faith in him, and although that feels harsh to me, when it happens then it it is hard to reverse it.\n\nThe Seagulls beat Manchester United away in round three and now Hurzeler could really do with beating Liverpool away too.\n\nI wouldn't put it past them, either, especially with Liverpool struggling to see out games at the moment, but I think Slot's side will just about get over the line.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Liverpool to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Liverpool, home of The Beatleth - finally thomewhere I've heard of!\n\nPorky: Someone told me, \"if you don't know anything about foo-foo-foo-soccer, just say you support Liverpool.\"\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 4-1\n\n10th in Championship v 15th in Premier League\n\nLeeds' comeback from 2-0 down to draw at Chelsea was just extraordinary, but I can smell an upset here.\n\nI am sure Leeds boss Daniel Farke will make some changes because he will have at least half an eye on the Premier League, and their next game against Aston Villa.\n\nBirmingham are going well under Chris Davies and are unbeaten in eight games in all competitions. This seems like a good time for him to take a top-flight scalp.\n\nDaffy: I didn't know a team from Alabama could play here.\n\nPorky: I don't think it's the same one.\n\nDaffy: Birmingham all the way - woohoo!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 100-0\n\n12th in League Two v 20th in Premier League\n\nI know all about Grimsby because I was at Blundell Park for their Carabao Cup win over Manchester United earlier in the season.\n\nCould something similar happen again? Yes, definitely. There will be another cracking atmosphere and David Artell and his players will fancy another upset, I am sure of that.\n\nThis is a horrible game for Wolves, but it is an important one for their manager Rob Edwards. He needs to find a way of getting through this tie, which is something Ruben Amorim could not do with United.\n\nWolves have had a miserable season and they probably thought it couldn't get any worse - well it might.\n\nI think lightning might strike twice, and this game will end in a draw before Grimsby win the shootout, just like they did against Manchester United.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Grimsby to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Grimthby eh? Thounds grim and deprething. I'll go with the Wolves.\n\nPorky: I think they'll huff and puff and run out steam. At least I hope so.\n\n23rd in Championship v 11th in Premier League\n\nBoth of these teams got through the last round on penalties, with Oxford beating MK Dons and Sunderland overcoming Everton.\n\nI don't see Sunderland needing a shootout this time, though. Oxford are pretty woeful at the moment and have just been spanked by Norwich - they are not coming back from that.\n\nRegis le Bris will make changes but the Black Cats will still be far too strong.\n\nDaffy, when told that Sunderland are nicknamed the Black Cats - so would not get on with Tweety Pie: Birdth of a feather mutht stick together against catth!\n\nPorky: And Oxford is a place of higher ed-ed-edu-learning. So I think they'll outsmart the opposition.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n14th in Championship v 12th in Premier League\n\nStoke's boss is my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins, who is an excellent manager - he clearly learnt a lot from me - but I fancy Fulham here.\n\nI don't know what Marco Silva's situation is with Fulham and if he is leaving at the end of the season, but he will want to go out with a bang.\n\nI really like the way Silva's side play, and I wouldn't rule out the Cottagers' chances of going deep in the FA Cup this season.\n\nDaffy: I think I know which one Porky liketh here.\n\nPorky: A f-f-f-full ham? You bet!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\n1st in Premier League v 21st in League One\n\nThis is the first meeting between these two clubs since the 2014 FA Cup semi-final, when Arsenal won on penalties and Mikel Arteta scored in a shootout. The Gunners went on to beat Hull in the final.\n\nThings have changed a lot for Wigan since then, and not in a good way.\n\nThey have just sacked their manager Ryan Lowe after sliding into the League One relegation zone, and it's hard to see them forcing a shootout this time, no matter how many changes Arteta makes.\n\nArsenal have not had much joy in the FA Cup since Arteta won it again as manager in 2019-20, a few months after taking charge.\n\nThey have not been past round four since, but they are going to make it to the last 16 this time, I'm sure of it.\n\nIn fact, they have got so much strength in depth now that, while for years Arteta has not been able to win anything at all, he could feasibly win four trophies this season.\n\nIs the Quadruple on? That could be the question we are asking in the final few months of the season.\n\nDaffy: You thee, the problem with Arthenal is they just try to walk it in.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n6th in National League North v 7th in Premier League\n\nI am co-commentating on this game for 5 Live with Ali Bruce-Ball and I cannot wait.\n\nMacclesfield boss John Rooney did an incredible job with his side's historic win over Crystal Palace in round three.\n\nI watched the game back as part of my prep and, while the Silkmen had less than 29% possession, they limited Palace to very few chances and they were deserved winners.\n\nKnocking the holders out was rightly hailed as the biggest shock in the FA Cup's illustrious history, and it would be another fantastic feat if they toppled Brentford too.\n\nOnly one non-league side has ever beaten two top-flight teams in the same FA Cup campaign - Millwall in 1913-14, who overcame Chelsea and Bradford City.\n\nI'd love to think Macclesfield could do it too, and if they play like they did against Palace then they have a great chance, especially on their plastic pitch.\n\nI think Brentford will be ready for them, though, and Keith Andrews' side are having a tremendous season too.\n\nAndrews will know he can't make too many changes here, and maybe Brentford will go on an FA Cup run themselves - they have not reached the quarter-finals since 1989, so it it is long overdue.\n\nThis is going to be a tight game but I just have a feeling the Bees will edge it.\n\nDaffy: I don't underthtand thith game at all – what is a Maccle? Why are there fields of them? And why do you altho call them the Thilkmen? Jutht for that, I'm going with Brentford!\n\nPorky: B-b-Bees make honey, And honey is sweet... and so is my d-d-dear-d-d-arling Petunia.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

    "fullText": "In 1997 IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated the reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov. In 2023 ChatGPT passed the bar exam. And last year, Google DeepMind clinched gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad.\n\nThese milestones are only expected to accelerate, with some business leaders, including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, predicting artificial general intelligence—AI that is able to meet or surpass human intelligence—could arrive as early as this year. While avid sci-fi fans and business leaders are thrilled by the technology’s potential, others caution about the economic downsides.\n\nWhat early warning signs indicate AI workforce disruption?\n\nHow could AI cause a 10% white-collar job disruption?\n\nHow could corporate reskilling programs address AI unemployment?\n\nWhat industries face the greatest AI displacement risks?\n\nSalman Khan, CEO of Khan Academy and vision steward at TED—two organizations that provide free online education services for more than 200 million users globally—predicts the AI revolution will hit harder and faster than most are predicting (although the AI doomers are getting louder in early 2026). And while AI experts like Geoffrey Hinton, the British-Canadian computer scientist widely known as the “godfather of AI,” have warned the technology could trigger mass unemployment, Khan said even a 10% decrease could bring the burn.\n\n“If white-collar work were to shrink even 10%,” Khan told Fortune, “it’s going to feel like a depression.”\n\nBut Khan said to look beyond the ensuing AI encroachment on white-collar jobs triggering mass unemployment a bit—it could also cause an identity crisis among a large portion of the population. “They’ve been making upper-middle-class, affluent salaries for the last 20 years,” Khan said. “Their identity is tied to this. And now, all of a sudden, you’re going to have this mass shift in the job market.”\n\nWhile no one can say exactly how significantly AI will disrupt the labor market—if at all—recent research predicts an uptick in unemployment thanks to the technology. A 2025 MIT study found AI could replace nearly 12% of the U.S. workforce, nearly triple the current rate.\n\nPart of Khan’s concern stems from conversations he’s shared with business leaders within the tech industry. “People behind closed doors are talking about pretty bold things these days,” he said. “I’ve heard people say you could do the same work with a quarter of the team.”\n\nIt’s not just white-collar jobs that will be impacted. Khan predicts robotic automation has already set in motion a displacement among the gig economy. From Waymo to Tesla, driverless cars are popping up across the U.S. While adoption is still uneven, Khan predicts driverless cars will become the norm, potentially impacting more than 1 million rideshare drivers across the country.",

    "fullText": "But, after second day of Wall Street falls, analysts say sell-off ‘may overstate AI’s immediate risk to complex deal-making’\n\nShares in commercial property services companies have tumbled, in the latest sell-off driven by fears over disruption from artificial intelligence.\n\nAfter steep declines on Wall Street, European stocks in the sector were hit on Thursday.\n\nThe estate agent Savills’ shares fell 7.5% in London, while the serviced office provider International Workplace Group, which owns the Regus brand, lost 9%.\n\nThe UK’s two biggest property developers, British Land and Landsec, dropped 2.6% and 2.4% respectively.\n\nOn Wall Street, property service firms fell for a second consecutive day. CBRE shares plunged 12.5%, Jones Lang LaSalle lost nearly 11% and Cushman & Wakefield fell 9.1%, after even sharper declines on Wednesday.\n\nCommercial property stocks have become the latest sector to be hammered by fears over the impact of rapid advances in AI, as the sell-off spread from legal software, publishing, analytics and data companies last week to insurance firms, price comparison sites and wealth managers this week.\n\nThe share declines were sparked by AI firms such as Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude, releasing new tools, although there was limited news on Thursday, leading analysts to argue that the sell-off was overdone.\n\nAI has the potential to automate a wide range of office-based tasks and could lead to swathes of job losses. There are also concerns among investors that demand for offices could fall, in a blow to property companies.\n\nJade Rahmani, commercial real estate analyst at New York-headquartered Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said: “We believe investors are rotating out of high-fee, labour-intensive business models viewed as potentially vulnerable to AI-driven disruption.”\n\nHowever, he believes that the sell-off “may overstate the immediate risk to complex deal-making, even as the long-term AI impact remains a ‘wait-and-see’”.\n\nDallas-based CBRE on Thursday reported fourth-quarter revenue of $11.6bn (£8.5bn), up 12%, and core earnings per share of $2.73, above analysts’ estimates. In 2025, revenues rose by 13% to $40.6bn.\n\nThe real estate services firm forecast 2026 profit above Wall Street estimates, on the back of strong momentum in leasing and facilities management, as the number of datacentres rapidly expands and billions of dollars flow into AI infrastructure.\n\nCBRE’s chief executive, Bob Sulentic, believes AI will benefit the business in the long run, with its transaction and investment work “most protected” from disruption.\n\n“Clients engage CBRE to plan and execute complex transactions because of our creativity, strategic thinking, negotiating skills, deep base of market knowledge and broad relationships,” he said. “None of this seems likely to be replaced by AI in the foreseeable future.”",

    "description": "Solopreneurs like Katrina Purcell and Gigi Robinson use AI tools to optimize their content creation, boost efficiency, and enhance lead generation.",
    "fullText": "These days, content creation can feel like a full-time job. For solopreneurs running podcasts or active social channels alongside client work, maintaining a consistent presence can be hard to manage without any teammates.\n\n\"I would not be doing this level of content if I didn't have AI,\" said Katrina Purcell, Fractional COO and host of the Managed Chaos podcast. Purcell produces a weekly podcast and publishes related content across LinkedIn, Substack, and a blog on her website. AI tools like Riverside for transcripts and Gemini for content ideation and creation make it possible, she said.\n\nHere are the specific ways Purcell and two other solopreneurs have integrated AI into their processes to make content creation more seamless.\n\n\"I've never really thought of myself as a content-generating creative person,\" Purcell told Business Insider.\n\nBefore generative AI, she struggled to identify which content from her podcast would perform well on different platforms and often took the \"lazy route\" and simply published the same copy everywhere.\n\nNow, she's trained a custom Gem on Gemini to support her in creating content tailored to different platforms.\n\n\"I gave it the brand guidelines for the podcast, told it that it was adept at SEO, that it knew all the latest content trends, and then I asked it to start coming up with content based on the transcripts,\" she said. Prompts she uses include:\n\nShe'll do some light tweaks and editing, but the AI does most of the heavy lifting.\n\nRecently, she wrote a Substack post based on a podcast episode using this process, and a reader reached out to say how valuable the post was for them, and asked how long it took her. She had to admit it didn't take her long at all, thanks to AI.\n\nPurcell added that she's continually training this Gem on new information about her goals and audience, and always \"closes the content loop\" by telling it how different posts performed.\n\nFor Gigi Robinson, who's been a social media creator since college and now runs a consultancy called Hosts of Influence to help other creators with their brands, creativity was never the bottleneck — it was going from an idea to a finished post.\n\nRather than getting in her head about optimizing every aspect of a post, AI helps her get it done rather than focusing on perfection.\n\nFor instance, she's been able to create LinkedIn videos based on trending news stories quickly. She'll copy and paste parts of a trending article she likes into ChatGPT and ask it to generate specific talking points in her brand voice. From there, she can quickly ad-lib a video without needing to script something out herself. This approach helped her get over 100 million impressions on LinkedIn in just 90 days last year (confirmed from a tracking document viewed by Business Insider) and led to more inbound brand deals from LinkedIn.\n\nRobinson has also found AI video editing tools like Adobe Premiere and OpusClip valuable for a first round of edits. She and her contract interns still make nitpicky tweaks, but it takes much less time than doing everything manually.\n\n\"Before, video editing could take hours. With these tools, getting a cut of the video finalized for posting is usually done in under an hour,\" Robinson said.\n\nEsosa Edosomwan, the coach and nutrition specialist behind The Raw Girl and UMI, still prefers to keep her content creation process largely human-driven after experimenting with AI video and finding her audience doesn't respond to it.\n\nOutside of small things like using Claude to optimize social captions or Nano Banana for video thumbnails, the biggest benefit of AI has been helping her turn social media followers into customers. When she had a piece of content go viral on Instagram early last year, the flood of DMs became impossible to keep up with.\n\nFor help, she turned to the AI tool Manychat. In addition to the automations that send lead magnets — free resources in exchange for contact info — when followers message call-to-action phrases like \"workshop\" or \"hormones,\" she's trained the bot to respond to other messages with her brand and voice, keeping the conversation going.\n\n\"I have even had a couple times where friends thought it was me before realizing it was my chatbot,\" she said. \"That has really helped with inbound leads.\"",

    "fullText": "Software engineers are in the AI hot seat — and they're feeling it.\n\nFacing pressures to keep their edge and avoid layoffs, software engineers are leaning into AI coding tools to help them do more, faster. But programmers have recently sounded the alarm that the productivity gains that come from AI can come at a mental cost.\n\nSiddhant Khare, a software engineer who builds AI tools, recently struck a chord with his post about the topic, which he said \"every engineer needs to confront.\" He told Business Insider that some days he used to be able to focus on just one task, but now AI is constantly pulling him in different directions.\n\nSteve Yegge, who worked at Amazon in the early days and spent 12 years at Google, said he and his friends have even started to take naps during the day to cope with exhausting AI coding sprints. He said that companies should consider imposing a 3-hour cap on AI-assisted work.\n\nAI fatigue — which is notably different than simply being tired about hearing about AI or being pressured to use it at work — has become a hot topic among software engineers, but it can also show up in other industries.",

    "description": "The bank listed several reasons for their \"unusually high\" price targets.",
    "fullText": "Two bitcoin-mining stocks have big upside potential, Morgan Stanley analysts say, but it's not tied to a bullish outlook for cryptocurrency.\n\nRather, the companies are well-positioned to convert to data centers to help fuel the AI boom, the bank said in a February 8 client note.\n\nTeraWulf and Cipher Mining have 159% and 158% upside, respectively, said Morgan Stanley in a note initiating coverage of the stocks. Both have seen huge surges in their share price over the last 12 months, with TeraWulf rising 245% and Cipher up 183%.\n\nThe bank listed several reasons for their \"unusually high\" price targets, including:\n\nTeraWulf, in particular, \"has a significant history of building power infrastructure, and has a track record of multiple repeat Bitcoin-toDC conversion transactions with customers,\" a team of analysts led by Stephen C. Byrd said. \"In our view, the company has a viable path to significant annual growth in power and data center capacity, and we include this growth potential in both our base and bull cases.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cipher Mining \"has entered multiple agreements with data center customers, and has assembled a team with significant data center construction experience,\" the analysts said. As of Q2 2025, the firm had no AI power hosting contracts — now, it has 10 and 15 year deals with Google and Amazon, respectively.\n\nFrom June to December 2025, the equity value creation per watt for companies like TeraWulf and Cipher Mining rose from about $7 to $18, signalling strong demand for power.\n\nDespite Morgan Stanley's big upside targets, the bank said there are risks to its outlook. One is that the firms aren't able to execute properly on their conversion to data centers.\n\n\"These data center projects are very large relative to the overall size of the Bitcoin companies, and execution risks could result in project delays and cost overruns,\" the analysts said. \"This, in turn, could result in greater volumes of equity capital to fund these data center projects, which can cause unexpected dilution and financing challenges.\"\n\nAnother is that hyperscalers could start to pull back on AI spending. Investors have grown nervous about AI capex in recent months, as they continue to look for clues about how the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual investments will pay off.\n\n\"We view a slowdown in AI spend as the largest single risk, though the updates from hyperscalers this past week suggest the risk to AI infrastructure capex is to the upside, not to the downside,\" the note said. \"Though the AI infrastructure industry remains under-supplied with power, it is possible that key AI players could moderate their data center capex for any number of reasons.\"",

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which recently entered a bear market and endured brutal selling last week, dropped another 3%.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around 12:30 pm ET on Thursday:\n\nThe market's steepest losses were concentrated in the tech sector, particularly among software and memory stocks. Here were some of the notable moves:\n\nThe continued selling pressure is a sign that investors' concerns about AI haven't ebbed despite a relief rally in tech at the start of this week. Software stocks took a beating last week as traders assessed the threat posed by AI and remained cognizant of high valuations in the broader tech landscape.\n\nA trio of AI-exposed sectors tumbled this week, with shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms dropping on fresh worries about AI disruption.\n\nInvestors are also likely reacting to recent softness in the economic data, according to Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers. He pointed to how most sectors in the economy were losing jobs, despite the US overall adding more payrolls than expected in January.\n\nInvestors are also keyed into the earnings potential of AI and are beginning to be more selective about the companies they invest in, he added.\n\n\"You have dwindling AI hopes coinciding with lackluster economic reports,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Software/services are being repriced as agentic AI pressures pricing power,\" Rosenberg Research wrote in a client note on Thursday, pointing to uncertainty around future cash flows among large tech firms. \"The sustainability of the accelerating investment cycle and the ultimate beneficiaries of the growth story remain highly uncertain,\" the firm added.",

    "title": "Apple's Big AI Siri Plans Are Once Again Delayed",
    "description": "The new Siri was supposed to launch with iOS 26.4.",
    "fullText": "If you're an Apple fan who closely follows tech news, you might have been looking forward to Siri's big AI overhaul for some time now—specifically, since the company initially announced it at WWDC 2024. But despite delay after delay, rumors have strongly suggested that the next generation of Siri is set to launch with iOS 26.4. And seeing as Apple just released iOS 26.3 this week, AI Siri is closer than ever, right? Wrong.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has once again kicked Siri's big updates down the road. According to Gurman, the company really did intend to release AI Siri with iOS 26.4, which is reportedly planned to release sometime in March. However, due to testing \"snags,\" the company is instead planning to break up Siri's major updates and distribute them across several iOS updates. Gurman notes that likely means iOS 26.5, which could launch in May, and iOS 27, which will likely release in September, if it follows Apple's usual release dates. But looking at Apple's track record here, don't hold your breath.\n\nAccording to Gurman's sources, Apple is struggling to get Siri to \"properly process queries,\" or to actually respond fast enough, both of which would defeat the purpose of using a smart assistant. Apple is reportedly pushing engineers to use iOS 26.5 to test these features, particularly the ability for Siri to use your personal data to answer questions. Users may be able to flip a switch in Settings to \"preview\" these features, and may treat the rollout as a beta.\n\nEngineers are also struggling to get Siri's app intents to work, or the feature that lets Siri take actions on your behalf. You could ask Siri to open an image, edit it, then share it with a friend, but only if the feature itself actually works. This, too, may roll out with iOS 26.5, but it's unclear due to reliability issues. Siri is also cutting off user prompts too soon, and sometimes taps into ChatGPT instead of using Apple's underlying tech—which would look pretty bad for the company.\n\nApple is also testing new AI features for iOS 26.5 that we haven't heard of yet. One is a new web search tool that functions like other AI search features from companies like Perplexity and Google. You ask a question to search on the web, and it returns a report with summaries and links. The other new feature is a custom image generation tool, that builds on Image Playground, but that too is hitting development hurdles.\n\nLooking even further ahead, Apple is planning more Siri advancements—namely, giving the assistant chatbot features, à la ChatGPT. (That said, it will reportedly use Gemini to power these features.) This version of Siri may even have its own app.\n\nIt seems Siri really is Apple's albatross. Despite arguably popularizing smart assistants for the general population, Siri quickly fell behind compared to the likes of Alexa and Gemini (née Google Assistant). Now, the latter have fully embraced modern generative AI, offering features like contextual awareness and natural language commands. While Amazon and Google users can ask their assistants increasingly complicated questions, Siri still feels designed mostly to handle setting alarms and checking the weather.\n\nThat was going to change with iOS 18, alongside Apple Intelligence as a whole. Apple's initial pitch for AI Siri was an assistant that could see what's on your phone to better understand questions you ask, and take actions on your behalf—i.e., app intents. You could ask Siri to edit an image you have pulled up on your Photos app, and because the assistant is contextually aware, it would know what image you mean, and apply the edits you ask for. Or, you could ask when your friend was set to arrive, and the assistant would be able to scan messages and emails to know that, one, your friend is visiting town this weekend, and two, that they sent you their flight itinerary that gets them into the airport at 3:55 p.m.\n\nThis Siri has never launched, however. While the company has rolled out iterative updates to Siri with some AI-powered features, its overhaul with these ambitious features have been a trial for Apple's AI team. It all stems from Apple's issues with AI in general: The company was caught off guard by the generative AI wave kicked off in late 2022 by OpenAI's ChatGPT, and following some resistance from corporate leadership, have been scrambling to keep up ever since. Apple Intelligence launched half-baked with issues of its own, but rather than launch a half-baked AI Siri, the company has been struggling to build up the assistant internally.\n\nPart of the problem is privacy-\n\nApple is the second most valuable tech company in the world, but a host of factors—including with software, hardware, and leadership—have made it so even Apple can't magically produce an AI assistant. Though, I'm not sold that an AI Siri will move units for Apple in the first place. I can't imagine Gemini moves people to Android, and you can download ChatGPT on any device you own. It's even now built into your iPhone.",

    "title": "AI Chatbots Are Even Worse at Giving Medical Advice Than We Thought",
    "description": "Even when they have the “right” information, they can lead you astray.",
    "fullText": "It’s tempting to think that an LLM chatbot can answer any question you pose it, including those about your health. After all, chatbots have been trained on plenty of medical information, and can regurgitate it if given the right prompts. But that doesn’t mean they will give you accurate medical advice, and a new study shows how easily AI’s supposed expertise breaks down. In short, they are even worse at it than I thought.\n\nIn the study, researchers first quizzed several chatbots about medical information. In these carefully conducted tests, ChatGPT-4o, Llama 3, and Command R+ correctly diagnosed medical scenarios an impressive 94% of the time—though they were able to recommend the right treatment a much less impressive 56% of the time.\n\nBut that wasn’t a real-world test for the chatbots medical utility.\n\nThe researchers then gave medical scenarios to 1,298 people, and asked them to use an LLM to figure out what might be going on in that scenario, plus what they should do about it (for example, whether they should call an ambulance, follow up with their doctor when convenient, or take care of the issue on their own).\n\nThe participants were recruited through an online platform that reported it verifies that research subjects are real humans and not bots themselves. Some participants were in a control group that was told to research the scenario on their own, and not using any AI tools. In the end, the no-AI control group did far better than the LLM-using group in correctly identifying medical conditions, including most serious “red flag” scenarios.\n\nAs the researchers write, “Strong performance from the LLMs operating alone is not sufficient for strong performance with users.” Plenty of previous research has shown that chatbot output is sensitive to the exact phrasing people use when asking questions, and that chatbots seem to prioritize pleasing a user over giving correct information.\n\nEven if an LLM bot can correctly answer an objectively phrased question, that doesn’t mean it will give you good advice when you need it. That’s why it doesn’t really matter that ChatGPT can “pass” a modified medical licensing exam—success at answering formulaic multiple choice questions is not the same thing as telling you when you need to go to the hospital.\n\nThe researchers analyzed chat logs to figure out where things broke down. Here are some of the issues they identified:\n\nThe users didn’t always give the bot all of the relevant information. As non-experts, the users certainly didn’t know what was most important to include. If you’ve been to a doctor about anything potentially serious, you know they’ll pepper you with questions to be sure you aren’t leaving out something important. The bots don’t necessarily do that.\n\nThe bots “generated several types of misleading and incorrect information.” Sometimes they ignored important details to narrow in on something else; sometimes they recommended calling an emergency number but gave the wrong one (such as an Australian emergency number for U.K. users).\n\nResponses could be drastically different for similar prompts. In one example, two users gave nearly identical messages about a subarachnoid hemorrhage. One response told the user to seek emergency care; the other said to lie down in a dark room.\n\nPeople varied in how they conversed with the chatbot. For example, some asked specific questions to constrain the bot’s answers, but some let the bot take the lead. Either method could introduce unreliability into the LLM's output.\n\nCorrect answers were often grouped with incorrect answers. On average, each LLM gave 2.21 answers for the user to choose from. People understandably did not always choose correctly from those options.\n\nOverall, people who didn't use LLMs were 1.76 times more likely to get the right diagnosis. (Both groups were similarly likely to figure out the right course of action, but that's not saying much—on average, they only got it right about 43% of the time.) The researchers described the control group as doing \"significantly better\" at the task. And this may represent a best-case scenario: the researchers point out that they provided clear examples of common conditions, and LLMs would likely do worse with rare conditions or more complicated medical scenarios. They conclude: “Despite strong performance from the LLMs alone, both on existing benchmarks and on our scenarios, medical expertise was insufficient for effective patient care.”\n\nPatients may not know how to talk to an LLM, or how to vet its output, but surely doctors would fare better, right? Unfortunately, people in the medical field are also using AI chatbots for medical information in ways that create risks to patient care.\n\nECRI, a medical safety nonprofit, put the misuse of AI chatbots in the number one spot on its list of health technology hazards of 2026. While the AI hype machine is trying to convince you to give ChatGPT your medical information, ECRI correctly points out that it’s wrong to think of these chatbots as having human personalities or cognition: “While these models produce humanlike responses, they do so by predicting the next word based on large datasets, not through genuine comprehension of the information.”\n\nECRI reports that physicians are, in fact, using generative AI tools for patient care, and that research has already shown the serious risks involved. Using LLMs does not improve doctors’ clinical reasoning. LLMs will elaborate confidently on incorrect details included in prompts. Google’s Med-Gemini model, created for medical use, made up a nonexistent body part whose name was a mashup of two unrelated real body parts; Google told a Verge reporter that the mistake was a “typo.”  ECRI argues that “because LLM responses often sound authoritative, the risk exists that clinicians may subconsciously factor AI-generated suggestions into their judgments without critical review.”\n\nEven in situations that don’t seem like life-and-death cases, consulting a chatbot can cause harm. ECRI asked four LLMs to recommend brands of gel that could be used with a certain ultrasound device on a patient with an indwelling catheter near the area being scanned. It’s important to use a sterile gel in this situation, because of the risk of infection. Only one of the four chatbots identified this issue and made appropriate suggestions; the others just recommended regular ultrasound gels. In other cases, ECRI’s tests resulted in chatbots giving unsafe advice on electrode placement and isolation gowns.\n\nClearly, LLM chatbots are not ready to be trusted to keep people safe when seeking medical care, whether you’re the person who needs care, the doctor treating them, or even the staffer ordering supplies. But the services are already out there, being widely used and aggressively promoted. (Their makers are even fighting in the Super Bowl ads.) There’s no good way to be sure these chatbots aren’t involved in your care, but at the very least we can stick with good old Dr. Google—just make sure to disable AI-powered search results.",
