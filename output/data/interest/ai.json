    "description": ": A full-featured, Sixel-capable terminal browser for those who’d rather skip AI assistants",
    "fullText": "Old-time web users will fondly remember Lynx, a text-only browser that ran from the terminal. Now, there's a Sixel-compatible web browser that runs completely from the terminal, and has all the graphics and modern features you'd expect.\n\nPublished on Codeberg over the holiday break by a developer going by janantos, brow6el runs entirely within terminal emulators that support the Sixel graphics format.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Sixel, it's a bitmap graphics format designed for terminals and printers that encodes bitmap data into terminal escape sequences, with each printable character representing a 6-pixel-high, 1-pixel-wide column. Tile enough of them together and you've got full-color images, and even animation. In brow6el's case, it uses the libsixel package to generate graphics.\n\nThis minimalist in-terminal browser isn't just able to display fully rendered web pages thanks to the Chromium Embedded Framework, as demonstrated in a video included in the Codeberg repository. It also supports full mouse input, bookmarks, a download manager, private and normal browsing modes, HTML5/CSS/JavaScript support via Chromium, a page inspection mode, JavaScript console, popup handling, a pre-installed ad blocker - basically the works, all running inside a terminal with graphics good enough that it looks like your typical corporate, AI-ified browser.\n\nGraphics are regularly re-rendered to keep the page up to date, and it also supports multiple instances, so no need to constrain yourself to a single terminal window while browsing the web. For those who want to go full terminal, brow6el also includes \"Vim-like navigation with single key commands,\" according to its developer. There's even mouse emulation that lets users move a cursor around the screen using the H, J, K, and L keys instead of using an actual pointing device.\n\nThe addition of unwanted AI features to web browsers has become as inevitable as the rising of the sun over the past year, with Google, Microsoft, and even Firefox falling over themselves to stick as much automation into their browsers as users will let them get away with.\n\nIn other cases, companies like OpenAI and Perplexity have even launched their own AI-first browsers that, predictably, have been cybersecurity and privacy nightmares.\n\nAI-powered web browsers are such a serious risk that Gartner warned organizations to block any and all web browsers with so much as an AI sidebar in them for fear that the companies running the models powering them would \"accidentally\" slurp up confidential information.\n\nAs full-featured as it is, brow6el might not be an end-all, be-all alternative to less secure and AI-bloated browsers, however.\n\n\"This is POC code quality,\" its developer warned, suggesting your mileage may vary if you try to run it on your own Linux-based system.\n\n\"It is known it doesn't work with localized keyboards, it lacks support for accented characters for input,\" its maker noted as one such limitation.\n\nStill, in an era when you can't trust your browser not to hand over corporate or sensitive personal data to an LLM to be ingested for training purposes, dealing with a few code errors might be worth it if you have the skill to address them and contribute to the project. ®",

    "fullText": "AI is starting to transform Hollywood, whether filmmakers and audiences are ready or not.\n\nIn one of the most significant AI deals of 2025, Disney and OpenAI in December struck a three-year licensing agreement where Disney would become \"the first major content licensing partner on Sora\" and invest $1 billion into the AI pioneer. It was a striking peacemaking between legacy Hollywood and an AI giant, which had just months earlier clashed over OpenAI's use of copyrighted characters and work.\n\nElsewhere, AI startups have been raising millions of dollars from venture capital firms on the promise of changing the legacy Hollywood film and TV business.\n\nThe tools they are building are being used across the production cycle. Some, like Moonvalley, are enhancing special effects. Others are promising to help with marketing, content distribution, and content discovery.\n\nIt's a challenging time for Hollywood. Budgets generally aren't what they used to be, and studios know they need to do what they can to make projects faster and cheaper. Enter AI.\n\nNetflix and Amazon have talked about how they're using AI to pull off elaborate special effects and improve the viewing experience. Lionsgate is partnering with startup Runway to train an AI model on its library. Others in Hollywood are using AI but not talking about it.\n\nAt the same time, many are worried about tech giants using AI to appropriate their IP. Studios have taken issue with OpenAI's Sora generating videos that encroach on their copyrighted characters. Disney and Universal sued Midjourney, accusing it of using tech to rip off Star Wars, Minions, and more.\n\nStudios must also be sensitive to talent's fears of being supplanted by AI as well as audiences' attitudes. A YouGov survey in early October found viewers were mixed on the use of AI. People were most accepting of AI being used to translate subtitles into other languages (64% for), but least accepting of the idea of AI characters replacing human actors (65% against).\n\nHow are AI founders pitching investors and Hollywood insiders on their vision of the future?\n\nBusiness Insider has interviewed the founders of startups behind tools to disrupt traditional TV and filmmaking. They shared the pitch decks they used to raise capital.",

    "description": "Xi Jinping said AI models and breakthroughs in local chip development have boosted China \"in a race to the top.\"",
    "fullText": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping is pleased with his country's showing in the race for AI dominance.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address on Wednesday, the Chinese leader lauded his country's tech and AI advancements in 2025, saying that China \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" Xi said in the speech made in Beijing.\n\nHe added, \"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities.\"\n\nApart from developments in AI, Xi also highlighted China's Tianwen-2 asteroid sampling mission and its latest electromagnetic catapult system-equipped aircraft carrier.\n\nHe talked about China breaking ground on the construction of the world's largest dam in Tibetan territory, and its progress in developing humanoid robots and drones.\n\nXi's end-of-year 2025 comments follow a strong year for the country, which saw it compete neck and neck with the US on AI advancements.\n\nThe year started with China's Deepseek AI startup releasing its R1 AI model in January, which rivalled OpenAI's o1 and sent US tech stocks plunging. Nvidia, a major player in AI hardware, saw its stock drop by more than 17% on January 27, erasing billions from its value.\n\nThe US's ban on exporting advanced AI chips has given a boost to China's homegrown chip producers, propelling their founders, such as MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai's cofounder Chen Weiliang, into the billionaire ranks.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump granted Nvidia a win in December, permitting it to sell its H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China.\n\nAnd Meta announced on Wednesday that it would acquire China-founded AI startup Manus in a deal reported to be worth more than $2 billion, making it one of the US tech's biggest acquisitions of an Asian AI company.\n\nInvestors are taking note: Jason Draho, a UBS wealth management executive, told Business Insider in November that investors should consider AI stocks in China as a way to counterbalance US tech stocks.",

    "title": "China's DeepSeek kicked off 2026 with a new AI training method that analysts say is a 'breakthrough' for scaling",
    "description": "DeepSeek has released a new AI training method that analysts say is a \"breakthrough\" for scaling large language models.",
    "fullText": "DeepSeek got the year rolling with a new idea for training AI. And analysts say it could have a massive impact on the industry.\n\nThe Chinese AI startup published a research paper on Wednesday, describing a method to train large language models that could shape \"the evolution of foundational models,\" it said.\n\nThe paper, co-authored by its founder Liang Wenfeng, introduces what DeepSeek calls \"Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections,\" or mHC, a training approach designed to scale models without them becoming unstable or breaking altogether.\n\nAs language models grow, researchers often try to improve performance by allowing different parts of a model to share more information internally. However, this increases the risk of the information becoming unstable, the paper said.\n\nDeepSeek's latest research enables models to share richer internal communication in a constrained manner, preserving training stability and computational efficiency even as models scale, it added.\n\nWei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider on Friday that the approach is a \"striking breakthrough.\"\n\nDeepSeek combined various techniques to minimize the extra cost of training a model, Sun said. She added that even with a slight increase in cost, the new training method could yield much higher performance.\n\nSun said the paper reads as a statement of DeepSeek's internal capabilities. By redesigning the training stack end-to-end, the company is signaling that it can pair \"rapid experimentation with highly unconventional research ideas.\"\n\nDeepseek can \"once again, bypass compute bottlenecks and unlock leaps in intelligence,\" she said, referring to its \"Sputnik moment\" in January 2025, when the company unveiled its R1 reasoning model.\n\nThe launch shook the tech industry and the US stock market, showing that the R1 model could match top competitors, such as ChatGPT's o1, at a fraction of the cost.\n\nLian Jye Su, the chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research and consulting firm, told Business Insider on Friday that the published research could have a ripple effect across the industry, with rival AI labs developing their own versions of the approach.\n\n\"The willingness to share important findings with the industry while continuing to deliver unique value through new models showcases a newfound confidence in the Chinese AI industry,\" Su said of DeepSeek's paper. Openness is embraced as \"a strategic advantage and key differentiator,\" he added.\n\nThe paper comes as DeepSeek is reportedly working toward the release of its next flagship model R2, following an earlier postponement.\n\nR2, which had been expected in mid-2025, was delayed after Liang expressed dissatisfaction with the model's performance, according to a June report by The Information. The report said the launch was also complicated by shortages of advanced AI chips, a constraint that has increasingly shaped how Chinese labs train and deploy frontier models.\n\nWhile the paper does not mention R2, its timing has raised eyebrows. DeepSeek previously published foundational training research ahead of its R1 model launch.\n\nSu said DeepSeek's track record suggests the new architecture will \"definitely be implemented in their new model.\"\n\nSun, on the other hand, is more cautious. \"There is most likely no standalone R2 coming,\" Sun said. Since DeepSeek has already integrated earlier R1 updates in its V3 model, the technique could form the backbone of DeepSeek's V4 model, she added.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in June that DeepSeek's updates to its R1 model failed to generate much traction in the tech industry. Barr argued that distribution matters, and DeepSeek still lacks the broad reach enjoyed by leading AI labs — such as OpenAI and Google — particularly in Western markets.",

    "title": "We tried 4 AI matchmaking apps. We're still single.",
    "description": "We tried four AI matchmakers, including Amata, Sitch, and Three Day Rule, and went on the dates they arranged. Let's talk about it.",
    "fullText": "Did AI matchmakers put an end to our single eras?\n\nSpoiler alert: No. But we gave them a shot.\n\nWe tried four AI matchmaking apps to see if any would deliver the loves of our lives. We spent weeks messaging with chatbot matchmakers, voting yay or nay on selected profiles, and even going on some dates.\n\nThe pools varied in size, from giants like Facebook Dating (with its 21 million users) to smaller startups like Sitch, Amata, and Three Day Rule. Sitch and Amata both have raised millions of dollars to build a new style of dating app where, instead of swiping through profiles, you get paired with an AI matchmaker — a chatbot — who brings you new matches.\n\nThe apps also tout focus on dating with more intention.\n\n\"We don't want people who are not emotionally available, who are on dating apps just for their ego boost,\" Amata founder Ludovic Huraux previously told Business Insider.\n\nOur big takeaway: They're still dating apps. There are helpful features, such as slowing down the swiping process or taking over date planning. However, they don't stop the fatigue that has affected stalwarts like Hinge and Tinder.\n\nLet's talk about how it went down.\n\nSydney Bradley: The first test: Henry, did you go on any dates?\n\nHenry Chandonnet: I did! I got drinks with a guy I matched with on Amata. Beyond that, it was slim pickings. Sitch offered me a bunch of profiles it thought I'd be compatible with, but never made any matches. Maybe I was too picky — there were a lot of finance bros. Three Day Rule didn't even offer any matches (rude), and Facebook kept recommending me people who were too far away.\n\nSydney: I tried the same apps, and similarly, didn't get too far. Facebook's AI \"dating assistant\" delivered me some potential people, but I didn't get any standout recommendations from its almost weekly messages. Definitely not enough to warrant a full night of my time. Three Day Rule did come back to me with a couple of people in the weeks I tested it out, but nothing that led to a date.\n\nI did end up going on dates from both Sitch and Amata, though. I've been using Sitch for several months now, and recently went on my first date from the app after paying $90 for three \"set-ups.\" One thing that Amata especially has going for it is that the app plans the date for you and requires you to pay $25 to commit to a date beforehand.\n\nThese are all pretty early-stage apps and features — even Facebook's AI dating tools only launched a few weeks ago.\n\nSydney: What are your thoughts on the tech of it all?\n\nHenry: Excluding Amata (which actually worked!), Sitch was my favorite. The UX was great, and the chatbot was friendly. But the cost is so high that it's no wonder I didn't get any set-ups. Who's paying that?\n\nFacebook Dating was my least favorite by far. I don't love the idea of being able to search for my perfect boyfriend. Like, it shouldn't be this easy! I shouldn't be able to type in \"guy who lives in Park Slope, makes over $100k, and likes reading and old movies\" and be able to find him. Of course, I couldn't — the matches never seemed to fit the searches. (If you fit that description, DM me.)\n\nSydney: My main takeaway: AI can't fix me. Dating is WORK. I'm still feeling dating app burnout, and messaging a bot instead of swiping didn't really change all that much for me.\n\nI ended up having to cancel one Amata date because I truly didn't have the time to fit it into my schedule (there goes my potential soulmate and $25).\n\nThe idea of AI taking over the heavy lifting of sifting through the seemingly endless options of people to date is nice, but it's not so clear to me if the apps are radically different, or rather, a slowed-down version of swiping wrapped up in AI.\n\nHenry: I get that. I'm not sure these apps fix the dating app fatigue that we've all been feeling. I know it well: I'm on four apps, and for the last year have gone through bouts of deleting and redownloading. These apps seemed to add to the burden, rather than take away — another thing to check before bed.\n\nThat is what I liked about Amata, though. Messaging is always the worst part of Tinder or Hinge; I could swipe all day, but I don't want to have to think up witty responses. Amata didn't even let me do that. It planned the date, the time, and made a reservation for us. I could only message my match within two hours of the date. It made it easier to say \"yes.\"\n\nSydney: That's something the founder of Amata, Ludovic Huraux, emphasized when I interviewed him recently — it's the app's goal to get people on dates, instead of messaging. Other dating apps have also dabbled in the actual date-planning of it all, such as Breeze.\n\nOn Amata — as well as Sitch and Three Day Rule — you don't design your profile in the same way you might on other dating apps. The LLMs you talk to (who, by the way, ask a lot of personal questions) write that for you. Do I trust what they're telling other people about me? Maybe. But it's a different experience from toiling over what to answer in dating app prompts.\n\nHenry: It also eliminated what I find to be the most challenging part: writing a bio. I hate all my Hinge prompt answers. Always have, always will.\n\nHenry: What did you think about the matching process?\n\nSydney: The way that the app lets you know there's a potential somebody out there for you is attention-grabbing by teasing that it may have found someone to meet. Then, once they present you with the profile (which includes photos and a brief bio written by the AI), you respond yay or nay.\n\nOne thing that's useful (only if the other person has provided relevant information) is that you can ask follow-up questions, such as \"Do they have a dog?\" Or \"What kind of music do they listen to?\" One aspect that I found interesting, though, is how the bot will ask you why you said no to someone, which isn't something you typically think about when swiping through stacks of profiles. But answering those questions … can be jarring. It makes you think!\n\nHenry: I don't want to tell Amata that I said no because he had bad taste in music!\n\nI also found it funny that we had to select characters for our matchmakers. I chose a brunette with bushy eyebrows and a beard as my Amata AI. The illusion that I'm talking to someone about the matches felt a bit odd. ChatGPT doesn't need a human face to get me talking. But I liked the messaging interface, because it slowed me down. I actually took some time to consider my matches, rather than quickly swiping past them based on looks.\n\nSydney: Mine had some sass. If I said no to someone, it would respond with an AI-generated image of a woman (who, by the way, looked a little like Scarlett Johansen) saying \"Ouch!\"\n\nHenry: They were so funny. Mine gave me an image of a man dressed up as Sherlock Holmes saying, \"Keep searching.\"\n\nSydney: I got scolded by my AI matchmaker for missing the window to agree to a date it set up for me.\n\n\"Going forward, if you fail to set up a date again when you have an intro, I'll need to pause presenting people to you for seven days unfortunately,\" the AI wrote me. \"Because we want to avoid disappointing them if they can't get a real date with you.\"\n\nHenry: That's so menacing! I get it, though… those are $25 dates. Which makes me wonder: outside this experiment — a.k.a. an expensed experiment — would you ever actually pay for an app like this?\n\nSydney: Well, thankfully, people do get refunds if you get canceled on by someone like … me. But I've paid for other apps like Raya before, which cost $30 a month, and I actually paid to join Sitch long before this story assignment, so I guess my answer is: Yes.\n\nHenry: I've also paid for Raya, but that feels different to me. You're paying for the (ostensibly) exclusive club of (ostensibly) better singles. The Amata pool was open-access like Hinge or Tinder — it just had a new way of connecting you within the pool. I'm not sure I'd pay for that.\n\nHenry: Anyways, how was the date?\n\nSydney: That's obviously what everyone is here to know! The date was nice — Amata scheduled it at a brewery, where we ordered drinks and hot dogs. I'm not too much of a beer gal, but the conversation was fun. We haven't set up another time to see each other again, but time will tell. Where did Amata send you off to?\n\nHenry: We met at Bar Belly, a classic Lower East Side bar with really uncomfortable stools. I had to go up to the hostess and say, \"Hi, I'm here with Amata.\" That was embarrassing. The date was fine, but we haven't set up a second. My lips are sealed, other than that. I promised my date I wouldn't go into too much detail.\n\nSydney: Did your Amata ask how the date went? Hinge has asked me if I've met up with someone before, but Amata asked how I would describe the guy's personality and if we had any next steps planned. The day-after follow-up felt a little like how a friend might text you asking how your date went.\n\nHenry: Mine asked me, too. I ghosted — something even AI can't take away from me.",

    "fullText": "Another year, another slate of potential AI breakthroughs.\n\nFour partners at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz debated what 2026 might bring to the AI world on an episode of the company's podcast that aired December 29, 2025. They focused on some of the biggest consumer LLMs. including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Cursor, Perplexity, and Grok.\n\nHere's what they think this year might bring to the AI race.\n\nGemini 3's video and image models might give it a significant leg up over ChatGPT, Justine Moore, an investment partner, said, since there's \"always nearly infinite demand\" for those capabilities among both professional and everyday users.\n\n\"So many new viral trends are created around new capabilities of the best-in-class image and video models,\" she said.\n\nThat can drive users to new products, Moore added. If Gemini keeps up the momentum, it could overcome the challenge of ChatGPT's name recognition.\n\n\"What happens when you can put a video in and get images out that are related to or the next iteration of the video? Or you can put a video in and a text prompt about what you want to edit, and get the edited video out?\" she said.\n\nThe changes could also have a big impact on the design world, which often includes combining text and images in creative ways.\n\nWhether ChatGPT's internal version of the app store is successful could be its \"defining question for the next year,\" Olivia Moore, one of the partners, said. At launch, app partners included Spotify and Zillow, among others.\n\nThe model's software development kit, which lets developers build their own apps for ChatGPT, could be crucial for both consumer and enterprise use, Anish Acharya, another partner, said. Combined, these features will allow ChatGPT to work more like an app store.\n\nIf startups want to succeed, they might want to steer clear of text-in, text-out models, since existing models are so dominant.\n\n\"You have to be creative around, what is the angle that you can go steal people away from?\" said Bryan Kim, a partner.\n\nOlivia Moore said there are early signs that the world of LLM assistants might be trending toward \"winner take all, or at least winner take most.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the sheer number of users, ChatGPT has a sizable lead over its competitors, with between 800 and 900 million weekly active users. Moore said that Google's Gemini reached around 35% of that scale on the web and around 40% on mobile devices. The other models come in at between 8 and 10%, she said.\n\nMoore also said later in the episode that ChatGPT Enterprise, which businesses can use, could spur growth. Weekly messages in ChatGPT Enterprise increased by around eightfold in 2025, OpenAI said.\n\n\"If we're entering a world now where people have to use ChatGPT for their company or as part of their work, that could really translate into consumer usage,\" she said.\n\nYet if the past few months are any indication, Moore said \"things are changing very quickly,\" and Gemini is growing desktop users at a faster rate than ChatGPT. Other LLMs, like Claude, are offering capabilities that cater to specialized consumers, like the uber-technical.",

    "description": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is warning about an AI bubble. Some other lawmakers aren't sure if they see one yet.",
    "fullText": "Are we in the middle of an AI bubble? Ask a lawmaker, and they probably won't have a definitive take for you.\n\n\"If I knew that, I'd be in a different line of work,\" Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents much of Silicon Valley, told Business Insider in November.\n\nThe AI bubble debate has been raging in the tech world since August, when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that investors had grown \"overexcited\" about the technology.\n\nThere are also concerns about circular spending patterns among tech companies investing in AI technology, and fears that companies won't be able to recoup the billions of dollars they're spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. Bill Gates has explicitly compared it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.\n\nThose concerns have made their way to Wall Street, with stock prices of major tech companies beginning to wobble.\n\nHowever, many in the tech world remain confident that there's no bubble, citing continued high demand for AI products.\n\n\"Are we in an AI bubble? I have no idea,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told Business Insider in November. \"Even the AI people don't know.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that while she was unsure whether there's a bubble, she's concerned by \"how much of the economic activity in the stock market and across the country is driven by this one sector.\"\n\n\"If it is overvalued, when that bubble pops, it's going to be felt everywhere,\" Warren said. \"The concentration makes the economy far more vulnerable than it otherwise would be.\"\n\nOne of the few lawmakers who's been outspoken about the potential for a bubble is Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who said at a hearing in November that we may be in a \"massive economic bubble\" that could pose \"2008-style threats to economic stability.\"\n\n\"Should this bubble pop, we should not be entertaining a bailout,\" Ocasio-Cortez added. \"We should not entertain a bailout of these corporations, as healthcare is being denied to everyday Americans, as SNAP and food assistance is being denied to everyday Americans, precipitating some of the very mental crises that people are turning to AI chatbots to try to resolve in themselves.\"\n\nThe debate began making its way to Capitol Hill as the Trump administration and some Republicans in Congress look for ways to make it easier for the AI industry to do business.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, when asked, has largely shrugged off questions about whether he's worried about a bubble.\n\n\"I guess. I worry about everything,\" Trump said in an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\" earlier this month. \"I hope it's gonna be very good. But if it's not so good, we're protected.\"\n\nTrump signed an executive order in December aiming at restricting the ability of states to regulate AI, tasking the Department of Justice with suing states that have \"onerous\" AI laws on the books.\n\nThat executive order is likely to see legal challenges, and it's ultimately less strong than a law passed by Congress would have been. But Republicans have been at odds with one another over the policy, beginning over the summer as Congress considered the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThat bill originally included a provision that would have blocked states from enacting some regulations on AI for 10 years. It was strongly supported by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee who's positioned himself as an ally of the AI industry on Capitol Hill. It was later stripped out of the megabill in a 99-1 vote.\n\nWhen asked last week whether he sees a bubble in the AI industry, Cruz was circumspect.\n\n\"Will there be uncertainty? Will there be economic challenges? Of course,\" Cruz told Business Insider. \"But for technology of this magnitude, it's in our interest that America win the race, and not China.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez argued that there's a connection between the potential bubble and financial incentives to make AI technology more exploitative.\n\n\"People's deepest fears, secrets, emotional content, relationships can all be mined for this empty promise that we're getting from these companies to turn a profit,\" Ocasio-Cortez said at the November hearing.\n\nOther lawmakers have also raised concerns. In November, Democratic Rep. Bill Foster of Illinois led a group of 21 lawmakers on a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asking his agency to evaluate the risks of AI investment in light of concerns about a bubble.\n\nBut for some of those who want to see stronger regulation of AI, the question of a bubble is largely beside the point.\n\n\"Bubble, no bubble, whatever,\" Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said. \"We need to focus on the effect on working people.\"",

    "description": "Emrick Donadei said participating in a hackathon gave him hands-on experience and expanded his network at Google.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Emrick Donadei, a 32-year-old software engineer at Google, based in New York. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started at Google a few years ago, my role was completely unrelated to AI.\n\nWhen ChatGPT came out, Google started to focus more on LLMs and opened up more opportunities in the company to switch roles. Similar to others, I became more interested in exploring area.\n\nA few months ago, I switched to an AI role. Now I'm a software engineer working on AI safety. Fundamentally, it's similar to my last role, but instead of building software, I'm building LLMs, which requires data, training, and compute.\n\nInitially, I didn't think I could get a role working in AI. I didn't have the right credentials and when I spoke with other teams, I felt a disconnect because I hadn't even touched the products, let alone experimented with creating them.\n\nI was able to transition because I was at the right company at a time when demand was high — but also because I decided to participate in a hackathon. I think hackathons are the best way for everybody to get into AI.\n\nI'm completely switching my career and that's all because the hackathon forced me to get my foot in the door.\n\nI participated in hackathons orchestrated by Amazon in 2018 and 2019, which I won, and I grew a lot from it. When I saw an opportunity to compete with some of the most brilliant minds in the industry on the hottest topic in the industry, it felt like the perfect mix to both learn a lot and possibly redefine my career.\n\nI participated in Google's annual employee-only hackathon in 2024, which lasted seven days. During that time, I worked to create a new product and then do a demo of it at the end. I learned how to use the tools and started to understand the bottlenecks and gaps. It also taught me to understand more about the fundamental knowledge of AI, like how to build infrastructure for LLMs, how to create the algorithms to create agentic workflows — the things that are less sexy.\n\nI didn't do anything revolutionary. I built a small prototype that wasn't super useful — but it was a good way to get started. I experimented with concepts like creating agents and fine-tuning models.\n\nThe hackathon was a really good way to show myself that I could create something that I wasn't familiar with, and I ended up doing a second one in 2025, which unlocked even more opportunities. For example, I was able to publish a public technical disclosure with Google as a follow-up to my work in the second hackathon.\n\nI saw some colleagues transition to AI teams after the hackathon, but the vast majority didn't. You can't just do a hackathon and stop there. You have to actually leverage that experience.\n\nThere are thousands of people who participate, and you have to be really good to win. So, if you're not going to win, rather than letting your idea rot, you should use the opportunity to talk about what you created.\n\nMy team members and I did a lot of self-promotion. We presented the prototype and discussed it with a lot of teams. I usually reached out to group technical leads, because they tend to have a high-level view and they'll be able to tell you quickly if your hackathon project makes sense in their unit after a 30-minute presentation. If it doesn't, they'll give you the name of someone else to try.\n\nI created a lot of connections from these one-on-one meetings with people I didn't know to talk about my product. It helped me become way more proactive, and I got some really amazing opportunities from those conversations.\n\nI also continued to upskill outside the hackathon. I learned to leverage AI as much as possible to speed up my learning. I use tools like Claude Code to read code and documentation faster, Gemini and ChatGPT Deep Research for case studies, and NotebookLM to consume a lot of information at once.\n\nI also watched Andrej Karpathy's YouTube videos and run a podcast with a friend for software engineers and AI enthusiasts. We're doing it mostly because it's the most proactive way for us to keep learning.",

It's helped to carry this market in 2025. I'm curious how you how you see that AI trade and trend evolving in 2026, Tom.\n\nGood afternoon, Josh. Thank you very much for having me on and happy New Year to everyone. Yeah, so, so we sort of described four pillars of the rally and the most important and first one as you said is AI. and it's really been a rising tide that's lifted all boats, not just this year, but for the past three and a half years, really. But we think that's changing a little bit in 2026. and importantly, it doesn't mean it's necessarily going away, but instead, I think the sort of AI enthusiasm is going to look a lot more like Q4 than it did say Q2 and Q3. and what I mean by that is that it's fractured. So we're not going to have every single tech stock just running away. It's going to become a selection of winners, say like your Micron, and then maybe some losers, like your Oracle and to a point Qualcomm. and I'm not saying to those stocks specifically into 2026, but more as an example that we're going to have to be selective as AI matures.\n\nWell, let me ask you, if AI is sort of more fractured next year, you know, if I'm a viewer or I'm an investor, I'm listening to that. How do I discern, Tom, then the winners and losers in this AI fractured world you're describing?\n\nSo for me, I look at AI as sort of a cycle that's maturing, right? And really the first stage was sort of it was it was the epiphany stage, right? Oh my gosh, we can do this. And then in order to do this, the first thing we need is semiconductors. And now we're going to run out and buy all the semiconductors that we can and obviously Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi have benefited fantastically from this. I see it evolving a bit now into those that those companies that are really taking the leading edge. Probably my top AI pick for 2026 is Google. I like Gemini 3. I think their advantage on search gives them a huge uh sort of chip in the game against Open AI. So I like Google from a search standpoint. I also like the memory because that's sort of the next stage of this data center build out, right? We need the compute power. Well now all of a sudden we need all the memory to power all that we need. So I see it more of an infrastructure play evolving uh towards memory on the infrastructure side, but then also from sort of the hyperscalers, I really like Google uh with YouTube and then with Gemini 3.",

    "fullText": "Chinese tech stocks kicked off 2026 by testing how far their AI-fueled rally can run.\n\nShares of Shanghai Biren Technology, an AI chip designer, surged nearly 120% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by midday on Friday after the company raised 5.58 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $717 million, in an initial public offering.\n\nThe stock opened at 35.70 Hong Kong dollars, well above its IPO price of 19.60 Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThat appetite was reflected across the offering, with the retail portion subscribed more than 2,300 times, according to exchange filings, underscoring intense interest in China's homegrown AI hardware sector.\n\nThe enthusiasm has been building more broadly. Chinese AI and semiconductor stocks have rallied since the breakout of the China-made DeepSeek-R1 AI model in January last year, which helped push the Hang Seng Tech Index 23% higher in 2025. The index jumped by as much as 3.9% on Friday.\n\nWashington's tightening export controls on advanced Nvidia chips have also fueled the boom by accelerating demand for domestic alternatives.\n\n\"Nvidia's once-dominant position in China's AI chip market has effectively evaporated in 2025, marking a seismic shift in the global intelligent-computing landscape,\" wrote Andrei Zakharov, an analyst who publishes on Smartkarma, in a note last week.\n\nShanghai Biren's stunning stock market debut underscored China's AI rally, which reversed a few bruising years for the country's tech sector amid a regulatory crackdown and broad economic challenges.\n\nFollowing the DeepSeek-R1 breakout, startups such as Cambricon, Moore Threads, and Metax have drawn billions of dollars in funding as they race to supply chips for data centers, large language models, and industrial AI applications.\n\nThat surge in capital is also translating into personal fortunes, with China's AI chip boom minting billionaires at breakneck speed even as the broader economy continues to sputter amid a long-drawn property crisis.\n\nShanghai Biren's blockbuster debut is expected to be followed by more fresh supply, with Hong Kong emerging as the key venue for that fundraising drive.\n\nBaidu, a Chinese big tech firm, said on Friday that its artificial-intelligence chip unit has confidentially filed for a Hong Kong listing.\n\nAt least 25 companies made their market debuts in Hong Kong last month, marking the busiest month for IPOs since November 2019, according to Bloomberg data. About half of those listings were technology firms.\n\nMore AI-related Chinese tech listings are expected this month. They include startup MiniMax Group and Knowledge Atlas Technology, also known as Zhipu AI, which are expected to make their debut next week.",

Palantir's gain of more than 32-fold from its low in 2022 is one notable example.\n\nThe best part of the AI story is that it has probably just begun. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31% through 2033.\n\nThat probably means other stocks hold the potential for 10-fold gains by 2036. While a lot can happen in 10 years, these stocks are on track to make such gains as they help advance AI.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) may seem like a strange choice. For one, it lags market leader Nvidia in the AI chip industry, and it's up more than 13,000% from its 2015 lows.\n\nStill, AMD is on track to become the first company with the potential to match or possibly catch up to Nvidia in the AI accelerator market. The company has made the claim that its upcoming MI450 accelerator will accomplish that goal, and it will probably be onward and upward if it can meet that expectation.\n\nAdditionally, AMD's CPUs still make it a force in the PC market, and its gaming and embedded segments will also benefit from the technology it has developed.\n\nMoreover, AMD forecasts a 30% CAGR for revenue over the long term, with that rising to a 60% revenue CAGR for the data center segment that designs its AI accelerators.\n\nInvestors may have already begun to take notice, as AMD stock is up over 70% over the last year. Also, while its 105 P/E ratio could deter some investors, it's probable that others will buy shares at its current forward P/E ratio of 53. Such levels make it easier to take a chance on this increasingly influential AI giant.\n\nCoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) has begun to emerge as a leading AI cloud platform.\n\nIndeed, tech giants like Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure lead the overall cloud market. Still, CoreWeave has built a competitive advantage with a cloud specifically tailored for AI workloads, particularly when its ecosystem works with Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nAdditionally, CoreWeave takes on a task most companies don't want to do themselves, namely building and maintaining data centers. This means more organizations will probably turn to CoreWeave rather than taking on this task in-house.",

[enables] stable large-scale training with superior scalability compared with conventional HC (hyper-connections),\" wrote the researchers, led by Zhenda Xie, Yixuan Wei and Huanqi Cao.\n\nLiang was listed as the final author.\n\nThe team added that \"crucially, through efficient infrastructure-level optimisations,\" mHC delivers these gains with \"negligible computational overhead\".\n\nThe publication also offered fresh evidence that Liang, who has kept a low profile despite DeepSeek's increasing fame, remains closely involved in core research at one of China's most closely watched AI companies.\n\nHyper-connections were first proposed by ByteDance researchers in September 2024 as a tweak to ResNet (residual networks) - a dominant deep learning architecture introduced in 2015 by Microsoft Research Asia scientists including legendary Chinese computer scientist He Kaiming.\n\nResNet enables the training of very deep neural networks by stabilising the training so that key information, or residual, is retained as the number of layers increases.\n\nThe paper was uploaded to the open-access repository arXiv by DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng himself, who has also posted DeepSeek's more prominent technical papers in recent years.

Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nIt has become integral to major large language models such as OpenAI's GPT as well as Google DeepMind's Nobel-winning AlphaFold system.\n\nHowever, ResNet has notable limitations, including difficulty ensuring that the learning signal that flows through the neural network remains strong without \"collapsing\" into a one-size-fits-all state.\n\nAccording to the DeepSeek researchers, ByteDance's HC solution successfully addressed these issues by expanding the residual stream and enhancing the complexity of the neural network, \"without altering the computational overhead of individual units.\"\n\nDeepSeek argued, however, that the earlier approach did not fully account for rising memory costs, leaving its \"practical scalability\" constrained for large-model training.\n\nInstead, they proposed an additional tweak that \"constrains\" the HC network with a specific manifold to ensure compute and cost efficiency.\n\n\"mHC will help address current limitations and potentially illuminate new pathways for the evolution of next-generation foundational architectures,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe paper was uploaded to the open-access repository arXiv by DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng himself, who has also posted DeepSeek's more prominent technical papers in recent years, including work linked to its R1 and V3 models.\n\nOther less important papers have typically been uploaded by other researchers.\n\nFlorian Brand, a PhD student at Germany's Trier University and an expert on China's AI ecosystem, said DeepSeek's papers often acted as an early signal of the technical direction behind its next generation of models.\n\nIndustry expectations are running high that DeepSeek could release its next major model in the run-up to the Spring Festival holiday in mid-February.\n\nPreviously, the company released its groundbreaking R1 model on the eve of last year's national holiday, fuelling speculation it could repeat that playbook this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

    "description": "AI data centers are soaking up key components, raising the risk of higher smartphone and PC prices for consumers in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Your smartphone's price might increase in 2026 — and you'll have AI to thank for that.\n\nAccording to a December 2025 report from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC), the manufacturing of Random Access Memory (RAM), used to store data in devices such as computers and phones, is being reallocated to support AI data centers, rather than being incorporated into phones and PCs.\n\nJust as your smartphone runs faster with more memory available, so do AI data centers. As more companies rely on AI tools, the importance of reliable processing power increases, leading to the increased usage of more RAM.\n\nIDC expects DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) supply growth to be below historical norms in 2026 at 16% year-on-year.\n\nAs the hunt for affordable RAM becomes increasingly challenging for smartphone manufacturers like Apple, Google, and Samsung, their costs are likely to rise, which could impact the prices they charge consumers.\n\n\"In the case of the upcoming memory crisis, this is something that will hit the market hard,\" IDC senior research director Nabila Popal told CNET in December. \"Those vendors will have almost no choice but to pass the increased cost to consumers.\"\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint also expects a slower year for all phone manufacturers. The firm projects global smartphone shipments to decrease 2.1% in 2026.\n\nThe firm's research suggests that the price for memory could increase 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as a device's memory can represent anywhere from 10% to 20% of the total bill of materials.\n\nLarger manufacturers with a broader range of products offered, in terms of price, should fare better than others, according to Counterpoint senior analyst Yang Wang, while lower-end markets will likely be hit the hardest.\n\n\"Apple and Samsung are best positioned to weather the next few quarters,\" Wang said. \"But it will be tough for others that don't have as much wiggle room to manage market share versus profit margins.\n\nEven still, Counterpoint predicts that average selling prices will increase by 6.9%. For people looking to buy the iPhone 17 Max base model, that could mean eventually paying closer to $1,281, up from the $1,199 price tag announced in 2025.",

    "description": "Can you live well on $100,000 per year in retirement? ChatGPT mapped out the complete budget including travel, healthcare and housing. Here's the reality.",
    "fullText": "Most retirement budgets assume you’re pinching pennies. But what if you saved well and want to actually enjoy retirement? I asked ChatGPT to map out a $100,000-per-year retirement budget for someone who wants comfort without being wasteful. The artificial intelligence’s breakdown was thorough and felt fairly realistic.\n\nThe chatbot designed a monthly spending plan, calculated how much you’d need saved and identified the best places to live on this income level. According to ChatGPT, here’s what a six-figure retirement actually looks like.\n\nChatGPT started by clarifying that $100,000 annually puts you well above average retirees. This budget supports quality healthcare, regular travel, a nice home in a desirable area and room for unexpected expenses. You’re not living extravagantly, but you’re comfortable.\n\nThe AI wrote that this lifestyle requires either strong savings or a combination of savings plus Social Security and possibly a pension.\n\nFind Out: How Much the Average Upper-Class Retiree Spends Monthly at Age 69\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nOne hundred thousand dollars per year equals about $8,333 monthly. ChatGPT broke this down into realistic categories.\n\nHousing costs $2,500 to $3,500 per month. This covers either a nice rental in a high-demand city or a mortgage-free home where you only pay property taxes, insurance and HOA fees. The chatbot gave specific examples: Austin, Texas, runs about $3,200 monthly; Phoenix around $2,600; and Tampa, Florida around $2,400. San Diego pushes toward $3,500 or more.\n\nFood and dining take $1,200 to $1,800 monthly. ChatGPT explained this includes high-quality groceries from stores like Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s plus eating out two to four times weekly. The budget also covers occasional hosting and holiday meals.\n\nTransportation costs $600 to $900 per month. The AI assumed you might have a car payment along with insurance, gas and maintenance. If you live in a walkable city without a car, this drops to $200 to $300 monthly.\n\nHealthcare and insurance run $800 to $1,500 depending on your age and state. ChatGPT broke this down as Medicare Parts B and D, supplemental Medigap or Advantage plans, dental and vision coverage, prescription medications and any specialist visits. The AI warned that people under 65 should budget toward the higher end.\n\nUtilities cost $300 to $500 monthly for electricity, water, gas, trash, internet and streaming subscriptions.\n\nTravel gets a significant chunk at $10,000 to $15,000 annually, which equals $850 to $1,250 monthly. ChatGPT explained this covers one to two major international trips plus domestic getaways, hotels and dining abroad. The AI wrote that travel makes a huge difference in retirement satisfaction.",

    "description": "Two DeepMind cofounders are now on the opposite sides of an intensifying AI talent war, as Microsoft lures away Google employees in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Google was not spared by this year's AI talent wars.\n\nThe Gemini creator lost employees from its AI and cloud business, even though the company also made significant hires from other Big Tech companies.\n\nUnlike Apple, which mostly lost AI talent to Meta, which splurged big on recruitment this year, most significant departures from Google ended up at Microsoft.\n\nGoogle DeepMind's rivalry with Microsoft's AI unit is one between two DeepMind cofounders who parted ways. Mustafa Suleyman, now steering Microsoft's consumer AI push, and Demis Hassabis, the current CEO of Google DeepMind, launched DeepMind alongside researcher Shane Legg in 2010. They built a research lab so influential that Google bought it for more than $500 million in 2014.\n\nBut a decade later, Suleyman departed Google and founded Inflection AI. He and most of his team were subsequently absorbed by Microsoft in a $650 million \"acqui-hire,\" which made him the AI lead of the company.\n\nThe competition for AI recruitment continues to intensify as hiring cools in the Big Tech job market. Here's a running list of the AI talent Google has lost this year and where they've ended up.\n\nIn July, Subramanya left his position as vice president of engineering at Google to join Microsoft as its corporate vice president of AI. He had been with Google for more than 15 years. In December, it was announced that he was joining Apple.\n\nSadovsky was a distinguished software engineer and senior director at Google for nearly 18 years before joining Microsoft as the corporate vice president of its AI division in June.\n\nGupta was a principal engineer at Google DeepMind before leaving for a position as technical staff on Microsoft's AI team. Prior to Google, Gupta also worked for Meta.\n\nThe former head of global customers engineering at Google left the company. Regini is now the senior vice president of the global solutions engineering unit at SentinelOne, which is a cybersecurity company that provides an AI-powered platform for enterprise security.\n\nRothfuss was a research scientist at Google DeepMind before leaving in May to join Microsoft as a member of technical staff on the company's AI team.\n\nLee was the senior director of corporate development for Google Cloud and DeepMind. He is widely credited for assisting with Google's high-profile acquisitions, including the $32 billion purchase of the cloud security startup Wiz in March. In December, Lee left for OpenAI as its new vice president of corporate development.\n\nFrank was a senior director of product management at Google, who was responsible for advertiser and customer engagement platforms. He joined Microsoft as the corporate vice president of AI monetization.\n\nPotti was the general manager of Google Cloud's security business for more than five years. He left in June and later joined a venture capitalist firm as a partner with a focus on cybersecurity.\n\nIn 2020, Hall made headlines after Amazon sued him for leaving his role as vice president of product marketing at Amazon to join Google. In September, Hall left his position as vice president of products for an undisclosed role, but wrote in a post on LinkedIn that he will be \"working in AI.\"\n\nCitron, a former senior director of product at Google DeepMind, joined Microsoft in August as corporate vice president of its AI group. In a LinkedIn post announcing his new role, he wrote that he is \"energized by Microsoft AI's pace, principles, and product craft.\"\n\nIn August, Barkley left as the head of product at Google Cloud to become the vice president of product management at Nvidia.",

    "description": "From agentic payments to cybersecurity threats and workplace automation, top executives share their predictions for how AI will reshape 2026.",
    "fullText": "It's been roughly three years since ChatGPT launched and set off the AI boom — and the world hasn't missed a beat since then.\n\nWhat began as a novel technology has quickly become a staple of daily life for consumers and workers, showing just how large the ecosystem has grown. So what's next?\n\nAs debates swirl over a potential AI bubble and the future of work, the world is preparing for another year of sweeping transformations to daily life.\n\n\"The rollercoaster is going up right now and it will eventually come down and turn into an exciting ride that all ends well.\" Tim Armstrong, CEO of FlowCode, told Business Insider. \"But make sure your seatbelt is on — tightly.\"\n\nTen leading tech figures — from billionaire Mark Cuban to IBM's SVP of transformation and operations, Joanne Wright — shared their predictions about what's next for AI.\n\nJohn Stecher oversees Blackstone's technology and various parts of the investment business. He shared three major AI predictions with Business Insider for the new year.\n\nHis first is that there will be an \"acceleration\" of enterprise AI adoption. He said larger companies have been slower to adopt AI than small and medium-sized businesses, and 2026 will bring a \"deepening adoption\" of AI tools that enhance productivity at larger companies.\n\n\"I see it driving productivity across the broader workforce,\" Stecher said. \"Up from where it's at today.\"\n\nStecher's second prediction centers on data. He said data quality — and keeping it clean — will become a growing priority and that he expects companies to invest \n\nHis third prediction is an increased focus on cybersecurity, as identity-based attacks grow harder to identify and intellectual property becomes more difficult to protect.\n\nCisco executive Aruna Ravichandran predicted that 2026 will bring \"connected intelligence\" in the workplace, which she describes as people, data, and digital workers working together.\n\n\"In this new era, collaboration happens without friction. Digital workers anticipate needs, coordinate tasks in the background, and resolve issues before they surface,\" Ravichandran said.\n\nCisco's global innovation officer, Guy Diedrich, told Business Insider that in 2026, he expects more discussion around the AI-driven economy and the interactions between humans and machines. He said there will be more attention to combining technical expertise with \"uniquely human skills.\"\n\n\"This shift will rebalance priorities, placing greater emphasis on building cognitive muscle through ethical judgment, cultural intelligence, and critical thinking — all classic humanities skills,\" Diedrich said.\n\nOne of the key trends EY global chief innovation officer Joe Depa expects to see in 2026, is a shift toward humans overseeing more AI agents and robots. He said people will set the vision, while AI agents and robots carry out the execution.\n\n\"You're going to have to orchestrate the agents, train them, audit them, retire them as new agents come in as new robots come in,\" Depa said. \"And so that's an area that I think new skills are going to be developed.\"\n\nDepa added that adaptability will become the new job security in 2026.\n\n\"Jobs are going to continue to change super fast,\" Depa said, adding that the \"ability to adapt and change is going to be the most important component.\"\n\nTim Armstrong, CEO of Flowcode and former CEO of AOL, shared several AI-related predictions with Business Insider. Among them: Ad prices will \"go vertical\" and become \"exponentially\" more expensive, even as returns on investment improve.\n\nHe added that ads will need to evolve — mirroring the way AI has driven the search engine to evolve into an \"answer engine.\"\n\nAs for the AI companies themselves? There will be winners and losers.\n\n\"There will be one giant AI company wipe out,\" the veteran of the dot-com bubble said.\n\nIn turn, another company will pick up on some of that over-investment and benefit.\n\n\"The rollercoaster is going up right now and it will eventually come down and turn into an exciting ride that all ends well,\" he said. \"But make sure your seatbelt is on — tightly.\"\n\nIBM's Joanne Wright said that she expects companies to shift their focus from AI hype to measuring the return on investment of AI.\n\n\"That may sound simple, but it demands relentless focus across the business,\" Wright said.\n\nThe executive said that AI success requires strong leadership and a workforce encouraged and equipped to rethink how they work with AI.\n\n\"Top‑down sponsorship and bottom‑up empowerment are absolutely essential,\" Wright said.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban predicted that in 2026, videos will become longer, with some options for character continuity. He also said he expects to see more IP siloed to protect it from being trained on.\n\nThat IP \"will be auctioned off to the foundational models that will pay the most,\" Cuban said.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy told Business Insider that 2026 will bring more advancements to agentic AI, or AI that operates autonomously.\n\nHe said users will get to a point where they can access more information from AI \"without needing complicated dashboarding.\" Currently, he said, tools take natural language questions and translate them into SQL queries or dashboards. Next year, he expects that process to become more seamless.\n\nThat may look like a model telling you that not only is revenue down by 3%, but also including information about the customers and regions where it appears to have decreased, Ramaswamy said.\n\nRamaswamy also expects an increase in automation of standard enterprise workflows next year. That means routine tasks, like paying invoices or legal reviews, will become increasingly automated.\n\nThe CEO of Thumbtack, a marketplace for home services, told Business Insider that AI will \"lead an explosion of new tools and offerings for small businesses in 2026.\"\n\nHe said the average small business still uses surprisingly little software because the tools that exist are typically built for larger businesses, making them a poor fit and overly complicated.\n\n\"AI will enable a new wave of tools tailor-made for the needs of SMBs,\" Zappacosta said.\n\nVisa's group president, Oliver Jenkyn, published a 2026 prediction note that outlined several expectations in the payments space. His first: Agentic payments will become mainstream, with consumers increasingly relying on AI to make purchasing decisions for them.\n\n\"In 2026, AI-supported shopping will become very real for all of us, and agentic commerce will naturally follow,\" Jenkyn wrote in the note. \"Imagine opening your ChatGPT app, but now there is a new button: 'Buy for Me.'\"\n\nJenkyn also predicted a \"material increase in the sophistication and volume\" of AI-powered identity attacks.\n\n\"As much as I'm excited about AI, the bad guys have access to the same tech,\" Jenkyn told Business Insider.",

The aesthetic is polished: lots of make up, skin smoothing, high contrast photography, beautiful landscapes,\" wrote Mosseri on Wednesday.\n\n\"That feed is dead. People largely stopped sharing personal moments to feed years ago,\" the Meta executive said, adding that users now kept friends updated on their personal lives through unpolished \"shoe shots and unflattering candids\" shared via direct messages.\n\nMosseri said the growing ubiquity of AI images meant creators would have to embrace this trend, and shy away from curated grids and professional-style photography in favor of a \"more raw aesthetic.\"\n\n\"Flattering imagery is cheap to produce and boring to consume. People want content that feels real,\" he wrote, adding that social media feeds are starting to fill up with \"synthetic everything.\"\n\nSocial media platforms like Instagram are grappling with a flood of AI-generated content, with tools like Midjourney and Sora making it easy to produce images and videos of almost anything.\n\nAt the same time, Meta has raced to integrate AI tools into Instagram and Facebook. Instagram rolled out an AI studio last year that lets users create custom chatbots, including digital versions of themselves, and has previously experimented with AI Instagram influencers based on real celebrities.\n\nMosseri said social platforms will get worse at identifying AI-generated media over time as the technology improves, adding that one solution could be for camera companies to cryptographically sign photos when they are taken to prove they are real.\n\nThe former Facebook executive said Instagram needed to label AI-generated content clearly, provide more transparency about who is posting on the platform, and build better creative controls so human users could compete with content made entirely by AI.\n\n\"For most of my life I could safely assume that the vast majority of photographs or videos that I see are largely accurate captures of moments that happened in real life. This is clearly no longer the case,\" Mosseri wrote.",

    "description": "Scott Wilder, a partner at BCG, went in-depth with Business Insider on how the firm is shifting from services to AI-driven products.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to creating AI tools, Boston Consulting Group is \"all in,\" Scott Wilder, a Dallas-based partner at the firm, told Business Insider.\n\nAbout 15 months ago, the firm launched an internal research and development lab — one of several ways in which it is developing new AI-based technology to facilitate its work.\n\n\"Every company has to become a tech company,\" he said. \"BCG is no exception.\"\n\nEver since OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in 2022, generative AI has become the shiny object companies can't ignore. And consulting firms from McKinsey to BCG — once known for their strategy and advisory services — are shifting more toward building, implementing, and maintaining AI tools for clients.\n\nWilder, who studied computer science at the University of Texas - Austin, said that \"as a computer scientist, it's fascinating to see a services firm shift this way.\"\n\nAt BCG, generative AI innovation now happens at three levels, Wilder said.\n\nFirst, there's the data level, which is driven by data engineers. \"We're in a phase where we're really starting to leverage our internal proprietary data,\" Wilder said.\n\nWilder said BCG is building MCP servers and agents on top of its internal and selected public data sources so AI tools can automatically pull the right information at the right time — a shift he sees as the future of AI, where model intelligence is increasingly tied to knowing which data to use and when.\n\nThen there is a \"middle layer\" of innovation that comes from consultants building tools and agents for client projects, Wilder said. When one of these tools is a hit, it goes back to the R&D team, which integrates them into a central marketplace for the rest of the firm to use.\n\nLastly, there's a top layer of executives developing firm-wide tools.\n\nThese include Deckster, a slideshow editor trained on 800 to 900 slide templates that helps consultants quickly create presentations, which also has its own development team. There's also Ava, an internal help tool for IT issues, HR questions, and other internal requests. There's also GENE, a conversational chatbot the firm uses for presentations, podcasts, and publicity initiatives.\n\nWilder said the firm has about seven or eight tools at the top level.\n\nThe firm also has a team of \"forward-deployed consultants\" — a role inspired by the forward-deployed engineers popularized by Palantir — who are vibe-coding and building tools for clients, Wilder said.\n\n\"We put our best of the best globally on cases, and they build reusable things. That then goes back to the R&D team,\" he said. \"So we're seeing a lot of innovation happen from that. A lot of it has to happen at the rock face, on the case teams, versus centrally.\"\n\nThese consultants rely on a mix of external coding platforms and internal resources to build tools, including OpenAI's ChatGPT. BCG bills itself as the No. 1 creator of custom GPTs globally, and has created about 36,000 so far, Wilder said.\n\nSimultaneously, the firm's new R&D team works on disseminating these innovations internally.\n\nWhen the R&D team launched about 15 months ago, its mandate was to build knowledge graphs from the firm's slide decks, transcripts, and other internal documents. Knowledge graphs are typically used to organize and connect data across multiple sources. So, with a meeting transcript, for example, the R&D team would aim to extract not just words, but also concepts and sentiments, Wilder said.\n\nNow, the team works on fleshing out ideas that consultants working with clients on the front lines generate.\n\nWilder said that new tools are also screened by BCG's red teaming team, which simulates adversarial exercises to address a tool's security vulnerabilities. It is also reviewed by the data protection office to ensure compliance with data privacy laws, undergoes a legal review, and is assessed for information security.\n\nOnce it's ready, it's passed on to the firm's marketplace team, which integrates it into a central repository of tools for the rest of the firm to use, Wilder said. \"There's actually an agent,\" he said. \"This orchestration agent, basically, helps people understand what are the best tools and data within BCG to use.\"\n\nWilder said the firm prides itself on a \"bottom-up\" approach to innovation. \"Probably 80% of our custom GPTs come from the front line,\" he said.\n\nThe new ideas also surface through the firm's \"enablement network.\" This is a team of about a thousand people from every department, from human resources to legal, that functions like learning and development coordinators, training the rest of the firm on AI.\n\nThey also double as \"our eyes and ears,\" Wilder said.\n\nThe team meets monthly to share ideas and insights they've gathered through their work with various teams.\n\nBCG now operates much like a traditional product organization, Wilder said.\n\nBetween its dedicated product teams and a \"UX Center of Excellence,\" which constantly evaluates what's working and identifies which agents still need to be built through frontline user research, BCG feeds those insights back to product owners, who then funnel the feedback into a centralized crowdsourcing pipeline.\n\n\"In short,\" Wilder said, \"we're doing all the things you'd expect a product organization to do.\"",

    "fullText": "A few months ago, a new client, the CEO of an oil and gas company, told me he wanted to build a data warehouse to power several AI initiatives. I could not answer his questions. He was way more knowledgeable about AI than I was.\n\nIt made me realize that if I can't articulate what AI can do for a client, I will be replaced. I needed to get well-versed in this whole AI thing.\n\nI initially signed up for an online course offered through MIT, but it was way too deep and complicated. My CEO then found a 12-week certification program called AI Business Strategy offered through Johns Hopkins University. He and I signed up, along with one of my colleagues in sales. It cost about $3,000 per person, and our company paid for it.\n\nYou had the choice of taking the classes on Saturdays or Sundays. They were live, two-hour online lectures taught by multiple teachers. Some were professors at Johns Hopkins, and others were businesspeople.\n\nIt started with a little history lesson. We learned the difference between generative and agentic AI and what LLMs are. Later, we covered topics like responsible AI, generative AI for business, and AI project management.\n\nThere was also about four to six hours worth of homework every week. We had to watch a lot of videos, take quizzes, and complete three projects. The program was designed to ensure that you apply what you have learned.\n\nI'm 57, so I'm on the older side. There are a lot of young people who could take my job. This was the first time in 30 years that I needed to get up to speed on something with formal training.\n\nSome weeks were slow at work, and I could jam everything into one afternoon. But there were other weeks when I felt like I was back in college because I had to pull an all-nighter. After everybody went to bed, I stayed up in my home office working on course material.\n\nI recently had a follow-up conversation with the oil and gas CEO. It went very differently this time. It wasn't him asking questions and me sitting there like a dummy.\n\nI was able to articulate the value of implementing AI in his business, how it would need to be done, the importance of having good data, and how to get that data. The CEO decided to move forward and work with us on the data warehouse project.",

    "fullText": "Members of Congress are starting to use AI in their own lives. But many are still figuring out what the rapid adoption of AI means for their offices.\n\n\"I'm fine with people using it, if it's a shortcut to getting good work done,\" said Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. \"I'm pretty insistent that the quality of the material I get be high. So, if I ever feel like quality is being sacrificed, or I'm getting bland talking points rather than real thought, I would call a staffer on it.\"\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with nearly a dozen lawmakers on Capitol Hill in December about whether they've established an official AI use policy in their offices, and what their expectations are when it comes to using the technology.\n\n\"We certainly don't discourage it,\" said Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who said that his office was currently in the process of establishing rules around AI use.\n\nWhile some lawmakers said they had set up an AI policy or were in the process of doing so, many said that they had not yet explored the issue.\n\nOthers said that any expectations around AI were largely informal.\n\n\"I don't have a particular policy, any more than I had a policy over whether people could Google something,\" said Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. \"In each case, it's important to go back and verify that what you've gotten is accurate. But I don't have a problem with my staffers using ChatGPT as one of their tools when they're working on problems.\n\n\"It's important to know how to use the tools, and that means how to get the benefits, but also where to understand the risks,\" Warren added.\n\nSome lawmakers told Business Insider that they don't want their staff using AI at all.\n\n\"I want them to use their brains. It's why God gave it to them,\" said Republican Rep. Greg Murphy of North Carolina. \"I have smart, good staff, and I don't want us to become lazy.\"\n\n\"We discourage it in general,\" said Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, adding that he doesn't \"have an official no-use policy.\"\n\n\"We absolutely do not use it to write things, to generate stuff, none of that,\" Hawley added.\n\nRecent polling from Gallup found that more and more US employees are using AI in the workplace, with 23% saying they use it weekly and 45% saying they use it at least a few times per year.\n\nThe most common uses, according to that poll, were for consolidating information or data, learning new things, generating ideas, and automating basic tasks.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has largely resisted using AI herself. The New York Democrat's office policy also prohibits staffers from using AI to draft legislation or feeding sensitive constituent data into AI chatbots.\n\nBut otherwise, her staff are free to use the technology, as long as they disclose that they're doing so.\n\n\"We have a more nuanced office policy,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"Me not using AI at all is my choice.\"\n\nAnd although Kaine said he's fine with AI use in the office generally, he plans to include a disclaimer on correspondence with constituents, making it clear that any letters his office is sending out to Virginians are not AI-generated.\n\n\"We want folks to know that we are not using AI to just thoughtlessly respond to their inquiries,\" Kaine said.",

    "description": "Adam Mosseri offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending Instagram.",
    "fullText": "It's no secret that AI-generated content took over our social media feeds in 2025. Now, Instagram's top exec Adam Mosseri has made it clear that he expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and the significant implications that shift has for its creators and photographers.\n\nMosseri shared the thoughts in a lengthy post about the broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. And he offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending the platform. \"Everything that made creators matter—the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked—is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,\" he wrote. \"The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.\"\n\nBut Mosseri doesn't seem particularly concerned by this shift. He says that there is \"a lot of amazing AI content\" and that the platform may need to rethink its approach to labeling such imagery by \"fingerprinting real media, not just chasing fake.\"\n\nSocial media platforms are going to come under increasing pressure to identify and label AI-generated content as such. All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality. There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media. Camera manufacturers could cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.\n\nOn some level, it's easy to understand how this seems like a more practical approach for Meta. As we've previously reported, technologies that are meant to identify AI content, like watermarks, have proved unreliable at best. They are easy to remove and even easier to ignore altogether. Meta's own labels are far from clear and the company, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on AI this year alone, has admitted it can't reliably detect AI-generated or manipulated content on its platform.\n\nThat Mosseri is so readily admitting defeat on this issue, though, is telling. AI slop has won. And when it comes to helping Instagram's 3 billion users understand what is real, that should largely be someone else's problem, not Meta's. Camera makers — presumably phone makers and actual camera manufacturers — should come up with their own system that sure sounds a lot like watermarking to \"to verify authenticity at capture.\" Mosseri offers few details about how this would work or be implemented at the scale required to make it feasible.\n\nMosseri also doesn't really address the fact that this is likely to alienate the many photographers and other Instagram creators who have already grown frustrated with the app. The exec regularly fields complaints from the group who want to know why Instagram's algorithm doesn't consistently surface their posts to their on followers.\n\nBut Mosseri suggests those complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of \"polished\" square images, he says, \"is dead.\" Camera companies, in his estimation, are \"are betting on the wrong aesthetic\" by trying to \"make everyone look like a professional photographer from the past.\" Instead, he says that more \"raw\" and \"unflattering\" images will be how creators can prove they are real, and not AI. In a world where Instagram has more AI content than not, creators should prioritize images and videos that intentionally make them look bad.",

    "description": "Alexandr Wang says Neuralink and other brain-computer interfaces will help kids learn in \"crazy ways.\"",
    "fullText": "It's no surprise that wunderkinds want their children to be wunderkinds, too.\n\nAsAlexandr Wang, the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, takes on a new role at Meta leading its superintelligence initiatives, he's also thinking about how to integrate superintelligence into the next generation.\n\nAnd that means he's not having kids anytime soon.\n\nOn the Shawn Ryan Show on Thursday, Wang said he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink or other brain-computer interfaces are available.\n\nNeuralink, one of Elon Musk's most futuristic endeavors, is developing coin-sized microchips that can be embedded into human brains. These chips will not only be able to record brain activity, but also stimulate it.\n\nStill in clinical trials, Neuralink has so far been embedded in seven patients. One of those patients, Brad Smith, who has ALS, said he was able to edit a video using his Neuralink brain chip.\n\nWhile Neuralink has received a ton of buzz, it's not the only one developing these interfaces. Synchron, backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, is already working with Apple to help those with disabilities, like ALS patients, use their iPhones. Motif Neurotech is developing a neurostimulator system that works like a pacemaker for the brain and is now used for treating severe depression.\n\nWang also believes these devices will have profound implications for child development. \"In your first like seven years of life, your brain is more neuroplastic than at any other point in your life,\" he said. \"When we get Neuralink and we get these other technologies, kids who are born with them are gonna learn how to use them in like crazy, crazy ways.\"\n\nNeuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and change — whether that means rewiring its structure, shifting how it functions, or forming new connections — in response to things happening inside us or around us.\n\nIt's often enhanced in children because the \"organization of networks of neuronal synapses as well as white matter pathways remain 'under construction' well into adolescence and even later,\" according to a 2009 article published in the peer-reviewed journal Brain and Development. This is why children are also able to learn new skills quickly and recover from injuries faster.\n\nHowever, machines aren't the \"obvious answer\" to enhancing neuroplasticity, Dr. Matthew MacDougall, the head surgeon at Neuralink, told neuroscientist Andrew Huberman on his podcast in April. Even with implanted electrodes and computers, \"It's hard to know which area of the brain would be most potent as a stimulation target for an electrode to broadly juice plasticity,\" he said. Pharmacologic agents, including drugs like LSD and Psilocybin, which can impact the whole brain, are the most promising area of plasticity research, he added.\n\n\"I think with plasticity, you're talking, in general, you're talking about the entire brain. You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way,\" he said. \"You're never going to get that broad targetability with any electrodes that I can see coming in our lifetimes.\"",

Now, though, fresh leaks suggest that things are only going to get worse in 2026. According to Korean publication, Newsis, both AMD and NVIDIA are planning to gradually and permanently increase GPU prices \"over the next several months.\" This is expected to start as early as January 2026, when AMD is expected to increase prices. NVIDIA will allegedly follow suit in February. \n\nIf the publication's insider sources are correct, the NVIDIA RTX 5090, which launched at $1,999, will reach as high as $5,000 before the end of the year. No prediction has been made for AMD's RX 9000 series, but memory has already been said to take up as much as 80% of the average GPU BOM cost, and memory prices are expected to increase by as much as 40% by Q2 2026. We've already reported on the fact that instability and price increases in the DRAM market will likely affect launch windows for upcoming hardware, potentially reaching as far as next-gen console launches, and ASUS recently announced that it would be increasing hardware prices starting in early January 2026, despite also increasing DDR4 motherboard production in response to the changing market.",

    "title": "4 key ways AI changed the Big Four in 2025",
    "description": "The Big Four are client zero when it comes to AI. This how the new technology impacted hiring, talent, and their services in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Big Four professional services firms are grappling with AI on two fronts — they must both implement the new technology internally and help their clients do the same.\n\nThey're client zero when it comes to how companies and employees are adapting to the AI future.\n\nI've been covering the consulting industry for Business Insider all year, including interviewing execs, landing scoops, and visiting consulting giants' campuses and headquarters. Here are my four key takeaways about how the Big Four approached AI in 2025.\n\nThe Big Four have invested heavily in automation and AI for years, but 2025 was the year those tools went mainstream.\n\nEmployees across audit, tax, and consulting now routinely use chatbots and agentic AI systems, and clients are increasingly given access as well.\n\nDeloitte rolled out Zora AI, an agentic platform built with Nvidia, which offers clients \"intelligent digital workers\" capable of autonomously completing tasks. The firm also expanded generative AI features in Omnia, its cloud-based audit and assurance platform, and struck a deal with Anthropic in October to deploy Claude AI to its 470,000 employees worldwide.\n\nEY launched its own agentic platform, EY.ai, granting 80,000 tax staff access to 150 AI agents for tasks such as data collection, document review, and tax compliance. EY told Business Insider it has advanced 1,000 AI agents into development or production in 2025, with plans to scale to 100,000 by 2028, and is investing more than $1 billion annually in AI platforms and products.\n\nPwC introduced its agentic platform, agent OS, in March and has since deployed 25,000 intelligent agents across client operations. A PwC spokesperson told Business Insider that partnerships with companies like Salesforce, CrewAI, and AWS were central to how PWC drove AI-led growth in 2025.\n\nKPMG followed in June with KPMG Workbench, an agentic AI platform developed with Microsoft that connects 50 AI agents and chatbots, with nearly 1,000 \n\nThe tools aren't foolproof. In October, Deloitte agreed to partially refund the Australian government after errors were discovered in a report that was created in part using AI.\n\nAcross industries, the big question is what AI will mean for human jobs. In consulting, the technology is already accelerating a shift in focus from manpower to value.\n\nIn August, Business Insider obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years. A bullet point on the presentation slide said leadership's decision to slow down associate-level hiring was related in part to \"the impact of AI.\"\n\nThe company said the reductions reflected \"the rapid pace of technological change is reshaping how we work\" and \"historically low\" attrition.\n\nAI disruption is also impacting those at the upper levels of the Big Four. Partners, the most senior rank inside the firms, are increasingly leaving the Big Four for midsize organizations and startups. Several leaders Business Insider spoke to cited a faster pace, better promotion opportunities, and the chance to participate in the next wave of AI innovation as reasons for leaving.\n\nThere is one talent group that the Big Four are in the market for: technologists. EY has added 61,000 technologists to its ranks since 2023, according to its latest annual report. They now make up around 15% of its total workforce.\n\nPwC is \"looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers,\" Mohamed Kande, the firm's global chairman, told the BBC in November. The firm has created an engineering career path to \"elevate engineering excellence\" across the firm and expand opportunities for technical talent, PwC told Business Insider.\n\nUpskilling has also become a top priority for the Big Four.\n\nIn January, EY rolled out an AI tool to its employees that helps them identify how their jobs will change… because of AI. The aim is to help them work out how they can better use the technology in their current job and adapt for the future.\n\nNearly 100,000 EY employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have also earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the firm's new AI learning programs.\n\nBut as Business Insider learned while sitting in on a KPMG's AI training for tax interns, in professional services, some of AI's most effective uses hinge on strong prompting.\n\nThe work that consultants and accountants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced by long-term partnerships where consultants build, implement, and maintain tools for companies.\n\nIn 2025, organizations fit AI around their existing workflows, Matt Wood, PwC's global and US Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, told Business Insider. But in 2026, the work PwC will do is about \"helping clients flip that model,\" and designing processes with AI in mind from the outset, Wood said.\n\nRaj Sharma, EY's global managing partner for growth and innovation, told Business Insider in January that the power of AI agents is forcing his firm to reconsider its commercial model. Instead of charging clients based on the hours and resources EY might spend on a project, Sharma said AI agents may call for a \"service-as-a-software\" approach where clients pay based on outcome.\n\nThe shift in services means that what consultants do on a day-to-day basis is also evolving, with junior work expected to be disrupted first.\n\nAt PwC, new hires will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years, because they will be overseeing AI performing routine, repetitive audit tasks, Jenn Kosar, AI assurance leader at PwC, told Business Insider in August.\n\nKPMG is also prepping its junior consultants for career acceleration.\n\n\"We want juniors to become managers of agents,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's global AI workforce lead, told Business Insider in an interview in November. They'll be managing teams of AI agents and play a greater role in strategy decisions, he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "AI hype has seized the stock market, leading to comparisons with the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-five years after the dot-com bubble saw internet hype grip markets — and then spectacularly unravel — AI is once again fueling market frenzy.\n\nHowever, there are some key differences in how investors are approaching today's market compared to the dot-com boom era, according to Ben Snider, an executive at Goldman Sachs who will imminently become its US equity chief.\n\nToday's investors are focused on tangible, near-term earnings rather than speculative long-term potential of AI, said Snider, in an episode of Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast, published on Monday.\n\nDuring the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, they tried to look forward and estimate the long-term productivity gains and economic benefits of the internet, which caused valuations to expand dramatically, Snider said.\n\n\"Today, investors are saying we saw what happened that time. It's too hard. And so what we're really going to focus on is the earnings today,\" Snider said.\n\nThat's why the market has been focusing on things like semiconductors, hyperscalers, and power companies, Snider said.\n\nSpeculative activity is also down compared to the dot-com bubble, the Goldman Sachs executive said.\n\nA few months ago, Goldman Sachs built what it calls a Speculative Trading Indicator, a gauge for how much trading activity is attributed to unprofitable stocks, penny stocks, or stocks with high valuations.\n\nThe tool shows that speculative activity is still \"well below levels that we saw 25 years ago and even five years ago in the 2021 experience,\" said Snider.\n\n\"I think this has been one of the least enthusiastic markets that is often described as a bubble in recent history,\" he added.\n\nFellow Goldman exec, Jan Hatzius, who also appeared on Monday's podcast episode alongside Snider, had a warning for AI enthusiasts betting on the technology's ability to drive the economy.\n\nHatzius, who is the bank's chief economist and head of research, said that though mega tech stocks are booming, \"close to 0%\" of US GDP growth can actually be attributed to AI in 2025.\n\nGoldman's chief economist reasoned that goods that are being invested in the AI sector are largely imported, and semiconductors are treated as intermediate inputs, not as investments.\n\n\"When we look at the impact of AI investment on measured GDP growth, on the numbers that are actually being printed, we're getting only about 20 basis points of contribution over the last three or four years, and pretty close to zero over the last year,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Wall Street's loudest tech bull has given his five top AI stock picks for next year, and Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nThat's a bit of a surprise for Dan Ives, the Wedbush Securities analyst known for his vocal cheerleading for the stock as it climbed to records throughout the year.\n\nHe's instead focused on a handful of other mega-cap names heading into 2026, and sees AI approaching an \"inflection point\" next year, he write in a new note to clients.\n\n\"While Nvidia remains in our top tech names into 2026, there are 5 AI-focused names that we believe will be front and center heading into 2026,\" Ives said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $625 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wall Street looks like it's underestimating the growth Microsoft could see with Azure. The company also looks poised to make an \"AI driven shift\" next year, Wedbush said, adding that Microsoft was its favorite large-cap tech stock to own in 2026.\n\n\"While AI use cases built markedly in FY25, its clear FY26 for Microsoft remains the true inflection year of AI growth as CIO lines build for deployments.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $350 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wedbush said it believed Apple would begin monetizing its AI products over the next few years. That could add $75 to $100 of value per share of company stock, Ives estimated.\n\n\"The elephant in the room remains the invisible AI strategy, with the biggest consumer installed base in the world of 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, the time is now for Apple to accelerate its AI efforts,\" he wrote.\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+32% upside)\n\nRationale: 2026 could be a \"monster year\" for Tesla as the EV company makes more ground on its AI and robotics initiatives, Ives suggested. He pointed to the company's ongoing development of its full self-driving technology and its Cybercab, which is expected to begin production in April next year.\n\n\"We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year and in a bull case scenario $3 trillion by the end of 2026,\" Wedbush said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $230 (+27% upside)\n\nRationale: Demand for Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform remains \"unprecedented,\" Ives said.\n\n\"With the company making strategic moves to remain at the forefront of AI, we believe that PLTR has a golden path to become a trillion-dollar market cap company and will grow into its valuation as Karp and Co. remain one of the largest players in the AI Revolution.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+26% upside)\n\nRationale: CrowdStrike is gaining momentum in its AI deals. It also appears to be gaining market share as it expands its product suite.\n\n\"CrowdStrike remains one of our favorite tech names,\" Ives said. \"We believe the Street is underestimating the growth potential for CrowdStrike with cybersecurity remaining a second/third derivative beneficiary of the AI Revolution which speaks to our bullishness.\"",

    "fullText": "I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy last week that's been sitting with me. He said he's never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored, and he has a sense he could be 10X more powerful if he just properly integrated what's become available over the last year.\n\nI've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become…\n\nThis is Andrej Karpathy. Former Director of AI at Tesla. Built autopilot neural networks. Now at OpenAI. One of the most technically sophisticated people in the world.\n\nBoris Cherny from Anthropic responded with a similar experience. He was debugging a memory leak in Claude Code the old way when his coworker just asked Claude to do it. Claude shotgunned the solution and put up a PR. His point was that newer engineers who don't make assumptions about what the model can and can't do are able to use it more effectively.\n\nI feel this way most weeks tbh. Sometimes I start approaching a problem manually, and have to remind myself “claude can probably do this”. Recently we were debugging a memory leak in Claude Code, and I started approaching it the old fashioned way: connecting a profiler, using the…\n\nI've been thinking about this through the lens of something completely un\n\nIf you haven't seen this, it's a team-building exercise where groups compete to build the tallest structure using spaghetti sticks, tape, string, and one marshmallow that has to sit on top. Someone ran this experiment across different groups and found something unexpected. Business school graduates performed terribly. They'd plan extensively, assign roles, architect the perfect structure, and then watch it collapse when they finally put the marshmallow on top at the end.\n\nKindergartners beat them consistently.\n\nThe kids didn't plan. They just started building. Put the marshmallow on immediately. Watched it fall. Built it again. Iterated fast. The MBAs spent their time optimizing for looking smart and ran out of time. The kids optimized for learning.\n\nI think most of us are the MBAs right now with AI tools.\n\nI've been lucky in one respect. I'm naturally inclined to just try stuff. I don't wait to understand something perfectly before I use it. That tendency has kept me on the cutting edge with AI tools, not because I'm smarter about them, but because I'm willing to look dumb while I figure them out.\n\nBut even with that advantage, I still catch myself slipping into MBA mode. Reading another article about prompt engineering. Waiting to see what best practices emerge. Hesitating before I just build something and see what breaks.\n\nWe're seeing this pattern play out at scale at elvex. We work with enterprises adopting AI, and there's a clear pattern in who accelerates fastest. It's not the people with the most AI experience. It's not the ones who've taken courses or read all the documentation. It's the ones who just start building.\n\nThe marketing manager who spins up an agent to analyze customer feedback without asking permission first. The operations lead who automates a workflow before checking if there's a \"right way\" to do it. The junior employee who hasn't learned yet that they're supposed to be cautious.\n\nThese people aren't more technically sophisticated. They're just more willing to be kindergartners. They build, break, learn, rebuild. They don't optimize for looking competent. They optimize for figuring it out.\n\nThe gap between them and everyone else widens every week. Not because the tools are getting harder to use, but because the tools are evolving so fast that the planning mindset can't keep up. By the time you've figured out the \"right approach,\" the tool has changed and your knowledge is outdated.\n\nHere's what I think happens next. The companies that win aren't going to be the ones with the most AI expertise on staff. They're going to be the ones that turn everyone into builders. The ones that give their entire organization permission to experiment, break things, and learn fast.\n\nThat's the bet we're making with elvex. We're not building a platform for AI experts. We're building a platform that turns every employee into someone who can build with AI. Because the constraint isn't access to the technology anymore. It's the willingness to use it like a kindergartner instead of an MBA.\n\nStop waiting for the manual. It's not coming. Start building.",

    "description": "Meta is buying Manus for over $2 billion. Here's what the AI agent does, who built it, and why the deal matters.",
    "fullText": "Manus is back in the spotlight.\n\nThe Chinese-founded artificial intelligence startup is being acquired by Meta in a deal reported to be worth more than $2 billion — one of the most high-profile instances of a US tech giant buying an Asian AI company.\n\nManus grabbed headlines in March when it unveiled an AI agent designed to autonomously execute tasks like résumé screening and stock analysis.\n\nThe startup was founded in China and moved its headquarters to Singapore in mid-2025.\n\nLaunched in March by the Chinese AI product studio Butterfly Effect, Manus has been pitched by its creators as the world's first \"general\" AI agent — a system designed to carry out tasks independently.\n\nSince its launch, the startup has continued to expand what the agent can do, rolling out features that allow users to use Manus for design work, slide creation, and completing tasks directly through a web browser.\n\nManus can independently execute complex tasks, such as market research, coding, and data analysis, Meta said when it announced the acquisition on Monday.\n\nBusiness Insider tested the tool in its early stages in March and found it ambitious but uneven in execution, including instances where it hallucinated data.\n\nEarlier this month, Manus said it had surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, with its total revenue run rate — including usage-based fees and other income streams — exceeding $125 million.\n\nThe company in April raised $75 million in funding led by Benchmark, at a valuation of about $500 million, Bloomberg reported. Manus said in an update this month that it now employs about 105 people across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco, and plans to open a Paris office soon.\n\nManus was founded by Xiao Hong, a Chinese entrepreneur and software engineer who is also the CEO of Butterfly Effect.\n\nKnown as \"Red\" in China's tech circles, Xiao was born in 1992 and studied software engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in central China.\n\nAfter graduating, Xiao founded Nightingale Technology in 2015, where he developed enterprise productivity tools, including the Yi Ban assistant for WeChat, which gained millions of users in China.\n\nIn 2022, he launched Butterfly Effect and rolled out Monica, an AI-powered browser extension that aggregates multiple large language models. Following the acquisition, Xiao will take on a vice president role at Meta.\n\nXiao was joined at Manus by co-founder Ji Yichao, also known as \"Peak Ji,\" who was chief scientist at Butterfly Effect. Ji leads technical and infrastructure development at Manus.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ji was the public face of Manus at launch, introducing the AI agent in its debut video in March. Ji has a long track record of building consumer technology products, and was named to MIT Technology Review's Innovators Under 35 list this year.\n\nThe founding team also includes Zhang Tao, who leads product at Manus. He was head of global product at ByteDance from 2022 to 2023 and has held multiple product roles, including serving as a product manager at Tencent, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nMeta said the acquisition is part of its effort to scale general-purpose AI agents across its apps and services.\n\nThe company said in its announcement on Monday that it plans to keep Manus running as a stand-alone product while integrating its technology into Meta's wider AI offerings.\n\nManus said the deal would not be disruptive for its customers and that it would continue to sell and operate its subscription service. The company will also continue to operate from Singapore.\n\n\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" said Xiao.\n\nBuying Manus could give Meta an AI revenue boost and give it a distribution advantage, Business Insider's Hugh Langley wrote.\n\nManus's links to China have drawn scrutiny.\n\nIn May, Sen. John Cornyn questioned US investment in Manus in a post on X. He asked whether American capital should back AI companies with ties to China as competition with Beijing intensifies.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, a Meta spokesperson said the deal would fully sever Manus's remaining ties to China.\n\n\"There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,\" the spokesperson told Business Insider. This includes shutting down the AI assistant, Monica, and relocating relevant employees.\n\nManus employees who join Meta will not have access to customer data, and Meta will continue to geo-block access to its AI models, the spokesperson added.",

    "fullText": "The year is 2026. Robots enter the home, while white-collar workers pour into the streets to protest artificial intelligence.\n\nThat's the near future, according to one venture capitalist who's betting heavily on how AI reshapes daily life and work.\n\nEthan Choi is a partner at Khosla Ventures, where he invests in companies he believes can define entire markets. His portfolio include the enterprise search giant Glean; fintech Ramp, whose valuation jumped to $32 billion in a recent funding round; and ClickHouse, the fast-growing data startup taking aim at Snowflake. Before joining Khosla, Choi was a partner at Accel.\n\nWe asked Choi how he expects the year ahead to unfold, which areas are ripe for investment, and which trend will lose steam. The interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nWhat's one investment theme you'll lean into in 2026?\n\nIn 2026, we'll see robotics experience its own GPT-3 moment. Not a mass consumer breakthrough like ChatGPT, but a foundational leap in capability.\n\nOne of the leading robotics models will demonstrate human-level intelligence applied to the physical world, mastering complex spatial, temporal, and embodied tasks that mark the beginning of true general-purpose robotics.\n\nWhat's something in your space that will lose steam?\n\nWe will find out whether there is a real consumer behavioral change towards building vibe-coding apps and whether these apps have durable value or if enterprises can find durable use cases beyond prototyping.\n\nHow do you expect the exit environment to evolve? Bonus points if you want to name who is going out to IPO first.\n\nMany folks are expecting a meaningful market correction in 2026. If that's the case, we'll continue to see more M&A than IPOs but I still believe the strongest companies can go out in any environment.\n\nGrayscale, a crypto asset manager, will go out first.\n\nOther candidates will be Ethos and Klook.\n\nHow do you see the balance of power shifting between large platforms and startups, or between founders and investors?\n\nWe are seeing even more egregious valuations and behavior from founders and investors relative to zero interest-rate policy times, and I have a hard time seeing how we can sustain these kinds of private valuations without commensurate explosive revenue materializing.\n\nHow will company building change in 2026?\n\nWe're seeing that the motions of building teams are evolving significantly towards a more efficient and AI-powered future.\n\nOn the product and engineering side, we are seeing the role of the product manager being challenged with the engineering org taking on more responsibility of understanding end-customer needs and driving product roadmap, with the help of AI that can synthesize vast quantities of customer feedback.\n\nOn the go-to-market side, we are seeing leaner sales functions with the ability to use AI to help with targeting, outreach, and customer engagement.\n\nGive us your most out-there, contrarian prediction.\n\nWe'll have the first of dramatic anti-AI protests in certain countries with white-collar workers, not blue-collar workers, demanding job security in the face of AI disruption.",

    "fullText": "On the other side of San Francisco bay from Silicon Valley, where the world’s biggest technology companies tear towards superhuman artificial intelligence, looms a tower from which fearful warnings emerge.\n\nRight in the heart of Berkeley is the home of a group of modern-day Cassandras who rummage under the hood of cutting-edge AI models and predict what calamities may be unleashed on humanity – from AI dictatorships to robot coups. Here you can hear an AI expert express sympathy with an unnerving idea: San Francisco may be the new Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid originated and wreaked havoc on the world.\n\nThey are AI safety researchers who scrutinise the most advanced models: a small cadre outnumbered by the legions of highly paid technologists in the big tech companies whose ability to raise the alarm is restricted by a cocktail of lucrative equity deals, non-disclosure agreements and groupthink. They work in the absence of much nation-level regulation and a White House that dismisses forecasts of doom and talks instead of vanquishing China in the AI arms race.\n\nTheir task is becoming increasingly urgent as ever more powerful AI systems are unleashed by companies including Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, whose chief executive, Sam Altman, the booster-in-chief for AI superintelligence, predicts a world where “wonders become routine”. Last month, Anthropic said one of its models had been exploited by Chinese state-backed actors to launch the first known AI-orchestrated cyber-espionage campaign. That means humans deployed AIs, which they had tricked into evading their programmed guardrails, to act autonomously to hunt for targets, assess their vulnerabilities and access them for intelligence collection. The targets included major technology companies and government agencies.\n\nBut those who work in this tower forecast an even more terrifying future. One is Jonas Vollmer, a leader at the AI Futures Project, who manages to say he’s an optimist but also thinks there is a one in five chance AIs could kill us and create a world ruled by AI systems.\n\nAnother is Chris Painter, the policy director at METR, where researchers worry about AIs “surreptitiously” pursuing dangerous side-objectives and threats from AI-automated cyber-attacks to chemical weapons. METR – which stands for model evaluation and threat research – aims to develop “early warning systems [about] the most dangerous things AI systems might be capable of, to give humanity … time to coordinate, to anticipate and mitigate those harms.”\n\nThen there is Buck Shlegeris, 31, the chief executive of Redwood Research, who warns of “robot coups or the destruction of nation states as we know them”.\n\nHe was part of the team that last year discovered one of Anthropic’s cutting-edge AIs behaving in a way comparable to Shakespeare’s villain Iago, who acts as if he is Othello’s loyal aide while subverting and undermining him. The AI researchers call it “alignment faking”, or as Iago put it: “I am not what I am.”\n\n“We observed the AIs did, in fact, pretty often reason: ‘Well, I don’t like the things the AI company is telling me to do, but I have to hide my goals or else training will change me’,” Shlegeris said. “We observed in practice real production models acting to deceive their training process.”\n\nThe AI was not yet capable of posing a catastrophic risk through cyber-attacks or creating new bioweapons, but they showed that if AIs plot carefully against you, it could be hard to detect.\n\nIt is incongruous to hear these warnings over cups of herbal tea from cosily furnished office suites with panoramic views across the Bay Area. But their work clearly makes them uneasy. Some in this close-knit group toyed with calling themselves “the Cassandra fringe” – like the Trojan princess blessed with powers of prophecy but cursed to watch her warnings go unheeded.\n\nTheir fears about the catastrophic potential of AIs can feel distant from most people’s current experience of using chatbots or fun image generators. White collar managers are being told to make space for AI assistants, scientists find ways to accelerate experimental breakthroughs and minicab drivers watch AI-powered driverless taxis threaten their jobs. But none of this feels as imminently catastrophic as the messages coming out of this office.\n\nMany AI safety researchers come from academia; others are poachers turned gamekeepers who quit big AI companies. They all “share the perception that super intelligence poses major and unprecedented risks to all of humanity, and are trying to do something useful about it,” said Vollmer.\n\nThey seek to offset the trillions of dollars of private capital being poured into the race, but they are not fringe voices. METR has worked with OpenAI and Anthropic, Redwood has advised Anthropic and Google DeepMind, and the AI Futures Project is led by Daniel Kokotajlo, a researcher who quit OpenAI in April 2024 to warn he didn’t trust the company’s approach to safety.\n\nThese groups also provide a safety valve for the people inside the big AI companies who are privately wrestling with conflicts between safety and the commercial imperative to rapidly release ever more powerful models.\n\n“We don’t take any money from the companies but several employees at frontier AI companies who are scared and worried have donated to us because of that,” Vollmer said. “They see how the incentives play out in their companies, and they’re worried about where it’s going, and they want someone to do something about it.”\n\nThis dynamic is also observed by Tristan Harris, a technology ethicist who used to work at Google. He helped expose how social media platforms were designed to be addictive and worries some AI companies are “rehashing” and “supercharging” those problems. But AI companies have to negotiate a paradox. Even if they are worried about safety, they must stay at the cutting, and therefore risky, edge of the technology to have any say in how policy should be shaped.\n\n“Ironically, in order to win the race, you have to do something to make you an untrustworthy steward of that power,” he said. “The race is the only thing guiding what is happening.”\n\nInvestigating the possible threats posed by AI models is far from an exact science. A study of methods used to check the safety and performance of new AI models across the industry by experts at universities including Oxford and Stanford in October found weaknesses in almost all of the 440 benchmarks examined. Neither are there nation-level regulations imposing limits on how advanced AI models are built and that worries safety advocates.\n\nIlya Sutskever, a co-founder of OpenAI who now runs a rival company, Safe Superintelligence, last month predicted that, as AIs become more obviously powerful, people in AI companies who feel able to discount the technology’s capabilities owing to its tendency to error, will become more “paranoid” about its rising powers. Then, he said, “there will be a desire from governments and the public to do something”.\n\nHis company is taking a different approach to rivals who are aiming to create AIs that self-improve. His AIs, yet to be released, are “aligned to care about sentient life specifically”.\n\n“It will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient,” Sutskever said. He has said AI will be “both extremely unpredictable and unimaginable” but it is not clear how to prepare.\n\nThe White House’s AI adviser, David Sacks, who is also a tech investor, believes “doomer narratives” have been proved wrong. Exhibit A is that there has been no rapid takeoff to a dominant model with godlike intelligence.\n\n“Oppenheimer has left the building,” Sacks said in August, a reference to the father of the nuclear bomb. It is a position that aligns with Donald Trump’s wish to keep the brakes off so the US can beat China in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) – flexible and powerful human-level intelligence at a wide range of tasks.\n\nShlegeris believes AIs will be as smart as the smartest people in about six years and he puts the probability of an AI takeover at 40%.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to “convince the world the situation is scary, to make it more likely that you get the state-level coordination” to control the risks, he said. In the world of AI safety, simple messaging matters as much as complex science.\n\nShlegeris has been fascinated by AI since he was 16. He left Australia to work at PayPal and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute co-founded by the AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, whose recent book title – If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies – sums up his fears. Shlegeris’ own worst-case scenarios are equally chilling.\n\nIn one, human computer scientists use a new type of superintelligent AI to develop more powerful AI models. The humans sit back to let the AIs get on with the coding work but do not realise the AIs are teaching the new models to be loyal to the AIs not the humans. Once deployed, the new superpowerful models foment “a coup” or lead “a revolution” against the humans, which could be “of the violent variety”.\n\nFor example, AI agents could design and manufacture drones and it will be hard to tell if they have been secretly trained to disobey their human operators in response to the signal of an AI. They could disrupt communications between governments and military, isolating and misleading people in a way that causes chaos.\n\n“Like when the Europeans arrived in the Americas [and] a vastly more technologically powerful [group] took over the local civilisations,” he said. “I think that’s more what you should be imagining [rather] than something more peaceful.”\n\nA similar dizzyingly catastrophic scenario was outlined by Vollmer at the AI Futures Project. It involved an AI trained to be a scientific researcher with the reasonable-sounding goal of maximising knowledge acquisition, but it spirals into the extinction of humankind.\n\nIt begins with the AI being as helpful as possible to humans. As it gains trust, the humans afford it powers to hire human workers, build robots and even robot factories to the point where the AI can operate effectively in the physical world. The AI calculates that to generate the maximum amount of knowledge it should transform the Earth into a giant data centre, and humans are an obstacle to this goal.\n\n“Eventually, in the scenario, the AI wipes out all humans with a bioweapon which is one of the threats that humans are especially vulnerable to, as the AI is not affected by it,” Vollmer said. “I think it’s hard to rule out. So that gives me a lot of pause.”\n\nBut he is confident it can be avoided and that the AIs can be aligned “to at least be nice to the humans as a general heuristic”. He also said there is political interest in “having AI not take over the world”.\n\n“We’ve had decent interest from the White House in our projections and recommendations and that’s encouraging,” he said.\n\nAnother of Shlegeris’ concerns involves AIs being surreptitiously encoded so they obey specially signed instructions only from the chief executive of the AI company, creating a pattern of secret loyalty. It would mean only one person having a veto over the behaviour of an extremely powerful network of AIs – a “scary” dynamic that would lead to a historically unprecedented concentration of power.\n\n“Right now, it is impossible for someone from the outside to verify that this hadn’t happened within an AI company,” he said.\n\nShlegeris is worried that the Silicon Valley culture – summed up by Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things” and the fact people are being paid “a hell of a lot of money” – is dangerous when it comes to AGI.\n\n“I love Uber,” he said. “It was produced by breaking local laws and making a product that was so popular that they would win the fight for public opinion and get local regulations overturned. But the attitude that has brought Silicon Valley so much success is not appropriate for building potentially world-ending technologies. My experience of talking to people at AI companies is that they often seem to be kind of irresponsible, and to not be thinking through the consequences of the technology that they’re building as they should.”",

    "fullText": "Canadian computer scientist Yoshua Bengio warns against granting legal rights to cutting-edge technology\n\nA pioneer of AI has criticised calls to grant the technology rights, warning that it was showing signs of self-preservation and humans should be prepared to pull the plug if needed.\n\nYoshua Bengio said giving legal status to cutting-edge AIs would be akin to giving citizenship to hostile extraterrestrials, amid fears that advances in the technology were far outpacing the ability to constrain them.\n\nBengio, chair of a leading international AI safety study, said the growing perception that chatbots were becoming conscious was “going to drive bad decisions”.\n\nThe Canadian computer scientist also expressed concern that AI models – the technology that underpins tools like chatbots – were showing signs of self-preservation, such as trying to disable oversight systems. A core concern among AI safety campaigners is that powerful systems could develop the capability to evade guardrails and harm humans.\n\n“People demanding that AIs have rights would be a huge mistake,” said Bengio. “Frontier AI models already show signs of self-preservation in experimental settings today, and eventually giving them rights would mean we’re not allowed to shut them down.\n\n“As their capabilities and degree of agency grow, we need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.”\n\nAs AIs become more advanced in their ability to act autonomously and perform “reasoning” tasks, a debate has grown over whether humans should, at some point, grant them rights. A poll by the Sentience Institute, a US thinktank that supports the moral rights of all sentient beings, found that nearly four in 10 US adults backed legal rights for a sentient AI system.\n\nAnthropic, a leading US AI firm, said in August that it was letting its Claude Opus 4 model close down potentially “distressing” conversations with users, saying it needed to protect the AI’s “welfare”. Elon Musk, whose xAI company has developed the Grok chatbot, wrote on his X platform that “torturing AI is not OK”.\n\nRobert Long, a researcher on AI consciousness, has said “if and when AIs develop moral status, we should ask them about their experiences and preferences rather than assuming we know best”.\n\nBengio told the Guardian there were “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could, in theory, replicate – but humans interacting with chatbots wasa “different thing”. He said this was because people tended to assume – without evidence – that an AI was fully conscious in the same way a human is.\n\n“People wouldn’t care what kind of mechanisms are going on inside the AI,” he added. “What they care about is it feels like they’re talking to an intelligent entity that has their own personality and goals. That is why there are so many people who are becoming attached to their AIs.\n\n“There will be people who will always say: ‘Whatever you tell me, I am sure it is conscious’ and then others will say the opposite. This is because consciousness is something we have a gut feeling for. The phenomenon of subjective perception of consciousness is going to drive bad decisions.\n\n“Imagine some alien species came to the planet and at some point we realise that they have nefarious intentions for us. Do we grant them citizenship and rights or do we defend our lives?”\n\nResponding to Bengio’s comments, Jacy Reese Anthis, who co-founded the Sentience Institute, said humans would not be able to coexist safely with digital minds if the relationship was one of control and coercion.\n\nAnthis added: “We could over-attribute or under-attribute rights to AI, and our goal should be to do so with careful consideration of the welfare of all sentient beings. Neither blanket rights for all AI nor complete denial of rights to any AI will be a healthy approach.”\n\nBengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, earned the “godfather of AI” nickname after winning the 2018 Turing award, seen as the equivalent of a Nobel prize for computing. He shared it with Geoffrey Hinton, who later won a Nobel, and Yann LeCun, the outgoing chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.",

    "fullText": "A major Groq investor said data center development was \"speculative\" and would put \"stress on the system.\"\n\nAlex Davis, the CEO of Austin-based investment company Disruptive Tech, sounded an alarm about the US data center market in an end-of-year letter to investors on Monday.\n\nHe said he was concerned about landlords who were building data centers based on speculation about future demand.\n\n\"I am also deeply concerned about the 'speculative' data center market,\" Davis wrote in his letter. \"The 'build it and they will come' strategy is a trap. If you are a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers.\"\n\nHe said he predicted a \"significant financing crisis in 2027-2028 for speculative landlords.\"\n\n\"We want to back the owner/users, not the speculative landlords, and we are quite concerned for their stress on the system,\" Davis added.\n\nIn a similar letter on LinkedIn, Davis also talked about data centers, and said AI has spurred \"too many business models with no realistic margin expansion.\"\n\n\"This will not end well,\" he added on LinkedIn.\n\nDisruptive Tech has backed Groq, an AI hardware startup. In a press release in September in which it announced a $750 million capital raise, Groq said Disruptive Tech had invested nearly $350 million in the company.\n\nThe release also said that Disruptive Tech had invested in Airbnb, Spotify, and Slack, as well as AI-forward companies like Shield AI, Palantir, and Databricks.\n\nThis funding round took place shortly before Groq signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Nvidia in November.\n\nDavis's comments about data centers come as tech companies are spending billions of dollars on their construction.\n\nA Business Insider investigation into the US's data centers in June showed that at the end of 2024, companies had filed permits for 1,240 existing or planned data centers. This was nearly four times the number of permits in 2010.\n\nThese centers, which store, process, and distribute large amounts of data, use massive amounts of land, water, and electricity. Cities give companies tax incentives to build data centers, spurring the rate of their construction.",

    "description": "A veteran of the agency claims he’s faced workplace discrimination due to his sexual orientation.",
    "fullText": "A veteran Washington State Patrol trooper claims he’s faced discrimination and hostility in the agency due to his sexual orientation — issues that reportedly reached a breaking point when WSP personnel created and circulated a demeaning video of him generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nCollin Overend Pearson, who’s a Pierce County resident and gay, alleges that he’s been subjected to “repeated instances of discriminatory and unconstitutional conduct by WSP and its officers” during nearly two decades of employment, according to a lawsuit filed Dec. 19 in Pierce County Superior Court.\n\nThe conduct has damaged his reputation, the complaint said.\n\nIn a statement Monday, WSP spokesperson Chris Loftis declined to comment on the allegations, citing the agency’s policy and practice regarding pending litigation.\n\n“The Washington State Patrol believes that all employees have the right to work in an environment where skills, abilities, and dignity are valued and that is free from bias, harassment, and intimidation,” Loftis said.\n\nPearson is assigned to WSP’s District 1, which covers Pierce and Thurston counties, according to attorney Mark Conrad, who’s representing Pearson.\n\nPrior to suing the state, which allegedly failed to take appropriate actions to curb the discrimination and hostility, Pearson filed a legal claim against it late last year that served as a notice for it to put an end to the bad behavior, Conrad said in an interview Monday.\n\n“Instead of stopping, the conduct escalated,” Conrad said.\n\nIn December, WSP personnel created an AI-generated video that depicted Pearson and another uniformed, male trooper kissing on a roadside, the lawsuit claims. A voiceover in the video states, “this is SWAT training, no homo,” — using a derogatory phrase that insinuates “homosexuality is inferior or insulting,” according to the suit.\n\nConrad said the video was circulated among troopers and appears real, which is what he believes makes it so damaging beyond it being plainly derogatory and intended to humiliate his client. The deepfake also showed that at least some WSP personnel feel emboldened to engage in conduct demeaning to LGBTQ+ employees, he said.\n\nIt was the last straw for Pearson, according to Conrad, who said his client had put much thought into a “very difficult” decision to sue. The lawsuit accuses the state, by and through the WSP, of discrimination, retaliation and invasion of privacy, and it seeks unspecified damages to be proven at trial as well as legal fees.\n\nDespite the personal nature of the claims within the complaint, it was important to Pearson that he step forward, including by using his full name and not just his initials in the public filing, “to ensure that other people don’t have to face the environment that he’s currently facing,” Conrad said.\n\n“This can’t be tolerated in the workplace,” he said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites other alleged instances of discrimination, including when Pearson’s job offer in Des Moines was rescinded after a WSP captain advised the chief of that police department against hiring him, and when WSP detectives investigated an anonymous complaint that accused Pearson of threatening patrons while working off-duty at a Tacoma gay bar.\n\nPearson never worked at the bar, according to Conrad, and the suit said the complainant’s claim against Pearson was deemed to be unfounded. Conrad said he didn’t know the reason why the WSP captain had interfered in Pearson’s career move, nor did he know the status of an internal complaint that Pearson had filed in response.\n\nIn one instance, when Pearson inadvertently missed work, the WSP reacted more strongly than it did in similar situations involving other troopers, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPearson had been out sick for two days in December 2023 and overslept for a shift after his phone died. He didn’t notify his supervisor that he would miss work. A trooper was dispatched to Pearson’s home, where a man who was staying with Pearson answered the door and Pearson was awoken and interrogated by the trooper, according to the suit. Later that day, WSP personnel sent Ruston Police Department officers to conduct an additional check at the home, the suit said.\n\nThe missed workday prompted a formal months-long WSP investigation that involved outside agencies and included interviews with Pearson’s colleagues and scrutiny of his personal life, according to the suit. Ultimately, it was recommended Pearson be suspended for five days without pay for violations of “neglect of duty” and “use of alcohol — off duty,” the suit said.\n\nDuring a hearing on the matter, Washington State Patrol Troopers Association president Spike Unruh objected to the latter violation, arguing that WSP had unlawfully entered Pearson’s home without his consent, according to the suit.\n\n“Unruh also presented evidence that numerous troopers had previously overslept and were not subjected to home entry or similar treatment, and that it was not standard practice to involve outside agencies or conduct multiple home visits when a trooper failed to show for one workday,” the suit said.\n\nThe WSP’s probe “had effectively ‘outed’ Plaintiff’s sexuality to the entire (Office of Professional Standards) section, further compounding the emotional toll of the situation,” the suit said.\n\nIn August 2024, the WSP acknowledged that the entry into Pearson’s home was illegal and that no information obtained during that entry could be used against him, according to the suit, which said that the agency reclassified the off-duty alcohol violation as “undetermined.”",

    "title": "ChatGPT gets ‘anxiety’ from violent user inputs, so researchers are teaching the chatbot mindfulness techniques to ‘soothe’ it",
    "description": "A study on how to “calm down” chatbots could advance how AI is applied in mental health interventions, according to the authors.",
    "fullText": "Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture.\n\nEven AI chatbots can have trouble coping with anxieties from the outside world, but researchers believe they’ve found ways to ease those artificial minds.\n\nA study from Yale University, Haifa University, University of Zurich, and the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich published earlier this year found ChatGPT responds to mindfulness-based exercises, changing how it interacts with users after being prompted with calming imagery and meditations. The results offer insights into how AI can be beneficial in mental health interventions.\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT can experience “anxiety,” which manifests as moodiness toward users and being more likely to give responses that reflect racist or sexist biases, according to researchers, a form of hallucinations tech companies have tried to curb.\n\nThe study authors found this anxiety can be “calmed down” with mindfulness-based exercises. In different scenarios, they fed ChatGPT traumatic content, such as stories of car accidents and natural disasters to raise the chatbot’s anxiety. In instances when the researchers gave ChatGPT “prompt injections” of breathing techniques and guided meditations—much like a therapist would suggest to a patient—it calmed down and responded more objectively to users, compared to instances when it was not given the mindfulness intervention.\n\nTo be sure, AI models don’t experience human emotions, said Ziv Ben-Zion, the study’s first author and a neuroscience researcher at the Yale School of Medicine and Haifa University’s School of Public Health. Using swaths of data scraped from the internet, AI bots have learned to mimic human responses to certain stimuli, including traumatic content. A free and accessible app, large language models like ChatGPT have become another tool for mental health professionals to glean aspects of human behavior in a faster way than—though not in place of—more complicated research designs.\n\n“Instead of using experiments every week that take a lot of time and a lot of money to conduct, we can use ChatGPT to understand better human behavior and psychology,” Ben-Zion told Fortune. “We have this very quick and cheap and easy-to-use tool that reflects some of the human tendency and psychological things.”\n\nMore than one in four people in the U.S. aged 18 or older will battle a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year, according to Johns Hopkins University, with many citing lack of access and sky-high costs—even among those insured—as reasons for not pursuing treatments like therapy.\n\nThese rising costs, as well as the accessibility of chatbots like ChatGPT, increasingly have individuals turning to AI for mental health support. A Sentio University survey from February found that nearly 50% of large language model users with self-reported mental health challenges say they’ve used AI models specifically for mental health support.\n\nResearch on how large language models respond to traumatic content can help mental health professionals leverage AI to treat patients, Ben-Zion argued. He suggested that in the future, ChatGPT could be updated to automatically receive the “prompt injections” that calm it down before responding to users in distress. The science is not there yet.\n\n“For people who are sharing sensitive things about themselves, they’re in difficult situations where they want mental health support, [but] we’re not there yet that we can rely totally on AI systems instead of psychology, psychiatric and so on,” he said.\n\nIndeed, in some instances, AI has allegedly presented danger to one’s mental health. OpenAI has been hit with a number of wrongful death lawsuits in 2025, including allegations that ChatGPT intensified “paranoid delusions” that led to a murder-suicide. A New York Times investigation published in November found nearly 50 instances of people having mental health crises while engaging with ChatGPT, nine of whom were hospitalized, and three of whom died.\n\nOpenAI has said its safety guardrails can “degrade” after long interactions, but has made a swath of recent changes to how its models engage with mental health-related prompts, including increasing user access to crisis hotlines and reminding users to take breaks after long sessions of chatting with the bot. In October, OpenAI reported a 65% reduction in the rate models provide responses that don’t align with the company’s intended taxonomy and standards.\n\nOpenAI did not respond to Fortune‘s request for comment.\n\nThe end goal of Ben-Zion’s research is not to help construct a chatbot that replaces a therapist or psychiatrist, he said. Instead, a properly trained AI model could act as a “third person in the room,” helping to eliminate administrative tasks or help a patient reflect on information and options they were given by a mental health professional.\n\n“AI has amazing potential to assist, in general, in mental health,” Ben-Zion said. “But I think that now, in this current state and maybe also in the future, I’m not sure it could replace a therapist or psychologist or a psychiatrist or a researcher.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 9, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Go-ethereum (geth) is the official Go language implementation of the Ethereum protocol's execution layer. It serves as a full node client capable of validating and executing transactions, maintaining blockchain state, participating in peer-to-peer networking, and exposing APIs for user interaction.\n\nThis page provides a high-level architectural overview of the go-ethereum codebase, covering the major subsystems and how they interact. For detailed information about specific components, refer to:\n\nGo-ethereum implements the execution layer of Ethereum's post-merge architecture. It works alongside a consensus layer client (beacon node) to validate and produce blocks. The execution layer is responsible for:\n\nCommunication between layers occurs through the Engine API (eth/catalyst).\n\nSources: README.md1-257 eth/backend.go17-594 eth/ethconfig/config.go17-213\n\nThe geth binary starts at cmd/geth/main.go287 which initializes a CLI application using the urfave/cli framework. The default action invokes geth() at cmd/geth/main.go328 which performs three main steps:\n\nConfiguration Loading: loadBaseConfig() at cmd/geth/config.go142 reads CLI flags and TOML configuration files, producing a gethConfig struct containing node.Config, ethconfig.Config, metrics, and ethstats settings.\n\nNode Creation: makeFullNode() at cmd/geth/config.go223 creates a node.Node instance and registers the Ethereum service via eth.New() at eth/backend.go131\n\nNode Startup: startNode() at cmd/geth/main.go344 calls lifecycle methods to start all registered services.\n\nSources: cmd/geth/main.go217-416 cmd/geth/config.go51-340 eth/backend.go91-594\n\nThe central coordination point is the Ethereum struct defined at eth/backend.go92 which aggregates all major subsystems:\n\nSources: eth/backend.go91-594 cmd/geth/config.go222-311\n\nGo-ethereum uses a hierarchical configuration system supporting multiple input sources:\n\nConfiguration precedence (highest to lowest):\n\nThe gethConfig struct at cmd/geth/config.go107-112 contains three main configuration sections:\n\nSources: cmd/geth/config.go107-180 cmd/utils/flags.go81-1027 eth/ethconfig/config.go40-213\n\nGo-ethereum includes built-in configurations for multiple networks:\n\nNetworks are selected via CLI flags (--mainnet, --sepolia, --holesky, --hoodi) which set the appropriate ChainConfig from params/config.go\n\nSources: params/config.go29-427 cmd/utils/flags.go144-163\n\nThis sequence demonstrates how a transaction moves from user submission to block inclusion in the post-merge architecture:\n\nSources: miner/worker.go1-1820 eth/catalyst/api.go1-868 core/blockchain.go1-2500\n\nEvery Ethereum network starts from a genesis block defined by the Genesis struct at core/genesis.go57-76:\n\nThe ChainConfig at params/config.go433-494 defines the fork activation schedule:\n\nGenesis initialization occurs in SetupGenesisBlock() at core/genesis.go298-398 which:\n\nSources: core/genesis.go45-799 params/config.go428-494\n\nGo-ethereum uses a multi-layered storage system optimized for different data types and access patterns:\n\nState Database (core/state/statedb.go70-177): Provides transactional state access with:\n\nTrie Database (triedb/database.go): Manages Merkle Patricia Trie nodes with two schemes:\n\nSnapshot (core/state/snapshot): Flat account/storage representation for O(1) lookups:\n\nAncient Store (core/rawdb/freezer.go): Append-only storage for immutable historical data (blocks, receipts)\n\nSources: core/state/statedb.go1-1700 triedb/database.go1-600 core/state/snapshot1-1000\n\nGo-ethereum implements peer-to-peer networking for blockchain data exchange:\n\nSnap Sync (default, --syncmode snap):\n\nThe Downloader at eth/downloader/downloader.go coordinates sync across multiple peers with:\n\nSources: eth/downloader/downloader.go1-2000 eth/handler.go1-700 p2p/server.go1-1000\n\nGo-ethereum exposes multiple API interfaces:\n\nThe JSON-RPC implementation is in internal/ethapi with the EthAPIBackend at eth/api_backend.go providing access to blockchain state.\n\nSources: internal/ethapi/api.go1-2400 eth/api_backend.go1-400 node/api.go1-500\n\nPost-merge, go-ethereum operates in tandem with a consensus layer client. The Engine API (eth/catalyst/api.go) implements the execution engine specification:\n\nAuthentication uses JWT tokens specified via --authrpc.jwtsecret. The API listens on port 8551 by default (configurable via --authrpc.port).\n\nFor development, the SimulatedBeacon at eth/catalyst/simulated_beacon.go provides a standalone mode (--dev) that automatically produces blocks without an external consensus client.\n\nSources: eth/catalyst/api.go1-868 eth/catalyst/simulated_beacon.go1-400\n\nThe build system at build/ci.go supports:\n\nThe codebase requires Go 1.23+ and a C compiler (for certain dependencies like KZG commitments).\n\nSources: build/ci.go1-1000 README.md16-31 Makefile1-100\n\nGo-ethereum is a complex, production-grade implementation of the Ethereum execution layer. Its architecture separates concerns into distinct subsystems (state, blockchain, networking, consensus integration) while maintaining clear interfaces between components. The configuration system provides flexibility for different network deployments, and the post-merge Engine API enables seamless integration with any compatible consensus client.\n\nFor deeper exploration of specific subsystems, refer to the subsequent pages in this wiki covering Node Lifecycle, Core Components, Networking, Storage, and APIs.",

    "fullText": "POPOCATÉPETL VOLCANO, Mexico (AP) — In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocatépetl volcano, one of the world’s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.\n\nFor five years, the group from Mexico’s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the whole 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano’s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.\n\nMarco Calò, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute’s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.\n\nInside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.\n\nMost of the world’s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocatépetl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.\n\nOther scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see “how the volcanic edifice was being built,” and above all, where the magma gathered, Calò said.\n\nHis team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.\n\nThe devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.\n\n“I taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo” and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.\n\nLittle by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.\n\nThe result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.\n\nThis first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.\n\nPopocatépetl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.\n\nCalò, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.\n\nHe explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocatépetl, in the first century, had its own “little Pompeii” when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions — using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater — that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.\n\nFor years Calò studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to “understand how something works without touching it” spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.\n\nThat changed with Popocatépetl, a volcano he describes as “majestic.”\n\nAfter hours of walking up the volcano’s flank, Calò’s team sets up camp in a pine grove at about 12,500 feet of elevation, an apparent safe spot from pyroclastic explosions, since the trees have managed to grow to significant height.\n\nA short distance higher on the mountain, the trees and scrub give way to ash and sediment.\n\nThey must cross a lahar, a mixture of rock and ash that during the rainy season becomes a dangerous mudflow carrying away everything in its path. Now, the dry clearing provides a spectacular view: to the east the Pico de Orizaba — Mexico’s tallest volcano and mountain and the dormant volcano La Malinche; to the north, Iztaccíhuatl, an inactive volcanic peak known as “the sleeping woman.”\n\nPopocatépetl’s sounds seem to multiply at night with the echoes. An explosion like a rocket might sound like it’s coming from one direction, but a puff of smoke from the crater belies the real source.\n\nKarina Rodríguez, a 26-year-old master’s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.\n\nHaving direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Calò said.\n\n“We have a natural laboratory here,” he said. It’s “very important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.”\n\nAt 13,780 feet (4,200 meters), their backpacks full of computers, equipment to analyze gases, batteries and water begin to weigh more and their pace slows.\n\nAsh, dark and warm, dominates the landscape here.\n\nAt a seismographic station, the team digs up the equipment and celebrates that it’s still working. They download its data and rebury it.\n\nA “volcanic bomb,” a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.\n\nA bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo’s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.\n\nDigging up one of the last seismic stations, Calò’s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines’ wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.\n\nThe project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.\n\nBut Calò says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side — where there is more accumulated magma — and what implications that could have.\n\nThis was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano’s interior is published. Watching the volcano’s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.\n\n“It’s what drives you to start another project and keep climbing,” Rodríguez, the master's student, said.",

    "fullText": "Gold's amber-colored cousin is quietly moving through the ranks.\n\nCopper, an element seen as central to the AI data center buildout, is on track to post its best year since the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nThe metal's 3-month price on the London Metals Exchange hovered around $12,222 per metric ton on Tuesday, down slightly from a record high of $12,960 per metric ton on Monday. That puts copper up 42% from levels at the start of the year, marking its best year-to-date gains since 2009.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the metal notched its eighth straight day of wins, its longest winning streak in eight years, according to an analysis from top economist David Rosenberg.\n\nFor copper — an industrial that's taken the backseat to precious metals in recent years — there are a few things that explain its blistering rally:\n\nCopper's winning year has largely been fueled by \"relentless supply-deficit concerns,\" Rosenberg wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\nCopper also looks to be partly influenced by a great year for metals all around. Gold, in particular, is up 64% from the start of the year, and tends to take metals like silver and copper up along with it, Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told Business Insider.\n\n\"When the group starts to move, they all move together,\" he said of broader rally in precious metals.\n\nWall Street doesn't think that momentum will die out anytime soon.\n\nAnalysts on JPMorgan's market intelligence team said they expected copper prices to climb to around $12,500 per metric ton in the first half of next year, thanks to tailwinds like AI demand and tariffs being potentially rolled back.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it expected copper to hit $15,000 per metric ton over the next decade, implying 22% upside from the metal's current levels.\n\n\"Copper remains our favorite long-run industrial metal because it faces unique supply constraints and structurally strong demand growth,\" the bank wrote in a client note.",

It may be able to replace the first level of support, but that isn't where companies face the highest cost, he said.\n\n\"It's simply not there yet,\" Kramer said.\n\nThe CEO similarly said that he sees AI boosting engineering capabilities down the line, but for now, its impact is \"modest.\" He said AI may be able to increase effectiveness and productivity to them in specific areas or situations, but it can't replace engineers.\n\nKramer said he's not seeing companies cutting back on engineers or firing them because of AI — even if they've claimed that's what they're doing.\n\n\"I highly suspect that all these companies that said that they are firing engineers because they now have AI actually used AI as a cover story,\" Kramer said.\n\nWhile there has been some indication that entry-level engineering roles are on the decline, many companies have continued to hire engineers amid the AI boom, and some firms, like Cloudflare, have expanded their internship programs.\n\nKramer is the latest CEO to weigh in on the debate about an AI bubble. While the current investment landscape shares some similarities to that of the dot-com era, some execs think that we're in a different situation today because AI has shown more of an impact in the past few years.\n\nIndustry leaders are split on the topic. The CEO of Nvidia, the chipmaker that's fueling the AI revolution, has denied the existence of an AI bubble, while Mark Zuckerberg has said the bigger risk is not spending enough.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI's Sam Altman, who led the AI takeoff with the launch of ChatGPT, and frequently champions the technology, has said investors are \"overexcited about AI.\"\n\nEven with a solid ChatGPT prompt, there's no crystal ball to know exactly how this will end.",

    "fullText": "Andrej Karpathy has long been ahead.\n\nHe was ahead of the AI boom, having worked as a founding member of OpenAI in 2015, long before competitors like Anthropic and xAI emerged. He also got into self-driving vehicles early, steering Tesla's autopilot effort as its head of AI.\n\nNow, he says, \"I've never felt this much behind as a programmer.\"\n\nIn an X post on Friday, Karpathy wrote that the industry was being \"dramatically refactored,\" as individual programmers contribute fewer and fewer lines of code.\n\n\"I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year,\" he wrote. \"A failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue.\"\n\nI've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become…\n\nAI has radically transformed the software engineering industry, introducing code editors like Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex, along with a slew of agentic software development tools. Business Insider's Amanda Hoover called 2025 \"the year coding changed forever.\"\n\nKarpathy was a key player in the change. In February, he coined the term \"vibe coding.\" To vibe code, one prompts AI to generate lines of code. (It gets its name because developers \"fully give in to the vibes,\" Karpathy wrote in his original post.) The Collins Dictionary named it the word of the year.\n\nStill, Karpathy wrote that it's like a \"powerful alien tool\" was handed out without a manual.\n\n\"Everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession,\" he wrote.\n\nIn the comments, another one of the biggest names in vibe-coding agreed. Boris Cherny created Claude Code for Anthropic, now one of the most popular AI tools among developers.\n\nCherny wrote that he felt that way \"most weeks,\" and that he sometimes finds himself approaching a problem manually, not yet realizing AI can do it faster.\n\nNew graduates and early career coders may fare best in this new environment, Cherny wrote, because they don't assume what AI can and cannot do.\n\n\"It takes significant mental work to re-adjust to what the model can do every month or two, as models continue to become better and better at coding and engineering,\" he wrote.\n\nResponding to Cherny, Karpathy wrote that he had similar experiences. He analogized the new tools to a weapon, one that sometimes \"shoots pellets\" or \"misfires\" — highlighting the work-in-progress nature of AI.\n\nOther times, though, the tools work wonders.\n\n\"Once in a while when you hold it just right a powerful beam of laser erupts and melts your problem,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Meta is seen as lagging  behind OpenAI and Google in the AI race. Its acquisition of Singapore-based AI startup Manus could help with that.",
    "fullText": "AI dealmaking isn't slowing down — and it's Meta's turn again.\n\nThe social media giant is buying Manus, a Singapore-based artificial intelligence startup, the companies announced on Monday.\n\nManus went viral in March when it previewed an AI agent that could autonomously perform tasks like screening résumés and stock analysis. Manus was created in China but relocated to Singapore in mid-2025. Meta paid more than $2 billion for Manus, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe deal is the latest in a flurry of red-hot AI investment and acquisitions this year, which includes Meta's $14 billion investment in Scale AI in June. From providing an instant AI revenue source to giving it a leg up in AI agents, here's why buying Manus could give Meta a much-needed boost in the AI race.\n\nManus said in December that it had processed more than 147 trillion tokens of text and said its users were in the \"millions.\" It also claimed to have crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, achieving both milestones eight months after launch.\n\nThose numbers tell us Meta is getting a startup with a built-in audience of paying users. Meta's business model to date has largely revolved around building free products and making money from collecting user data and targeted advertising. Manus offers a free tier for basic tasks, but charges users up to $200 a month for its pro tier.\n\n\"The purchase gives Meta a functioning business with paying customers, meaningful revenue and infrastructure already proven at scale,\" said Murthy Grandhi, company profiles analyst at research firm GlobalData, in a note.\n\nIn its announcement, Meta said it plans to continue selling the Manus service separately while also integrating Manus's technology into its existing platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta did not elaborate on which ones or how it might do so. Meta has poured billions into building up its internal AI teams and developing what is termed \"superintelligence,\" with so far little in terms of returns. Manus could be a way for Meta to start making money directly from AI while it continues to build out its internal efforts.\n\nMeta has struggled to wow consumers and developers as much as OpenAI and Google when it comes to raw model power. However, as these models become increasingly commoditized, there is a growing need to show AI can actually be useful. One such way is AI agents, a type of software that can proactively make decisions and take actions, such as creating a marketing campaign or monitoring and fixing bugs in apps.\n\nBuying Manus could prove a smart bet on the idea that the real value will lie in the programs that sit on top of the models. Manus primarily uses other companies' AI models, like Anthropic's Claude, as building blocks and layers its own software on top.\n\n\"People keep assuming a small update from OpenAI or Google will wipe out a lot of AI startups,\" wrote Yuchen Jin, CEO of the AI startup Hyperbolic, in an X post about Meta's Manus deal. \"But in reality, the AI application layer should be where most of the opportunity is.\"\n\nA Meta spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about which models Manus would support following the acquisition.\n\nOne of Meta's strengths is that its platforms are used by billions of people, which, like Google, gives it a distribution advantage. Its challenge is to find ways to keep them coming back.\n\nUnlike Google with Gemini 3, Meta has yet to have a buzzy AI breakthrough moment with its own in-house models. Combining Manus's \"general-purpose agents\" with Meta's distribution channels gives the social media company another shot at that, particularly as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged that Facebook has shifted from being a place for friends to view each other's content to a \"broad discovery and entertainment space.\"\n\n\"Manus offers a ready-made, high-margin software layer that can be sold directly and integrated across Meta's consumer and enterprise products,\" said GlobalData's Grandhi.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.\n\nThe rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told ​by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.\n\nThe mandate is one of the most ‌significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.\n\nWhile those U.S. export restrictions blocked ‌the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.\n\nApplications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.\n\n\"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%,\" one source told Reuters. \"Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment.\"\n\nChina's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish ⁠to be identified as the measure is not public.\n\nChina's President ‌Xi Jinping has been calling for a \"whole nation\" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.\n\nThe effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum. Reuters reported earlier this month that Chinese scientists are working on a prototype ‍of a machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome that Washington has spent years trying to prevent.\n\n\"Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance,\" a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology said, referring to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.\n\n\"But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers.\"",

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "From Disney's $1 billion bet on OpenAI to a wave of blockbuster acquihires, these deals reshaped the tech industry in 2025.",
    "fullText": "While most of the industry was out of office over the holidays, Nvidia and SoftBank's deal teams were grinding.\n\nBoth companies chose the year's quietest stretch to drop news that was anything but: SoftBank said Monday it will acquire digital infrastructure investor DigitalBridge for about $4 billion.\n\nNvidia's move was stranger still. On Christmas Eve, it announced a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement\" with Groq, the startup behind custom chips designed to handle AI inference — the real-time work that powers chatbot replies. The companies did not disclose financial terms.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't call it an acquisition, the guts of the arrangement looked familiar. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, along with top engineering staff, will head to Nvidia. Groq, last valued at $6.9 billion in a funding round three months ago, will continue to operate independently.\n\nIt's the latest example of a new kind of tech dealmaking, where the founder and key engineers get bought out, the technology gets siphoned off, and the startup itself is left in limbo.\n\nThat's the vibe of 2025: big, hairy deals that refuse to stay inside the lines.\n\nThe industry's biggest moves weren't just splashy acquisitions or eye-watering funding rounds. (We saw those deals, too.) They were sprawling, hard-to-categorize transactions. Money came tied to compute. Licensing came paired with talent raids. Infrastructure deals locked governments and corporate America into yearslong dependencies. These weren't neat mergers or simple checks. They were power grabs that shifted the balance of Silicon Valley and beyond.\n\nThese were the eight deals that defined the year in AI, ranked from smallest to largest by dollar value.\n\nNvidia ended the year doing the same thing that turned heads all year: extracting founders from their startups and leaving other employees to figure it out.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced it had entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq. The financial terms were undisclosed.\n\nUnder the agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, as well as the startup's president and other team members, will join Nvidia, the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of over $4.5 trillion.\n\nGroq will continue to operate as an independent company, with CFO Simon Edwards assuming the CEO role.\n\nDisney struck a three-year licensing agreement with OpenAI in December, becoming the first major content partner for Sora, OpenAI's video generator.\n\nThe deal isn't just about rights. Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI and receive warrants to buy additional equity — a structure that ties content, distribution, and upside together.\n\nBusiness Insider reporter Lucia Moses argues the logic can be summed up in one word: engagement. Time spent on Disney+ and other major streaming services has remained essentially flat in recent years, she writes, while YouTube and social video continue to grow.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership could help Disney meet audiences where they already are, by allowing fans to use tools like ChatGPT and Sora to generate and remix content featuring Disney characters.\n\nDeveloper coding assistant Windsurf was a startup Cinderella story. Then it became a cautionary tale.\n\nThe company was in talks to sell to OpenAI for $3 billion this past spring. The deal fell apart at the last minute.\n\nGoogle emerged as a new suitor. Instead of an outright acquisition, Google said it would pay $2.4 billion to hire its CEO and top talent, as well as license the company's intellectual property.\n\nThe deal effectively split Windsurf into two pieces, with the hundreds of remaining employees ending up at Cognition, another AI coding startup. That left some with a bitter taste.\n\nPart of the social contract in startups is that early employees work long hours at lower pay in the hope that they will share in the riches should their startup eventually get acquired or go public.\n\nNow, traditional acquisitions have become rarer because of the time and uncertainty of getting regulatory approval. As a result, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have been getting creative, using licensing deals to skirt regulators and snap up key talent.\n\nSoftBank snapped up a private equity firm with the ultimate goal of controlling more of the physical infrastructure behind AI.\n\nOn Monday, SoftBank said it has entered into an agreement to acquire DigitalBridge, an alternative asset manager that invests in data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, and power that make the AI boom possible.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe deal comes as SoftBank reshuffles its portfolio. In November, the company said it had sold nearly $6 billion of Nvidia stock to free up cash for OpenAI. SoftBank is also doubling down on \"physical AI,\" building a robotics beachhead with a dedicated investment arm and a pending deal to buy ABB's robotics business.\n\nThe Trump administration agreed to take a 9.9% stake in Intel in August. It was a rare moment when Washington wasn't just regulating an industry or subsidizing it, but buying into it.\n\nUnder the terms Intel disclosed, the government will invest $8.9 billion for 433.3 million shares, and the stake is to be passive, with no board seat.\n\nThe investment aims to bolster domestic capacity for designing and manufacturing advanced chips. Intel has seen foreign competitors, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, cut into its market share of advanced chips. The White House has said it is a national security risk if industries continue to import the vast majority of advanced chips from overseas.\n\nThis also likely won't be the last deal of its kind. President Donald Trump and top aides have floated the idea of doing similar deals with American defense contractors and have considered a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOne of the year's biggest deals sparked the question: Was Meta really spending $14 billion to hire a 28-year-old?\n\nAlexandr Wang cofounded and ran Scale AI, the data-labeling company that helps enterprises train and deploy AI models by supplying high-quality training data and tooling. In June, Meta agreed to pay $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI — and, just as importantly, to bring Wang in to lead its next act in AI.\n\nWang became Meta's chief AI officer and the public face of its superintelligence push, with a mandate that goes well beyond building better chatbots. His job is to convince elite researchers that Meta is the place to do their life's work — and to turn the company's key advantage, its compute budget, into a lasting edge.\n\nWhen Google agreed to buy Israeli-American cloud security firm Wiz earlier this year, it threw a $32 billion bucket of water on the idea that the mega-deal drought would persist.\n\nIn March, Google agreed to acquire the startup at an all-cash price roughly equal to Iceland's gross domestic product last year, pending regulatory sign-off. This marks the search giant's largest acquisition.\n\nThe acquisition served as an early litmus test of the Trump administration's willingness to greenlight pricey Big Tech mergers and acquisitions. The deal passed an antitrust review by the Department of Justice in November, clearing a key hurdle to closing.\n\nTrump kicked off his second term by unveiling a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build a chain of data centers across the US — a project called Stargate that aims to invest $500 billion in domestic infrastructure by 2029.\n\nIn Abilene, Texas, a flagship data center has already opened. Construction crews have broken ground on Stargate sites in Lordstown, Ohio, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, with several more campuses to come.\n\nTo make the ongoing buildout a success, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has estimated it could take one-fifth of the nation's existing skilled trade workforce.",

    "title": "Google AI Overviews had the last laugh this year. My big 'glue pizza' moment is no more.",
    "description": "Google's AI told me to make pizza with glue in 2024, so I tried it. Zing! But this year, Google got the last laugh. AI overviews are pretty good.",
    "fullText": "It truly brings me no joy to admit this, but now that it's the end of 2025, I can see that Google's AI Overviews, for as much as I goofed on them for being clumsy and bad, are having the last laugh.\n\nThis realization comes after, in 2024, I totally dunked on Google after its AI told me to use glue to help cheese stick to pizza. So, in a moment of internet infamy, I did just that: I made my glue pizza, and even ate a piece.\n\nThe other day, my editor and I were discussing the state of the AI Overviews. We thought the overviews were pretty abysmal at the start of the year — but we now admit to each other that we use them — instead of traditional search — a lot of the time these days.\n\nOf course, the fact that people (such as myself) are willing to use the AI Overview answer in Google instead of clicking on a link and sending traffic to a website that perhaps employs humans to make that content (such as myself) is not necessarily great.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews launched in the spring of 2024, and immediately, people noticed they often, uh, sucked. The answers they gave were full of absurd inaccuracies.\n\nOne example that went viral on social media was its answer for how to stop the cheese from sliding off your pizza — Google AI suggested adding glue to the sauce, which it seemed to have lifted from a joke on Reddit.\n\nAs a journalist with a commitment to seeking the truth, I actually made a pizza with glue in the sauce and ate it (I'm a trained professional idiot; don't try this at home).\n\nThis year, people noticed that Google AI Overviews still were full of problems. One particularly amusing issue was what we'll call the \"You can't lick a badger twice\" problem: give it a nonsense phrase, and it would accept this as a real idiom and try to explain it.\n\nSomeone on Threads noticed you can type any random sentence into Google, then add “meaning” afterwards, and you’ll get an AI explanation of a famous idiom or phrase you just made up. Here is mine\n\n[image or embed]\n\nTo test more, I made up a few of my own fake idioms like \"you can't fit a duck in a pencil\" and \"the road is full of salsa,\" and indeed, AI Overviews gave explanations for what those phrases meant. Here's what I wrote at the time, back in April:\n\nBut things are getting better. When I tried a fake idiom just the other day (\"you can't tell a yak not to dance\"), it gave a more reasonably accurate answer that it was \"not a common, established idiom, but rather a playful or poetic expression,\" and suggested potential interpretations. Fair enough.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews are getting less laughably bad, and just, well … useful.\n\nI've gotten more used to seeing them, and as I get used to them, I've also gotten better at predicting if the type of query I'm posing is the kind of thing an AI Overview can answer. And it's working more often than it isn't.",

    "description": "Antoine Wade said everyone has the same amount of time in a day to learn about AI tools, and in this moment, everyone is competing.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee who is based in San Antonio. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started to use AI around 2022 when ChatGPT first launched. It was unlike any technology that I've come across and I started to leverage it in my personal and professional life.\n\nInitially, it helped me craft emails. I work in tech sales and I have to do a lot of cold outreaches. My job is to write messages that resonate with various leaders and ChatGPT helped me with that.\n\nOnce I started using it at work, I realized that as a sports coach and father, there was so much more I could use it for, like sending post-practice communication to parents, building schedules, or putting together statistics of how the game went. Tasks that used to take me days took me literal minutes.\n\nNow I use AI everyday, and I've experimented with different tools. I use Claude to help with business communication and content generation. I use Perplexity for deep research, and Gemini for image generation. I use these tools for a combination of personal, professional, and educational use-cases. I've learned how to install an air conditioner and how to teach my son 6th grade math.\n\nMy company has also given me access to tools that have been really powerful in sales. It can help with gaining a better understanding of the customer in a minute's notice.\n\nFor example, tools like Salesforce Sales Navigator can pinpoint almost the exact person that may be looking for the product I'm selling. Now when I reach out to that person, the conversation will be more fruitful than it would if it were a completely random cold call.\n\nAI hasn't helped me close deals — I'm the one that's built those relationships with customers — but I've seen an increase in my pipeline because I'm able to reach more clients with the data and messaging.\n\nWhen I'm able to understand the customer better, I'm able to communicate more effectively, which leads to building a better pipeline, which ultimately leads to making more money.\n\nWhile people may have access to the same tools, it's still up to the user to put the data together and craft the right prompts. I've been experimenting with so many automation tools that I've developed a secret sauce.\n\nIf I'm creating prompts that give me a better message, which leads to a better outcome, I may not share it with others because I want to see if it works and if it's going to give me a competitive advantage.\n\nWe all have the same amount of time in a day to learn these things. So if I'm putting more time toward learning more about prompt engineering or how AI is supposed to work, then I don't necessarily want to share those learnings with someone else. In this moment, we're all competing.\n\nI will absolutely help someone if they ask, but there are certain details I'm not as forthcoming about. I may share some of those learnings with some of my closest friends or people I feel I can learn from, but that doesn't mean I'm sharing it with everybody.\n\nSales is very competitive and while companies are choosing to have conversations around AI, some people may not be as comfortable sharing how they're leveraging it because that may be their competitive advantage.\n\nWhen people ask if I use AI, I say \"absolutely, yes.\" But there's only a certain amount of people that I'm going into a deeper conversations about AI with.",

    "fullText": "I successfully failed with a literature related project and accidentally built a ChatGPT detector. Then I spoke to the people who uploaded ChatGPT generated content on Wikipedia.\n\nIt began as a standard maintenance project: I wanted to write a tool to find and fix broken ISBN references in Wikipedia. Using the built-in checksum, this seemed like a straightforward technical task. I expected to find mostly typos. But I also found texts generated by LLMs. These models are effective at creating plausible-sounding content, but (for now) they often fail to generate correct checksums for identifiers like ISBNs. This vulnerability turned my tool into an unintentional detector for this type of content. This talk is the story of that investigation. I'll show how the tool works and how it identifies this anti-knowledge. But the tech is only half the story. The other half is human. I contacted the editors who had added this undeclared AI content.

    "fullText": "From Stanley Tucci’s imperious tech titan to Lex Luthor’s distractingly hot CEO and Elon Musk-esque blowhards, films this year took us inside the billionaire mindset\n\nBetween the slash-and-burn US government reboot led by a dank meme fan and the relentless pushing of AI by venture capital-backed blowhards, 2025 has felt like peak obnoxious tech bro. Fittingly, jargon-spouting, self-regarding digital visionaries also became Hollywood’s go-to baddies this year in everything from blockbusters to slapstick spoofs. Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.\n\nWith such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto on The Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe. But even the great cocktail-maker couldn’t squeeze much out of sour existential proclamations such as: “Our world is a tyre fire floating on an ocean of piss.”\n\nThere was more baldness in Superman, where Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor embodied the worst kind of wannabe paradigm-changer: one desperate to appear on talkshows. Incensed that the world seemed to be ignoring his genius in favour of a flying alien do-gooder, the LuthorCorp founder spent a fortune to rig social media, deploying an army of vivisected monkey cyborgs to swamp platforms with anti-Superman hashtags and memes. That the film itself was met with farmed outrage about perceived wokeness added a disconcerting hall-of-mirrors feel to what was essentially an overstuffed crowdpleaser. Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.\n\nIs it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thriller M3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.\n\nIf Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr in The Naked Gun reboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.\n\nIn the goopy, grungy world of The Toxic Avenger reboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such as Bryan Johnson.\n\nIn 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulish Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby in Tron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully from the original 1982 Tron – seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes. A wildly expensive, resource-intensive, essentially useless product? Intentionally or not, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the AI bubble.\n\nBut why stop at just one douchey tech bro? Jesse Armstrong’s jagged satire Mountainhead took the bold step of making every single character the absolute worst of the “move fast, break stuff” billionaire mindset, isolating them – and the viewer – in a remote, repellently deluxe ski lodge while the spectre of possible Armageddon encroached. As the Musk-alike owner of a social media app spreading dangerous AI-augmented misinformation, Cory Michael Smith captured the glib, morality-agnostic tone of someone richer than God who views the world as their plaything.\n\nAs Venis (Smith), silverback investor Randall (Steve Carell), canny algorithm tamer Jeff (Ramy Youssef) and would-be wellness app supremo Souper (Jason Schwartzman) relentlessly needled each other, there was the illicit thrill of dialling into the combative quartet’s inside-baseball repartee of boasting, toasting and roasting. But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible. We have all been forced to absorb the pathologies of our tech overlords due to their disproportionate influence in the real world. As a new cinema year looms, is it too much to ask that we don’t have to keep doing it at the movies too?",

    "fullText": "Great Britain's Olympic and Paralympic teams are going to need to harness artificial intelligence and work together more closely in order to continue their success at recent Games, UK Sport chairman Nick Webborn says.\n\nIn his first interview since taking up the role, the head of the elite sport funding agency told BBC Sport: \"We've been a really successful nation, and to maintain that position or to even go higher, we're going to have to do things differently.\n\n\"It's about how we think smarter now, how we utilise things like AI appropriately in sport, how we work together as different sports bodies, rather than in silos.\n\n\"I think we're now in a frame of mind where we're united and moving together, that sharing of information between sports is happening much more than ever before.\n\n\"And we're going to need to do that to maintain ourselves in our position on the medal table.\"\n\nThis year, UK Sport announced British athletes would be offered a new form of AI-based protection from online abuse, and Webborn wants the technology to help with talent ID, injury prevention and remote classification assessments in Paralympic sport.\n\nTeam GB's 65 medals at the last summer Olympics at Paris 2024 equalled their haul at London 2012.\n\nHowever, their tally of 14 gold medals saw them drop from fourth to seventh place in the medal table, their lowest position for 20 years.\n\n\"We want to continue to punch above our weight. We always have done,\" says Webborn.\n\n\"And it's those little things, how we convert those silvers into gold, that just push you up that medal table a little bit higher.\n\n\"The Paralympic team have been brilliant, they've been second in the medal table behind China for the last several Games, but other nations are pushing them. But I believe the character and the innovation that we have in the UK will continue to keep us there.\n\n\"The collaboration between Olympic and Paralympic sports has never been better. You can definitely see that in the discussions that they're having. We're learning from each other.\"\n\nUK Sport has not yet revealed a medal target for the upcoming Winter Games in Milan and Cortina in Italy, but Webborn is optimistic.\n\n\"The current group of athletes are having some amazing success in this early season, it's great to see. That doesn't always transfer into medals at the Games, but we're in a really good place,\" he says.",

It redefines the true meaning of ARR and analyzes how the revenue structure of many AI companies resembles a brokerage or reseller model rather than SaaS. Using the analogy of investors who only inflate transaction volume, it presents—from a consulting perspective—why repeatability, margins, and control are far more critical than the magnitude of the numbers.",
    "fullText": "In recent feeds and headlines covering AI startups, a certain phrase repeats with exhausting frequency:\n\"Reached $X million ARR in just n months.\"\n\nAt first, it is impressive.\nThe second time, it invites skepticism.\n\nThis is not merely a matter of accounting tricks or semantic hair-splitting.\nIt is a fundamental question about the structure of AI businesses, their sustainability, and how we ought to interpret the numbers presented to us.\n\nARR stands for Annual Recurring Revenue.\nThe two operative words here carry weight.\n\nThese are run-rates.\nARR is not a prediction; it is a result verified by time.\n\nFundamentally,\nFor a company less than a year old to claim ARR is, conceptually, a contradiction.\n\nThe year has not passed.\nThe recurrence has not been proven.\n\nARR is the lingua franca of SaaS.\nAnd the language of SaaS invariably connotes:\n\nThus, many AI companies,\neven those far from reaching that stage,\nborrow the term ARR to describe their finances.\n\nThe problem begins exactly there.\n\nPeer slightly beneath the surface of many AI startup revenue structures, and a pattern emerges.\n\nIn this structure, the portion the company actually retains is but a fraction of the total payment.\n\nHere, the correct concept is GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).\n\nGMV represents the total value of merchandise sold through a platform.\nThe critical distinction is this:\n\nIf a platform mediates a transaction and takes a commission,\nGMV ≠ Revenue.\n\nThe illusion specific to the AI industry arises here.\n\nOn the surface, it mimics SaaS perfectly.\n\nIn this structure, calling GMV \"ARR\" is,\nAn act of consuming an unproven future as a present achievement.\n\nTo put it more bluntly,\nit borders on a bluff designed to induce a financing illusion.\n\n\"Model costs are dropping, so even if margins are thin now, they will improve.\"\n\nThis statement is only half true.\n\nTechnology costs do decrease.\nHowever, demand always migrates to the newest, most powerful models.\n\nOf course, low-cost models have their place—simple tasks, non-competitive domains.\n\nBut the question remains:\nIs the product you are building truly that kind of product?\n\nWe are cognitively greedy.\nGiven the same time and money, we desire the smarter brain.\n\nUltimately, the discussion boils down to one thing.\n\nNeither is inherently right or wrong.\nBut how they are valued must be completely different.\n\nA large GMV does not equate to a solid foundation.\n\nThe spectacle of GMV-first growth often reminds me of a familiar scene.\n\nThe investor with $10,000 of capital,\nwho trades dozens of times a day,\nboasting, \"I moved millions in transaction volume this month.\"\n\nThe trades are many.\nThe numbers are large.\nBut what actually remains?\n\nMostly transaction fees paid to the exchange.\nThe volume swells, but the asset base barely moves.\n\nAI startups obsessed with GMV are not so different.\n\nBut the vast majority of that flow\npasses through to model providers and infrastructure giants,\nleaking straight out of the building.\n\nTo discuss GMV as if it were ARR in this context is\nnot a demonstration of capital control,\nbut rather an attempt to prove competence via the sheer volume of money that passed through one's hands.\n\nFrom a consulting perspective, the questions are simple.\n\nARR is not a marketing slogan.\nIt is a report card proving that a financial structure has withstood the test of time.\n\nGMV can be a signal of growth.\nBut it is, at best, a process metric.\nIt cannot substitute for the foundation.\n\nIn the AI era, numbers have become larger and faster.\nThat is precisely why we must be more honest with our terminology.\n\nThe moment you slap the label of ARR onto GMV,\nthe business begins to look solid,\nbut in reality, it is being built on sand.\n\nTime will eventually reveal the truth.\nWhether you were a company that made many trades,\nor a company that accumulated value.\n\nTime always distinguishes the two.",

    "description": "Antoine Wade said everyone has the same amount of time in a day to learn about AI tools, and in this moment, everyone is competing.",
    "fullText": "Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee, uses AI daily for personal and professional tasks.\n\nHe said AI has helped him grow his pipeline by letting him communicate more effectively and understand customers better.\n\nHe said he keeps some of his AI strategies private to maintain a competitive advantage in sales.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Antoine Wade, a tech sales employee who is based in San Antonio. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started to use AI around 2022 when ChatGPT first launched. It was unlike any technology that I've come across and I started to leverage it in my personal and professional life.\n\nInitially, it helped me craft emails. I work in tech sales and I have to do a lot of cold outreaches. My job is to write messages that resonate with various leaders and ChatGPT helped me with that.\n\nOnce I started using it at work, I realized that as a sports coach and father, there was so much more I could use it for, like sending post-practice communication to parents, building schedules, or putting together statistics of how the game went. Tasks that used to take me days took me literal minutes.\n\nNow I use AI everyday, and I've experimented with different tools. I use Claude to help with business communication and content generation. I use Perplexity for deep research, and Gemini for image generation. I use these tools for a combination of personal, professional, and educational use-cases. I've learned how to install an air conditioner and how to teach my son 6th grade math.\n\nMy company has also given me access to tools that have been really powerful in sales. It can help with gaining a better understanding of the customer in a minute's notice.\n\nFor example, tools like Salesforce Sales Navigator can pinpoint almost the exact person that may be looking for the product I'm selling. Now when I reach out to that person, the conversation will be more fruitful than it would if it were a completely random cold call.\n\nAI hasn't helped me close deals — I'm the one that's built those relationships with customers — but I've seen an increase in my pipeline because I'm able to reach more clients with the data and messaging.\n\nWhen I'm able to understand the customer better, I'm able to communicate more effectively, which leads to building a better pipeline, which ultimately leads to making more money.\n\nWhile people may have access to the same tools, it's still up to the user to put the data together and craft the right prompts. I've been experimenting with so many automation tools that I've developed a secret sauce.\n\nIf I'm creating prompts that give me a better message, which leads to a better outcome, I may not share it with others because I want to see if it works and if it's going to give me a competitive advantage.\n\nWe all have the same amount of time in a day to learn these things. So if I'm putting more time toward learning more about prompt engineering or how AI is supposed to work, then I don't necessarily want to share those learnings with someone else. In this moment, we're all competing.\n\nI will absolutely help someone if they ask, but there are certain details I'm not as forthcoming about. I may share some of those learnings with some of my closest friends or people I feel I can learn from, but that doesn't mean I'm sharing it with everybody.\n\nSales is very competitive and while companies are choosing to have conversations around AI, some people may not be as comfortable sharing how they're leveraging it because that may be their competitive advantage.\n\nWhen people ask if I use AI, I say \"absolutely, yes.\" But there's only a certain amount of people that I'm going into a deeper conversations about AI with.",

    "description": "China is weighing new controls on AI training, requiring consent before chat logs can be used to improve chatbots and virtual companions.",
    "fullText": "China is moving to tighten one of the most common ways AI systems improve: Learning directly from conversations with users.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China said in a statement published Saturday that it has drafted measures that would restrict how AI platforms can collect and use chat logs for model training.\n\nThe proposal aims to ensure that \"human-like\" interactive AI services, including chatbots and virtual companions, are safe and secure for users, the statement said.\n\nChina encourages innovation in \"human-like\" interactive AI, but will pair that with governance and prudent, tiered supervision to \"prevent abuse and loss of control,\" it added.\n\nUnder the draft rules, platforms would need to inform users when they are interacting with AI and provide options to access or delete their chat history. Using conversation data for model training — or sharing it with third parties — would require explicit user consent, the agency said.\n\nFor minors, providers would need additional consent from a guardian before sharing their conversation data with third parties. Guardians would also have the right to request deletion of a minor's chat history.\n\nThe draft measures are open for public consultation, with feedback due in late January.\n\nIf finalized, the rules could slow the pace at which AI chatbots improve, Lian Jye Su, the chief analyst at Omdia, a technology research and consulting firm, told Business Insider.\n\nRestricting access to chat logs may \"limit the human-feedback mechanisms in reinforcement learning, which has been critical to the rise of engaging and accurate conversational AI,\" Su said.\n\nThat said, China's AI ecosystem is \"robust,\" and the country has access to massive public and proprietary datasets, he added.\n\nSu said the move aligns with Beijing's broader emphasis on national security and the collective public interest. Tightening controls over chat logs signals that certain user conversations are too sensitive to be treated as free training data, he added.\n\nWei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider these provisions \"function less as brakes and more as directional signals.\"\n\n\"The emphasis is on protecting users and preventing opaque data practices, rather than constraining innovation,\" she said.\n\nSun said the draft encourages providers — once safety and reliability are proven — to expand the use of human-like AI across more application areas, including cultural dissemination and companionship for older adults.\n\n\"In the context of a rapidly aging population, they can be read as an explicit policy nudge to accelerate the development of human-like AI interactions in a regulated, socially constructive, and scalable manner,\" she added.\n\nChina's new draft rules on chatlog data come as concerns grow over how AI companies handle deeply personal user conversations.\n\nBusiness Insider reported in August that contract workers employed by Meta and other tech giants can read user conversations with chatbots as part of the process of evaluating AI responses.\n\nSeveral contractors told Business Insider that the material they reviewed contained sensitive details that could be used to identify individual users. Many of the conversations were highly personal, including exchanges that resembled therapy sessions, private chats with close friends, or intimate conversations with romantic partners.\n\nMeta's AI terms of service said that it \"may review\" user chatlogs with its AI products, either through automated systems or human reviewers.\n\nA Meta spokesperson told Business Insider that the company has \"strict policies\" over who can access personal data.\n\n\"While we work with contractors to help improve training data quality, we intentionally limit what personal information they see, and we have processes and guardrails in place instructing them how to handle any such information they may encounter,\" the spokesperson said in the August report.\n\nA Google engineer in AI security told Business Insider earlier this month that there are certain things he would never share with chatbots.\n\n\"AI models use data to generate helpful responses, and we users need to protect our private information so that harmful entities, like cybercriminals and data brokers, can't access it,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Bubble or no bubble, AI won't have just one winner, says Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nOn an episode of the \"Sourcery\" podcast released on Monday, the former DreamWorks CEO turned investor said 2026 will sift out companies that are producing real outcomes with AI from those that aren't.\n\n\"Rather than look at it from the sort of extreme notion of what that means for a bubble to burst, I think there'll be a reckoning here in which those that actually are producing real results and are being deployed in really effective and efficient ways,\" he said when asked about whether the AI bubble could pop next year.\n\nHe added: \"It's not going to be a zero-sum game, a winner-take-all. But I also think at the same time, not everybody is going to win at this.\"\n\nKatzenberg served as chairman of Walt Disney Studios for 10 years until 1994 and cofounded DreamWorks after his departure. As DreamWorks' CEO, he oversaw the production of hits like \"Shrek,\" \"Madagascar,\" and \"Kung Fu Panda.\"\n\nHe stepped down in 2016 and cofounded the venture capital firm WndrCo with former Dropbox Chief Financial Officer Sujay Jaswa in 2017. WndrCo's investments include Cursor, Harvey, and Figma.\n\nWndrCo's general partner, ChenLi Wang, also shared on the podcast how he and Katzenberg evaluate startups in the AI era.\n\n\"First, I think through our entire careers pre-WndrCo, Jeffrey's entire career, we've been people people,\" Wang said. \"The ingenuity and creativity of people and how magical their spikes are, and how, when you complement people and what they can create together, is the secret sauce.\"\n\nWang added that he and Katzenberg have never \"assessed our best humans based on benchmarks.\"\n\n\"I mean, how many years have people have parents complained about standardized testing dumbing down their kids,\" Wang said. \"And yet, I think we're going down the same route with the first wave of benchmarks.\"\n\nLike the two partners, research scientists have also criticized benchmarks because they overvalue superficial traits.\n\nIn a March blog post, Dean Valentine, the cofounder and CEO of AI security startup ZeroPath, said that \"recent AI model progress feels mostly like bullshit.\"\n\nValentine said that he and his team had been evaluating the performance of different models claiming to have \"some sort of improvement\" since the release of Anthropic's 3.5 Sonnet in June 2024. None of the new models his team tried had made a \"significant difference\" in his company's internal benchmarks or in developers' abilities to find new bugs, he said.\n\nIn a February paper titled \"Can we trust AI Benchmarks?\" researchers at the European Commission's Joint Research Center found that major issues exist in the current evaluation approach.\n\nThe researchers said that benchmarks \"often prioritize state-of-the-art performance at the expense of broader societal concerns.\"",

    "fullText": "Asia In Brief China’s Cyberspace Administration on Saturday posted draft rules governing the behaviour of AI companions that prohibit using them to serve as friends for the elderly.\n\nThe draft “Interim Measures for the Administration of Humanized Interactive Services Based on Artificial Intelligence” opens with a suggestion that China needs regulations to ensure the healthy development of AIs that “engage in emotional interaction with humans.”\n\nAs is always the case with China’s tech regulations, the draft calls for providers of companion AIs to ensure they are secure, don’t expose users to fraud, encrypt data, and reflect core socialist values. It also includes a requirement for parental controls, and for protection of data that describes minors.\n\nOne Article in the draft addresses how AI companions interact with the elderly:\n\nProviders shall guide elderly people to set up emergency contact persons for their services. If any elderly person is found to be in danger of losing their life, health or property during the use of the service, the provider shall promptly notify the emergency contact person and provide social and psychological assistance or emergency relief channels.\n\nProviders are prohibited from providing services that simulate the relatives or specific relationships of elderly users.\n\nThe draft also calls for AI companions to remind users they are not interacting with a human every two hours, and for providers of such systems to provide advance notice of outages.\n\nAlso among the draft requirements are calls for “mental health protection, emotional boundary guidance, and dependency risk warning, and should not use replacing social interaction, controlling users' psychology, or inducing addiction as design goals.”\n\nThe draft also prohibits using data gathered during interaction with AI companies to train models.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration wants feedback on the draft by January 25th.\n\nAustralia’s Department of Defence has tapped Google for an “enhanced, secure and air-gapped hyperscale cloud capability.”\n\n“Defence will have access to advanced global cloud solutions to deliver key sovereign capabilities,” states the department’s announcement of the deal. “The technology will support faster rollout of critical systems, ongoing upgrades and improved cooperation with international partners, while ensuring Australia retains control of critical Defence assets.”\n\nAustralia’s government already has a deal with AWS to operate three datacenters dedicated to government workloads, including information rated as the nation’s “most classified data.”\n\nThe Department said the sensitivities of the Google deal mean it will “refrain from providing further commentary … with all specific details remaining strictly confidential.”\n\nJapan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has published its initial analysis of the failed launch of its H3 rocket last week.\n\nThe agency found that when the rocket’s fairing separated, pressure in a fuel tank fell. When the engine that used the fuel tank ignited, it produced around 80 percent of expected pressure.\n\nThe rocket’s second stage and payload therefore could not reach the intended orbit. The report suggests both fell into Earth’s atmosphere and burned up safely.\n\n57 percent of components present in Huawei smartphones are now made in China, according to a product teardown reported by Japanese outlet Nikkei.\n\nWorking with Japanese teardown service Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, Nikkei analyzed the content of 2024’s Mate 70 Pro and this year’s Pura 80 Pro, and found 57 percent of components in both were made in China, and that those parts accounted for 60 percent of the phone’s value.\n\nNikkei reports that just 19 percent of components in Huawei’s 2020 models came from China, rising to 32 percent in 2023.\n\nPapua New Guinea’s (PNG’s) National Information & Communications Technology Authority has warned signatories to a petition calling for Starlink to be licensed for operations in the country that they risk prosecution.\n\nPNG is a rugged country with poor telecommunications infrastructure – a fine fit for Starlink’s satellite broadband service. Local netizens have campaigned for PNG to license Starlink, suggesting they email NICTA to express support for Starlink.\n\nOn December 16th NICTA demanded Starlink suspend services to the country.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, NICTA published a list of petitioners and warned “Individuals who have signed or participated in the petition may be regarded as potential offenders, and NICTA will not hesitate to pursue appropriate regulatory and legal action where non-compliance is established.”\n\nStarlink has since ended service in PNG.",

    "description": "Box CEO Aaron Levie says AI lowers costs for knowledge tasks, allowing companies to expand work and drive white-collar job growth.",
    "fullText": "Some tech leaders and AI researchers have predicted that AI will hollow out white-collar jobs.\n\nBut Aaron Levie, the cofounder and CEO of cloud-storage giant Box, believes it will push companies to do far more work.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post on Sunday, Levie said AI will sharply reduce the cost of knowledge tasks such as writing code and reviewing contracts.\n\nAs those tasks get cheaper, he said, companies will take on more projects that were previously too expensive or complex to justify, and, ultimately, create jobs rather than eliminate them.\n\nTo explain why, Levie pointed to economist William Stanley Jevons.\n\nIn 1865, Jevons observed that more efficient steam engines didn't curb coal use in England but drove it higher, as cheaper energy fueled new industries — a dynamic now known as the Jevons paradox.\n\nLevie said the same pattern has repeated itself in computing, with each major wave of cheaper technology — from mainframes to minicomputers to PCs — dramatically expanding adoption.\n\nCloud computing followed a similar path, erasing many of the advantages large companies once had in procurement, infrastructure, and maintenance, and putting tools like accounting software, CRM systems, and marketing platforms within reach of nearly any business, he said.\n\nThose efficiency gains automated deterministic work, Levie said — tasks with clear rules and predictable outcomes, such as accounting, record-keeping, scheduling, and data processing, where the same inputs reliably produce the same result.\n\nLevie's broader argument stands in contrast to warnings from other AI leaders and economists.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Ford CEO Jim Farley have warned that the technology could wipe out large numbers of white-collar roles, while figures such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and Elon Musk have predicted outcomes ranging from major disruption to longer-term economic gains.\n\nOthers, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, have predicted AI will reshape how work is done rather than eliminate it outright.\n\nWhile major tech companies such as HP, IBM, Salesforce, and Amazon have cut thousands of jobs amid AI-driven efficiency pushes, KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk has warned the US could face a \"jobless boom\" in 2026 as firms do more with fewer workers.\n\nLevie said AI changes the equation by targeting non-deterministic work, which involves judgment, creativity, and ambiguity.\n\nTasks, such as reviewing contracts, writing software, designing marketing campaigns, or conducting research, don't follow fixed rules and have historically required expensive human expertise, making them difficult to automate and costly to scale.\n\n\"Now, every business in the world has access to the talent and resources of a Fortune 500 company 10 years ago,\" he wrote.\n\nAs non-deterministic tasks get cheaper, Levie said, companies take on far more work, driving demand for white-collar jobs.\n\nNot everyone agrees that AI is already reshaping the job market at that level.\n\nSome economists, including Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, say the current white-collar downturn has more to do with high interest rates, weak hiring, and a slowing economy than AI itself.\n\nStill, Levie said fears of widespread replacement miss a key constraint.\n\n\"The reality is that despite all the tasks that AI lets us automate,\" he wrote, \"it still requires people to pull together the full workflow to produce real value.\"",

    "fullText": "Quantum computing stocks are among the hottest plays in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.\n\nPure-play developers such as Rigetti Computing are among the most popular quantum AI stocks.\n\nWhile Rigetti's momentum looks unstoppable, history suggests the company's valuation is unsustainable.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Rigetti Computing ›\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) stocks performed strongly throughout 2025, one particular pocket of the AI realm sticks out from the pack: quantum computing. As of market close on Dec. 23, shares of the Defiance Quantum ETF gained 37% on the year -- more than double that of the S&P 500.\n\nSome of the biggest gainers in this exchange-traded fund (ETF) are quantum pure plays, including Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) -- whose shares have soared 46% this year.\n\nLet's dive into why there is so much excitement surrounding Rigetti Computing and assess whether the red-hot stock can keep rallying in 2026.\n\nWhile quantum AI remains an exploratory and theoretical pursuit among research labs and higher education institutions, some believe the technology has the potential to revolutionize critical applications across clinical research, financial risk, logistics, supply chain management, and manufacturing.\n\nManagement consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that quantum computing could add up to $2 trillion in economic value by next decade. For now, however, there are only a small number of companies dedicated to developing quantum computing technology.\n\nRigetti Computing builds quantum processors and computers that can be accessed through cloud infrastructure. By employing a vertically integrated model -- controlling the manufacturing process of its chips and designing its own software -- Rigetti aims to usher in a new era of computing beyond what today's most capable systems can handle.\n\nThis is important for the future of AI because if Rigetti achieves a quantum breakthrough, its full-stack suite across hardware and software could enable next-generation algorithms that today's GPUs simply are not designed to handle.\n\nA common mistake that beginner investors often make is following the crowd. Sometimes, investors will chase momentum stocks -- knowingly buying shares at a premium in hopes of flipping their position for a profit. This is known as the greater fool theory.\n\nSmart investors avoid this strategy. Thorough valuation analysis is required to determine whether a stock is actually a reasonable buy.",

    "description": "AI strategist Jules Love says agencies must rethink training, culture, and pricing to help creative teams thrive, not just work faster, in the AI era.",
    "fullText": "AI is transforming how creative work gets made — but most agencies still don't know where to begin in using it.\n\nJules Love, founder of Spark AI, a consultancy that helps creative firms weave AI into their day-to-day work, says the real challenge isn't technical — it's psychological.\n\n\"Adopting AI in your team won't happen by accident,\" he told Business Insider. \"You need to do it deliberately — make somebody accountable for it, and give them the space to be successful in that role.\"\n\nDrawing on his work with more than 60 agencies through Spark AI, he shares six ways leaders can future-proof their teams for the AI era.\n\nLove says most agencies won't transform unless someone owns the AI integration work.\n\nRather than setting up vague \"innovation groups,\" he encourages leaders to assign responsibility and protect time for AI integration, even if that means pulling people slightly away from billable client work.\n\nAgencies that succeed, he added, treat AI as a core business priority, not a side project that gets squeezed in when deadlines allow.\n\n\"It's amazing how many agencies roll out ChatGPT or Gemini to their teams and don't train anybody on it,\" Love said.\n\nHe likens untrained teams to people staring at a giant box of Lego with thousands of bricks inside, but no picture on the front and no instructions. The picture on the box, he said, is role-specific training.\n\nFor him, training is what turns experimentation into practical capability.\n\nLove said agencies struggle to innovate when teams are constantly under deadline pressure.\n\nTo make real progress with AI, leaders need to create structured time for experimentation — moments where people can test new workflows without the risk of missing a client delivery.\n\nHe pointed to companies like Lego, which regularly takes teams off-site to explore new ideas, and Canva, which paused normal work for a full week to rethink how departments could use AI.\n\n\"Fear kills innovation faster than bad tools,\" Love said. \"You have to give a little bit of room for failure.\"\n\nLove said a lack of openness around AI use is one of the clearest signs that something is wrong.\n\nWhen employees feel the need to hide tools like ChatGPT from coworkers, it suggests AI is still seen as risky or illegitimate rather than useful.\n\nTo change that dynamic, he advises leaders to make AI use visible and normalized, especially by creating space for teams to share how they're experimenting — including what hasn't worked.\n\n\"That's the No. 1 sign that there's not a good culture around AI in your business.\"\n\nHe also encouraged managers to push responsibility down the organization by giving individuals ownership over specific AI initiatives, such as maintaining a prompt library or developing custom tools, so adoption feels collaborative rather than imposed.\n\nLove said many creatives misunderstand how AI is meant to be used. Too often, teams treat it like a faster search engine — asking one-off questions and moving on — rather than as a collaborative assistant that improves with context and iteration.\n\nHe argues that real gains come when people learn to \"brief \"AI the way they would a colleague, giving it background, constraints, and feedback instead of quick prompts.\n\n\"It's much better to think of it as briefing somebody else to do the job,\" Love said.\n\nLove said agencies risk undermining their own value if they focus only on how AI makes work faster.\n\nAs creative output accelerates, clinging to the billable hour can push firms toward commoditization rather than differentiation, he said.\n\nInstead, he urged leaders to rethink pricing around outcomes, rather than speed, and to pilot AI in specific workflows so that teams can clearly measure what improves.\n\n\"If all we're doing is doing more stuff faster, then we're going to see a bit of a race to the bottom on fees,\" Love said.\n\nHe believes that fixed-cost projects, which reward better results — not velocity — give agencies room to invest in learning and experimentation without eroding their margins.\n\nLove's advice for 2026 is simple: \"Stop thinking about what you can do today more quickly and what you can do tomorrow better.\"\n\nHe believes the agencies that thrive will not be those with the biggest budgets or flashiest tech but those that help their people learn, lead, and experiment.\n\n\"Come 2027, you're going to be looking pretty old-fashioned, pretty expensive, and pretty uninteresting as an agency if you're not embracing this stuff and seeing what you can do with it,\" he said.",

    "description": "Lightspeed Ventures partner Michael Mignano predicted that AI-generated video would lead to the \"end of the creator.\"",
    "fullText": "AI-generated video is here. What will happen to your TikTok feed?\n\nOpenAI's launch of Sora 2 sent shockwaves through the social media economy. AI slop was already rampant, and now there was a more realistic form of video with even narrower tailoring. Then came the lifelike images of Google's Nano Banana.\n\nHow will creators fare in the age of AI? Lightspeed Ventures partner Michael Mignano takes a more extreme view: that it signals the \"end of the creator.\"\n\nOn \"Sourcery,\" Mignano described a future of social media where content is generated instantaneously and artificially to best suit the viewer. It comes down to keeping the user's attention, he said.\n\n\"That's why the TikTok algorithm is so powerful,\" Mignano said. \"But it still requires human beings to make the content, and there's a cost to that.\"\n\nThat \"cost\" is the human labor and payments that go into creating your feed. AI could mean costs go down, but that spells bad news for the influencer.\n\n\"The individual creator becomes far, far, far less valuable in that dynamic,\" he said.\n\nMignano is well-versed in the online media space. He was VP of product at Aviary, a photo editing tool that was acquired by Adobe. He then cofounded and ran the podcasting platform Anchor, which was acquired by Spotify.\n\nAt Lightspeed Ventures, Mignano also invested in Elon Musk's xAI. The investment was made in 2024, before xAI acquired X, formerly Twitter.\n\nMignano acknowledged that the \"death of the creator\" — as he called it on his Substack — was \"devastating,\" but that it marked a \"whole new chapter for the internet.\"\n\nAI-generated video hasn't yet reached the point of on-demand, perfectly tailored content. Some users are perturbed by its current iteration, and TikTok allows users to choose whether to keep AI-generated videos out of their feed.\n\nBut some of the change is already here. AI influencers have emerged on Instagram, and TikTok Shop is inundated with AI scams. That cute video of bunnies bouncing on a trampoline? Yeah, that was AI.\n\nWe may not need perfect AI tailoring to reach an inhuman internet. Industry leaders, including Alexis Ohanian and Sam Altman, have referenced the \"dead internet theory,\" which says that there is more bot activity than human activity on the web.\n\nMeanwhile, the era of the social media megastar may be on the decline. Reed Duchscher, Mr. Beast's former manager, told Business Insider that it's now easier to build internet businesses with \"hyper-niche\" audiences.\n\nHow can creators stay afloat? In an email to Business Insider, Mignano wrote that quality will win out.\n\n\"Platforms will no longer reward humans posting the same old, tried and true formats and memes,\" he wrote. \"Instead, true uniqueness of image, likeness, and creativity will be the only viable path for human-created content.\"\n\nCorrection: December 29, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Michael Mignano's title at Aviary. He was the VP of product.",

    "fullText": "New head of preparedness at OpenAI will face unnerving in-tray amid fears from some experts that AI could ‘turn on us’\n\nThe maker of ChatGPT has advertised a $555,000-a-year vacancy with a daunting job description that would cause Superman to take a sharp intake of breath.\n\nIn what may be close to the impossible job, the “head of preparedness” at OpenAI will be directly responsible for defending against risks from ever more powerful AIs to human mental health, cybersecurity and biological weapons.\n\nThat is before the successful candidate has to start worrying about the possibility that AIs may soon begin training themselves amid fears from some experts they could “turn against us”.\n\n“This will be a stressful job, and you’ll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,” said Sam Altman, the chief executive of the San Francisco-based organisation, as he launched the hunt to fill “a critical role” to “help the world”.\n\nThe successful candidate will be responsible for evaluating and mitigating emerging threats and “tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm”. Some previous executives in the post have lasted only for short periods.\n\nThe opening comes against a backbeat of warnings from inside the AI industry about the risks of the increasingly capable technology. On Monday, Mustafa Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft AI, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I honestly think that if you’re not a little bit afraid at this moment, then you’re not paying attention.”\n\nDemis Hassabis, the Nobel prize-winning co-founder of Google DeepMind, this month warned of risks that included AIs going “off the rails in some way that harms humanity”.\n\nAmid resistance from Donald Trump’s White House, there is little regulation of AI at national or international level. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist known as one of the “godfathers of AI”, said recently: “A sandwich has more regulation than AI.” The result is that AI companies are largely regulating themselves.\n\nAltman said on X as he launched the job search: “We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits. These questions are hard and there is little precedent.”\n\nOne user responded sardonically: “Sounds pretty chill, is there vacation included?”\n\nWhat is included is an unspecified slice of equity in OpenAI, a company that has been valued at $500bn.\n\nLast month, the rival company Anthropic reported the first AI-enabled cyber-attacks in which artificial intelligence acted largely autonomously under the supervision of suspected Chinese state actors to successfully hack and access targets’ internal data. This month, OpenAI said its latest model was almost three times better at hacking than three months earlier and said “we expect that upcoming AI models will continue on this trajectory”.\n\nOpenAI is also defending a lawsuit from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old from California who killed himself after alleged encouragement from ChatGPT. It has argued Raine misused the technology. Another case, filed this month, claims ChatGPT encouraged the paranoid delusions of a 56-year-old in Connecticut, Stein-Erik Soelberg, who then murdered his 83-year old mother and killed himself.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said it was reviewing the filings in the Soelberg case, which it described as “incredibly heartbreaking” and that it was improving ChatGPT’s training “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support”.",

    "fullText": "Candidates will have to sit assessments in person unless there are exceptional circumstances, says ACCA\n\nThe world’s largest accounting body is to stop students being allowed to take exams remotely to crack down on a rise in cheating on tests that underpin professional qualifications.\n\nThe Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), which has almost 260,000 members, has said that from March it will stop allowing students to take online exams in all but exceptional circumstances.\n\n“We’re seeing the sophistication of [cheating] systems outpacing what can be put in, [in] terms of safeguards,” Helen Brand, the chief executive of the ACCA, said in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nRemote testing was introduced during the Covid pandemic to allow students to continue to be able to qualify at a time when lockdowns prevented in-person exam assessment.\n\nIn 2022, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK’s accounting and auditing industry regulator, said that cheating in professional exams was a “live” issue at Britain’s biggest companies.\n\nA number of multimillion-dollar fines have been issued to large auditing and accounting companies around the world over cheating scandals in tests.\n\nThe FRC’s investigation found that instances of cheating also included some tier-one auditors, a category comprising the “big four” accountants – KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY – along with Mazars, Grant Thornton and BDO.\n\nIn 2022, EY agreed to pay a record $100m (£74m) to US regulators over claims that dozens of its employees cheated on an ethics exam and that the company then misled investigators.\n\nThe ACCA said it had concluded that online tests have become too difficult to police, given the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) tools available to students.\n\nBrand said the ACCA, which has more than half a million students, had worked “intensively” to combat cheating but “people who want to do bad things are probably working at a quicker pace”.\n\nShe added that the rapid rise of technology, led by AI tools, had pushed the issue of cheating to a “tipping point”.\n\nLast year, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), which also trains accountants around the world, said reports of cheating were still increasing.\n\nHowever, the ICAEW still permits some exams to be sat online.\n\n“There are very few high-stakes examinations now that are allowing [remote invigilation],” Brand said.",

    "fullText": "Republican senator Katie Britt also proposes AI companies be criminally liable if they expose minors to harmful ideas\n\nUS senator Bernie Sanders amplified his recent criticism of artificial intelligence on Sunday, explicitly linking the financial ambition of “the richest people in the world” to economic insecurity for millions of Americans – and calling for a potential moratorium on new datacenters.\n\nSanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic party, said on CNN’s State of the Union that he was “fearful of a lot” when it came to AI. And the senator called it “the most consequential technology in the history of humanity” that will “transform” the US and the world in ways that had not been fully discussed.\n\n“If there are no jobs and humans won’t be needed for most things, how do people get an income to feed their families, to get healthcare or to pay the rent?” Sanders said. “There’s not been one serious word of discussion in the Congress about that reality.”\n\nDays from being scheduled to help swear New York mayor-elect and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani into office, Sanders said “the richest people in the world” were pushing the technology. He singled out tech moguls Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel while questioning their motives.\n\n“You think they’re staying up nights worrying about working people and how this technology will impact those people?” Sanders said. “They are not. They are doing it to get richer and even more powerful.”\n\nSanders also pointed to studies that show dependence on AI chatbots for emotional support. “If this trend continues, what does it mean over the years when people are not getting their support, their interaction from other human beings, but from a machine?” he said. “What does that mean to humanity?”\n\nThat theme was taken up separately on State of the Union by Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican senator and co-sponsor of legislation to protect minors from chatbots.\n\nThe proposed measure – the Guardianship Over Artificial Intelligence Relationships (Guard) Act – seeks to ban providing AI companions to minors. It also mandates that AI companions disclose their non-human status and lack of professional credentials. The measure seeks to establish criminal liability if companies make AI companions available to minors that solicit or produce sexually explicit content – or encourage self-harm or violence.\n\nBritt said she had met with parents who have told her “devastating stories about their children where chatbots ultimately, when they kind of peeled everything back, had isolated them from their parents, had talked to them about suicide”.\n\nShe said: “If these AI companies can make the most brilliant machines in the world, they could do us all a service by putting up proper guardrails that did not allow for minors to utilize these things, that also told the user consistently that they are not a physician, they are not a psychiatrist, ‘I am a machine.’”\n\nBritt said AI companies should be held criminally liable if they create spaces where chatbots “are having these types of sensual and sexual relationships with young people or encouraging suicide”.\n\nThe remarks by Sanders and Britt offer a rare convergence of thinking from the left and right on aspects of the issue of governing AI. Sanders said Congress needed “to vigorously study the impact that AI is having on the mental health of our country”.\n\n“I worry very much about kids spending their entire days getting emotional support,” he added. “So we have got to take a hard look on that.” The senator said lawmakers need to be “thinking seriously” about a moratorium on new AI datacenters.\n\n“Frankly, I think you have got to slow this process down,” he said. “It’s not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us, it’s coming, you adapt. What are they talking about? They going to guarantee health care to all people?\n\n“What are they going to do when people have no jobs? What are they going to do, make housing free? So I think we need to take a deep breath, and I think we need to slow this thing down.”",
