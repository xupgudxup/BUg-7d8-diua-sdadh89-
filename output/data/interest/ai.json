    "fullText": "More human resources teams are using artificial intelligence for a variety of functions. Amazon and Siemens, for example, use AI for HR to analyze résumés and make job recommendations based on an applicant's skills.\n\nIndeed, 31% of organizations this year report using some type of AI technology, according to a 2025 survey of nearly 10,000 HR professionals by Sapient Insights Group.\n\nMany companies are also creating new HR job titles that require AI skills, such as data literacy, analytics, large-language model prompt engineering, and workflow redesign.\n\nMoreover, in 2026, many organizations are willing to offer higher salaries for AI-related skills, including data science, data analytics, and business intelligence, according to a Robert Half report.\n\n\"Historically, technological shifts have reshaped some jobs and the way we work, but they've also opened doors to new roles and skills,\" said Christina Giglio, technology hiring and consulting expert at Robert Half. \"AI seems to be continuing that trend.\"\n\nHere are four new HR job titles that are appearing in the AI age, according to experts.\n\nThis role coordinates the adoption of AI tools, helping people understand the technology's value, how to use it, and how it benefits them, ensuring that AI rollouts go smoothly.\n\n\"AI doesn't eliminate people,\" says Anthony Donnarumma, CEO of the recruiting agency 24 Seven. Companies need individuals to manage the relationship between human and machine work to ensure the technology produces consistent outcomes and meets an organization's needs, he says.\n\nHumans are needed to oversee how teams adopt AI in their daily work, says Lana Peters, chief revenue and experience officer at Klaar, a performance management software.\n\nThe job often includes training managers, redesigning workflows, and connecting company culture and technology while helping employees adapt to the changes.\n\n\"Without this role, AI use is at risk of being done in silos or improperly, which is why we're seeing this position pop up across the job market,\" Peters adds.\n\nThis role trains AI systems, such as chatbots, AI agents, and other tools, to ensure the technology works effectively to produce the desired HR outcome. This might include organizing data and reviewing it for bias.\n\n\"Part technical, part editorial, part quality control,\" Ronni Zehavi, CEO and co-founder of HR tech platform HiBob, says the individual in this role curates and labels data for AI to use, reviews outputs, and teaches AI systems how to respond to data to meet company goals.\n\nThis person \"improves AI quality through hands-on review and feedback,\" he explains.\n\nTurning \"raw people data,\" such as from performance reviews and manager check-ins, into insights that leaders can act on is this role's focus, Peters says.\n\nThis individual helps leaders make data-based decisions on their workforce strategy and better understand \"how employees are performing, when they are ready to be elevated to a new role, and when they may be a flight risk,\" she adds.\n\nData literacy, analytical thinking, and the ability to interpret AI outputs are crucial skills for this role, says Lauren Winans, CEO and principal human resources consultant at Next Level Benefits.\n\n\"Additionally, employers will value soft skills such as ethical awareness, critical thinking, collaboration, and the capacity to translate AI capabilities into strategic decisions, especially in roles that bridge technology, policy, and operations,\" Winans says.\n\nPolicies and oversight are needed to ensure that AI use is safe, fair, and transparent; this role sets those \"guardrails,\" Peters says. This individual oversees how employee data is used and ensures there's no bias that could negatively impact them, she says.\n\nAlso referred to as an AI governance and risk lead, the job establishes policies to \"keep AI use safe and compliant\" and focuses on privacy protection and accuracy monitoring, helping organizations manage regulatory shifts and legal or reputational risks, Donnarumma says.\n\nEssentially, Zehavi says, the role \"guides teams on fairness, transparency, and compliance, helping companies use AI in ways that support people rather than unintentionally excluding them.\"",

    "description": "Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft AI's CEO, has described using AI for guidance on life decisions as \"something that the world needs.\"",
    "fullText": "The CEO of Microsoft AI says chatbots are a good way to offload emotions and \"detoxify ourselves.\"\n\nAppearing on an episode of Mayim Bialik's \"Breakdown\" podcast, which was released on December 16, Mustafa Suleyman said companionship and support have become some of AI's most popular use cases.\n\nPeople are using AI chatbots for everything from navigating breakups to solving disagreements with family members, he said.\n\n\"That's not therapy,\" Suleyman said. \"But because these models were designed to be nonjudgmental, nondirectional, and with nonviolent communication as their primary method, which is to be even-handed, have reflective listening, to be empathetic, to be respectful, it turned out to be something that the world needs.\"\n\nThe upside of this, he said, is \"this is a way to spread kindness and love and to detoxify ourselves so that we can show up in the best way that we possible can in the real world, with the humans that we love.\"\n\nSuleyman cofounded DeepMind in 2010. The company was acquired by Google in 2014.\n\nOn the podcast, he said people need a space to \"ask a stupid question, repeatedly, in a private way, without feeling embarrassed.\"\n\nOver time, he said, chatbots can make people \"feel seen and understood\" in a way that many other humans can't, outside of partners or close friends.\n\nNot everyone in tech, however, is enthusiastic about chatbots being used as therapy stand-ins. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is one of those voices. In August 2025, he expressed his discomfort over people relying on chatbots to make major life choices.\n\n\"I can imagine a future where a lot of people really trust ChatGPT's advice for their most important decisions,\" Altman wrote on X. \"Although that could be great, it makes me uneasy.\"\n\nIn July 2025, while appearing on \"This Past Weekend with Theo Von,\" Altman also flagged the potential legal risks of offloading onto a robot. He said that OpenAI may be required to produce its users' therapy-style chats in a lawsuit.\n\nMental health professionals have voiced concerns over the rise of ChatGPT therapy, too. Speaking to Business Insider senior health reporter Julia Pugachevsky in March 2025, two therapists said that relying on AI chatbots for emotional support could exacerbate loneliness and make people dependent on seeking reassurance.\n\nSuleyman acknowledged some of those downsides on the podcast, saying there is \"definitely a dependency risk,\" and that chatbots can sometimes be overly flattering or \"sycophantic.\"\n\nSuleyman is not the sole tech voice who sees AI's therapeutic potential. In a May 2025 interview with the Stratechery newsletter, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he believed everyone should have a therapist.\n\n\"For people who don't have a person who's a therapist,\" Zuckerberg said, \"I think everyone will have an AI.\"",

    "description": "It's been a wild year for precious metals, with gold and silver headed for their best year since 1979. Copper, driven by AI excitement, has also soared.",
    "fullText": "2025 has been a wild year for metals, and the ride continued on Monday with fresh highs in gold, silver, and copper.\n\nAll three metals jumped to start the short holiday week, putting the commodities on track for stellar returns this year as investors seek out defensive investments, anticipate more rate cuts, and look for AI-exposed nvestments beyond the most expensive tech stocks.\n\nGold prices ticked higher by more than 1.5%, climbing past $4,450 an ounce for the first-ever time. The metal is up 67% year-to-date, putting it on track for its best annual rise since 1979.\n\nSilver prices climbed 2% to a record $69 an ounce. The metal is up 130% year-to-date, also putting it on track for its best year since 1979.\n\nCopper rose 1% to trade near $12,000 a ton, a record high. The metal is up 40% for the year, marking its best-ever return since the Great Financial Crisis, according to an analysis from Rosenberg Research.\n\nHere's where the metals were trading shortly around 9:30 a.m. ET on Monday:\n\nThe move in gold and silver came as traders laid bets for more rate cuts in 2026. Lower rates reduce the yield of things like bonds and cash held in savings and money market funds, increasing the appeal of gold.\n\nInvestors are largely expecting the Fed to keep rates steady at its January policy meeting, but the probability that rates will be lower in March now hovers around 54%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\n\"The easier the Fed is, the more it debases the US currency. Then the more that happens, the viable hard assets like gold are,\" Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told Business Insider.\n\nThe risk that the Fed could cut interest rates prematurely, which could stoke higher inflation, is also likely adding to the allure of both metals.\n\nGeopolitical headlines over the weekend also sent investors back toward safe havens. The US has stepped up aggression toward Venezuelan oil shipping, sparking fears of a potentially deeper conflics that has also boosted the price of crude.\n\nCopper, meanwhile, tends to move alongside the other two precious metals, Hogan added, explaining why the metal caught up in the latest push to all-time records.\n\nCopper and silver are also seen as key components of the AI trade, due to their role in data centers and electrification. Both metals are facing supply pressures, which have boosted their prices.\n\nMany of the tailwinds that boosted metals in 2025 are expected to remain in place in 2026. A chorus of forecasters on Wall Street has called for gold to keep rising next year, with some bullish targets putting the metal at $5,000 an ounce.\n\nCentral banks purchases have been a particularly powerful force behind gold's rally, and is widely expected to continue in 2026.\n\n\"What has driven the precious metals are global geopolitical and policy uncertainties, accommodative monetary policies, contained real interest rates, and expectations for an ongoing 'debasement trade,'\" analysts at Ned Davis Research wrote in a recent client note, referring to a defensive trade that assumes the markets will shift away from fiat currency as deficits rise around the world.\n\n\"Silver is the most hybrid of the three, benefiting from its safe-haven appeal as well as its electrical applications and, to an increasing extent, solar energy, electric vehicles, electrification and digital infrastructure,\" Ned Davis Research added of silver's catalysts.",

    "title": "Why I Won't Be Getting an AI Home Gym",
    "description": "The \"future\" of fitness just can't beat more affordable solutions.",
    "fullText": "I've been getting relentless Instagram ads for AI-powered home gyms lately. You've probably seen them, too—sleek wall-mounted screens with impossibly toned instructors, testimonials promising \"the future of fitness,\" and before-and-after transformations that make it all look effortless.\n\nThe smart home gym equipment market is booming. According to Business Wire, the industry was valued at $3.2 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $4 billion by 2030. The numbers show plenty of people are investing in fitness technology that offers personalized, convenient, and effective home workouts. Fitness is yet another way to feed the AI beast, transforming boring old equipment into highly sophisticated systems capable of delivering real-time feedback, tracking performance, and adjusting workouts to each user's needs. It all sounds impressive—revolutionary, even. But here's the thing about fitness trends: It takes a lot more than the latest technology to make them stick.\n\nAfter months of watching these ads follow me around the internet, I got curious enough to actually dig into what these things are and whether they're worth the hype, and if the math really adds up for most people.\n\nWhatever your fitness goal is, the way to get it done is going to be time-tested and probably not too glamorous. Look at Tae Bo, Zumba, shake weights, even the world of Crossfit—most fitness fads don't have staying power once the novelty wears off.\n\nSure, exercise science evolves, but not nearly as fast as whatever trendy gadget cycles through the cultural zeitgeist. In this way, we see “fitness” get reduced to a consumer product—something to be purchased, used briefly, and then tossed aside when something shinier comes along. In 2025, spin classes are out, while Pilates and strength training are in, and that Bowflex is probably collecting dust in your mom’s basement.\n\nIn fact, in 2024 both Bowflex and American Home Fitness, two companies that bet big on the home fitness boom, filed for bankruptcy. In more recent history, Peloton once seemed unstoppable. Now, Peloton's revenue declined 2.8% in 2024 to $2.71 billion, marking its third consecutive year of declining revenue. What was once a cultural phenomenon now struggles to retain members and justify its premium pricing.\n\nFor something to stick in fitness, three questions matter: Is it affordable? Does it work? Will you personally keep coming back to it?\n\nAI home gyms might work, and you might keep coming back, but that first question is where things get complicated.\n\nAI home gyms are digital fitness systems that combine hardware with software to create a personalized workout experience at home. The most well-known is probably Tonal, but there's also Tempo, Speediance, Amp, and others.\n\nHere's how they typically work: Tonal, for instance, is a wall-mounted unit about the size of a large TV that uses electromagnetic resistance instead of traditional weights. You pull cables attached to adjustable arms, and the system can provide up to 200 pounds of resistance digitally. Built-in cameras and sensors track your movements, and the AI adjusts the weight in real-time based on your form and performance. A screen displays instructors leading classes, tracks your reps and sets, and the system learns your strength patterns over time to suggest when you should increase weight or modify exercises.\n\nOther systems work differently—Tempo uses free weights with 3D sensors that watch your form, while some use smart cables or connected dumbbells—but the core promise is the same: sophisticated technology that monitors your workout, corrects your form, tracks your progress, and adapts to your fitness level, all from your living room.\n\nSmart home gyms do offer legitimate benefits, including compact convenience, personalization, time savings, structured workouts, and potentially better injury prevention through form monitoring. And for many, devices like Tonal, Amp, and others are here to stay. “As a professional home gym equipment tester,” says Jose Guevara of ShreddedDad, “I've seen more of these continue to pop up not only in full training stations, but also in specific equipment, like cable machines, dumbbells, and sometimes a combination of both. They'll never have the longevity of weight plates or barbells, but there is an audience for them.\"\n\nAccording to Guevera, these systems appeal to \"those people who need guidance and want a done-for-you system where they can choose on-demand workouts where they can just follow along and not have to think about what to do for their workout.”\n\nThere is an audience for these products, just as there's an audience for Peloton bikes and high-end boutique fitness studios. But to me, the relevant question isn't whether they work for some people—it's whether they're the revolutionary solution to home fitness they're marketed as, or just another expensive piece of equipment that most people will use enthusiastically for a few months before the novelty wears off.\n\nStill, another Tonal user told me that comparing these AI systems to a Bowflex machine from the 1990s is like comparing a surgical robot to using a rusty scalpel. But this analogy assumes your body is a machine where the logic of “endless innovation” holds up. A smart gym isn’t exactly a medical solution. It's an accessory, a luxury good that depends on who can afford it. I don’t think the problem with working out at home has never been that we lacked sophisticated enough technology. The problem is that working out is hard, consistency is harder, and no amount of AI can fundamentally change that human reality. There are some things you just can’t hack.\n\nThere are hefty upfront costs for these products. Take Tonal, one of the leading AI home gym systems. It's around $4,300 for the unit itself, $295+ for mandatory professional installation, plus bundled smart accessories. Then comes the recurring monthly membership fee of around $60 for full access to classes and features. All told, you're looking at roughly $5,300 in the first year, followed by $720 annually for the subscription.\n\nCompare that to traditional gym memberships. According to a 2023 report, the average monthly cost of a gym membership is $58, which works out to about $696 per year. Budget options like Planet Fitness run as low as $15 to $23 per month, or $180 to $276 annually. Even mid-tier gyms like LA Fitness typically cost $40 to 56 per month.\n\nSo, to break even on a Tonal, compared to a mid-range gym membership at $50/month:\n\nYear 1: Tonal costs $5,300. A gym membership costs $600. You're already $4,700 in the hole.\n\nYear 2: You pay $720 for Tonal's subscription. The gym still costs $600. You're now $4,820 behind.\n\nYear 3: Another $720 vs. $600. Now you're $4,940 in deficit.\n\nIt would take roughly eight years of consistent use before Tonal becomes cost-competitive with a traditional gym membership. Eight years. That's assuming the hardware doesn't malfunction, the company doesn't go under (remember, Bowflex and Peloton couldn't sustain their models), and you actually use it consistently for nearly a decade.\n\nAnd the subscription costs are real. Unlike traditional weights that work whether or not you're paying a monthly fee, many digital fitness products require a subscription as long as you want to access workouts. \"I've seen some of these companies also go out of business,\" Guevara says, \"so if that happens, you're stuck with a product that doesn't function if their software is not kept up with.\" We've watched other companies’ subscription traps effectively brick your hardware.\n\nNow, proponents will argue that you save on commute time and costs. Fair enough. But for the Tonal investment to be \"worth it\" financially, you'd need to use it at least three to four times per week for those eight years straight. If you weren’t driving to a gym you pay $50/month for, are you sure you’ll consistently use your smart gym for years and years once the novelty wears off?\n\nThere’s another unspoken cost to at-home convenience, akin to people who struggle with WFH setups: the absence of gym culture. Don’t underestimate the power of casual human interaction, personal trainers who can physically adjust your form, accountability from workout buddies, the ritual of leaving your house to exercise, or maybe even the silent camaraderie of shared suffering. If you’re like me, that separation between home and workout space is a major psychological boost.\n\nThe best exercise is the one you'll actually keep doing. If you run the numbers and a Tonal makes sense for your budget and workout habits, great. Personally, as AI creeps into every other corner of my life, I find a lot of comfort in my workouts as a rare screen-free activity.\n\nMy gripe with AI home gyms is when they’re marketed as must-have solutions, instead of what they are: luxury goods, something available only to those with disposable income and spare square footage. On a grand scale, given their current costs, AI home gyms look like a passing trend to me. And two years from now, when the next fitness innovation promises to finally solve at-home workouts, I bet someone will write this same article all over again.",

    "description": "If you don't like your AI friend's personality, you can change it.",
    "fullText": "When Spike Jonze's movie Her dropped back in 2013, I thought it was a great work of total fiction. Who would actually befriend an AI bot, let alone fall in love with them? Fast forward 12 years, and I couldn't have been more wrong. Not only do people love chatting with AI bots, they are actually developing deep connections with them. I still don't get it, but I can't deny it: People like these chatbots a lot.\n\nPart of what people like about conversations with generative AI is the \"personality\" of each bot—or, at least, its perceived personality. After all, ChatGPT isn't a monolith: You can adjust the bot to sound wildly different than it does on someone else's app, which raises some questions for me regarding these curated companions. But I digress: This article isn't necessarily a critique of how people are attaching themselves to ChatGPT; rather, I'm sharing the news that OpenAI is now giving you more control over how the bot sounds and responds in your conversations.\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI announced new controls for ChaGPT's \"Personalization.\" In a post on X, the company revealed that users can now adjust their chatbot's \"characteristics,\" or, in other words, its overall personality. These are adjustments to the personality types that OpenAI has already let you choose from, which include one of eight options: \"Default\" (preset style and tone); \"Professional\" (polished and precise); \"Friendly\" (warm and chatty); \"Candid\" (direct and encouraging); \"Quirky\" (playful and imaginative); \"Efficient\" (concise and plain); \"Nerdy\" (exploratory and enthusiastic); and \"Cynical\" (critical and sarcastic).\n\nBut no matter which of these personalities you pick, you now have four \"characteristics\" to adjust to fine-tune the overall experience. There's \"Warm,\" \"Enthusiastic,\" \"Headers & Lists,\" and \"Emoji,\" with the option to have more or less of each, or the default amount, as OpenAI sees fit. For Warm, you can either have ChatGPT be friendlier and more personable, or more professional and factual. With Enthusiastic, you can choose the bot to have more energy and excitement, or be calmer and more neutral. \"Headers & Lists\" lets you choose between clear formatting and lists, or more paragraphs. And, of course, you can control whether ChatGPT uses more emoji, or fewer, depending on your sense of fun and joy.\n\nAs usual, you can take advantage of custom instructions to guide ChatGPT's personality in a direction you like, especially when the presets don't give you those options. For example, if you'd like ChatGPT to talk to you like a pirate, or if you want it to end every response with a certain catchphrase, here's your chance to influence the bot.\n\nI'm really not someone who uses ChatGPT outside of testing it for coverage, so I can't speak to whether these additional controls are useful. But if you want to try making your version of ChatGPT your ideal \"AI companion,\" the controls are at your disposal. You'll find these options wherever you access ChatGPT. You can either access it from Settings > Personalization, or from the Personalization shortcut in the ChatGPT menu.",

    "description": "Critics are judging models trained on last-gen hardware. There's a 6x wave of compute already allocated - and it's just starting to produce results.",
    "fullText": "You've heard the new narrative: AI scaling hit a wall, the capex is insane, the returns aren't there. But the critics are judging models trained on last-gen hardware. There's a 6x wave of compute already allocated - and it's just starting to produce results.\n\nThis post looks at how much compute is actually coming online - and the early signs of what it is achieving.\n\nMorgan Stanley did some excellent research looking at CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) allocations for TSMC. CoWoS is TSMC's advanced 2.5D chip packaging technology and is used for nearly all leading silicon in artificial intelligence:\n\nFirstly, we can see that total supply is estimated to go from 117,000 wafers to 1 million wafers, in just 4 years, with NVIDIA taking the lion's share of the supply. Interestingly though, Broadcom (which produces Google's TPUs) is taking 15% of that capacity, with AMD growing 15x for their MI300/MI400 series of AI chips.\n\nThis doesn't tell us the total story though - as chips are continually improving in FLOPs/mm² of wafer.\n\nI did some napkin math[1] to try and convert this into exaFLOPs. This is a lot of guesswork on shipment mix, but I believe it should be roughly in the right ballpark:\n\nNote the Google TPU stats assume a very aggressive ramp from Broadcom, which is somewhat in question. Again, this is napkin math.\n\nAI silicon flow is increasing dramatically - and really starts gathering steam into 2026.\n\nIf we look at cumulative installs, we start seeing a huge amount of exaFLOPs available across the globe - with a roughly 6x increase in global AI chip capacity between 2024 and 2026e.\n\nIt's difficult to undersell the implications of this growth. Between ChatGPT first launching and the end of 2026, the world will have nearly 50x more compute installed and available for us. To push an overused analogy arguably too far, the initial build of railways in the UK and US were closer to 10x over 10 years. This level of infrastructure buildout hasn't really been seen before in human history - probably WW2 military spend is the only thing that surpasses it as a proportion of GDP in the Western world.\n\nHaving said all that, there is a significant lag between a chip being finished with TSMC and it coming online - probably at least a month in absolutely ideal conditions. However, there have been significant delays with getting the latest GB200 series of AI accelerators as they require liquid cooling - which previous generations didn't. There have been a lot of rumours that this has been extremely difficult to get right, with widespread reports of overheating and leaks from the liquid cooling system delaying the rollout of this generation of AI accelerators from Nvidia.\n\nThis doesn't even get into the serious power capacity constraints the datacentre industry is currently battling - a million wafers worth of Blackwell-class silicon implies a need for gigawatts of new power capacity. This physical bottleneck is likely to be the true governor on how fast that '2026e' column actually comes online.\n\nOn top of this - the even larger delay is from when a chip gets installed and powered on in a datacentre facility to training finishing. It's likely this process takes at least 6 months end to end - assuming no major problems or difficulties.\n\nSo when we look at 'current' models - we are looking really in the past, probably 12 months or so all things being equal. When I wrote this blog at the end of 2025 we're really just seeing the results of 2024's cumulative infrastructure buildout.\n\nIt's very important to point out though that not all of this compute is being allocated towards training. Proportionally more and more will be allocated to inference to serve current customers. However, at off peak times I'm sure that the big AI players are dedicating a lot of this spare inference compute allocation to new techniques like agentic reinforcement learning - which can be easily checkpointed and done \"off peak\".\n\nAnd let's not forget that an enormous amount of compute still is going to be allocated to training. Sam Altman has said in a recent interview that OpenAI would be profitable if it wasn't for training - no doubt the cost of researchers plays a big part, but compute has to be a huge part of the expenditure there.\n\nTwo models have really caught my eye recently - Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3. I wrote an article a few weeks ago delving into them if you're interested to learn more, but the quick summary is that Opus 4.5 is a step change in terms of software engineering and Gemini 3 has graphic/UI design skills far ahead of other models.\n\nA month or so later, I really agree with what I wrote there - while the benchmark scores were impressive, they massively undersell what a giant leap Opus 4.5 has been. Combined with Claude Code I've found that it really can do 30 minutes+ of software engineering with minimal (or no) babysitting. This is a step change from Anthropic's previous Sonnet 4.5 model - which required me to constantly interrupt its execution to correct its approach.\n\nI've noticed two other more quantitatively sound approaches also backing up what I'm anecdotally seeing. Firstly, one of Princeton's HAL agent benchmarks has been \"solved\" by the combination of Opus 4.5 and Claude Code:\n\nOpus 4.5 + Claude Code effectively solving the benchmark, a massive jump from the previous SOTA.\n\nSecondly, METR has been doing some fascinating work on seeing how long various models can operate on successfully. We're starting to see an enormous leap forward on this - with Opus 4.5 managing to complete software engineering tasks that would take a human 4+ hours successfully in over 50% of cases.\n\nNote the 50%+ success rate on tasks that take humans 4+ hours.\n\nNow, correlation doesn't equal causation, but it's hard to not notice the parallels between the performance here and the availability of compute.\n\nBut if you look closely at the timelines, you realise that this performance isn't the result of the massive wave of compute I just described. It's actually the result of the trickle that came before it.\n\nLook at the \"Cumulative Installs\" for 2024 versus 2026 in my table above.\n\nBecause of the installation and training lag I described earlier, Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 were likely trained on the 2024 install base. They are the product of roughly ~36 exaFLOPs of global capacity.\n\nWe are looking at these PhD-level engineering capabilities and assuming they are the result of the current AI hype cycle. They aren't. They are the result of the infrastructure that was ordered before the mania truly set in.\n\nThe 100+ exaFLOPs coming online in 2025 and the 220+ in 2026? That compute hasn't even finished a training run yet.\n\nIf Opus 4.5 is what we get from the 'trickle' of 2024 compute, what happens when the 'flood' of 2026 infrastructure actually finishes training the next generation? By 2030, if trends continue, we'll have nearly 30x more - a zettaFLOP (1021 FLOPs). The scaling debate is about to get a lot more uncomfortable.",

I think that that part of ourselves will persist even if machines can do most of the jobs,\" research scientist Yoshua Bengio said on an episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast, hosted by Steven Bartlett, posted on December 18.\n\nDuring the one-hour and forty-minute episode, Bengio said that with companies eager to integrate AI into their workflows, it's only a matter of time before AI can do most jobs that humans do behind a keyboard. Physical jobs, like plumbing, may eventually be replaced by robots, too, although this may take longer, he said.\n\nBengio said that even as the world becomes more tech-driven, there will always be a need for human qualities such as love, accepting responsibility, and enjoying contributing to others' well-being.\n\n\"If I'm in a hospital, I want a human being to hold my hand while I'm anxious or in pain. The human touch is going to, I think, take more and more value, as the other skills become more and more automated,\" he said.\n\nAlongside Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, Bengio is known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" because of his pioneering research in deep learning and neural networks. He is a professor in the computer science and operations research department at the Université de Montréal, and in June, he launched the AI safety research nonprofit LawZero. In a statement on his website, Bengio said the organization aims to reduce dangerous behaviors associated with agentic AI systems, such as deception.\n\nAll three industry leaders have been sharing their advice for how people can pivot their careers to stay relevant in the age of AI.\n\nIn a June 2025 episode of \"Diary of a CEO,\" Hinton said it's a good time to become a plumber, as it may be a long time before AI disrupts physical jobs. Earlier this month, LeCun told Business Insider he thinks computer science students should focus on foundational courses, like maths and physics, rather than trendy courses on the technology of the day, if they want to break into AI.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Nvidia is pushing the idea that building graphics chips that consume more and more power is the best path to advancing AI — and the result could be the US losing the AI race to China.\n\n\"Exactly and sadly,\" Burry wrote on X late Saturday, responding to another user's comment that called Nvidia the \"gangster of the AI neighborhood\" as it has \"shut down any narrative that even hints at reducing GPU demand.\"\n\nIn another post over the weekend, Burry shared a chart showing China has more than double America's electric generation capacity, and is expanding its energy infrastructure at a much faster rate.\n\nWhy China will win AI in one chart. \n\nPower hungry Nvidia chips are not the way forward for the U.S. \n\nIt is not just the total power advantage. It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "description": ": Rising rack densities are driving changes from grid connection to chip-level delivery",
    "fullText": "Power semiconductors are soon set to become as vital as GPUs and CPUs in datacenters, handling the rapidly increasing loads forecast for AI infrastructure.\n\nThe AI craze has seen datacenter operators stuffing servers with as many accelerators (typically GPUs) as will fit inside, then filling the racks in their data halls with these high-performance boxes.\n\nWith some GPUs now using 700 W of energy each, the power required by an entire rack or datacenter of kit is growing rapidly, putting a strain on electrical distribution infrastructure.\n\nLast year, Nvidia introduced an integrated rack-scale system for AI processing, the DGX GB200 NVL72, which needs 120 kW per unit, while cloud giant Google disclosed this year that it is planning for datacenter racks supporting 1 MW of IT hardware loads.\n\nTo cap it all, some of the key infrastructure components such as transformers are reported to be holding things up through long lead times of 28 weeks or more.\n\nThis is where power semiconductors come into the picture. They enable solid-state transformers (SSTs), which are much smaller and more efficient than their conventional counterparts – perhaps just 500 kg as opposed to multiple tons.\n\n\"What's now being introduced is a solid-state transformer that has a couple of advantages on the supply chain side, but also on this performance side, and that is a pretty new application,\" said Dr Peter Wawer, division president for Green Industrial Power at chipmaker Infineon.\n\nSSTs are a great deal lighter and smaller, Wawer told us, because they operate at very high frequency, a couple of orders of magnitude higher than the AC power supply frequency fed into them. Because the solid-state transformer switches at such high frequency, it requires silicon carbide components.\n\n\"Silicon carbide is the only material that has the capability to switch at high frequency and has high blocking voltages. And for blocking voltage, we mean up to two or three kilovolts (kV), which this semiconductor device will need to block,\" Wawer said. \"But then, of course, you have input voltages of more than 30 kV, and therefore you have to stack more than 10 of the devices in a kind of cascaded structure.\"\n\nInfineon is a prominent supplier of power semiconductors, and so has an interest in pushing the development of solid-state components that are set to be in demand as the datacenter build boom continues.\n\nThe firm expects that SSTs will replace a portion of the datacenter transformer market and could be worth up to $1 billion by 2030, for example.\n\nCircuit breakers are nother application where power semiconductors may replace legacy kit. These electromechanical devices open up in a few milliseconds in the event of a short circuit, but a silicon carbide solid-state version can open much faster, in microseconds – handy if you are dealing with high voltages being supplied to racks full of very expensive GPUs.\n\nPower semiconductors, based on silicon carbide or gallium nitride, are also set to play a part in the power distribution around the datacenter itself.\n\nNvidia has signposted that it sees 800 VDC power supplies as the way forward, as the power demands of AI infrastructure get ever higher, saying this move will be required to support 1 MW IT racks and beyond. It claims this reduces the number of voltage conversions needed, which can introduce inefficiencies and increase the complexity of the electrical system, among other things.\n\nIt is also a way of minimizing losses, according to Infineon, because the power loss is proportional to the square of the current. The trick therefore, when you want to go to a higher power and keep losses under control, is to increase the voltage to a level that means you keep the current constant.\n\n\"Today, you have a combined rack that has the IT payload as well as the power delivery and the backup power. Now, as the GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs increase in power, that means that you need to bring in more power into the racks themselves,\" said Adam White, division president for Power & Sensor Systems at Infineon.\n\n\"So we now move to this potential 800 volt DC supply, but you've also got the plus-minus 400-volt topologies that some vendors [such as Google] may end up using. We call this then the hybrid microgrid.\"\n\n\"Why 800 volts DC? Effectively, you can bring that directly into the motherboards or into the compute trays, using fewer conversion steps,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Infineon believes that before we can get to that step, there will have to be an intermediate stage, where a \"power sidecar\" – effectively a second rack full of power delivery and backup circuitry – will sit alongside the rack of IT kit it serves. Whether this serves just one rack or several will depend on the IT load.\n\nThis arrangement is expected to see racks hitting 600 kW of power, up from the maximum of about 125 kW today, to support configurations using Nvidia's Rubin Ultra, expected to arrive in late 2027.\n\nGoogle also mentions a \"sidecar\" in its plans for 1 MW kit, as a dedicated AC-to-DC power rack that feeds power to the other racks.\n\nAs power demand rises, the power supply unit (PSU) within the rack will need to handle more power, with 8 kW units available now. There will also be a transition to a three-phase design to move from a 12 kW unit to 16 kW or above, which is expected to happen next year. This transition will see greater use of components made with silicon carbide and gallium nitride (GaN), according to Infineon.\n\nFinally, the increasing density of the AI accelerators themselves and the amount of power all those transistors guzzle is starting to have an impact at the chip level.\n\nThe voltage regulator modules (VRMs) are currently discrete packages that sit alongside the accelerator chip package (GPU, ASIC or TPU) on the system board, but as the current to the chip rises, parasitic losses also increase, wasting energy.\n\n\"Some of the industry has already recognized that and started to move to what we call BVM, or back-side vertical power module,\" White said. This moves the VRMs to the other side of the system board, below the accelerator chip package, and simplifies the board layout as well as reducing overall power delivery network losses.\n\nUltimately, the industry would like to get to the point where the VRM moves inside the chip package and is embedded in the substrate directly beneath the chip, but this is a development set for beyond 2027, according to Infineon. ®",

    "description": "It's been a hot year for healthcare venture investment. Backers said they expect investments in AI cost savings in 2026, plus more M&A — but not IPOs.",
    "fullText": "It's been a hot year for healthcare deals — but some investors are predicting a shift in which startups will capture VC attention next year.\n\n2025 saw a welcome surge in healthcare venture funding as investors rushed to back top AI startups. Last December, VCs predicted huge funding rounds for AI scribe startups like Abridge and Ambience Healthcare; indeed, both Abridge and Ambience landed hundreds of millions of dollars in venture funding this year.\n\nInvestors also said in December 2024 that they anticipated a race for those startups to expand beyond AI health scribing into other product lines, like medical coding and billing. That pressure intensified in August, when medical records giant Epic announced it was releasing its own AI tools, including for clinical documentation, in competition with its closest startup partner Abridge.\n\nWith Epic in the mix and tech giants like OpenAI working on their own healthcare AI plays, VCs told Business Insider that they're expecting different profiles of healthcare startups to grab funding next year as companies focus on cost savings, securing patient and provider trust, and ensuring high-quality data.\n\n\"AI has diffused nicely for passive listening in clinical settings, and administrative simplification,\" said Dan Mendelson, the CEO of Morgan Health, JPMorgan's healthcare investing arm. \"AI now needs to show savings to payers by helping consumers make good choices and reducing the burden on clinicians.\"\n\nInvestors are also watching for more healthcare exits in 2026. Two venture-backed digital health companies went public this year: Hinge Health in May, and Omada Health in June. VCs weren't optimistic that 2026 would bring a deluge of new public healthcare companies, but they're looking forward to what many said should be an active year for healthcare M&A.\n\nThis year, investment surged for AI startups tackling administrative burdens for large health systems. AI scribe startups Abridge and Ambience Healthcare notched $5.3 billion and $1.25 billion valuations, respectively, while AI-powered medical knowledge platform OpenEvidence hit a $6 billion valuation with its own raise.\n\nMany such startups have expanded into coding and billing to help hospitals capture more revenue from health insurers. But in 2026, insurers could use AI to fight back, said Todd Cozzens, cofounder and managing partner of Transformation Capital.\n\nCozzens said that many insurers have already partnered with large organizations such as Palantir and Anthropic on custom AI solutions. Next year, he expects those payers to contract with more specialized AI platforms trained on complex clinical data, like providers are already doing.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game in the end, but like with the nuclear weapons arms race, a lot of money is going to be spent here, and doing nothing is no longer an option for either side of the battle,\" he said.\n\nSeveral VCs suggested that the next wave of healthcare investment will go toward business models that prioritize higher-quality AI behind the scenes.\n\nSapphire Ventures partner Cathy Gao predicted a conscious shift away from \"black box\" AI models in high-stakes industries like healthcare, calling them \"uninvestable.\"\n\n\"The next healthcare unicorns will be 'glass box' platforms where the core product is the digital paper trail,\" she said. \"Any engineering team can build an AI that fills out a medical form. The real opportunity is building the governance layer that proves why the AI made that decision.\"\n\nLiam Donohue, cofounder and managing partner at .406 Ventures, said his firm has also been investing in companies focused on AI decision transparency and data quality.\n\n\"One of the obstacles that needs to be hurdled for AI to be more widely used in enterprise settings is absolutely the ability to go back to the source of why some process happened or why a decision was made. And there's a lot of infrastructure being built to do that,\" he said.\n\nAs insurers cut reimbursement rates for key services, investors are also expecting a surge in business models that prioritize lower-cost care settings and eschew point solutions, paired with AI to reduce administrative spend.\n\nNorwest partner Irem Rami said she expects a boost for in-home care models that incorporate AI agents. Mercedes Bent, cofounder and partner at Premise VC, is watching healthcare startups that aim to support patients across a chosen specialty, like women's health tech that assists patients from fertility tracking through conception.\n\nTech startups that actually provide healthcare have somewhat fallen out of favor with VCs in recent years. The costs of employing providers or running brick-and-mortar clinics can make it tough for those businesses to deliver venture-style returns.\n\nBut in 2026, according to 7wireVentures partner Alyssa Jaffee, \"tech-enabled services is coming back, baby.\"\n\nAfter 2021's venture boom and the subsequent funding drought, some tech-enabled services companies struggled to maintain their growth or hit their next milestone on slim margins, especially at earlier stages, Jaffee said.\n\nBut many startups that have made it to the other side have stronger businesses as a result, including durable relationships with key customers like health plans, she said.\n\nShe also pointed to Hinge Health and Omada Health's successful IPOs; both companies are tech-enabled service providers that sell to employers and health plans.\n\n\"We have a number of those companies in our portfolio that have really hit their stride. It's just a meatier business, and I think we're going to get a lot of interest from later-stage investors coming in to support those kinds of companies,\" Jaffee said.\n\nNorthzone partner Wendy Xiao said that she's now seeing some employers try out a few different tech-enabled services solutions in a given category, such as GLP-1 management, and test them against one another.\n\nContracting with multiple companies could be a tough sell for employers who are already seeing their healthcare costs skyrocket. But Xiao said many of these startups are paid a portion of the money they save employers — a model that dramatically lowers employers' financial exposure.\n\nThere are a few healthcare companies that could be eyeing the exits next year. Virta Health has publicly said it expects to be IPO-ready in 2026. And Business Insider previously reported that two private-equity-backed healthtech companies, Zelis Healthcare and Ensemble Health, have been in talks with bankers about potential IPOs.\n\nStill, no reports have emerged of venture-backed healthcare startups filing their S-1s. By this time last year, Hinge Health and Omada Health were already deep into their IPO preparations.\n\nWhile Xiao thinks a handful of healthtech startups are waiting for their debuts, she's not confident they'll take the plunge before the second half of 2026.\n\n\"I think they'll probably go out in a similar timeframe of, if not late next year, then the year after. There seems to be a lot of momentum pent up around IPO readiness at the organizational level over the past few years. I think a lot of these companies are in pretty good shape in terms of that, and they're just waiting for one of the larger ones to go out,\" Xiao said.\n\nMichael Greeley, the cofounder and general partner at Flare Capital Partners, agreed that the new year is unlikely to bring a steady stream of new healthcare IPOs. But he's anticipating more M&A activity as interest rates come down and private equity buyers look for healthcare AI acquisitions in the VC world.\n\n\"A lot of us are still sitting on a lot of unrealized gains, and the obsession is going to be heightened around liquidity,\" Greeley said. \"We're seeing a lot more interest from the big buyout funds in our sector, who are going down market to buy AI assets to wrap around their legacy platform companies.\"\n\n2025 saw a few such deals. New Mountain Capital, in particular, made several AI acquisitions this year as the PE firm rolled startups onto its existing healthcare bets. Greeley also pointed to firms such as Bain Capital, TPG, Silver Lake, and KKR as potential buyers in 2026.\n\nDonohue is similarly optimistic that 2026 will bring a flurry of exit activity as more companies mull going public, selling, or merging with a competitor. In particular, he expects strategic buyers, such as health plans, to become more active in the second half of 2026.\n\n\"I actually think it'll be a good exit year. I'm seeing lots of signs of life, both within our portfolio and more broadly. There's a lot of activity percolating that you just haven't seen for the last several years,\" he said.",

    "description": "Alex Yang details founding an AI startup with other high schoolers worldwide to improve Alzheimer's diagnostics.",
    "fullText": "My typical morning starts around 3 a.m. I'm instantly met with Messenger notifications from web developers in California, GitHub pings from Florida, and a running document of research papers to read sent from Michigan. By 7:50 a.m. I'm off to class to live my life as an 18-year-old high school senior in Seoul.\n\nThis solitary ritual has become my strange normal after I founded an AI research and development startup with people all around the world, whom I've never met in person. My ambition was to improve Alzheimer's diagnostics, but I had no network, so I built one online.\n\nGrowing up, I heard stories about various family members battling Alzheimer's. I viewed the disease as something truly terrifying, which leaves behind only the shell of who someone once was.\n\nI'd grown up knowing that someday, someone I love might disappear while still standing in front of me. In high school, this fear crystallized into something beyond passive acceptance.\n\nI came across this competition, looking to fund ideas that can make health more accessible, and decided to apply.\n\nI knew I couldn't do the work alone. I had to find people beyond my network with diverse perspectives and skills capable of building something real together.\n\nI started searching for partners by spending my time on internet forums and pitching my vision. I posted detailed research proposals on Discord servers and created GitHub repositories with preliminary code.\n\nAfter a month of \"nos,\" I got one \"yes\" from California. Then Florida. Then Michigan. Until there were six of us. We named ourselves Reteena (pronounced like \"retina\"), a deliberate wordplay symbolizing our mission to bring new vision to Alzheimer's diagnostics.\n\nWe became something none of us expected: a team of high schoolers from around the world who genuinely believed we could fix Alzheimer's.\n\nI didn't set out to target only high schoolers, but I was on servers mainly for students, and those were the people who responded.\n\nWe've been self-funded and started by conducting research on enhancing the image resolution of low-field MRI, which is a portable and more economically accessible MRI machine. We applied machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance the quality of low-field MRI scans.\n\nOur goal was radical — to make Alzheimer's diagnostics accessible and affordable for underserved communities by making low-field MRI more reliable. Conducting research together, I realized that my abstract dream had become reality, but reality proved far more demanding than any dream.\n\nI staggered under the crushing weight of the time and dedication that my team was giving. The time zone difference was not an excuse for me to make them wait for responses. Lying awake at night, my stomach knotted with anxiety about \"what should I do next,\" I recognized that my wrong decision could waste months of work from people who believed in me.\n\nDuring those suffocating moments, when doubt was a physical pain in my chest, I'd question everything: my abilities, our direction, and whether I was worthy of the faith my team placed in me.\n\nGradually, my leadership improved, and doubts faded when I stopped seeing our differences as obstacles and started viewing them as strengths. I created a \"follow-the-sun\" workflow where I completed tasks before people in the states woke up, with detailed handoff documents in shared Notion workspaces. We were asynchronous, yet somehow more connected.\n\nWhen our first piece of research was published in the IEEE BigData 2024 Conference, a prestigious annual conference for artificial intelligence research, I felt exhilarated. It was proof that we were onto something and justification for every late night. Yet it was only the beginning.\n\nWe expanded from a six-person group chat into an unconventional startup with 12 members. Over the next nine months, we conducted additional Alzheimer's research and presented our findings on how changes in speech patterns and genetic markers could aid in detecting the disease earlier than traditional methods.\n\nAs people who met on the internet, we've also made our growth transparent on the internet, sharing our journey on LinkedIn. By posting our product-building journey and sharing the authentic rationale behind our research and products, we connected with mentors who believed in what we were doing — Y Combinator founders, Pear VC partners, and researchers who took us seriously despite our age.\n\nWe even started receiving messages from students across different countries asking for advice on starting their own health tech projects.\n\nMost recently, we launched our first consumer product, Remembrance, an AI therapeutic service to try to help Alzheimer's patients reconnect with their past. It works by asking gentle questions designed to trigger old memories through reminiscence therapy.\n\nEach recalled memory is automatically organized in knowledge graph databases, making it easy to revisit and build a personal memory repository. Over time, it can suggest related memories on demand, building a personalized memory archive.\n\nThe healthcare market is impenetrable in many ways. When we attempted to approach a local hospital to test our product using actual patient data, we were immediately halted by compliance requirements and institutional review boards.\n\nWe've spent two years discovering that building something in healthcare is harder than we thought. But I wouldn't change it because we learned that at 17 and 18, not at 25 when the stakes feel higher and the fear feels heavier.\n\nReteena might not end up as we imagined, but that's OK. The point was never the destination; it was about learning how to build, understanding that authentic problems matter more than viral success, and realizing you can inspire people by simply trying.\n\nThat's the real experiment. And it's worth every sleepless night.",

    "fullText": "The AI tech trade isn't over. Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\n\nTech (XLK) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle (ORCL) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave (CRWV) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Micron Technology's (MU) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\n\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's (NVDA) results in May 2023, which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\n\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Broadcom (AVGO), and Meta (META). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.\n\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation,\" Essaye said.\" The next evolution of this trade, where there are going to be winners and losers within the Mag 7.\"\n\nHe said that his favorite stock is Alphabet because of the growth prospects for Google's Gemini artificial intelligence product.\n\n\"I think companies like Oracle that are not overextended financially, but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" he added.",

    "description": "Former Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said current and prospective CS students need to focus on skills \"with a long shelf life.\"",
    "fullText": "Yann LeCun said if computer science majors don't spend their time wisely, they may find out their degree doesn't add up.\n\n\"If you are a CS major and take the minimum required math courses for a typical CS curriculum, you might find yourself unable to adapt to major technological shifts,\" LeCun said in an email to Business Insider.\n\nLeCun, who teaches computer science at NYU, said during a recent podcast appearance that he jokes that he's \"a computer science professor arguing against studying computer science\" based on his push on where students should focus their time.\n\n\"My recommendation was not to avoid CS as a major but to take the maximum number of courses on foundations (e.g. math, physics, or EE courses) rather than take courses on the trendy technology du jour,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe former chief AI scientist at Meta said his advice is that students \"learn things with a long shelf life.\" Depending on the computer science program, not all of these skills may be baked into a degree.\n\n\"What we should do is learn kind of basic things in mathematics, in modeling, mathematics that can be connected with reality,\" LeCun said on \"The Information Bottleneck\" podcast. \"You tend to learn this kind of stuff in engineering in some schools that's linked with computer science, but sort of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, et cetera.\"\n\nUniversities and computer science students continue to grapple with how to adapt their programs to the age of generative and increasingly agentic AI. Earlier this year, UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid described the struggle students face in finding jobs, compared to how graduates used to have \"the run of the place.\"\n\nLeaders in the field, including OpenAI's Bret Taylor, have stressed that computer science is about so much more than simply learning to code. Others, including Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton, have stressed that learning critical thinking is what's the key to staying ahead of AI's advancements.\n\n\"Some skills that are always going to be valuable, like knowing some math, and some statistics, and some probability theory, knowing things like linear algebra that will always be valuable,\" Hinton recently told Business Insider. \"That's not knowledge that's going to disappear.\"\n\nLeCun jokingly pointed out that he did not initially study CS. He studied electrical engineering at ESIEE in Paris before earning a Ph.D. CS from the renowned Sorbonne Université in 1987. LeCun said some CS schools are linked to engineering programs, which tend to require more advanced math.\n\n\"Engineering disciplines, you know, in the US, you learn Calculus 1, 2, 3 that gives you a good basis, right?\" he said. In computer science, you can get away with just Calculus 1. That's not enough, right?\"\n\nEngineering also exposes students to concepts like control theory and signal processing, which LeCun said are \"really useful for things like AI.\"\n\nAll of this isn't to say basic programming should be thrown out, LeCun said. Vibe coding is nice, but it's not a substitute for fundamental knowledge.\n\n\"Obviously, you need to learn enough computer science to kind of program and use computers,\" he said. \"And even though AI is going to help you be more efficient at programming, you still need to know how to do this.\"",

    "title": "Expert: EU Commission wants an \"unlimited special legal zone\" for AI",
    "description": "In a legal analysis for consumer advocates, experts warn of massive protection gaps due to the planned \"digital EU omnibus\". Big Tech is favored.",
    "fullText": "With the planned \"digital omnibus\" package, the EU Commission promises a breakthrough against bureaucracy. However, resistance to the initiative is constantly growing. Legal experts from the law firm Spirit Legal are now urgently warning in an expert opinion commissioned by the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzbv) that the draft represents a systematic break with the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and endangers the privacy of hundreds of millions of consumers.\n\nAt the center of the criticism is the planned Article 88c, which provides for special relief for data processing in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The experts Peter Hense and David Wagner warn here of an \"unlimited special legal zone\". Since the term \"AI system\" is extremely broadly defined, companies could in the future declare almost any automated data processing as AI-relevant in order to evade strict data protection rules. This would replace the technology-neutral logic of the GDPR with a technology-specific privilege that primarily benefits service providers.\n\nThe lawyers consider the planned relaxation in handling sensitive data such as health information or political views to be alarming. The draft suggests that their processing is all the more justified the larger the data volumes are. This reverses the principle of data minimization: mass data extraction is rewarded as long as it serves to train AI models. The experts see this as dangerous privileges for Big Tech corporations.\n\nThe authors also criticize that essential protective mechanisms are merely shifted to the legally non-binding recitals. One example is technical opt-out procedures with which users can object to the use of their data. Without anchoring in the binding legal text, supervisory authorities lack the means to effectively sanction violations. Especially with web scraping, data of individuals would be collected who often have no opportunity to even become aware of their right of objection.\n\nTo counteract these negative developments, the experts propose a specific legal basis for AI training. Companies should only be allowed to access personal information if they can prove that their goal cannot be achieved with anonymized or synthetic data. Furthermore, it must be ensured that AI models do not reproduce personal information in their answers (\"Data Leakage\"). Strict technical standards are therefore necessary already in the training process.\n\nA chapter is dedicated to the protection of vulnerable groups. Since minors frequently cannot grasp the implications of data processing for AI, the authors advocate for explicit parental consent. In addition, individuals reaching the age of majority should receive an unconditional right to prohibit the further use of their data in existing models. Without such guardrails, the digital sovereignty of the next-generation risks being permanently lost.\n\nAccording to vzbv board member Ramona Pop, the political dimension of these findings is enormous. She warns that the Commission, under the guise of innovation, primarily wants to issue a free pass to US platforms. Big Tech could easily exploit legal grey areas, while European companies and consumers would be left behind. True legal certainty can only be achieved through clear rules. Brussels, on the other hand, is proposing vague exceptions that would have to be judicially clarified over years.\n\nCurrent results of a representative online survey for the vzbv demonstrate that data protection is not a hindrance but an economic factor. According to the survey, trust is the fundamental prerequisite for using digital services for 87 percent of consumers. The GDPR serves as an important anchor: over 60 percent of respondents are more likely to trust companies if they demonstrably comply with European regulations. A dilution of these standards thus also risks the social acceptance of new technologies.\n\nThe Digital Omnibus will now be discussed in the EU Council and Parliament. The objections from civil society can hardly be ignored. The package is suspected of being primarily the result of massive pressure from the US government, rather than representing European citizen and economic interests. The rights of data subjects are being weakened under the guise of \"simplifications,\" it is said. The Commission wants to issue AI companies a blank check to extract European data.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "fullText": "THIBODAUX, La. (AP) — The teasing was relentless. Nude images of a 13-year-old girl and her friends, generated by artificial intelligence, were circulating on social media and had become the talk of a Louisiana middle school.\n\nThe girls begged for help, first from a school guidance counselor and then from a sheriff’s deputy assigned to their school. But the images were shared on Snapchat, an app that deletes messages seconds after they’re viewed, and the adults couldn’t find them. The principal had doubts they even existed.\n\nAmong the kids, the pictures were still spreading. When the 13-year-old girl stepped onto the Lafourche Parish school bus at the end of the day, a classmate was showing one of them to a friend.\n\n“That’s when I got angry,” the eighth grader recalled at her discipline hearing.\n\nFed up, she attacked a boy on the bus, inviting others to join her. She was kicked out of Sixth Ward Middle School for more than 10 weeks and sent to an alternative school. She said the boy whom she and her friends suspected of creating the images wasn’t sent to that alternative school with her. The 13-year-old girl’s attorneys allege he avoided school discipline altogether.\n\nWhen the sheriff's department looked into the case, they took the opposite actions. They charged two of the boys who'd been accused of sharing explicit images — and not the girl.\n\nThe Louisiana episode highlights the nightmarish potential of AI deepfakes. They can, and do, upend children's lives — at school, and at home. And while schools are working to address artificial intelligence in classroom instruction, they often have done little to prepare for what the new tech means for cyberbullying and harassment.\n\nOnce again, as kids increasingly use new tech to hurt one another, adults are behind the curve, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University focused on emerging technology.\n\n“When we ignore the digital harm, the only moment that becomes visible is when the victim finally breaks,” Alexander said.\n\nIn Lafourche Parish, the school district followed all its protocols for reporting misconduct, Superintendent Jarod Martin said in a statement. He said a “one-sided story” had been presented of the case that fails to illustrate its \"totality and complex nature.”\n\nA girl’s nightmare begins with rumors\n\nAfter hearing rumors about the nude images, the 13-year-old said she marched with two friends — one nearly in tears — to the guidance counselor around 7 a.m. on Aug. 26. The Associated Press isn’t naming her because she is a minor and because AP doesn’t normally name victims of sexual crimes.\n\nShe was there for moral support, not initially realizing there were images of her, too, according to testimony at her school disciplinary hearing.\n\nUltimately, the weeks-long investigation at the school in Thibodaux, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, uncovered AI-generated nude images of eight female middle school students and two adults, the district and sheriff's office said in a joint statement.\n\n“Full nudes with her face put on them” is how the girl’s father, Joseph Daniels, described them.\n\nUntil recently, it took some technical skill to make realistic deepfakes. Technology now makes it easy to pluck a photo off social media, “nudify” it and create a viral nightmare for an unsuspecting classmate.\n\nMost schools are “just kind of burying their heads in the sand, hoping that this isn’t happening,” said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nLafourche Parish School District was just starting to develop policies on artificial intelligence. The school-level AI guidance mainly addressed academics, according to documents provided through a records request. The district also hadn’t updated its training on cyberbullying to reflect the threat of AI-generated, sexually explicit images. The curriculum its schools used was from 2018.\n\nA school investigation hits obstacles\n\nAlthough the girls at Sixth Ward Middle School hadn’t seen the images firsthand, they heard about them from boys at school. Based on those conversations, the girls accused a classmate and two students from other schools of creating and spreading the nudes on Snapchat and possibly TikTok.\n\nThe principal, Danielle Coriell, said an investigation came up cold that day as no student took responsibility. The deputy assigned to the school searched social media for the images unsuccessfully, according to a recording of the disciplinary hearing.\n\n“I was led to believe that this was just hearsay and rumors,” the girl’s father said, recounting a conversation he had that morning with the school counselor.\n\nBut the girl was miserable, and a police incident report showed more girls were reporting that they were victims, too. The 13-year-old returned to the counselor in the afternoon, asking to call her father. She said she was refused.\n\nHer father says she sent a text message that said, “Dad,” and nothing else. They didn't talk. With the mocking unrelenting, the girl texted her sister, “It’s not getting handled.”\n\nAs the school day wound down, the principal was skeptical. At the disciplinary hearing, the girl’s attorney asked why the sheriff's deputy didn’t check the phone of the boy the girls were accusing and why he was allowed on the same bus as the girl.\n\n“Kids lie a lot,” responded Coriell, the principal. “They lie about all kinds of things. They blow lots of things out of proportion on a daily basis. In 17 years, they do it all the time. So to my knowledge, at 2 o’clock when I checked again, there were no pictures.”\n\nA fight breaks out on the school bus\n\nWhen the girl stepped onto the bus 15 minutes later, the boy was showing the AI-generated images to a friend. Fake nude images of her friends were visible on the boy’s phone, the girl said, a claim backed up by a photo taken on the bus. A video from the school bus showed at least a half-dozen students circulating the images, said Martin, the superintendent, at a school board meeting.\n\n“I went the whole day with getting bullied and getting made fun of about my body,” the girl said at her hearing. When she boarded the bus, she said, anger was building up.\n\nAfter seeing the boy and his phone, she slapped him, said Coriell, the principal. The boy shrugged off the slap, a video shows.\n\nShe hit him a second time. Then, the principal said, the girl asked aloud: “Why am I the only one doing this?” Two classmates hit the boy, the principal said, before the 13-year-old climbed over a seat and punched and stomped on him.\n\nVideo of the fight was posted on Facebook. “Overwhelming social media sentiment was one of outrage and a demand that the students involved in the fight be held accountable,” the district and sheriff’s office said in their joint statement released in November.\n\nThe girl had no past disciplinary problems, but she was assigned to an alternative school as the district moved to expel her for a full semester — 89 school days.\n\nIt was on the day of the girl’s disciplinary hearing, three weeks after the fight, that the first of the boys was charged.\n\nThe student was charged with 10 counts of unlawful dissemination of images created by artificial intelligence under a new Louisiana state law, part of a wave of such legislation around the country. A second boy was charged in December with identical charges, the sheriff's department said. Neither was identified by authorities because of their ages.\n\nThe girl would face no charges because of what the sheriff’s office described as the “totality of the circumstances.”\n\nAt the disciplinary hearing, the principal refused to answer questions from the girl’s attorneys about what kind of school discipline the boy would face.\n\nThe district said in a statement that federal student privacy laws prohibit it from discussing individual students’ disciplinary records. Gregory Miller, an attorney for the girl, said he has no knowledge of any school discipline for the classmate accused of sharing the images.\n\nUltimately, the panel expelled the 13-year-old. She wept, her father said.\n\n“She just felt like she was victimized multiple times — by the pictures and by the school not believing her and by them putting her on a bus and then expelling her for her actions,” he said in an interview.\n\nThe fallout sends a student off course\n\nAfter she was sent to the alternative school, the girl started skipping meals, her father said. Unable to concentrate, she completed none of the school's online work for several days before her father got her into therapy for depression and anxiety.\n\nNobody initially noticed when she stopped doing her assignments, her father said.\n\n“She kind of got left behind,” he said.\n\nHer attorneys appealed to the school board, and another hearing was scheduled for seven weeks later.\n\nFor students who are suspended or expelled, the impact can last years. They're more likely to be suspended again. They become disconnected from their classmates, and they’re more likely to become disengaged from school. They're more likely to have lower grades and lower graduation rates.\n\n“She’s already been out of school enough,” one of the girl's attorneys, Matt Ory, told the board on Nov. 5. “She is a victim.\n\n“She,” he repeated, “is a victim.”\n\nMartin, the superintendent, countered: “Sometimes in life we can be both victims and perpetrators.”\n\nBut the board was swayed. One member, Henry Lafont, said: “There are a lot of things in that video that I don’t like. But I’m also trying to put into perspective what she went through all day.” They allowed her to return to campus immediately. Her first day back at school was Nov. 7, although she will remain on probation until Jan. 29.\n\nThat means no dances, no sports and no extracurricular activities. She already missed out on basketball tryouts, meaning she won’t be able to play this season, her father said. He finds the situation “heartbreaking.”\n\n“I was hoping she would make great friends, they would go to the high school together and, you know, it’d keep everybody out of trouble on the right tracks,” her father said. “I think they ruined that.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "The artificial intelligence boom is real — but there's more to the AI trade than chips alone, according to a credit investor.\n\n\"This is a super-duper micro cycle that will outlast many investing careers,\" said Scott Goodwin, the cofounder and managing partner of Diameter Capital Partners, a quote he attributed to his partner Jonathan Lewinsohn.\n\nAI represents what Diameter Capital sees as a long-running, disruptive cycle — but buying the most obvious winners isn't the only way to play it, he said on the \"Goldman Sachs Exchanges\" podcast published on Friday.\n\nDiameter Capital, which manages approximately $25 billion in assets, has focused on where AI demand could create less obvious bottlenecks — and where those bottlenecks show up in credit markets.\n\nThat view led Diameter to buy the unsecured debt of a midsize telecommunications company in 2023.\n\nGoodwin said the bet was rooted in the idea that as companies move from training AI models to actually using them, demand shifts away from chips alone and toward the networks that carry data.\n\n\"It had to leave the data center. How would it leave? It would leave on the commercial fiber, the pipes,\" he said.\n\nThe telco went on to sign more than $10 billion in contracts with hyperscale cloud providers, and the debt has rebounded to face value, Goodwin said.\n\nDiameter Capital also made \"a big bet\" on a satellite company tied to the wireless spectrum — a wager that later paid off after the company sold spectrum assets and the debt returned to face value.\n\nGoodwin's comments come amid growing debate over whether sky-high AI valuations are sustainable and whether investors are overlooking other opportunities tied to the technology.\n\nGoodwin warned that parts of the AI-credit boom may be taking on risk that's hard to price, especially in chip finance.\n\nSome investors, he said, are taking on \"residual risk,\" or the riskiest slice of chip-financing deals — betting on what the hardware might be worth years from now. Cutting-edge firms refresh their technology often, so chips can quickly become outdated for some customers.\n\n\"We call up really smart people in Silicon Valley, we call up really smart people at Big Tech companies and ask them what the residual value is on these chips three, four, five, six, seven years forward,\" he said. \"None of them have a clue.\"\n\nGoodwin said the next phase isn't just about spending on infrastructure — it's about competitive disruption rather than capital expenditure.\n\n\"Who are the companies, who are the entities that are going to adopt AI and take a step forward versus their peers? And who are going to be the losers?\" he asked.\n\n\"That is actually a longer cycle than the capex cycle, so that's really interesting,\" he said.",

    "title": "Embedding-Based Tool Selection for AI Agents",
    "description": "When I first built our AI assistant, it had five tools. Look up an order. Process a refund. Check ticket availability. Simple stuff.",
    "fullText": "When I first built our AI assistant, it had five tools. Look up an order. Process a refund. Check ticket availability. Simple stuff. Fast forward six months and we're at nearly 40 tools spanning orders, events, marketing campaigns, contests, and customer management.\n\nThe problem became obvious during a routine cost review: we were burning thousands of tokens on every single request just describing tools the model would never use. Someone asks \"What time does my show start?\" and we're sending the full spec for process_refund, create_email_campaign, and manage_contest_prizes. Wasteful.\n\nEach tool definition isn't trivial. You need a name, a description detailed enough for the LLM to understand when to use it, and parameter specifications with types and constraints. Here's what one looks like in our codebase:\n\nMultiply by 40 and you're looking at 3,000+ tokens before the user even says anything. The costs add up, latency increases, and here's the kicker: having too many tools actually makes the model worse at picking the right one. More noise, more confusion.\n\nThe fix is conceptually simple. Instead of sending every tool on every request, we embed all tool descriptions into vectors and store them in Postgres using pgvector. When a query comes in, we embed it too, then find the 5-10 most semantically similar tools using cosine distance.\n\nThe query \"refund order #12345\" gets embedded, compared against all tool embeddings, and returns process_refund, calculate_refund_amount, get_order_details. We send only those to the LLM.\n\nThis cuts our tool payload by 75-90% on most requests. The model sees fewer, more relevant options and picks better.\n\nWe debated two main approaches: calling OpenAI's embedding API or running our own model.\n\nOpenAI's text-embedding-3-small is the path of least resistance. It's a REST call, returns 1536-dimensional vectors, costs about a hundredth of a cent per embedding, and just works. The semantic understanding is excellent. The downside is the external dependency. Every query needs a network round-trip, your data touches their servers, and you're subject to their rate limits and outages.\n\nRunning something like ModernBERT locally is appealing for different reasons. Zero marginal cost, sub-millisecond latency since there's no network hop, and complete data privacy. But now you're managing infrastructure. You need a server running the model, monitoring, scaling considerations, and you're on the hook for model selection and updates. For a small team, that operational burden is real.\n\nThere's also a hybrid approach: use OpenAI in production for reliability, run a local model in development and testing to avoid API costs and flakiness. We built our system with a provider abstraction to make this possible:\n\nSwitching providers is a config change. The abstraction cost an extra hour upfront but buys flexibility later.\n\nFor our volume, OpenAI was the obvious choice. We process hundreds of queries daily, not millions. At $0.00001 per embedding, we're talking pennies per month. The reliability is excellent, the semantic quality is strong for our e-commerce domain, and there's zero infrastructure to manage.\n\nIf we were processing millions of queries or had strict data residency requirements, the calculus would be different. But for a small team running a ticketing platform, paying a few cents to avoid running another service is a good trade.\n\nAdding a new tool or updating an existing one means regenerating embeddings. In development, it's a mix task:\n\nThis iterates through all tool definitions, calls OpenAI for each, and upserts the results into the tool_embeddings table. Takes about 10 seconds for 40 tools. The task is idempotent so you can run it whenever.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward. We convert each ToolDefinition to embedding text that captures the name, description, and parameter info, then store the vector alongside the tool name and model ID.\n\nFor production, we built a simple admin page. Navigate to the AI operations screen, see the current embedding count, click a button to regenerate. Non-technical team members can trigger it after tool updates without touching the console.\n\nThe alternative is shelling into the production console:\n\nEither way, regeneration is safe to run anytime. It deletes existing embeddings and creates fresh ones. The whole process takes seconds.\n\nOne gotcha: if you ever switch embedding providers, you must regenerate everything. OpenAI's 1536-dimension vectors are incompatible with a local model's 768-dimension vectors. We store model_id with each embedding to catch mismatches and make debugging easier.\n\nPure similarity search has a gap. If someone says \"refund order #12345\", we'll find process_refund. But the LLM also needs get_order_details to look up the order before it can refund anything. Those two tools aren't semantically similar enough to both appear in the top results.\n\nWe solved this with category expansion. Each tool has a category like :orders, :refunds, or :events. When we select tools via similarity, we expand to include related categories:\n\nSo finding process_refund (category :refunds) automatically pulls in order lookup tools. The LLM gets everything it needs for multi-step workflows.\n\nFor those curious about the database side, here's the actual query we run:\n\nThe <=> operator is pgvector's cosine distance. We filter by a similarity threshold (0.4 by default) to avoid returning completely irrelevant tools, then take the top K results. The whole thing runs in under 10ms.\n\nWe use Mimic for mocking in tests. Every test that touches tool selection stubs the embedding provider to return consistent vectors:\n\nThis keeps tests fast, deterministic, and free of API dependencies. We can simulate failures too, testing that the system gracefully falls back to using all tools when embedding generation fails.\n\nA few things surprised us along the way.\n\nThe similarity threshold matters more than we expected. Too high and you filter out useful tools. Too low and you're back to noise. We settled on 0.4 after some experimentation but it's worth tuning for your domain.\n\nCategory expansion was an afterthought that became essential. Pure semantic similarity misses the dependencies between tools. If your assistant does multi-step operations, you need something like this.\n\nThe provider abstraction was worth it even though we haven't switched providers. It forced us to think cleanly about the interface and made testing much easier. The Mimic stubs work because there's a clear boundary to mock.\n\nCold start is a real concern. If your embeddings table is empty, you need a fallback. We log a warning and use all tools, which isn't ideal but prevents complete failure.\n\nAfter rolling this out, our per-request token usage for tool definitions dropped 60-80%. Latency improved by about 200ms since the model processes fewer tokens. Tool selection accuracy actually got slightly better because there's less noise confusing the model.\n\nThe embedding costs are negligible. We're at maybe $0.01 per day for our volume. The whole system adds a 10ms database query per request, which disappears in the noise of the LLM call.\n\nFor anyone dealing with tool explosion in their AI agents, this approach is worth considering. The implementation isn't complex, the costs are minimal, and the benefits compound as your tool count grows.",

    "description": "An AI security researcher says companies lack the talent to handle AI security problems — and traditional cybersecurity teams aren't enough.",
    "fullText": "Companies may have cybersecurity teams in place, but many still aren't prepared for how AI systems actually fail, says an AI security researcher.\n\nSander Schulhoff, who wrote one of the earliest prompt engineering guides and focuses on AI system vulnerabilities, said on an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" published Sunday that many organizations lack the talent needed to understand and fix AI security risks.\n\nTraditional cybersecurity teams are trained to patch bugs and address known vulnerabilities, but AI doesn't behave that way.\n\n\"You can patch a bug, but you can't patch a brain,\" Schulhoff said, describing what he sees as a mismatch between how security teams think and how large language models fail.\n\n\"There's this disconnect about how AI works compared to classical cybersecurity,\" he added.\n\nThat gap shows up in real-world deployments. Cybersecurity professionals may review an AI system for technical flaws without asking: \"What if someone tricks the AI into doing something it shouldn't?\" said Schulhoff, who runs a prompt engineering platform and an AI red-teaming hackathon.\n\nUnlike traditional software, AI systems can be manipulated through language and indirect instructions, he added.\n\nSchulhoff said people with experience in both AI security and cybersecurity would know what to do if an AI model is tricked into generating malicious code. For example, they would run the code in a container and ensure the AI's output doesn't affect the rest of the system.\n\nThe intersection of AI security and traditional cybersecurity is where \"the security jobs of the future are,\" he added.\n\nSchulhoff also said that many AI security startups are pitching guardrails that don't offer real protection. Because AI systems can be manipulated in countless ways, claims that these tools can \"catch everything\" are misleading.\n\n\"That's a complete lie,\" he said, adding that there would be a market correction in which \"the revenue just completely dries up for these guardrails and automated red-teaming companies.\"\n\nAI security startups have been riding the wave of investor interest. Big Tech and venture capital firms have poured money into the space as companies rush to secure AI systems.\n\nIn March, Google bought cybersecurity startup Wiz for $32 billion, a deal aimed at strengthening its cloud security business.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said AI was introducing \"new risks\" at a time when multi-cloud and hybrid setups are becoming more common.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, organizations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds,\" he added.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last year that growing security concerns around AI models have helped fuel a wave of startups pitching tools to monitor, test, and secure AI systems.",

    "fullText": "When it comes to retirement planning, everyone’s got an opinion. Financial advisors push complicated portfolios, bloggers swear by extreme savings and your neighbor won’t stop talking about their real estate investments.\n\nBe Aware: Major 401(k) Change Coming in 2026 — High Earners Must Act Now\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K Per Month From Home\n\nSo I decided to cut through the noise and ask ChatGPT directly: What’s the single smartest retirement move to make in 2026?\n\nThe answer was surprisingly straightforward — and it has everything to do with timing.\n\nChatGPT’s response was clear: Maximize your tax-advantaged accounts with a Roth-first strategy while tax rates are still relatively low.\n\nThat means prioritizing Roth IRA contributions, Roth 401(k) contributions and Roth conversions over traditional pretax retirement accounts. The reason this matters so much right now comes down to one major deadline.\n\nLearn More: This ‘Boring’ Investment Could Be the Secret To Never Running Out of Retirement Income\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions expire after 2025. That means many Americans will face higher federal tax rates starting in 2026 and beyond.\n\nIf you convert money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA before rates go up, you pay taxes at today’s lower rates. Then that money grows tax-free forever and you never pay taxes on it again — even when rates are higher.\n\nChatGPT explained that this creates a perfect opportunity. Lock in lower tax rates now by moving money into Roth accounts before the window closes. For people who expect to be in a similar or higher tax bracket in retirement, this move could save thousands of dollars over a lifetime.\n\nThe Roth-first strategy isn’t complicated, but it requires action in three areas.\n\nFirst, contribute to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) instead of the traditional versions. If your income is too high for direct Roth IRA contributions, you can use the backdoor Roth strategy by contributing to a traditional IRA and immediately converting it.\n\nSecond, consider converting some of your existing traditional IRA money to a Roth. You’ll pay taxes on the conversion amount this year, but then that money grows tax-free. The key is converting when your income is lower or tax rates are favorable — which is exactly what 2025 and early 2026 represent before rates potentially rise.\n\nThird, if you have a 401(k) with Roth options, funnel as much as possible into the Roth side. For 2025, the 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000 for people under 50 and $30,500 for those 50 and older.",

    "description": ": Lessons from COVID and tariff shocks getting Mike D's tech shop through AI-induced memory maze",
    "fullText": "Dell has predicted PC sales will be flat next year, despite the potential of the AI PC and the slow replacement of Windows 10.\n\n“We have not completed the Windows 11 transition,” COO Jeffrey Clarke said during Dell’s Q3 earnings call on Tuesday. “In fact, if you were to look at it relative to the previous OS end of support, we are 10-12 points behind at that point with Windows 11 than we were the previous generation.”\n\nClarke said that means 500 million PCs can’t run Windows 11, while the same number didn’t need an upgrade to handle Microsoft’s latest desktop OS. The COO therefore predicted the PC market will “flourish”, but then defined the word as meaning “roughly flat” sales despite Dell chalking up mid-to high single digits PC sales growth over the last year.\n\nDell can survive flat PC growth because its enterprise AI hardware portfolio is booming. The company booked orders for $12.3 billion worth of AI servers in the quarter ended October 31st, and shipped machines valued at $5.6 billion. Revenue from servers and networking kit reached $10.1 billion for the quarter, up 37 percent year-over-year.\n\n“Our five-quarter pipeline continue to grow sequentially across neo-clouds, sovereigns and enterprises, and remains multiples of our backlog, even when accounting for the robust demand we've seen,” Clarke told investors on the earnings call. “As expected, AI server profitability improved sequentially,” he added.\n\nBuyers are becoming more interested in traditional servers, too, often to consolidate existing fleets into denser rigs. That means more memory and storage in each system, and a challenge for Dell given the exploding price of RAM and NAND, caused by memory-makers shifting production to the high-margin products needed to support AI workloads and reducing manufacturing capacity for more anodyne kit.\n\nClarke said Dell will do “everything we can to minimize the impact,” drawing on extreme supply chain management skills learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and in more recent months coping with Trump administration’s rapidly shifting tariff policies.\n\n“Our model gives us tremendous flexibility, whether that is to reprice, how we set out quotes, whether that's to reconfigure, redirect to different products, the ability to determine how long price will be in effect, the ability to understand where we're going to drive demand to and change our demand generation vehicles to drive that,” Clarke said.\n\nDell reported $27 billion of revenue in the quarter, an eleven percent year-over-year jump, and told investors to expect $31.5 billion in Q4 and $111.7 billion in FY 2026, jumps of 32 percent and 17 percent respectively.\n\nThe company thinks servers will be a big part of that improvement, because 70 percent of its customers run 14th generation servers or even older machines. Dell’s current machines are its 17th generation and each one replaces between three and seven older machines – and has a higher average selling price due to the aforementioned increase in memory and storage.\n\nBuyers looking to modernize their servers therefore need Dell to successfully exercise its self-professed supply chain skills, or revisit their budgets. ®",

    "fullText": "Researchers warn generative tools are helping militant groups from neo-Nazis to the Islamic State spread ideology\n\nWhile the artificial intelligence boom is upending sections of the music industry, voice generating bots are also becoming a boon to another unlikely corner of the internet: extremist movements that are using them to recreate the voices and speeches of major figures in their milieu, and experts say it is helping them grow.\n\n“The adoption of AI-enabled translation by terrorists and extremists marks a significant evolution in digital propaganda strategies,” said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. Webber specializes in monitoring the online tools of terrorist groups and extremists around the world.\n\n“Earlier methods relied on human translators or rudimentary machine translation, often limited by language fidelity and stylistic nuance,” he said. “Now, with the rise of advanced generative AI tools, these groups are able to produce seamless, contextually accurate translations that preserve tone, emotion, and ideological intensity across multiple languages.”\n\nOn the neo-Nazi far-right, adoption of AI-voice cloning software has already become particularly prolific, with several English-language versions of Adolf Hitler’s speeches garnering tens of millions of streams across X, Instagram, TikTok, and other apps.\n\nAccording to a recent research post by the Global Network on Extremism and Technology (GNet), extremist content creators have turned to voice cloning services, specifically ElevenLabs, and feed them archival speeches from the era of the Third Reich, which are then processed into mimicking Hitler in English.\n\nNeo-Nazi accelerationists, the kinds who plot acts of terrorism against western governments to provoke a societal collapse, have also turned to these tools to spread more updated versions of their hyper-violent messaging. For example, Siege, an insurgency manual written by American neo-Nazi and proscribed terrorist James Mason that became the veritable bible to organizations like the Base and the now-defunct Atomwaffen Division, was transformed into an audiobook in late November.\n\n“For the last several months I have been involved in making an audiobook of Siege by James Mason,” said a prominent neo-Nazi influencer with a heavy presence on X and Telegram, who stitched together the audiobook with the help of AI tools.\n\n“Using a custom voice model of Mason, I re-created every newsletter and most of the attached newspaper clippings as in the original published newsletters.”\n\nThe influencer lauded the power of having Mason’s writing from “pre-internet America” and turning it into a modern-day voice.\n\n“But to hear the startling accuracy of predictions made through the early eighties really puts a milestone on the road and it changed my view of our shared cause on a fundamental level,” he said.\n\nAt its height in 2020, the Base held a book club on Siege, which was an instrumental influence on several members who discussed its benefits in a hypothetical war against the US government. A nationwide FBI counterterrorism probe eventually swept up over a dozen of its members on various terrorism related charges in the same year.\n\n“The creator of the audiobook has previously released similar AI content; however, Siege has a more notorious history,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, “due to its cultlike status among some in the online extreme right, promotion of lone actor violence, and being required reading by several neo-Nazi groups that openly endorse terrorism and whose members have committed violent criminal acts”.\n\nWebber says pro-Islamic State media outlets on encrypted networks are currently and actively “using AI to create text-to-speech renditions of ideological content from official publications”, to supercharge the spread of their messaging by transforming “text-based propaganda into engaging multimedia narratives”.\n\nJihadist terrorist groups have found utility in AI for translations of extremist teachings from Arabic into easily digestible, multilingual content. In the past, American-imam turned al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki, would personally have to voice English lectures for recruitment propaganda in the anglosphere. The CIA and FBI have repeatedly cited the influence of al-Awlaki’s voice as a key contagion in the spread of al-Qaeda’s message.\n\nOn Rocket.Chat – the preferred communications platform of the Islamic State, which it uses to communicate with its followers and recruits – a user posted a video clip in October with slick graphics and Japanese subtitling, remarking on the difficulties of doing that without the advent of AI.\n\n“Japanese would be an extremely hard language to translate from its original state to English while keeping its eloquence,” said the pro-Islamic State user. “It should be known that I do not use artificial intelligence for any related media, with some exceptions regarding audio.”\n\nSo far, not just the Islamic State, but groups across the ideological spectrum, have begun using free AI applications, namely OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to amplify their overall activities. The Base and adjacent groups have used it for the creation of imagery, while also acknowledging, as far back as 2023, the use of these tools to streamline planning and researching.\n\nCounterterrorism authorities have always viewed the internet and technological advancements as a persistent game of catch-up when it comes to keeping pace with the terror groups who exploit them. Already the Base, the Islamic State and other extremists have leveraged emergent technologies like crypto to anonymously fundraise and share files for 3D printed firearms.",

    "description": "When Will.i.am’s not writing hit songs like “OMG” for Usher, he’s looking for the next big pop star on The Voice U.K., or running his new AI company, FYI.",
    "fullText": "Orianna Rosa Royle is the Success associate editor at Fortune, overseeing careers, leadership, and company culture coverage. She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs.\n\nWill.i.am is busy. When he’s not writing hit songs like “OMG” for Usher, he’s looking for the next big pop star on The Voice UK, or running his new AI company, FYI. So how exactly does he balance it all?\n\nThe Grammy Award–winning artist turned tech entrepreneur revealed to Fortune that he maxes out the 5-to-9 after the daily grind of his 9-to-5, and he advises Gen Zers to forget about work-life balance if they want to emulate his success.\n\n“If you’re trying to build something that doesn’t exist, it’s about dream-reality balance,” he says. “Work-life balance means that you’re working for somebody else’s dream. You just have a job supporting somebody else’s dream, and you want to balance your work and your life.\n\n“But if it’s dream-reality balance, then it’s not work. It’s a dream that you’re trying to put into reality, and you’re ignoring your current reality.”\n\nFor example, after working on his tech venture from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Will.i.am says that he goes back to work on his creative business until 9 p.m. But before his AI company was a reality, his day was flipped. He’d work on music first before dipping into his tech side hustle well into the evening.\n\nIt’s why he advises young people to reframe how they think of their time off work and their current 9-to-5 reality.\n\n“I’m not really paying attention to this reality,” he explains. “I’m trying to bring that one [a new business venture or idea] here and focusing on how do I get people who believe in this dream to help me materialize it? So for that, you have to make some type of sacrifice to bring this thing that doesn’t exist here.\n\n“From that perspective, work-life balance is not for the architects that are pulling visions into reality. Those words don’t compute to the mindset of the materializers.”\n\nOf course, many young people already put in hours to their side hustles and personal development after work. Millions of Gen Zers and millennials are tuning into people’s 5-to-9 evening routines on TikTok.\n\nBut Will.i.am says chipping away at your dream when most people are off work extends to weekends, birthdays, and holidays.\n\n“I didn’t party. I was always a square, meaning, ‘You work too much, man, let’s go out.’ Like what? Go out. I don’t want to go out. I just always worked,” the rapper says. “It’s your birthday what are you gonna do? Work. You ain’t gonna celebrate?”\n\nThe multimillionaire says he’s always saved the celebrating for the stage, where he can finally enjoy the fruits of his labor.\n\n“There’s nothing that’s ever gonna feel that glorious than when you’re actually at a festival. But how do you get to headline a festival? You’ve got to work. My friends would go out and party, hanging out with chicks, doing drugs, drinking. I was just in the studio working, writing songs.”\n\nTo this day, he says that he hasn’t gone out and celebrated a birthday—including his most recent one, which was just last week on March 15.\n\n“Like on Christmas for the past 12 years: I could celebrate Christmas with my family, and then on the 26th, I fly to China because that’s dream maker heaven. Anything you want to make is there.”\n\nWill.i.am was speaking to Fortune in Rome for the rollout of Raidio.FYI radios in Mercedes-Benz cars.\n\n7 a.m.: Will.i.am is not a part of the CEO-approved 5 a.m. club. Instead, he told Fortune he wakes up at around 7 a.m., and he sticks to this routine whether he’s living in L.A. or London.\n\n8 a.m.: “I walk, do my calls, and get to work,” he says, with the aim to start work at 9 a.m.\n\n9 a.m. to 5 p.m.: “I get a lot done from nine to 12, do my little lunch, then back to work at one, finish at five, and that’s all my tech, like entrepreneurial activities.”\n\n5 p.m. to 9 p.m.: “The night hours are creativity,” he says, adding that specifically between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. is when he gets the best ideas. “That’s the juicy bits, [when] I’m freaking soaking in emotion, to where I just rinse it out in the phone.”\n\n9 p.m. onward: When Will.i.am was in his late twenties, he says going to sleep at 4 a.m. (and waking up at noon) was the norm. But now, at 50 and balancing both his tech and music ventures, he starts unwinding for bed after 9 p.m. and is asleep by 11 p.m.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 23, 2025.",

    "title": "I applied for 900 jobs after being laid off at 62. AI made the search even harder.",
    "description": "After being made redundant, Jim Herrington's job hunt revealed how AI and ageism are reshaping the modern hiring process.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Jim Herrington, 62, from Suffolk, UK. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was made redundant from my electronics marketing job in 2024 after the company downsized, the last thing I expected was that I would end up applying for 900 jobs before finally landing a new one.\n\nI put everything I had into my job search. I created tailored résumés, cover letters, and even presentations for individual roles — without using AI — and contacted employers directly, while also attending physical events to meet new contacts.\n\nI treated each day like a workday — often starting at 8 a.m. to search through job boards, then methodically selecting which roles to apply for based on relevance, industry, and location. I even sent my résumé to some trusted peers for feedback and refinement. I was also open about being happy to commute to an office up to an hour from where I live - in my early career, I would drive thousands of miles a year for work.\n\nThroughout this entire process, my motivation and confidence took a significant hit, particularly due to the frustration of conflicting feedback. Some bosses wanted experience in their industry, while others were open to people from other fields. Some were open to senior marketers, yet others told me I was overqualified.\n\nThe feedback that I often got was, \"You'd be bored in this job\", but given my age, I think they were trying to say that they thought I was too old, rather than value my 40-plus years of experience, the awards I've won, and the teaching work I've done.\n\nWhile AI may be helping companies streamline their recruitment processes, I believe it's actually causing more problems. Getting all the right buzzwords into your résumé and cover letter to get past AI screening tests seems to have become more important than whether someone is actually a good fit.\n\nNow, with some companies even starting to use AI video interviews, that's only going to add to that mistrust and cause employers to ruin their reputation among candidates. Because if a business hasn't got the time or courtesy to speak to me themselves, then I'm just not interested.\n\nIn an interview, there would be so much that an AI could not possibly experience. To me, it shows a total lack of respect for the candidate who has taken the time and energy to apply.\n\nBut the problem is more complex than simply a tough market or lazy applicants who are using AI. In my experience, many employers simply lack clarity in what they're looking for.\n\nWhen they don't list exactly what they are looking for, it's very difficult. If they want experience, then they need to say it. If you're looking for somebody who can bring fresh ideas and a new approach, then they need to say it. It is especially unhelpful when salaries aren't listed.\n\nInstead of applying for 900 jobs, I could have applied for 100, because I would have known with 800 of them that I would have been wasting a lot of effort, as I would have had a better sense that I was overqualified for most of them. But a lot of job specs weren't written properly and didn't show everything they were looking for.\n\nFinally, in December 2024, I was appointed as marketing director of Omega Diagnostics, a health testing company. They called me the day after I applied and said, \"Wow, you have a great résumé. Can we talk to you?\"\n\nWhen you do 900 job applications, you start to question yourself, and you think, \"Am I actually that good?\" And you build up resilience.\n\nFor them, my seniority was a significant advantage, but they also appreciated the fact that I had been successful in other industries and could bring a fresh perspective.\n\nSo, finally, it has turned out well. I'm well paid. It's relatively local. It's an industry where there is a lot of change and a lot of activity. It's an industry that actually has a positive outcome on people's lives. I'm really happy that I can personally recommend something that I'm doing for work that will make a difference.",

    "description": "Danny Moses, one of the traders featured in \"The Big Short,\" thinks the AI bubble is real. He shares advice on how to avoid getting burned.",
    "fullText": "Since Michael Burry launched a Substack in November, he's been sharing plenty of investing insight, but he isn't the only \"Big Short\" trader who has something to say about the current market landscape.\n\nDanny Moses, the former member of FrontPoint Partners, the firm led by Steve Eisman that successfully bet against the housing market in 2008, spoke to Business Insider about the potential problems he sees developing in the AI market and how he thinks investors should navigate the rapidly evolving space.\n\nAs the AI boom has unfolded, many finance pros have weighed two primary questions: Is there a bubble in the AI market, and if so, should it be compared to the dot-com era of the early 2000s?\n\nMoses thinks the answer to both questions is yes. While he doesn't deny that the AI trade is real and a secular growth story, he also sees strong parallels between the two tech crazes that suggest investors need to tread cautiously.\n\n\"The growth was real, but the math didn't work,\" he said. \"And I think that we're reaching a point where the math is starting not to work.\"\n\nMoses emphasized that his take on potential AI market problems isn't a call to short the industry. Rather, he noted it's a call for investors to do their homework and find the right names to gain valuable exposure as the market continues to grow.\n\nIn his view, that means sticking with the tech sector's most dominant names that have the resources to continue scaling and aren't bound by the same constraints that some smaller companies are. The best examples include Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\"They can turn down their capex at any point, and they're still cash flowing positive, as opposed to these other companies, which are dependent upon that spending within AI,\" he said.\n\nMoses isn't bullish on all of Big Tech's top names, though. He cited Oracle as an example of problems within the AI market, noting the company's high debt levels and the cash that it will require the fulfill the orders from tech clients. He also highlighted volatile tech stocks Super Micro Computer and CoreWeave as examples of riskier plays within the AI trade.\n\nIn his view, though, investors are finally starting to account for the fact that not all AI stocks are created equal as the divide between relative outperformers and underperformers becomes increasingly hard to ignore.\n\n\"I think it's proof that investors are beginning to sort out the winners and losers of the trade, and they'd much rather have comfort and other businesses with stronger balance sheets to fall back upon to express the AI theme,\" Moses added.\n\nHe also said that he's bullish on uranium, as the metal is being increasingly touted as a key component of the AI buildout that will be necessary to sustain the industry in the coming years.\n\nThat said, he thinks the timeline for when it will start to spur growth is one that investors should be paying close attention to, as it is sometimes misunderstood amid the AI hype.\n\n\"One of the trades that I like is uranium, which thematically, should work, but it takes a long period of time,\" Moses said. \"There's a mismatch in the timing of how people think that companies will experience AI growth and actually the infrastructure that it's going to take to power it.\"",

    "description": "Collibra CEO Felix Van de Maele said it's \"a red flag\" if prospective employees aren't leaning into how they can use AI to make their job better.",
    "fullText": "Collibra CEO Felix Van de Maele said it becomes \"a red flag\" if job seekers wanting to join his data governance platform cannot show familiarity with AI.\n\n\"In any interview, you expect people to think AI first in all the ways they do their job,\" Van de Maele said in an interview with Business Insider. \"And so if we ask for that and people haven't used or experimented with AI tools, they don't have a sense of how they do their job better, faster using AI, that definitely becomes a bit of a red flag.\"\n\nFounded in 2008 in Belgium, Collibra is among the top names in the data governance sector. In 2021, the private company was valued at $5.2 billion. Collibra has worked with McDonald's, Credit Suisse, Adobe, and Heineken.\n\nVan de Maele said the precise AI skills he's looking for vary by position. For example, he said, if he's interviewing an engineer, he wants to know if they are using AI agents like Cursor.\n\n\"I think you can ask questions to get a sense of how are people actually using those tools and what kind of experience have they had,\" he said. \"I think that's really important. Do they have an interest and are they leaning into wanting to use those tools, or are they more defensive and taking a step back on the adoption of those tools?\"\n\nVan de Maele said that at Collibra, which he described as sort of like \"ServiceNow for data,\" AI adoption has increased drastically over the past year. His roughly 1,000 employees around the world use AI for everything from transcribing meetings to building custom agents and assistants. The goal is to push AI usage to change how work is done.\n\nIn the enterprise marketplace, Van de Maele said he sees the ideal niche for his company as an independent layer that can connect a large amount of company-specific data, unlocking the true capabilities of AI, particularly the promise of AI agents.\n\n\"Imagine you're hiring a senior new person and in your organization and ask them to do certain analysis,\" he said.\n\nIt's challenging for humans to navigate all the hoops required to access what they need and understand how companies organize their data. In an agentic AI future, an agent could find themselves stuck in a similar situation.\n\n\"If a human can't do it, the agent can't do it unless you make that context formal and you capture that context so the agent can use that,\" Van de Maele said.\n\nMaking sure customers get a tailored experience is why Palantir helped popularize the use of forward-deployed engineers. OpenAI and other model makers are following suit with their own teams. The current issue with enterprise AI, Van de Maele said, is that if a company is tied to just a single model they could easily fall behind.\n\n\"If I'm a big bank, if I'm a big organization, I don't want to be completely tied to one model vendor because who knows, maybe next month there's another model that's five times better or five times cheaper,\" he said. \"I want to have the flexibility to change. That's strategically important to me.\"",

    "fullText": "Steps to help combat fraud in which criminals use AI-generated replica of a person’s voice to deceive victims\n\nThe voicemail from your son is alarming. He has just been in a car accident and is highly stressed. He needs money urgently, although it is not clear why, and he gives you some bank details for a transfer.\n\nYou consider yourself wise to other scams, and have ignored texts claiming to be from him and asking for cash. But you can hear his voice and he is clearly in trouble.\n\nHowever, the voicemail is the latest way in which criminals are using technology to defraud people. By taking a tiny snippet of real audio – just three seconds is enough – from a person, they can “clone” the individual’s voice using freely available AI technology. From there, they can make an recording of the synthesised voice saying exactly what they want.\n\nThe criminals can record a voice from videos on social media or by calling someone and saying nothing. A victim just needs to respond with words such as “hello, who is there?” to give them material for their hoax.\n\nOliver Devane, a senior researcher at the online security company McAfee, says this is a sophisticated example of spear phishing, or a personalised, targeted attack.\n\n“Having tested some of the free and paid AI voice cloning tools online, we found in one instance, that just three seconds of audio was needed to produce a good match,” he says.\n\n“Cybercriminals will often source this information from public social media profiles and other places online where people post about themselves, their families, their travels, and so on in an attempt to cash in.\n\n“The cybercriminal is betting on a loved one or family member becoming worried, letting emotions take over, and sending money to help.”\n\nA phone call or a voicemail, or even a voice note, will come through on your mobile and sound exactly like a loved one or friend.\n\nThey will have been involved in an accident or they may have been robbed or injured. They will be distressed and there will be a sense of urgency.\n\nWhatever the circumstances, they will ask for money. They may not give details of why they need the money but they will say it is urgent. They may ask you to transfer it to an account that belongs to someone else.\n\nAs with many scams, if you get a call or voicemail that asks for money, take a moment to stop and think. Does it really sound like the person you know? Are there strange speech patterns that are not accounted for by the fact that there is an emergency.\n\nEven if the phone number comes up as coming from one of your children, this is no assurance as the number can also be faked.\n\n“Try to remain level-headed and pause before you take any next steps,” says Devane. “Remember that cybercriminals are betting on emotions running high. They will play on your connection to the loved one and create a sense of urgency to prompt you into action.”\n\nCall the person who it seems left the message. They may pick up and be able to reassure you that they are OK. Remember the message has come by phone, so even if there is a real emergency they clearly can reach their device and get a signal.\n\nTo prepare for the possibility of such scams, you can set up a codeword between you and your children so you know for sure when they are in trouble.",

    "description": "This tech giant's early entry into the AI space has helped it build a substantial revenue backlog that could propel its shares higher in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\n\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \"Magnificent Seven\" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\n\nThere is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\n\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.",

    "description": "Spencer Penn worked at Tesla and Waymo before he founded LightSource, an AI-powered sourcing and procurement startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Spencer Penn, the 33-year-old founder of LightSource, who lives in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI moved to California 10 years ago, back when Tesla was a boutique car business. We were making 1,000 vehicles a week.\n\nMy friends and family were telling me it was a big career mistake to work at Tesla. They said it would never be someone's main car, that it's a tech toy, that it's an iPad with wheels on it. But I was just excited to see what this Elon guy was up to.\n\nMy interactions with Elon were always very positive, but I'm not a fanboy. There were some things that were very notable about his leadership style.\n\nTesla is a very flat organization. When I was there, even relatively young and out of college, it was two levels between Elon and me. That's very unusual to have such close proximity so early in your career.\n\nJust because it's a flat org structure, doesn't mean it's a horizontal power dynamic. Elon is the king. What he says goes. If you wanted to get something done, you really did have to go through Elon.\n\nThe drawbacks were that the guy didn't have that much time. In 2017, he was running three different companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink. He was just getting started with OpenAI. He had two and a half days a week to really focus on Tesla exclusively. You'd have to get things approved in that period of time.\n\nBut he was also very focused on the product. He would get involved in the way that things felt. If you wanted to change a texture on a paint, you'd want to get his buy-in.\n\nMany CEOs go the opposite direction. They let themselves get so far removed from the product. Elon always felt the product was the thing, and the innovation would be what drives the company forward.\n\nI like to embody that here at our company. I still do demos. If you take your hands off the wheel, things might veer in a direction you don't like.\n\nElon has a knack for setting overly ambitious goals. There are benefits and drawbacks. Sometimes, you lose credibility. Certain products like the new Roadster were unveiled back when I was an employee, and they've yet to be delivered.\n\nBut there are certain things where you shoot for the moon and you do hit the stars. Nobody thought Starlink would be as successful as quickly as it has been.\n\nIf you apply the right amount of pressure, you can see where the leaks are. That kind of ambition is everything.\n\nThat's the final thing Elon does: he's really a risk taker. He's bet the company multiple times; he always keeps putting the chips back on red. I think about that a lot. Sometimes it can be hard for professional management to take the risks they need to. Sometimes you can sleepwalk into a long-term, uncompetitive position.\n\nThere was some internal signaling. People knew that Elon was in the factory. They knew that he was going to stay there until the issues were fixed. Elon works about as hard as any human on earth possibly can.\n\nThere's a hotel right across the street from the Fremont factory. Part of me always felt like, instead of setting up pillows in a conference room, I would like our CEO to be well-rested and go to the hotel five minutes away. But the signaling was very potent.\n\nI try to embody that to some degree here, too. I like to come into the office five days a week. I want people to know that I'm coming in early and I'm staying late. I unload the dishwasher in the office. I'm assembling IKEA furniture.\n\nWaymo was a very different organization. It's a very vertical org structure. Google is a large organization with lots of levels, and that translated directly to Waymo, which is a much smaller business.\n\nEven though it's a very vertical org structure, it's a horizontal power structure. It's like it's rotated 90 degrees from Tesla.\n\nSome people compared the org to slime mold. It starts to spread and find all the crevices on its own. Individual contributors could construct their own ideas.\n\nThere are benefits and drawbacks. There is the possibility that there are duplicative teams doing the same things in different ways. But it also leads to a lot of creativity.\n\nAt Tesla, it was very clear that Elon and his lieutenants were driving a lot of the decisions. The decisions that the more junior people made would be incremental. At Google, I found that a lot of the best ideas come from the individual folks in the business, because they're given the freedom to roam.\n\nIn a startup, you have limited resources. You have to be focused, but a lot of the best ideas come from experimentation.\n\nWe had an engineer who asked if he could move his start date by a month. He was like, \"I want to spend a month before I get into work catching up on everything that's happening in AI.\" He came to the table, and he had so deeply immersed himself that he had a lot of new and fresh ideas. Many of those ideas have become product features.\n\nI have to delegate innovation to folks on the team to find those opportunities. That's something I learned from Google.",

    "description": "Several key Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Josh Hawley, have been outspoken against federal AI preemption.",
    "fullText": "Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida — a 2024 GOP primary opponent of Trump's — has been a consistent critic of federal efforts to curtail states' ability to regulate AI.\n\nAs lawmakers considered adding an AI regulation moratorium to the annual defense bill in November, DeSantis wrote on X that doing so is a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"\n\n\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment,\" DeSantis wrote. \"Denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's executive order, DeSantis said at an AI roundtable event in Florida that he was confident that it wouldn't apply to laws that the governor is pursuing in his state.\n\nBut he said that if the administration did try to challenge Florida laws, he would expect the state to prevail.\n\n\"Even reading it very broadly, I think the stuff we're doing is going to be very consistent,\" DeSantis said of the executive order. \"But irrespective, clearly we have a right to do this.\"\n\nAs Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene began to break with the president over the summer, one of the issues the Georgia Republican highlighted was AI.\n\nGreene notably admitted to voting for an initial version of the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" without realizing that it contained a provision to block state AI regulation for AI.\n\n\"I am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there,\" Greene wrote on X in June.\n\nFull transparency, I did not know about this section on pages 278-279 of the OBBB that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years.\n\nI am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in… pic.twitter.com/bip3hztSGq\n\nThe Georgia Republican re-upped her criticism when the provision was under consideration for the annual defense bill in November.\n\n\"States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state,\" Greene wrote on X. \"Federalism must be preserved.\"\n\nJust days later, Greene announced that she would resign from Congress on January 5 after Trump called her a \"traitor,\" largely over her stance on the Epstein files.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley has been one of the biggest GOP critics of the AI industry in the Senate — and he's opposed efforts to restrict states from regulating the technology.\n\n\"I would think that, just as a matter of federalism, we'd want states to be able to try out different regimes that they think will work for their state,\" Hawley told Business Insider in June. \"And I think in general, on AI, I do think we need some sensible oversight that will protect people's liberties.\"\n\nWhen the AI provision was reported to be no longer under consideration for the defense bill in November, Hawley celebrated via a post on X.\n\n\"Good. This is a terrible provision and should remain OUT,\" he wrote.\n\nIn June, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas — who served as the White House Press Secretary during Trump's first term — led a group of 17 Republican governors in opposing an AI moratorium in the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThat provision in that bill was stronger than Trump's executive order — it would have amounted to a more wholesale ban on state-level AI regulation for a period of 10 years.\n\nSanders also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post opposing the plan.\n\n\"That Congress proposes to strip away the right of any state to regulate AI is the antithesis of what our founders envisioned when they established our federal system,\" she wrote in June.\n\nIn November, as lawmakers considered adding a similar provision to the defense bill, Sanders spoke up again.\n\n\"Now isn't the time to backtrack,\" she wrote on X. \"Drop the preemption plan now and protect our kids and communities.\"\n\nGov. Spencer Cox of Utah, among the GOP governors who signed onto Sanders' letter, has also remained outspoken against efforts to limit state-level AI regulation.\n\n\"I'm very worried about any type of federal incursion into states' abilities to regulate AI,\" Cox told NPR in November.\n\nIn December, as Trump prepared to sign his executive order, Cox said there was a need for more balance.\n\n\"An alternative AI executive order focused on human flourishing would strike the balance we need: safeguard our kids, preserve our values, and strengthen American competitiveness,\" Cox wrote on X. \"States must help protect children and families while America accelerates its leadership in AI.\"",

    "fullText": "Analysts see ‘global construction frenzy that shows no signs of slowing’ amid surge in demand from AI boom\n\nA new report finds that investment in the worldwide data center market reached $61bn this year, setting a new record atop the wave of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe analysis by S&P Global, first reported by CNBC, documented what the market intelligence firm called a “global construction frenzy that shows no signs of slowing”, to build out the massive real estate, hardware, and energy requirements driven by insatiable demand from AI companies. S&P pegged 2024’s investment in the data center market at $60.8bn, just below the 2025 number.\n\n“Unable to buy, many investors are turning to new builds,” wrote Iuri Struta, an analyst for S&P Global.\n\nThere are approximately 500 data centers in the United Kingdom, compared with about 4,000 in the United States, according to Data Center Map, which tracks the facilities globally.\n\nStruta, the S&P Global analyst, said he does not see the demand for data centers slowing.\n\n“The global data center footprint is projected to expand at a faster rate over the next five years than it did in the previous five, spurred by demand for energy- and computer-intensive AI workloads,” said Struta.\n\nS&P Global’s report comes at a time when some investors worry that the entire artificial intelligence sector may be in the midst of huge overspending for unproven ongoing returns.\n\nLast week, Oracle’s shares dropped 11% after it reported lower quarterly earnings than analysts had expected, which in turn dragged the stock prices on some other major companies in AI. Some companies such as Oracle, along with Nvidia and OpenAI, have been criticized recently for making deals with one another that seem circular to many investors.\n\nEarlier this year, the International Energy Agency noted in a lengthy report that, globally, “electricity demand for data centres more than doubles by 2030”, reaching 945 terawatt hours (TWh), or just more than “Japan’s total electricity consumption today”.\n\nThis month, a trio of analysts from Deutsche Bank put out a staggering chart indicating that OpenAI alone will burn through $143bn between 2024 and 2029, the year before the company claims it will turn a profit. That chart shows how much more the ChatGPT maker, seen as a bellwether of the AI industry, plans to spend relative to other tech giants of the last two decades, including Amazon, Tesla and Uber, reached profitability.\n\n“Of course, OpenAI may continue to attract significant funding and could ultimately develop products that generate substantial profits and revolutionise the world,” Jim Reid, managing director, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank, wrote.\n\n“But at present, no startup in history has operated with losses on anything approaching this scale. We are firmly in uncharted territory.”",

    "title": "LG TVs' unremovable Copilot shortcut is the least of smart TVs' AI problems",
    "description": "LG says it’ll let people delete the Copilot icon. But TV chatbots aren’t going away.",
    "fullText": "Online fury erupted this week after an LG TV owner claimed that a firmware update installed unremovable generative AI software on their smart TV.\n\nThe controversy began on Saturday, when a Reddit user posted about the sudden appearance of a Microsoft Copilot icon on their device (something Windows users are all too familiar with). The Reddit user claimed that a “new software update installed Copilot” onto their LG TV and that it couldn’t be deleted.\n\n“Pre-installed crap is universally dogshit. If I wanted it, I’d have installed it myself eventually. The whole reason it’s bundled is because no one would choose it… Burn your television,” another Reddit user responded in the thread, which has 36,000 upvotes as of this writing.\n\nSome news outlets covered the move this week, reporting that LG customers were upset by an “unremovable Microsoft Copilot installation” and that other LG TV owners could expect to get it the next time they update their device.\n\nLG has since admitted that it used a webOS update to force Copilot onto some of its TVs. However, the firmware update didn’t install the Copilot application but rather a shortcut to the Copilot web app, which opens in the TV’s integrated web browser, LG spokesperson Chris De Maria told The Verge. De Maria added that “features such as microphone input are activated only with the customer’s explicit consent.”\n\nLG’s spokesperson said the company added the “shortcut icon to enhance customer accessibility and convenience.” LG, like other companies, has failed to prove why people need their non-computing devices, such as computer mice or earbuds, to provide instant access to third-party chatbots.\n\nFor those annoyed about the web app shortcut, De Maria said today that LG “will take steps to allow users to delete the shortcut icon if they wish.” He didn’t provide more details.\n\nEven with LG’s concession, it may become more difficult to avoid chatbots on TVs.\n\nLG says it will let people delete the Copilot icon from their TVs soon, but it still has plans to weave the service throughout webOS. The Copilot web app rollout seems to have been a taste of LG’s bigger plans to add Copilot to some of its 2025 OLED TVs. In a January announcement, LG said Copilot will help users find stuff to watch by “allowing users to efficiently find and organize complex information using contextual cues.” LG also said Copilot would “proactively” identify potential user problems and offer “timely, effective solutions.”\n\nSome TVs from LG’s biggest rival, Samsung, have included Copilot since August. Owners of supporting 2025 TVs can speak to Copilot using their remote’s microphone. They can also access Copilot via the Tizen OS homescreen’s Apps tab or through the TVs’ Click to Search feature, which lets users press a dedicated remote button to search for content while watching live TV or Samsung TV Plus. Users can also ask the TV to make AI-generated wallpapers or provide real-time subtitle translations.\n\nCopilot similarly rolled out automatically onto supporting Samsung TVs. Users can avoid Copilot by not using the above features, and they may be able to remove the Copilot icon from their TV’s Apps section.\n\nBut Copilot will still be integrated into Tizen OS, and Samsung appears eager to push chatbots into TVs, including by launching Perplexity’s first TV app. Amazon, which released Fire TVs with Alexa+ this year, is also exploring putting chatbots into TVs.\n\nAfter the backlash LG faced this week, companies may reconsider installing AI apps on people’s smart TVs. A better use of large language models in TVs may be as behind-the-scenes tools to improve TV watching. People generally don’t buy smart TVs to make it easier to access chatbots.\n\nBut this development is still troubling for anyone who doesn’t want an AI chatbot in their TV at all.\n\nSubtle integrations of generative AI that make it easier for people to do things like figure out the name of “that movie” may have practical use, but there are reasons to be wary of chatbot-wielding TVs.\n\nChatbots add another layer of complexity to understanding how a TV tracks user activity. With a chatbot involved, smart TV owners will be subject to complicated smart TV privacy policies and terms of service, as well as the similarly verbose rules of third-party AI companies. This will make it harder for people to understand what data they’re sharing with companies, and there’s already serious concern about the boundaries smart TVs are pushing to track users, including without consent.\n\nChatbots can also contribute to smart TV bloatware. Unwanted fluff, like games, shopping shortcuts, and flashy ads, already disrupts people who just want to watch TV.\n\nLG’s Copilot web app is worthy of some grousing, but not necessarily because of the icon that users will eventually be able to delete. The more pressing issue is the TV industry’s shift toward monetizing software with user tracking and ads.\n\nIf you haven’t already, now is a good time to check out our guide to breaking free from smart TV ads and tracking.",

    "description": "London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova said that rapid AI disruption could outpace institutions and destabilize societies.",
    "fullText": "A historic labor shock may be about to hit the job market.\n\nThat's according to London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova.\n\nShe said AI is advancing so quickly that it could trigger mass layoffs long before new jobs emerge to replace them — a mismatch that has historically fueled social unrest.\n\nAbramova, who studies technology-driven economic transitions, said the past three years of AI advances mark a sharp break from earlier waves of mechanization.\n\nIn past eras — from 18th-century textile automation to late-20th-century manufacturing decline — the impact was mostly gradual and largely contained to individual sectors, she said.\n\nBut AI is different: \"A single AI model can displace thousands of cognitive jobs across multiple industries overnight,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAbramova expects layoffs to outstrip new job creation over the next five to 10 years, especially without aggressive retraining efforts.\n\nWhile the exact number of AI-related layoffs is unknown, several major companies have already cited AI as a reason to reduce head count or to announce job cuts.\n\nNew AI-related roles often require skills or credentials that many displaced workers lack, Abramova said, and entry-level positions — such as junior developers, analysts, and customer support staff — are already among the most vulnerable.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of Lazard and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Obama, sees a similar risk.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" this week, Orszag said that if AI delivers on its promise, there's likely to be a jobs crisis.\n\n\"Labor markets deal well with small problems that happen fast or big problems that happen slow. They do not deal well with big shocks that happen quickly,\" he said.\n\nAbramova said that the social risks extend far beyond unemployment numbers.\n\n\"History shows social strain emerges when the pace of economic change overtakes institutions' capacity to support displaced workers,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed to the UK's Enclosure Acts, which displaced tens of thousands of small farmers from common land, sparking riots and mass migration, and to the 1980s coal pit closures, which wiped out mining communities almost overnight and triggered years of strikes and political upheaval.\n\nBusiness leaders are divided over AI's impact on jobs, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Ford CEO Jim Farley warning of widespread white-collar displacement, while Elon Musk, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, and OpenAI's Sam Altman have predicted varying outcomes, ranging from significant disruption to long-term prosperity.\n\nOthers, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Yann LeCun — Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist — say AI will transform work rather than erase it.\n\n\"It's very likely that the companies that use AI first, that use robotics technology first, will be the most successful first, and they will end up hiring more people,\" Huang said in late October.\n\n\"You're going to lose your job not to somebody — not to a robot, you're going to lose your job to somebody who uses a robot. You're going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI,\" he added.\n\nIf governments and employers fail to prepare, Abramova said she expects widening inequality, persistent unemployment, falling consumer demand, rising political anger, and even expanding surveillance as leaders try to contain discontent.\n\nIn extreme cases, she warned, democratic norms can erode.\n\nBut she also said that the worst outcomes aren't inevitable.\n\nThe alternative is worker-augmenting AI: systems where machines handle data-intensive tasks while humans retain judgment, ethics, and client relationships. That shift will require regulatory incentives that reward firms for responsible oversight, not just rapid headcount reduction.\n\n\"Without major support,\" Orszag said, \"many displaced workers risk long-term underemployment.\"",

    "title": "From McKinsey to PwC, here's how elite consulting firms are racing to hire engineers — and train everyone else in AI",
    "description": "Business Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders about how consulting's talent recruitment is changing.",
    "fullText": "AI is pushing consultants to their biggest-ever talent overhaul.\n\nAs firms shift from slide decks and advisory work to multi-year AI-driven transformation projects, the profile of the ideal consultant at firms like Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey, and PwC is changing.\n\n\"Going to a client and purely proposing an army of consultants doesn't really work anymore,\" Gert De Geyter, a former AI lead at Deloitte US, told Business Insider.\n\nInstead of the \"pure traditional consultant,\" firms are now looking for a blend of \"generalists and technical experts,\" said De Geyter, who left the firm in July to join AI startup Teragonia.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders to understand how consulting firms are hiring, retraining, and redefining their workforces to meet the moment.\n\nThe work that consultants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced with building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies, requiring technology expertise over research skills.\n\nHiring data reveals how aggressively top firms have been expanding their technologist ranks. Accenture's latest annual report shows it added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global head count. EY has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nAt McKinsey, the \"AI engineer\" is the fastest-growing non-entry-level role, followed by procurement officer, data scientist, and software engineer, according to workforce intelligence company Revelio Labs.\n\nAt Boston Consulting Group, software engineers, frontend developers, and Python developers are the fastest-growing entry-level roles.\n\nBCG, which brought on 1,000 employees last year, has ramped up hiring technologists since launching its tech and AI arm, BCG X, in late 2022.\n\n\"We're essentially building a tech company inside a consulting firm,\" said Sylvain Duranton, Global Leader of BCG X. \"Our job has always been to help companies transform. But tech has become so critical to transformation that we needed to have a grip on it ourselves.\"\n\nIts regular consulting division is also adopting a more tech-centric mentality.\n\nScott Wilder, a BCG partner and managing director, told Business Insider that a new team, called \"forward deployed consultants,\" is rising through the ranks. It takes inspiration from a software engineering role popularized by Palantir, Wilder said.\n\nThese consultants are vibe-coding and building tools on client projects, he said. When one of these tools is a hit, it goes back to the R&D team and becomes a broader tool that everyone can use.\n\nFor firms like McKinsey and BCG, the must-have hire in the AI era isn't a pure engineer or a pure consultant — it's someone who can move between both worlds.\n\n\"What we want to be able to do is find those people that actually have a propensity to either be this great McKinsey consultant, and or a great technologist, and then groom them to be both,\" Alex Singla, a senior partner at McKinsey who co-leads its AI arm, QuantumBlack, told Business Insider.\n\nHe added that candidates also want hybrid roles: Many don't want to spend years building products for a cloud company like AWS, nor do they want to be traditional consultants.\n\nSingla said McKinsey is looking for \"5Xers — they're deep in one thing, but can do three or four different things well.\"\n\nQuantumBlack, with its 1,700-person team, drives all of McKinsey's AI initiatives, which account for 40% of the firm's work, but McKinsey's technical talent isn't limited to that group, Singla said. There are about 3,500 people building internal technology for McKinsey, and another 4,000 to 5,000 consultants who are leading the technical work from the business side, but don't necessarily have technical expertise.\n\nThe consulting talent landscape has been in flux since the pandemic, when a surge in demand prompted top firms to aggressively staff up. As that boom faded and demand for advisory work slowed, many firms found themselves overstaffed, triggering layoffs and a more selective approach to hiring.\n\nAmid the shifting market, the traditional pyramid model — built on large cohorts of junior consultants — started to recalibrate as firms focused on roles that deliver value over manpower. That focus has only sharpened with the rise of AI, prompting firms to invest heavily in upskilling their existing workforces.\n\n\"Everyone is reckoning with the fact that AI has exploded onto the scene,\" Saurabh Sarbaliya, PwC's AI Lead, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The demand for people who can make AI work in the enterprise is only going to grow — but there just aren't enough experts. So you have to focus on upskilling your existing workforce,\" he said.\n\nAt KPMG, Sam Gloede, the firm's global trusted AI leader, said it is prioritizing upskilling over hiring.\n\n\"There is not a massive change in our workforce,\" Gloede said. \"It's just a focus on upskilling, literacy, and learning.\"\n\nEY is taking a similar approach and prioritizing the AI capabilities of its employees, Imgard Naudin ten Cate, EY's global leader of talent acquisition, told Business Insider.\n\nIn October, EY held a two-week learning event to teach employees to build AI agents for use in their day-to-day work. The firm has also rolled out 15-hour courses on topics including AI engineering, applied AI, and AI compliance.\n\nNearly 100,000 employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the courses, said Simon Brown, EY's global learning and development leader. The initiative has been \"a phenomenal way at scale to build deep AI knowledge,\" he added.\n\nTechnologist roles are in high demand, but don't expect a team of hoodie-wearing Silicon Valley types when your company hires consultants. Most in the industry are still generalists with strong problem-solving and communication skills — and they'll likely show up in a suit.\n\nEven as firms hire more technologists, most consulting work still doesn't require deep engineering expertise. Traditional consulting roles at top firms are still on the rise, growing from 250,000 globally in 2022 to 340,000 in 2024, according to Revelio Labs.\n\n\"A lot of the clients are still just dipping their toes in the AI pond, so over-engineering solutions for them doesn't work,\" said de Geyter, the former AI lead at Deloitte US. \"It's a lot more helpful that someone supports them with setting up the right data governance so they can get ready for AI solutions down the line.\"\n\nA senior software engineer at Deloitte, who requested anonymity as they are not permitted to speak to the media, told Business Insider that the technical literacy of most employees is improving, but remains in a \"very nascent state.\"\n\n\"They're looking less for people who know the inners of how these black box models work or could train one themselves, and more at people who can quickly leverage them for a specific solution set,\" the person said.\n\nStill, they warned that the current skill level poses a strategic risk: \"We can't let it continue for too long.\"\n\nJim Rowan, head of AI at Deloitte US, told Business Insider that its employees have \"the latest technologies and certifications to effectively work with machines and unlock even more impactful business outcomes for clients.\" Deloitte is not just hiring more data engineers and technologists, but \"actively investing\" in upskilling its workforce, Rowan said.\n\nSeveral leaders told Business Insider that soft skills are becoming more relevant now that AI can perform specific quantitative tasks.\n\n\"When we get asked a question of what we are looking for when we recruit, the core fundamental thing is actually attitude,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's AI workforce lead, said. Communication, collaboration, and agile learning — \"the sort of things AI can't really do\" — are the standout qualities, he said.\n\nMcKinsey is still active on college campuses recruiting undergraduates, MBAs, and PhDs, said Kate Smaje, McKinsey's global leader of technology and AI.\n\nIn its screening process, McKinsey emphasizes elements of judgment and conceptual thinking in problem-solving, resilience, and the ability to learn quickly.\n\nThe ability to build relationships and the core EQ leadership qualities can be \"fairy dust\" on top of what you can do analytically that will now set you apart, said Smaje.\n\n\"What we really hire for is voracious learners, people who are curious about the world and have the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn,\" she said. \"Those are the people we really want.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "On new years eve last year I told myself I wanted to really adopt AI. Let's talk about it.",
    "fullText": "On new years eve last year I told myself I wanted to really adopt AI. Let's talk about it.\n\nOne year ago I set a New Year's resolution for myself to be an AI optimist for 2025. Before this, I had been a bit of a skeptic, you might say, and I still am in my core. But I thought it would be an interesting perspective to go through 2025 with.\n\nIn the beginning of the year I went out hard. I wanted to use AI in every single part of my life. Personal and work. This was fun, and there were certainly some good use cases. For example, taking a photo of a whiteboard after a meeting, uploading to my Mac's Raycast chat instance, and asking an LLM to OCR what was on there. Cool, not groundbreaking.\n\nAt this point, I was still a heavy terminal and Neovim user. This is how I'd been working for the last 6 years or so. And I loved it. I created this really productive environment where I could fly through files. Going from idea to code has never really been the hard part for me. I think learning Vim and Neovim was one of the best things I've done for my career for the first 6 years. I would see colleagues of mine slowly click through an IDE with their mouse, while I would already have a draft PR out.\n\nAs the year went by, I started hearing more and more about Cursor. I tried it. Didn't like it, went back to Neovim. Then I heard more and more about Zed. Tried it, really liked it, but then went back to Neovim. I used some AI plugins for Neovim, like Copilot and gp.nvim, and it worked quite well.\n\nThen agentic editing started to surface. It was quite bad in the beginning. But after the summer of 2025, things really started accelerating. I gave Cursor another shot, and with the release of Composer 1, I found myself not going back to Neovim. When I did go back, I just cringed at the incredible latency and performance of Copilot. And not having gp.nvim actually implement the changes it suggested, but just displaying them made me realize the jump ahead Cursor had created for itself.\n\nComposer 1 and the agents panel is absolutely crazy. There's so much power here, and it can write a lot of code. Some pretty good, and some less. I really think it's great. But it's such a double edged sword.\n\nI think this is a term you've probably heard in other contexts in your life. If you can't remember, go back to your school days. Someone near you probably mentioned that when you write something down, you remember it better. I think this is interesting. Having an agent write your code and then you reviewing (i.e., reading) works. But the problem is that you won't build a mental model or deep understanding of the code.\n\nOn one hand I deeply believe in the previous paragraph. And, I want to go back to pure Neovim and write every single line of code by hand. Except boilerplate of course (this is something we all have to agree on is better with LLMs). But then I jump a few years ahead in my mind, and think about where the industry is in 10, 15, or even 20 years. I'm just 26 years old. I joined my first startup at 18 and I've been building web and mobile apps at all types of companies ever since. But where are we in 20 years? Will code even matter, or will English just be the next elevator level in the skyscraper of language abstractions?\n\nKnowing how your codebase works on a deeper level is really valuable. If a customer comes to you with a bug, you can't blame the LLM.\n\nYou know, uuhmm... I didn't actually write that code. But I'll check with the Claude.\n\nHow would you feel if a service provider you use in your company would answer something like that to a bug you report? Sure, they won't answer like that. But they'll think it. How does that feel to you? Probably not great. It doesn't bring a huge sense of trust in that company.\n\nI know there's real value in deeply understanding the code you write. Even if it's boring code at times, it's valuable. Taking ownership of what you ship to customers. After all, \"customers\" are just simple peasants like you and me. And I fucking hate when Netflix won't load half of the shows on my Samsung smart TV. You have to ask yourself what you expect from the products and services you use. And then apply those expectations to the products you build.\n\nSo, it seems like things are only going in one direction: abstractions. English to code. It kinda works. You can ship a ton. And your boss is probably happy because your team is delivering more features. Your users? Who knows. Maybe they're happy. But honestly, as a user, I don't give a hell if Netflix ships a bunch of new features. I just care about their core. If their new fancy features are all half-baked, laggy pieces of crap, I'll watch something on Apple TV instead.\n\nAnother thing that's worth reflecting on is that even though it might seem like everything is going in one direction in the insutry. It doesn't mean we have to go that route. It's not like there's just one final master goal to all of this. These are just private companies who want to sell us their services. And, you might not believe it... But we don't have to buy it.",

    "fullText": "AI stocks might look frothy, but Uber's embrace of the technology is transforming its operations and yielding huge financial benefits, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says.\n\n\"You can debate whether or not there's a bubble in terms of valuation,\" Khosrowshahi told the \"On with Kara Swisher\" podcast in an episode released Thursday. \"The spending on the data centers, etc., is massive.\"\n\nBut AI has created a lot of value for Uber, \"not in the space-age stuff\" but in \"very practical\" ways, he said, such as determining what's shown next to a customer on their Uber Eats app after they select a carton of oat milk.\n\nThe latest AI models are \"enormously more effective\" than previous generations, and are producing \"hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit to us,\" he added.\n\nUber's AI spend \"has been well worth it and then some,\" he said. \"We are not building the picks and shovels but we're riding on top of that spend, absolutely.\"\n\nAI stocks have soared to record highs this year, but investors such as Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" have warned tech giants are overspending on microchips and data centers in their scramble for computing power, and will fall short of their fabulous growth forecasts.\n\nKhosrowshahi described his mobility, delivery, and freight company as an \"applied AI\" business. It's harnessing the tech for everything from setting prices and payments to matching, routing, identification, and dealing with customer complaints, he said.\n\nRoughly 80% to 90% of Uber's developers now use AI tools, he said. The company no longer has to keep scores of engineers on call to fix issues, and have them spend \"hours and hours\" figuring out what's gone wrong and where, as AI agents are now \"constantly looking at all of our systems\" and helping to diagnose problems, he continued.\n\n\"And then the human can look over the shoulder of the AI agent,\" he added.\n\nKhosrowshahi said that other tech bosses might see AI making their engineers 20% or 30% more productive, and conclude they need 20% to 30% fewer engineers, but that's not his attitude.\n\n\"I just think they become superhumans,\" he said. \"So we are actually hiring more engineers because every engineer got more valuable to me.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi also touched on Uber's partnership with Waymo and other robotaxi companies, saying the driverless vehicles are proving popular.\n\n\"There's something to be said for privacy,\" he said. While he loves talking to Uber drivers and hearing their stories, it's also \"nice being alone in the car.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi predicted that once self-driving cars become proven revenue generators, Wall Street will embrace them as investments and want their cars on Uber's platform to access its customers and maximize their returns.\n\nSimilar to how private equity and private debt companies are \"financing these data centers and buying Nvidia chips, that same ecosystem is going to be buying fleets of cars,\" he said.\n\nKhosrowshahi said that Uber could play a similar role to Marriott, which primarily manages or franchises hotels instead of owning them.",

    "description": "Despite the great positive potential of AI, the AI ethics community has presented a rather gloomy picture of AI’s ethical implications. This paper examines the negativity within AI ethics through a philosophy of science lens. The prevailing negativity is a result of the particular way the discipline is institutionally organized, which pressures AI ethicists to portray AI in a critical light. As a consequence, the overall picture of AI offered by the AI ethics community is one-sided and negatively biased. We should be skeptical about the negative narrative promoted by AI ethics and explore ways of reforming the system.",

Larian CEO Swen Vincke recently kicked a hornet's nest after saying the studios' developers use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations. After a quick retraction and explanation, along with sharing that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking.

    "fullText": "The world of AI is evolving quickly beyond single-purpose models toward intelligent, autonomous multi-agent systems.\n\nIn order to help developers build these complex applications, we are excited to introduce Agent Development Kit (ADK) for TypeScript, an open-source framework designed to make agent development feel more like classic software development.\n\nNow TypeScript and JavaScript developers can build, streamline, and deploy powerful AI agents and multi-agent systems using the language and ecosystem they know and love.\n\nADK is built on a core principle: empowering developers with the flexibility and precise control of a code-first approach.\n\nUsing ADK for TypeScript, you can define your agent's logic, tools, and orchestration directly in TypeScript. This enables you to apply the same best practices you use for traditional software development — including version control, automated testing, and integration into your CI/CD pipelines.\n\nGetting started with ADK for TypeScript is simple and familiar for engineers. It replaces complex prompting with modular, testable components like Agents, Instructions, and Tools. This code-first approach makes your AI logic scalable and easy to reuse across your entire project. You can define a powerful agent in just a few lines of clean, readable code:\n\nBringing ADK to the TypeScript ecosystem unlocks a powerful set of benefits for developers:\n\nADK is an open-source framework, and while it is optimized for Google's AI, including Gemini and Vertex AI, it is designed to be model-agnostic and compatible with other third-party tools. This includes full support for our latest models, such as Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Flash, allowing you to leverage their advanced capabilities in your agents.\n\nConnect to your data effortlessly using MCP Toolbox for Databases and its new native ADK for TypeScript integration.\n\nWe believe in providing developers with powerful, flexible tools to build the next generation of AI applications.\n\nWe can't wait to see what you build with Agent Development Kit for TypeScript.\n\nExplore the GitHub Repository: https://github.com/google/adk-js\n\nDive into the Documentation: https://github.com/google/adk-docs\n\nCheck out the samples: https://github.com/google/adk-samples\n\nJoin the community, share your agents, and let us know what you think.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "fullText": "Capital One is concerned about AI costs rising via its cloud-computing relationship with Amazon and may be looking for alternatives, according to an internal Nvidia document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nIn the document, an Nvidia employee wrote that the chip giant talked with Capital One about AI infrastructure alternatives to Amazon Web Services, as the bank was \"looking to control costs.\"\n\nThe Nvidia staffer was recapping discussions with Capital One in an internal email after meeting representatives from the bank at a recent tech conference.\n\n\"They see their need for GPUs and reasoning models growing and the costs in AWS will soon get out of hand,\" the Nvidia employee wrote, referring to Capital One.\n\nNvidia and Capital One discussed \"AI factory and neo-clouds,\" according to the email. An AI factory is an in-house data center that a company can build to train and run AI models as an alternative to renting compute from a third party. Financial institutions can use this infrastructure for tasks such as fraud detection, customer support, and algorithmic trading, according to Nvidia.\n\nNeoclouds are upstart cloud providers, often powered by Nvidia hardware, that focus on AI workloads, whereas AWS supports a much broader range of computing needs. Top neocloud players include CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, and Nebius. Nvidia has been working closely with several of these players, in part to reduce its reliance on established cloud giants as customers.\n\nThe Capital One situation underscores a key dynamic in the AI boom. Companies are racing to adopt generative AI but also trying to mitigate rising cloud costs. This new technology has great promise, but developing and running AI models and AI applications can be expensive.\n\nLarge companies also regularly assess their cloud spending, including varying setups that increasingly incorporate multiple providers. Forty-three percent of companies use more than two public cloud providers, according to a recent RBC Capital report.\n\n\"We continue to be committed to AWS as our predominant strategic cloud partner,\" a Capital One spokesperson wrote in a statement. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\n\"Our pricing philosophy is to work relentlessly to take cost out of our own cost structure and to pass those savings back to our AWS customers in the form of lower prices,\" an AWS spokesperson said. \"It's easy to lower prices, it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices, and at AWS we work really hard at that.\"\n\nCapital One isn't the only company taking issue with AWS costs. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported in October that AI startups are increasingly delaying traditional AWS spend in favor of AI model and developer tools, according to internal Amazon documents from March and July.\n\nThe documents said that 90% of startups in Radical Ventures' portfolio were building primarily on rival clouds due to AWS costs. Amazon also noted internally that there was increasing demand from customers for neocloud providers, which let them rent GPU power in small chunks and only pay for what they use.\n\nWhen that story published in October, an AWS spokesperson said Business Insider was \"using old data to reach outdated conclusions,\" noting that \"AWS remains the top choice for startups to build because we offer the best core services as well as the most innovative and powerful generative AI offerings.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A firm whose top investment ideas have beaten the broader market in 2025 unveiled the big themes and stocks to watch in the coming year.",
    "fullText": "Slop bowls. AI layoffs. What your girlfriend spends money on.\n\nAll of those themes have a place in investors' portfolios for 2026, according to Citrini Research, which unveiled its top bets for the market heading into the new year.\n\nCitrini, which releases an annual \"thematic watchlist\" for investors, ended up handily beating the market with many of its 2025 calls. An equal-weighted portfolio of the firm's individual stock picks for the year gained 26.5%, outpacing the S&P 500's 15% gain. Around half of the 25 investment baskets it created for the year also beat the benchmark.\n\nThe firm's investment ideas for the coming year were based on trends it believes are unfolding.\n\n\"Some we think could be real winners, some are preparation for a specific scenario or eventuality, some we simply want to keep on our screen,\" Citrini wrote on Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the firm's most interesting market calls going into 2026.\n\nThesis: Critrini said it was bullish on stocks that were best-positioned to benefit from AI by reducing headcount.\n\nThe firm said it screened for companies that could most benefit from AI-induced layoffs by developing a \"Bureaucracy Score\", a gauge that measures how robust a firm's administrative and managerial layers are, as well as a \"Margin Optionality Score,\" which determines if a company is able to earn more if its workforce were leaner.\n\nCitrini identified over thirty firms in this category. Here are some of the largest on the list:\n\nThesis: Critrini said it believes slop bowl chains would be among the first to benefit from back-of-house automation, which would allow those firms to reduce labor costs and boost profit margins.\n\nChipotle, Cava, and other restaurants within the slop bowl universe are likely headed for an inflection point next year, they said.\n\nThe firm identified several slop bowl food chains and robotics companies that could benefit from the shift:\n\nThesis: As drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy become more popular, an investment opportunity is growing among users who are looking to keep the weight off after they stop taking a GLP-1 drug, Citrini said.\n\nThe firm pointed to GaINAc-SiRNA drugs, which are believed to help users preserve lean body mass and \"deliver sustained metabolic benefit.\" The drugs are also believed to redistribute fat away from \"metabolically harmful sites,\" Citrini added, referring to visceral fat, which resides deep in the abdominal cavity.\n\nThesis: The firm pointed to the Girlfriend Index, an online indicator built around the idea that investors can identify market opportunities based on what female consumers are spending money on.\n\nQuiet luxury fading out of the cultural zeitgeist is one such trend that looks to be gaining traction in 2026, Citrini said, citing contributions from The Girlfriend Index, a Substack that publishes a weekly memo on female-driven consumer spending.\n\n\"When culture rotates from restraint to expression, heritage luxury historically leads. The emerging expression of 2026 is luxury as self-expression,\" Citrini wrote.",

    "fullText": "Each morning, you can brew your coffee, brush your teeth — and read your Google AI briefing.\n\nGoogle Labs announced a new AI productivity tool on Tuesday, titled CC. Built with Gemini, CC prepares a morning rundown of priorities based on the user's Gmail, Calendar, and Drive. Google users can also email CC at any time to perform tasks such as setting reminders, scheduling events, or summarizing emails.\n\nCC comes from Google Labs, the division of Google that started \"Project Tailwind\" in 2022. That later produced NotebookLM, Google's AI research tool that was a breakout hit.\n\nAfter a few hours on the waitlist, I was approved to receive my own CC briefing. At 5:18 a.m. the following morning, \"Your Day Ahead\" hit my inbox, with Google AI celebrating the coming weekend. Here's what it had:\n\nI get dozens of newsletters. I emailed back: \"Hey CC, can you pick out the four most important stories in all the unread newsletters in my inbox that I should read?\"\n\nMy CC said that it \"couldn't find many newsletters from today,\" only finding one from CNN that it said it was \"unable to pull a full summary\" of. That was odd: There were also two unread New York Times newsletters, one from New York magazine, and one from GQ.\n\nIt did pull four articles from yesterday's newsletters, though, offering me three Vanity Fair stories and one from The Atlantic.\n\nI decided to try a simpler task. Sometimes Letterboxd will send out free or discounted movie tickets, but the offers get stuck in my \"promotions\" folder. Were there any offers I should know about?\n\nMy CC responded with five different discounts for movies like \"No Other Choice\" and \"The Voice of Hind Rajab.\" I wouldn't know those offers existed if I hadn't asked!\n\nFor me, that's the real promise of Google's CC: To go through the endless promotional emails and decide what you should know. It's a deals magnet, without having to rummage through the spam folder.\n\nI'm sure CC would be a great enterprise workplace tool, but it's not yet allowed. The waitlist is open to Google users in the United States and Canada who are 18 years old or older who use a personal email. No enterprise accounts are permitted.\n\nIf you want to give Google's CC tool a try, you can join the wait list here.",

In some ways, I am, and in some ways I think it'd be really annoying,\" Altman said on an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published Thursday.\n\nLeadership seems to be one of the sticking points for Altman: \"Am I excited to be a public company CEO? 0%.\"\n\n\"It's wonderful to be a private company,\" Altman said, but he added that OpenAI needs lots of capital and is going to \"cross all of the shareholder limits and stuff at some point.\"\n\n\"I do think it's cool that public markets get to participate in value creation,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman cofounded OpenAI alongside eleven others in 2015, and the company's value has soared since the launch of its AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022.\n\nChatGPT has 800 million weekly users, and the company has inked $1 trillion worth of deals with tech giants like Oracle, Nvidia, and AMD.\n\nIn October, the company reached a $500 billion valuation after a secondary share sale, briefly overtaking Elon Musk's SpaceX to become the most valuable private company in the world, a crown that SpaceX regained in recent days.\n\nThe Information reported on Wednesday that OpenAI is seeking to raise billions more at a $750 billion valuation.\n\nThere are signs the company is preparing for a potential IPO. In October, Reuters reported that OpenAI is considering filing with securities regulators as soon as the second half of 2026.\n\nBut asked during the podcast if OpenAI would IPO next year, Altman responded, \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"We will be very late to go public,\" Altman added.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is the latest to make a political hire as big tech spreads its tentacles around the world. So what’s the attraction?\n\nGeorge Osborne getting a new job isn’t exactly news. Since leaving frontline politics, the former chancellor has served as the chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, edited (not entirely successfully) the Evening Standard, advised asset manager BlackRock, joined boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, been appointed as the chair of the British Museum and taken on roles including advising crypto firm Coinbase. Oh, and like any white man of a particular age, he co-hosts a political podcast.\n\nBut Osborne’s latest job is the most eye-opening – and is an alarming augur of what is to come. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has become the latest organisation to employ Osborne. He will run OpenAI for Countries, a unit tasked with working directly with governments while expanding the company’s Stargate datacentre programme beyond the US. At least it was announced with a tweet, rather than a LinkedIn post.\n\nThe tweet prompted jokes, as did Osborne’s single-handed attempt to boost laggard employment figures brought about by his policies as the chancellor of austerity. But it’s a serious moment, because it’s another sign that the biggest AI firms are starting to behave less like normal companies and more like quasi-governments. They’re negotiating “national” partnerships, pitching a values-led vision of “democratic AI” and hiring former senior politicians as their diplomatic corps. It’s a similar path we have seen from other industries, including oil, pharma and defence, in previous decades – which is why it’s important to try to recognise the risks and head them off before AI companies can repeat the same trick.\n\nThe initiative Osborne is heading up, OpenAI for Countries, does what it says on the tin. It’s designed to embed OpenAI’s models and infrastructure inside the machinery of states, becoming an invaluable, indefatigable part of the running of our lives. OpenAI is in talks with about 50 countries to provide them with critical national infrastructure. Whether you welcome Osborne being put in that role rather than a tech executive is a little like Hobson’s choice: who do you distrust the least? But it’s an indication of how tech companies see their position in society that they are hiring such high-powered people for these roles.\n\nOsborne is not the first to don the branded hoodie and Silicon Valley lifestyle. His fellow coalition government bod Nick Clegg blazed the trail as head of global affairs for Meta. At the time of his initial hiring as a vice-president at Facebook in 2018, his appointment was treated as a PR move – a big name to help the company navigate scandal and scrutiny. But it hinted that platforms had become political actors, whether they liked it or not. The industry’s outsized spending on lobbyists (€151m in Europe alone at the last count) to support the political beasts is an indication of what is at stake. The numbers involved also hint at the scale of the prize that tech companies see: the 10 largest big tech firms now outspend the biggest 10 companies in the pharma, finance and automotive industries combined.\n\nThe former chancellor isn’t even the first former controller of the UK public purse to be handy to big tech. In October of this year, Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Microsoft and the AI firm Anthropic, less than two years after he convened the AI safety summit at Bletchley Park. Sunak, at least, already had the regulation hoodie in his wardrobe.\n\nYou can read these moves in two ways. The generous interpretation is that these companies are hedging: trying to anticipate tech regulation and ensure they understand it. The more cynical interpretation is that they are attempting to shape the geopolitical story around AI from inside the machine, hiring former leaders less for their technical insight than their institutional muscle memory and networks.\n\nEither way, it leaves democracies with a problem. Governments are supposed to set the rules of the road. But the tech companies they are meant to regulate are on a different scale, planting their feet in different countries. When Sunak convened the Bletchley Park summit, it was notable that he turned interviewer to quiz Elon Musk, sitting starry-eyed on stage as Musk dominated the discourse.\n\nIt’s time to recognise these companies are acting like political actors. That means it’s time to treat them like political actors, too. We need more transparency: governments signing up to OpenAI for Countries agreements should publish the details of their partnerships by default. We should also ask more questions about infrastructure dependence. Governments love Stargate-style investments in their countries, and want to be able to don a hard hat, cut a ribbon and issue a press release. But if they are in effect a new layer of national backbone, they should be studied more closely – as if they are utilities, rather than receive the good grace of a startup-style mystique.\n\nThe more tech companies start to act like politicians and global leaders, the more we need to treat them like it. That doesn’t mean deference; it means more scepticism and journalistic interrogation.\n\nChris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite App",

    "description": "The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.\n\nThis year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.\n\nWe like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.\n\nThat was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.\n\nOn reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nRegrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.\n\nImagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.\n\nThat was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.\n\nBut as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.\n\nStill interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.\n\nMore: I Tried the Robot That’s Coming to Live With You. It’s Still Part Human (WSJ), The World’s Stupidest Robot Maid (The Daily Show) Why the humanoid workforce is running late (MIT Technology Review), NEO The Home Robot | Order Today (1X Corp.)\n\nIt’s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.\n\nThis year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.\n\nIn April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”\n\nDon’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”\n\nMore: What OpenAI Did When ChatGPT Users Lost Touch With Reality (New York Times), Sycophantic AI Decreases Prosocial Intentions and Promotes Dependence (arXiv), Expanding on what we missed with sycophancy (OpenAI)\n\nWhen you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.\n\nThat’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.\n\nTo be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nColossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”\n\nIn a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.\n\nMore: Game of Clones: Colossal’s new wolves are cute, but are they dire?

Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.\n\nIn August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.\n\nThe purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.\n\nIn August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”\n\nMore: HHS Winds Down mRNA Vaccine Development (US Department of Health and Human Services),  Cancelling mRNA studies is the highest irresponsibility (Nature), How Moderna, the company that helped save the world, unraveled (Stat News)\n\nWikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.\n\nOnly around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.\n\nPerhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.\n\nIn September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”\n\nThere’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.\n\nSo maybe it would end up a hit.\n\nNope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.\n\nWith unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.\n\nMore: Elon’s Edsel: Tesla Cybertruck Is The Auto Industry’s Biggest Flop In Decades (Forbes), Why Tesla Cybertrucks Aren't Selling (CNBC), Ford scraps fully-electric F-150 Lightning as mounting losses and falling demand hits EV plans (AP)\n\nDonald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.\n\nThis was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.\n\nThe White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.\n\nMore: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)\n\nIn 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.\n\nCritics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.\n\nApple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”\n\nMore: Inside the controversial tree farms powering Apple’s carbon neutral goal (MIT Technology Review), Apple Watch not a 'CO2-neutral product,' German court finds (Reuters), Apple 2030: Our ambition to become carbon neutral (Apple)\n\nWe asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.\n\nIt’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory.

    "fullText": "\"Code red\" isn't a one-off at OpenAI.\n\nCEO Sam Altman said on an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published Thursday that the company has entered emergency mode multiple times in response to competitive threats — and expects to continue doing so as rivals close in.\n\n\"It's good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges,\" Altman said.\n\n\"My guess is we'll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that's part of really just making sure that we win in our space,\" he added.\n\nAltman said that OpenAI had gone \"code red\" earlier this year when China's DeepSeek emerged. DeepSeek shocked the tech industry in January when it said its AI model matches top competitors like ChatGPT's o1 at a fraction of the cost.\n\nOpenAI entered \"code red\" earlier this month, about two weeks after Google released its latest AI chatbot, Gemini 3. The model drew widespread praise after its release in November, with Google touting it as its most advanced model to date. Altman reportedly told staff in an internal Slack memo that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.\n\nAltman said in the podcast episode that Google's Gemini 3 did not have \"the impact we were worried it might.\"\n\n\"But it did — in the same way that Deepseek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,\" he added.\n\nSince OpenAI entered \"code red,\" the company has moved quickly to ship new upgrades and features.\n\nLast week, it rolled out a more advanced AI model aimed at improving ChatGPT's performance across professional work, coding, and scientific tasks. OpenAI also unveiled a new image-generation model earlier this week.\n\nAltman said the company will not be in code red \"that much longer.\"\n\n\"Historically, these have been kind of like six- or eight-week things for us,\" he added.\n\nThe state of \"code red\" has also been a precedent for other tech companies. In 2022, Google declared an internal \"code red\" after ChatGPT's debut. The search giant was lagging in consumer AI, despite having funded much of the research that made the AI boom possible.",

    "description": "This post will introduce a tutorial on how to build an app for ChatGPT using Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server. You’ll have what you need to get started with our opinionated stack for building these apps.",
    "fullText": "Building Apps for ChatGPT with Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Client\n\nIn early October, OpenAI introduced the ChatGPT Apps SDK with a handful of launch partners. These “apps” could be invoked by ChatGPT via Model Context Protocol (MCP) and would be embedded directly into the ChatGPT interface. In their intro video, they showed use cases like asking for flights, hotel locations, house listings, and more, including teasing the idea of asking follow up questions to ChatGPT.\n\nImagine your application being part of the conversation, allowing the user to ask follow up questions, and having your app be responsive to those questions. These are action-oriented conversational apps where the LLM can take action on behalf of a user with rich interactive UIs.\n\nThis idea quickly caught fire, and now the MCP apps spec is proposing a standardized approach to create these kinds of experiences, with other AI vendors sure to follow suit. We’re excited about the potential here, and are working on tools to abstract away all of the AI provider details from you with a great developer experience, allowing you to focus on building your app instead of worrying about vendor idiosyncrasies and evolving standards.\n\nWe want this to be a true “build once” solution where you can deploy your app anywhere that supports one of the protocols that we will support. This way, you don’t need to host a separate MCP Server, and build a separate app, for every provider and sub-protocol that emerges.\n\nYou can instead focus on your customers.\n\nThis post will introduce a tutorial on how to build an app for ChatGPT using Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server. By the end of it, you’ll have what you need to get started with our opinionated stack for building these apps. If you prefer to dive into the template and follow along, you can find the repo here.\n\nBased on the OpenAI documentation and examples, to build one of these apps you would:\n\nWe don’t want you to have to do any of this. You shouldn’t have to focus on any of the inner workings of this sub-protocol, or even think about MCP. Your front-end engineers shouldn’t have a new dependency on your platform engineers. Instead, you should be able to focus on building exciting and compelling experiences for your customers.\n\nInstead of this feeling like learning 100% how to build apps from scratch, this should be 90% reusing what you already know about building apps, and 10% learning about the specifics of this new paradigm.\n\nWe wanted to make this as easy as possible and decided to reach for tools that are already familiar to many of our users: Apollo MCP Server and Apollo Client. If you want to follow along in this tutorial, you can find all the code in our OpenAI Apps SDK demo.\n\nTo build this app we have two components: a React app and Apollo MCP Server. This solution works without any additional MCP Server configuration. The client gets to focus on their application, not the MCP server configuration.\n\nStarting in our main.tsx file, we create an ApolloClient instance and ApolloProvider, very similar to how we would on a traditional React app, but we’re going to import them from @apollo/client-ai-apps instead of the normal location. This is an Apollo Client integration package, similar to @apollo/client-nextjs. This allows us to do a lot of setup and details behind the scenes of dealing with data being exchanged over MCP.\n\nNow we can use the normal useQuery and useMutation hooks as we normally would!\n\nFor example, I can write a component that gets my TOP_PRODUCTS:\n\nLooks pretty normal, but what is that @tool directive on the operation? That is allowing you to declare in your app a tool that will be exposed to the LLM, including a name and description. At the same time, we are registering the operation that will be executed when this tool is called (and therefore the data that should be delivered as part of this tool), and the graphql variables become the input schema for the tool!\n\nThis is really exciting because we’re able to declare so much with so little code. Also, these are on-the-fly tool declarations. I don’t need a platform team to create these tools for me on an MCP server!\n\nAnother important aspect of this solution is showing the right component based on what tool was called by the LLM. It turns out we’ve had this problem solved for years now with React Router!\n\nTo do this, we provide a useToolEffect hook, which works the same way as a useEffect, but allows you to run the effect based on which tool was executed.\n\nUsing this hook, and a very familiar navigate function from react-router, I can express that when the “Top Products” tool is called, I should navigate to the /home view.\n\nThe magic of this solution really comes from a custom Vite plugin called the ApplicationManifestPlugin which extracts all the operations, tools, and metadata from your React app and generates a .application-manifest.json file:\n\nThis plugin runs during dev and build time and generates a file that looks something like this:\n\nWhat you’ll see contained in this manifest is everything that the Apollo MCP Server needs to automatically generate the resource and tools for your app. There’s no need to create or configure any of this on the MCP Server. It will automatically pick it up based on your manifest file.\n\nAnd that’s it! You can build your React app and declare tools alongside the data declarations and the tooling will do the rest. At the time this post was written, you would then test your app in ChatGPT using developer mode. OpenAI outlines how to try the app in their documentation.\n\nWith the MCP apps spec hot off the press, and likely other providers working on an answer to ChatGPT’s AppsSDK, we have a very important goal: To abstract away all of the provider details from you with a great developer experience, allowing you to focus on building your app instead.\n\nWe want this to be a true “build once” solution where you can deploy your app anywhere that supports one of the protocols that we will support. This way, you don’t need to host a separate MCP Server, and build a separate app, for every provider and sub-protocol that emerges.\n\nYou can instead focus on your customers.\n\nThis solution is exciting for platform engineers because it doesn’t require them being in the loop and becoming a blocker for the frontend teams they are looking to empower. A single Apollo MCP Server powers apps across providers and accelerates platform engineering. For frontend engineers, this removes the burden of sub-protocol concerns and lets them focus on building high-quality user experiences.\n\nIt’s important to note that these apps are still very, very early.\n\nRemember many, many years ago when “apps” first appeared on the iPhone? Many people didn’t understand why they needed a mobile app when they already had a website. It’s kind of funny looking back now because we had no idea what we were even looking at or how much it would change and shape our future.\n\nThat’s about where we are now with these conversational chat apps. Customers and companies alike don’t yet “get” these apps. The app store just launched. But once these things fall into place, and we hit an industry mind share, we believe we’re going to see an explosion of conversational, chat-based applications.\n\nTry out building apps for ChatGPT today with Apollo Client and Apollo MCP Server by going to our Template Repo and following the README. We’d love to hear what you think.",

    "fullText": "When ChatGPT first launched, it was strictly about dealing with text. You could ask it to write you a poem, to check your code for errors, or to build you a grocery list from a recipe. Fast forward three years, and the app has changed completely—for better or for worse. Not only has ChatGPT's large language model (LLM) improved dramatically from GPT-3.5 to GPT-5.2, but the bot has gone multimodal. It can understand text, but also images, video, and the internet at large. 2025's ChatGPT is hardly the same product as 2022's.\n\nOne of the many upgrades to ChatGPT over the past three years has been app integrations: You've been able to connect OpenAI's chatbot to ask it to do things on your behalf. You could connect to Expedia to ask ChatGPT for help booking a hotel, Zillow to ask the bot to help you find an apartment, or Canva for help with creating a slide. Whether these integrations are any more useful than simply using the respective app itself is perhaps up to each user, but these integrations exist all the same.\n\nFidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, announced the integration in a Substack post on Tuesday. Among other updates, like a new image gen model and new writing tools, Simo revealed new app integrations for the chatbot, including OpenTable, Salesforce, Clay, Lovable, and, of course, Apple Music. At the time, details were limited, but now, the integration is officially live.\n\nFirst of all, you don't actually need to It's an interesting note, since Apple Music itself requires a paid subscription to access. But with ChatGPT, you can access elements of the services without paying—keyword \"elements.\"\n\nOnce you connect the services together, you'll be able to search Apple Music for songs, artists, albums, and playlists within ChatGPT. In addition to music discoverability, you can also generate playlists, and listen to clips of songs you find. ChatGPT doesn't specify how long those clips are, but if they base it off of iTunes, it could be anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. If you thought this integration was all about listening to Apple Music tunes while using ChatGPT, think again: You'll still need Apple Music itself for the listening side of things.\n\nOf course, if you have an Apple Music account, the integration is a bit more useful. If so, you'll be able to add songs, albums, and playlists to your Apple Music library that you found or generated from ChatGPT.\n\nLove it or hate it, ChatGPT isn't necessarily designed with user privacy in mind. After all, part of the company's business model is training its LLMs on your ChatGPT interactions—unless you specifically opt out. As such, the idea of connecting your Apple Music subscription to ChatGPT raises some privacy alarm bells in my mind. Apple Music doesn't have the most sensitive user information in your digital portfolio, but it does contain quite a bit of extra data ChatGPT can collect from you.\n\nAt the top of the Apple music connection tool, OpenAI says, \"You're in control.\" The company is adamant that ChatGPT \"always respects\" your preferences on training data, and is held to the permissions you've already set. That said, the company also warns that by using apps, you run the risk of falling victim to attack: If hackers decide to attack ChatGPT, your data could get swooped up. You'll also end up sharing data points like your IP address and approximate location, as well as ChatGPT data with Apple Music. (The data sharing goes both ways here.)\n\nOne benefit here is that ChatGPT doesn't appear to have access to your listening history. While the app can create playlists for you, it can't actually see what you're choosing to listen to in Apple Music itself.\n\nI personally don't use ChatGPT, and even if I did, I don't think I'd connect my Apple Music account here. I find the discoverability within the app itself fine for my needs, and when it isn't, the greater internet already helps me find new music. I'm not sure I'd feel the benefits of ChatGPT's intelligence here, especially when it comes with the risk of keeping all my Apple Music data in yet another location.\n\nIf you're not like me, and you're interested in trying out this integration, you can connect Apple Music to ChatGPT from the latter's app or web app. Head to the sidebar, choose Apps, then find and select \"Apple Music.\"",

    "description": "You can connect apps like Photoshop, Apple Music, and Slack to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, OpenAI announced ChatGPT apps. Not the ChatGPT app, mind you: That's been out for more than a couple years now. ChatGPT apps, on the other hand, are programs that work within ChatGPT. You can access them in any given conversation with ChatGPT—in fact, they may appear based on the context of the conversation.\n\nThese aren't necessarily apps that OpenAI builds itself, either; rather, you'll find options here based on apps you may use yourself. The initial batch of apps included with the feature's rollout included Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow—big apps you've likely used before.\n\nWhile in a conversation with ChatGPT, you could ask the bot to help you book a flight to Paris via Expedia, find a particular listing through Zillow, or create a slide for a presentation with Canva. From OpenAI's perspective, this adds a host of additional functionality to ChatGPT the company couldn't offer itself. OpenAI doesn't need to build an apartment-hunting tool into ChatGPT; it can just pull in Zillow. It also doesn't escape me that the more apps that OpenAI folds into ChatGPT, the less likely it is you'll need to leave ChatGPT to do something in another app—but that's none of my business.\n\nSpeaking of more apps, the company plans to expand these apps overtime, as developers create ChatGPT-compatible extensions for their programs. That was part of yesterday's news: OpenAI is now letting developers submit apps to ChatGPT en masse. What's more, these apps will be hosted in an \"app directory,\" though many online are taking to calling it an app store. (There's no payment necessary, however, so app directory might really be a more apt description.) You'll find this new app directory in the sidebar of ChatGPT, appropriately called \"Apps.\"\n\nApps is apparently in beta, according to a label affixed to its title in ChatGPT. Here, you'll find a rotating slide featuring an ad for some of the service's biggest apps, like Canva and Zillow, and, below it, rows of apps to choose from. Right now, the apps are sorted into \"Featured,\" \"Lifestyle,\" and \"Productivity,\" with no option that includes all the apps. (But they seem to be entirely split across Lifestyle and Productivity.) There are a lot of options here already. Some made headlines this week, like Photoshop and Apple Music, while others arrived more quietly, like Asana, Uber, and Target. It's not just traditional apps like Zillow or Spotify that are getting the app treatment here, either. OpenAI is also considering \"connector\" services, like Google Drive, as \"apps.\"\n\nYou can click on any app in the directory to see what you can do with it. Slack, for example, says you can look up your chats and messages to summarize threads, generate recaps, and come up with responses. You can check on your Asana tasks to generate progress reports and status updates. Outlook says you can create \"talking points\" and generate follow-ups from your emails and calendar events. While there's a brief summary underneath each title, you'll need to click through to each service to see the full picture of what it actually offers.\n\nHere are the apps I'm seeing at this time. Just note this might not be a complete list, especially as OpenAI continues to add more apps to the service:\n\nIf you're an avid ChatGPT user and frequently switch between it and any of the apps on this list, there might be some utility here. Maybe coders will find the integration with Hugging Face and Lovable to be beneficial, while Photoshop users might take advantage of the AI image editing tools this integration provides. But I'm still left feeling like this is more gimmick than anything else: I don't need to connect my Slack to ChatGPT to generate follow-ups for me: I'm perfectly capable of responding to emails myself, and managing my own calendar, so no need to connect Outlook or another email client to the bot. Maybe a future update will sell me on connecting generative AI to all aspects of my work and personal life, but so far, I'm still not convinced.",

    "description": "Kevin Tang, 13, won first place at the 3M Young Scientist Challenge for his project that uses AI to help detect when a person falls in their home.",
    "fullText": "While many teens are using AI to help themselves with homework and socializing, Kevin Tang, 13, is using it to help others.\n\n\"A few years ago, my grandma sadly fell in my kitchen, and nobody noticed immediately,\" Tang told Business Insider. By the time his family found her and called 911, \"it was still too late, since she was left with permanent brain damage.\"\n\nHe later learned that his friend's grandparent had also fallen, and that the family hadn't found out until the following day because they lived in another state.\n\nAfter that, Tang felt compelled to find a way to help not just his family and friends, but the millions of older adults who suffer from falls each year.\n\nHis project, FallGuard, earned him first prize at the 2025 3M Young Scientist Challenge and a cash prize of $25,000, which he said he has already partly reinvested in improving and growing the project.\n\nTang started working on Fallguard in the summer of 2024. Since then, he has built and developed it into a device that uses AI to detect when a person falls in real time and immediately sends an alert to the person's family members' phones via the FallGuard mobile app. It can also detect when a person has been lying down for an extended period.\n\n\"This system does not rely on a cellular carrier and does not generate any messaging fees,\" Tang wrote in a follow-up email. \"A single FallGuard device can be linked to multiple phones so that several caregivers can receive alerts at the same time.\"\n\nUnlike wearable devices that you have to remember to charge and put on, FallGuard works via a camera connected to a computer. \"You can just place [the camera] on the wall, and it works all the time,\" Tang said, later adding that, \"no video is recorded or uploaded, which helps protect privacy.\"\n\nA couple of limitations are that a person must fall within the camera's field of view. Moreover, the camera must be connected to a computer with the FallGuard model, which can only support one camera at a time. Tang said he's working on expanding the system so one device can support multiple cameras that could be placed all around a home. \"So that way you don't have to have multiple computers,\" he said.\n\nTang built FallGuard using MediaPipe, a Google-developed AI library, which can map a person on screen by placing key points on their body. With a two-stage fall detection algorithm that Tang developed, FallGuard analyzes posture and movement over time. It does this via a common tool in computer vision models called bounding boxes that can track how a person's body proportions change from standing to lying down, Tang said.\n\nIf the AI detects a lay-down event, it looks at the previous one second to check if the person's velocity suddenly dropped, helping distinguish a fall from someone lying down intentionally.\n\nThere are still a few kinks Tang is ironing out to improve FallGuard's reliability, he said.\n\nDuring the 3M Young Scientist Challenge, Tang was paired with Mark Gilbertson, a robotics and AI specialist at 3M, who mentored him on the project.\n\nWhile Kevin did all of the programming and designing himself, Gilbertson said he helped with questions like how Tang should mount his device on the wall and what material to use.\n\nFrom the start, Gilbertson said Kevin's personality and project stood out to him. \"I liked that his project had an emotional connection to his life,\" Gilbertson told BI.\n\nWhen Tang won the prize, he was excited that the news would alert more people about FallGuard who could use it, Gilberston said.\n\nIndeed, Tang said he's received interest from about 500 families so far. \"One stood out to me was, this man who was trying really hard to take care of his wife, but he was deaf, so he wouldn't hear his wife fall,\" Gilbertson said, adding that the man noted, \"This invention will just really change our lives and quality of living.\"\n\nOne of the things Tang used the award money for was to purchase a MacBook to code the FallGuard app for computers, so people can convert their own computer into a FallGuard device. It works with most regular computers, he said.\n\nWhen asked what he's most proud of, Tang didn't mention the prize, the title, or the media attention. Instead, he pointed back to the device itself, which hung on the wall behind him.\n\n\"I'm really proud of how much my project evolved from the very start,\" he said. From a tripod and camera, to a mounted device, to an app anyone can download — each model improved on the one before. \"I just kept working until I had a final product.\"",

    "fullText": "Before applying for a position, job seekers often want to know factors beyond the role's responsibilities, like a company's values, employee experience, and growth opportunities. Like many areas of the workforce, artificial intelligence can help with this.\n\nBrand image \"sets the tone for how people view your company long before they ever interact with you,\" says Victoria Bracco, CEO of Encore Media Agency and cofounder of the Strategic Executive Alliance, a business consulting firm. It gives job candidates \"clarity, confidence, and a sense of direction\" about whether an organization is a good fit.\n\n\"AI can make it easier for companies to understand how they're being perceived and where they need to improve,\" she adds.\n\nHuman resources leaders also see value in AI for talent acquisition. For instance, some companies, including Unilever and L'Oreal, use AI chatbots to answer job applicants' questions and provide personalized responses based on their preferences and skills.\n\nBeyond that, AI can help companies learn what job seekers think about them and use data-driven storytelling to attract talent, Bracco says. Here's how.\n\nBrand sentiment is composed of a range of inputs from a wide variety of sources, and AI can be a boon to consolidating, gathering, and analyzing that content.\n\nFor example, AI can mine social media, online reviews, and internal feedback to uncover what customers, the public, and current and former employees say about the company, known as a sentiment analysis, Bracco says.\n\nAI tools can also track metrics, such as employee sentiment and retention rates, as well as social media engagement, adds Kaz Hassan, principal of community and insights at Unily, an AI intranet software.\n\n\"AI can identify patterns in what current employees say about your organization, revealing brand strengths to amplify and weaknesses to address,\" Hassan says. \"This real-time intelligence allows companies to respond quickly to emerging issues before they become reputation problems.\"\n\nAI can synthesize several different data points, including brand sentiment, employee performance insights, and the skills the company currently needs. Using that information, AI can then help write job descriptions, career pages, and social media messaging that will resonate with the right candidates, Bracco says.\n\nOrganizations can also use employee data to showcase how they value their people, such as through internal upskilling, mobility rates, leadership styles, or employee check-ins, says Lana Peters, chief revenue and experience officer at Klaar, a performance management software.\n\nAI can \"shape an unbiased story,\" she says. That story should focus on \"culture, purpose, and growth,\" Bracco adds.\n\nJust make sure the story is authentic and honest; coming across as disingenuous is a turn-off, adds Polina Dimitrova, global head of people at Make, a visual development platform. \"The truth is: your brand is how you hire, how you develop people, how leaders behave, and where your teams show up in the world.\"\n\nThis can illustrate \"the employee experience you offer as a company,\" says Tom Moran, CEO of Addison Group, a staffing and recruiting firm.\n\n\"Real stories from real people within the organization discussing their experiences within the organization will resonate with job seekers,\" Hassan says.\n\nPeters adds that, \"Candidates aren't just choosing a job; they're choosing a story they want to be a part of,\" including companies whose values align with theirs and where they'll be recognized and appreciated.\n\nHowever, AI isn't the \"end-all, be-all,\" Dimitrova says. It should be used to optimize brands for attracting talent; it's not a substitute for a brand strategy, Bracco adds.\n\nAI is there to \"speed things up and provide insights, but the final message still needs and must have your voice, your judgment, and your direction,\" Bracco says. \"Keep the human side front and center, because candidates can spot a forced or overly polished message a mile away.\"",

    "fullText": "OpenAI isn't trimming its sails.\n\nIn a pair of videos and an accompanying chart, top OpenAI executives made the case that the startup's biggest risk might be not spending enough on securing future compute, even though the company has already committed roughly $1.4 trillion on data center projects over the next eight years and is, according to CEO Sam Altman, five years away from profitability.\n\n\"We want to be ahead of the curve,\" OpenAI President Greg Brockman said in a video posted on X. \"And the truth is, I don't think we will be, no matter how ambitious we can dream of being right now. I think demand will far exceed what we can think of.\"\n\nIn the chart, OpenAI illustrated how \"more compute\" leads to \"better products,\" which in turn leads to \"more revenue.\"\n\nCompute fuels progress. pic.twitter.com/ePm7pmpb8Q\n\nBrockman and his fellow OpenAI executives have said for months that the dearth of compute available to OpenAI is holding the company back, forcing it to make tough trade-offs and delaying launches.\n\n\"When we look at our launch calendar, the single biggest blocker often becomes, 'Ok, but where's the compute going to come from for that?'\"\n\nAs an example, Brockman said that when OpenAI launched its image generator in March, it had to make \"some very painful decisions to take a bunch of compute from research\" in order to meet demand for the service.\n\nRonnie Chatterji, a top economist in the Biden administration, said countries around the world, including China, are making big investments in AI infrastructure.\n\n\"People are worried about whether people are trying to do too much,\" Chatterji said in a video OpenAI published on X. \"I just encourage people to think about and consider, what if we're not moving fast enough? What if we're investing too little?\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in September that the biggest risk for his company \"is probably in not being aggressive enough.\"\n\n\"If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously,\" Zuckerberg said on an episode of the \"Access\" podcast. \"But what I'd say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.\"\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who led the development of GPT-2 and 3 at OpenAI before starting his rival company, recently said that part of the difficulty is that companies have to make bets years in advance on what the demand might be. Still, Amodei offered some veiled criticism of people in the industry who are \"YOLOing,\" which was viewed as a shot at Altman.\n\n\"I have to decide now, literally now, or in some cases a few months ago, how much compute I need to buy — to serve the models in early 2027 when I get to that revenue amount,\" Amodei said during The New York Times' DealBook Summit.\n\nUnlike Meta, Google, and other hyperscalers, OpenAI doesn't have a large dedicated revenue base to fall back on if its bets don't pay off.\n\nLast month, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar sparked concerns when she spoke of a \"government backstop\" for data center spending. She later walked back those remarks, and Altman said OpenAI believed \"taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions.\"\n\n\"If we get it wrong, that's on us,\" Altman wrote on X.",

    "description": "The new feature gives you even more precision over your edits.",
    "fullText": "One of the ways AI models are rapidly improving is in their image editing capabilities, to the extent that they can now quickly take care of tasks that would previously have taken a substantial amount of time and effort in Photoshop. This is undoubtedly one of the main reasons Adobe has decided to introduce its own ChatGPT plug-ins.\n\nWant your t-shirt to be blue rather than red? Need to cut out a person or an object from an otherwise perfect group selfie? These are tricks that AI chatbots are now able to do cleanly and professionally, from just a text prompt. You don't need to have any digital photo editing skills; you only need to describe what you want to happen.\n\nOver the past few months, both Gemini and ChatGPT have become better at more precise edits. They're able to tweak part of an image and leaving the rest of it untouched, rather than rendering everything again from scratch just to alter one detail. Now Gemini has quietly added some more markup tools for this job.\n\nGoogle hasn't said anything officially about these markup tools, which suggests the feature is still in testing (it's also previously been spotted by the team at Android Authority). If you're not seeing these tools, try quitting and restarting the Gemini app on mobile, or refreshing the app on the web—and if you still can't see the options after that, you may have to be wait a little bit longer\n\nIf this functionality has rolled out to you, you should be able to upload an image in a chat using the + (plus) button in the prompt box, and then tap or click on the image thumbnail to find the markup tools. At the moment, they only show up before the image has been edited—you can't find them after you've started generating edits.\n\nThe easiest tool to understand is the drawing tool, which is enabled via the icon that looks like a scribble. You can use this to highlight a particular part of an image—a space in the sky, a lamppost in the street, a face in a crowd—and then describe the change you want Gemini to carry out.\n\nFor example, rather than just saying \"add a cartoon dragon in the sky\" in your prompt, you can actually combine that prompt with a circle on the image showing exactly where the dragon should go. It gives you even more of that Photoshop-level precision, without cluttering up the interface too much.\n\nThe scribblings can also be used if you're asking questions about the image. For example, you could circle an actor or an object in a scene and then ask \"who is this?\" or \"what is this?\" in the attached prompt. In that sense it works in a similar way to the Circle to Search feature that's available for images on Android.\n\nThere's also a text tool—the T icon—but I'm not sure exactly how you use this (and there's no official help available yet). You can use it to describe changes you want to apply to your picture (like \"an add arrow here\"), but the text stays in place—it's almost like a rudimentary text overlay feature, with a choice of colors but no font or styling options.\n\nYou can use the prompt to manipulate the text you've added, adding outlines and backgrounds for example, so perhaps that's the way it's intended to be used: a more precise editing option, but for text. Presumably once these tools have reached all Gemini users, we'll get some more information from Google on how to use them—but you may well find they're available to you now.",

    "fullText": "Equity says vote signals strong opposition to AI use and readiness to disrupt productions unless protections are secured\n\nActors have voted to refuse digital scanning to prevent their likeness being used by artificial intelligence in a pushback against AI in the arts.\n\nMembers of the performing arts union Equity were asked if they would refuse to be scanned while on set, a common practice in which actors’ likeness is captured for future use – with 99% voting in favour of the move.\n\nThe general secretary, Paul Fleming, said: “Artificial intelligence is a generation-defining challenge. And for the first time in a generation, Equity’s film and TV members have shown that they are willing to take industrial action.\n\n“Ninety per cent of TV and film is made on these agreements. Over three-quarters of artists working on them are union members. This shows that the workforce is willing to significantly disrupt production unless they are respected, and [if] decades of erosion in terms and conditions begins to be reversed.”\n\nThe vote was an indicative ballot designed to demonstrate the strength of feeling on the issue, with more than 7,000 members polled on a 75% turnout. However, actors would not be legally protected if they refused to be scanned.\n\nThe union said it would write to Pact, the trade body representing the majority of producers and production companies in the UK, to negotiate new minimum standards for pay, as well as terms and conditions for actors working in film and TV.\n\nEquity said it may hold a formal ballot depending on the outcome of the negotiations, which, if backed, would give actors legal protection if they were being pressed to accept digital scanning on set.\n\nThe decision comes after months of debate and growing concern about performers’ rights as AI becomes embedded in the creative industries, with high-profile actors urging Equity members to support the push to stop digital scanning.\n\nAdrian Lester, Hugh Bonneville and Harriet Walter have backed the union’s campaign to ensure AI protections for performers are written into union agreements.\n\nBonneville said actors’ likenesses and voices should not be “exploited for the benefit of others without licence or consent”, while Lester said actors at the start of their careers often found it difficult to push back against body scanning.\n\nIn October, Olivia Williams told the Guardian that performers were routinely pressed to have their bodies scanned on set without having a say over how the data was later used.\n\nThe Dune star argued that actors should have as much control over data harvested from body scans as they do over nudity scenes. She said some contracts included clauses that appeared to give studios carte blanche over a performer’s likeness “on all platforms now existing or yet to be devised throughout the universe in perpetuity”.\n\nThe arrival of the first AI “actor”, Tilly Norwood, further heightened concerns and demands for formal agreements on what is and is not permissible.\n\nIn 2023, concerns over AI were at the heart of the Hollywood writers’ strike, with writers and actors warning that unchecked use of the technology could radically reshape the industry and undermine their roles.",
