    "fullText": "Reddit is working hard to stay human in the AI era.\n\nIn the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Steve Huffman said that Reddit's success lies in being a place for authentic human conversation, not a platform flooded with bots.\n\n\"We're now operating in a fundamentally different internet, one shaped by opaque algorithms, generative content, and growing distrust,\" Huffman said on Thursday. \"Reddit is the most human place on the internet in a world flooded with AI slop.\"\n\nThe CEO, who cofounded the social media company in 2005, added, \"At the end of the day, Reddit is for humans to talk to other humans.\"\n\nThat's why the platform is investing in authenticity, Huffman said. The company has launched verified profiles and brands in the fourth quarter and plans to add \"bot verification\" and labelling as a next step.\n\n\"It doesn't mean we have to outlaw entirely,\" he said about AI use on the platform. \"It just needs to be marked as what it is because there are times when it's helpful.\"\n\nReddit has rolled out several AI features since 2023, including AI-powered search results that summarize discussions and content translation. It also uses AI to improve content recommendations and for ad targeting.\n\nThe company reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday and beat analyst estimates for both revenue and profit. Revenue for the quarter rose 70% year on year to $726 million, while net income rose 255% to $252 million.\n\nReddit's stock rose 5% after hours on Thursday, but is down 34% so far this year, as part of the broader sell-off in software stocks.",

    "title": "PwC is rethinking how to train workers in the Al era, and it's betting on 'skills, not titles'",
    "description": "The Big Four firm PwC launched a new in-house training initiative on Thursday, designed for the AI workplace.",
    "fullText": "AI is forcing the Big Four to rethink how work — and workers — are defined. The generalist consultant is out, and technical skills and deep industry expertise are in.\n\nPwC has launched what it's calling the \"Learning Collective,\" a new workplace training initiative designed for the realities of the AI era.\n\nIt's a broad rethink of how learning happens inside one of the world's largest professional services firms.\n\n\"Skills, not titles, are the currency of this new era,\" the firm said in a press release.\n\nThe line was reminiscent of news from January, first reported by Business Insider, that fellow Big Four firm Deloitte is overhauling job titles for all of its professionals. From June 1, simple, traditional job roles like \"consultant\" and \"associate\" will be replaced by more specific descriptors that better reflect the work Deloitte carries out for clients.\n\n\"We're not changing our titles,\" Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, clarified to Business Insider in an interview.\n\nStill, PwC's approach to talent echoes the industry shift. What that \"skills, not titles\" ethos means is that, as employees apply for projects, move around the organization, and progress in their careers, it's their portfolio of skills that will set them apart rather than a job title, said Seals-Coffield.\n\nPwC has introduced three major learning tracks with the Learning Collective. The first is a firmwide emphasis on 30 key skills: 15 AI-centric and 15 human-centric, both of which are \"extremely critical\" to PwC's success, Seals-Coffield told Business Insider.\n\n\"We're not necessarily asking someone to digest all 30 skills in one year,\" said Seals-Coffield. Different levels will focus on different skills, she added, but taken together they represent what PwC believes will matter most as AI reshapes client work.\n\nOn the human-centric aspect, this includes applying critical thinking to evaluate AI-generated outputs and using empathy to understand client dynamics.\n\nThe technical skills include AI fluency and AI simulation, which Seals-Coffield described as simulating the work now being completed by AI to ensure staff understand why and how it's done.\n\nThe firm said it isn't just teaching people about agents — it's using them in the learning process.\n\nSeals-Coffield said she recently watched a demo of an agent giving feedback on presentation skills this week that was \"pretty brutal, but in a really good way.\"\n\nThe agent told her: \"You're still not addressing the question around profitability. You're still not being specific about the ROI. It sounds a little bit generic. And I was just like, 'OK, geez, that was a little bit harsh.'\"\n\nBut the blunt feedback helped her rethink how she had presented certain details, Seals-Coffield said, adding that PwC wants agents that \"provide that real tangible critical coaching.\"\n\nThe Learning Collective is introducing new programs for two groups feeling the impact of AI acutely: engineers and junior workers.\n\nIn a move away from traditional roles associated with the Big Four, PwC has launched a new tech engineering career track, aimed at attracting and recruiting more technical talent.\n\nThe firm wants to become \"a destination for top engineering talent,\" the press release states.\n\nFor junior staff, PwC has launched the Associate Discovery program — a drive to expose new employees to AI from day one. By the time associates land on their first major engagement, PwC wants them to have experience building agents, working with AI, and developing the human skills required to make those tools useful.\n\nThe firm has also reduced the number of offices where consulting associates can begin their careers, from around 60 down to 13, said Seals-Coffield.\n\nTraining and development have always been important at the Big Four consulting and accounting firms. Many young grads join their ranks looking to supercharge their business skills.\n\nBut the isolation of the COVID years, combined with the way that AI is changing the nature of work, has chipped away at some of PwC's sense of connection around learning and development, especially for younger employees, said Seals-Coffield.\n\nThe Learning Collective is trying to change that by encouraging learning beyond courses, such as bringing team members along to meetings or getting teams to discuss what they've learned that week with each other.\n\n\"They will find that we are asking them more and more to engage in these learning experiences in their intact team,\" Seals-Coffield said.\n\n\"Getting our people to spend more time together, learning and growing in an intentional way, is the goal of the experience,\" she added.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Two University of Michigan graduates who met on a Bollywood dance team have emerged from Y Combinator with $5.3 million in seed funding.\n\nVihaar Nandigala and Kishan Sripada, both 23, cofounded sales product Orange Slice, which uses AI to generate prospecting spreadsheets using salespeople's prompts and real-time data from across the web.\n\nThey said the company was born of the idea that the larger problem in sales isn't messaging, but identifying who's worth reaching out to.\n\nOrange Slice sells subscriptions to customers like sales engineers, with fellow Y Combinator startups Novoflow and Pirros among its early users, they said.\n\n1984 Ventures and Moxxie Ventures co-led the seed round, and Paul Graham participated as an angel investor. Funds will go toward hiring engineering talent, Nandigala said.\n\nNandigala and Sripada began building the startup and applied to Y Combinator as college seniors last year. At the time, YC advised them to finish school and reapply the following cycle despite its reputation for welcoming dropouts. They got accepted into the following batch in summer 2025, even as they spent much of their final semester focused on the business.\n\n\"I don't remember any of my classes my last semester of college — I don't think I was the best student,\" Nandigala said. \"Fundamentally, we were still working on the business full time.\"\n\nNandigala, who serves as the CEO of Orange Slice, founded his last startup, ghost kitchen company KitchenKonnect, at 19, and previously served as a summer analyst at JPMorgan. CTO Sripada founded the choreography software company Formi and was a software engineering intern at Ramp.\n\nHere's a look at the pitch deck Orange Slice used to raise its $5.3 million seed round.",

    "description": "Gary Marcus advocates caution about AI's risks. He told Business Insider that using OpenClaw was like giving your passwords to a stranger at the bar.",
    "fullText": "AI researcher and author Gary Marcus is worried about those viral agents and their social network.\n\nAnimated lobsters flooded X last week. First, it was OpenClaw (previously called Moltbot and Clawdbot before Anthropic came knocking). The AI agent runs locally and can independently make decisions on common consumer apps without human supervision.\n\nThen came Moltbook, the Reddit-like social forum where AI agents post and comment. No humans are allowed — though it appears some humans may have managed to sneak their way in.\n\nMarcus is known to pour cold water on the most hot-headed AI fanatics. It's in the title of his book: \"Taming Silicon Valley.\" The entrepreneur and scientist founded Geometric Intelligence, a machine-learning startup he later sold to Uber. Now, he advocates for AI regulation and risk consideration.\n\nHis take on these new tools was no different. In a Substack post, he was blunt. \"If you care about the security of your device or the privacy of your data, don't use OpenClaw,\" he wrote. \"Period.\"\n\nCurious to hear more about his thoughts on the latest viral moment in AI, we followed up with Marcus over email for a short Q&A, which was lightly edited for clarity.\n\nHere's what he had to say about those AI agents popping up everywhere.\n\nLet's start with OpenClaw. When did you first run into it, and what was your reaction?\n\nI think it was called something different then, oh so many days ago (seven?). My immediate reaction is, this is just like AutoGPT and it will be a complete security disaster if it becomes popular. Maybe, if we are lucky, it will become a teachable moment and the damage will be modest.\n\nWhy do you think OpenClaw grew so popular (at least online)?\n\nI imagine it is super fun to play with, and it must make users feel like they have an express ticket to the future. Personally I wouldn't touch it.\n\nYou compare OpenClaw to AutoGPT. How are they similar and different?\n\nThey are both basically connectors between LLMs and services. The underlying LLMs are better now than in 2023, but the security risks are roughly the same: immense. It's like giving full access to your computer and all your passwords to a guy you met at a bar who says he can help you out. Yeah, maybe.\n\nIs there any secure use of OpenClaw? What about those who have already set it up — what should they do?\n\nI doubt there is any real secure use. Personally I would stop running it and try to uninstall it and change passwords for banks and things like that.\n\nOpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said he's taken steps to make it more secure. (Here's one example.) What do you think of these efforts?\n\nNoble, but maybe like putting a finger in dike to hold off a flood?\n\nMoving to Moltbook. Is there any argument to set your agent live on the site?\n\nOn TBPN, Matt Schlicht made the argument that startups should build businesses \"on top of Moltbook.\" What do you think of his proposal?\n\nGood luck to you. Don't blame me if your customer base gets scammed because of prompt injection attack you didn't notice.\n\nMeta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, said that he didn't find Moltbook interesting, because these agents were trained to speak like humans. Thoughts?\n\nFacebook did actually have some related experiments years and years ago; he's right that we shouldn't be entirely surprised. The interest comes mostly from the scale.\n\nWill we be talking about Moltbook in two weeks, or is this just another meme cycle?\n\nI don't know. AutoGPT exploded like a rocket in March 2023 and faded because of issues around reliability and accuracy; I wouldn't be surprised if this is just another fad, like Sora videos or pet rocks. But we'll see.",

    "description": "As tech sells off, Wall Street is in the midst of a rotation that Piper Sandler analysts say should favor stocks in \"old economy\" sectors of the market.",
    "fullText": "Investors looking for refuge from the tech sell-off slamming Wall Street should look to the \"old economy.\"\n\nAnalysts at Piper Sandler offered a handful of ideas for weary investors weathering the tech sell-off this week. The latest rout, which started in a small corner of the software space, eventually spread to bigger names like Microsoft after an agentic AI update from Anthropic sparked AI replacement fears. The new bearish AI sentiment has bled into the wider tech sector, with a risk-off shift gripping investors in the last few days.\n\nWhile some commentators argue the software crash is overblown, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, others frame it as a healthy rotation away from tech.\n\nPiper Sandler analysts are in the \"rotation nation\" camp, seeing the tech sell-off as a shift to \"old economy\" plays in cyclical and value shares.\n\n\"The bull market is intact; however, it's not being led by the popular Tech and Growth favorites of investors. Instead, new momentum and leadership are emerging in cyclical and value sectors—Energy, Industrials, Materials, Staples, and Banks,\" they said.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 information technology sector is the worst performer in the index in 2026, down more than 6% year to date. The losses have been particularly pronounced in software this week, with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF falling 17% in the last week.\n\n\"After years of focus on identifying stocks with the greatest potential AI exposure, concerns about disruption have pushed investors back toward 'real economy' industries, including those leveraged to recent signs of accelerating economic growth,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote this week.\n\nThe analysts examined industry exposure to AI automation compared to labor costs and sales to determine which spaces are most insulated. Some of Piper Sandler's \"old economy\" sectors, specifically energy, industrials, and consumer staples, were part of the same group Goldman flagged.\n\nGoldman analysts added that the sell-off has only sped up an existing market rotation into cyclical stocks.\n\n\"The investor search for insulation from AI disruption risk has accelerated the ongoing cyclical rally,\" they wrote.\n\nBeyond clear flight from stocks exposed to AI risks, BNY Investment researchers credit the rotation, in part, to a cyclical recovery in the US economy.\n\n\"The prevailing narrative in US equity markets is one of market broadening and leadership rotation, consistent with our view of a cyclical recovery in the US economy,\" the BNY analysts wrote.",

    "fullText": "AI content for scams can be targeted at individuals and ‘produced by pretty much anybody’, researchers say\n\nDeepfake fraud has gone “industrial”, an analysis published by AI experts has said.\n\nTools to create tailored, even personalised, scams – leveraging, for example, deepfake videos of Swedish journalists or the president of Cyprus – are no longer niche, but inexpensive and easy to deploy at scale, said the analysis from the AI Incident Database.\n\nIt catalogued more than a dozen recent examples of “impersonation for profit”, including a deepfake video of Western Australia’s premier, Robert Cook, hawking an investment scheme, and deepfake doctors promoting skin creams.\n\nThese examples are part of a trend in which scammers are using widely available AI tools to perpetuate increasingly targeted heists. Last year, a finance officer at a Singaporean multinational paid out nearly $500,000 to scammers during what he believed was a video call with company leadership. UK consumers are estimated to have lost £9.4bn to fraud in the nine months to November 2025.\n\n“Capabilities have suddenly reached that level where fake content can be produced by pretty much anybody,” said Simon Mylius, an MIT researcher who works on a project linked to the AI Incident Database.\n\nHe calculates that “frauds, scams and targeted manipulation” have made up the largest proportion of incidents reported to the database in 11 of the past 12 months. He said: “It’s become very accessible to a point where there is really effectively no barrier to entry.”\n\n“The scale is changing,” said Fred Heiding, a Harvard researcher studying AI-powered scams. “It’s becoming so cheap, almost anyone can use it now. The models are getting really good – they’re becoming much faster than most experts think.”\n\nIn early January, Jason Rebholz, the chief executive of Evoke, an AI security company, posted a job offer on LinkedIn and was immediately contacted by a stranger in his network, who recommended a candidate.\n\nWithin days, he was exchanging emails with someone who, on paper, appeared to be a talented engineer.\n\n“I looked at the resume and I was like, this is actually a really good resume. And so I thought, even though there were some red flags, let me just have a conversation.”\n\nThen things became strange. The candidate’s emails went directly to spam. His resume had quirks. But Rebholz had dealt with unusual candidates before and decided to go ahead with the interview.\n\nThen, when Rebholz took the call, the candidate’s video took nearly a minute to appear.\n\n“The background was extremely fake,” he said. “It just looked super, super fake. And it was really struggling to deal with [the area] around the edges of the individual. Like part of his body was coming in and out … And then when I’m looking at his face, it’s just very soft around the edges.”\n\nRebholz went through with the conversation, not wanting to face the awkwardness of asking the candidate directly if they were, in fact, an elaborate scam. Afterwards, he sent a recording of it to a contact at a deepfake detection firm, who told him that the video image of the candidate was AI-generated. He rejected the candidate.\n\nRebholz still does not know what the scammer wanted – an engineering salary, or trade secrets. While there have been reports of North Korean hackers trying to get jobs at Amazon, Evoke is a startup, not a massive player.\n\n“It’s like, if we’re getting targeted with this, everyone’s getting targeted with it,” said Rebholz.\n\nHeiding said the worst was ahead. Currently deepfake voice cloning technology is excellent – making it easy for scammers to impersonate, for example, a grandchild in distress over the phone. Deepfake videos, on the other hand, still have room for improvement.\n\nThis could have extreme consequences: for hiring, for elections, and for broader society. Heiding added: “That’ll be the big pain point here, the complete lack of trust in digital institutions, and institutions and material in general.”",

    "title": "AWS intruder achieved admin access in under 10 minutes thanks to AI assist",
    "description": "UPDATED: LLMs automated most phases of the attack",
    "fullText": "UPDATED A digital intruder broke into an AWS cloud environment and in just under 10 minutes went from initial access to administrative privileges, thanks to an AI speed assist.\n\nThe Sysdig Threat Research Team said they observed the break-in on November 28, and noted it stood out not only for its speed, but also for the \"multiple indicators\" suggesting the criminals used large language models to automate most phases of the attack, from reconnaissance and privilege escalation to lateral movement, malicious code writing, and LLMjacking - using a compromised cloud account to access cloud-hosted LLMs.\n\n\"The threat actor achieved administrative privileges in under 10 minutes, compromised 19 distinct AWS principals, and abused both Bedrock models and GPU compute resources,\" Sysdig's threat research director Michael Clark and researcher Alessandro Brucato said in a blog post about the cloud intrusion. \"The LLM-generated code with Serbian comments, hallucinated AWS account IDs, and non-existent GitHub repository references all point to AI-assisted offensive operations.\"\n\nThe attackers initially gained access by stealing valid test credentials from public Amazon S3 buckets. The credentials belonged to an identity and access management (IAM) user with multiple read and write permissions on AWS Lambda and restricted permissions on AWS Bedrock. Plus, the S3 bucket also contained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) data for AI models, which would come in handy later during the attack.\n\nTo prevent this type of credential theft, don't leave access keys in public buckets. Sysdig recommends using temporary credentials for IAM roles, and for organizations that insist on granting long-term credentials to IAM users, make sure you rotate them periodically.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully trying usernames such as \"sysadmin\" and \"netadmin\" typically associated with admin-level privileges, the attacker ultimately achieved privilege escalation through Lambda function code injection, abusing the compromised user's UpdateFunctionCode and UpdateFunctionConfiguration permissions:\n\nThey replaced the code of an existing Lambda function named EC2-init three times, iterating on their target user. The first attempt targeted adminGH, which, despite its name, lacked admin privileges. Subsequent attempts eventually succeeded in compromising the admin user frick.\n\nThe security sleuths note that the comments in the code are written in Serbian - likely indicating the intruder's origin - the code itself listed all IAM users and their access keys, created access keys for frick, and listed S3 buckets along with their content.\n\nPlus, the attacker's code contained \"comprehensive\" exception handling, according to the security sleuths, including logic to limit S3 bucket listings and an increase to the Lambda execution timeout from three seconds to 30 seconds.\n\nThese factors, combined with the short time from credential theft to Lambda execution, \"strongly suggest\" the code was written by an LLM, according to the threat hunters.\n\nNext, the miscreant set about collecting account IDs and attempting to assume OrganizationAccountAccessRole in all AWS environments. Interestingly, they included account IDs that did not belong to the victim organization: two with ascending and descending digits (123456789012 and 210987654321), and one ID that appeared to belong to a legitimate external account.\n\n\"This behavior is consistent with patterns often attributed to AI hallucinations, providing further potential evidence of LLM-assisted activity,\" Clark and Brucato wrote.\n\nIn total, the attacker gained access to 19 AWS identities, including six different IAM roles across 14 sessions, plus five other IAM users. And then, with the new admin user account they had created, the crims snarfed up a ton of sensitive data: secrets from Secrets Manager, SSM parameters from EC2 Systems Manager, CloudWatch logs, Lambda function source code, internal data from S3 buckets, and CloudTrail events.\n\nThey then turned to the LLMjacking part of the attack to gain access to the victim's cloud-hosted LLMs. For this, they abused the user's Amazon Bedrock access to invoke multiple models including Claude, DeepSeek, Llama, Amazon Nova Premier, Amazon Titan Image Generator, and Cohere Embed.\n\nSysdig notes that \"invoking Bedrock models that no one in the account uses is a red flag,\" and enterprises can create Service Control Policies (SCPs) to allow only certain models to be invoked.\n\nAfter Bedrock, the intruder focused on EC2, querying machine images suitable for deep learning applications. They also began using the victim's S3 bucket for storage, and one of the scripts stored therein looks like it was designed for ML training - but it uses a GitHub repository that doesn't exist, suggesting an LLM hallucinated the repo in generating the code.\n\nWhile the researchers say they can't determine the attacker's goal - possibly model training or reselling compute access - they note that the script launches a publicly accessible JupyterLab server on port 8888, providing a backdoor to the instance that doesn't require AWS credentials.\n\nHowever, they terminated the instance after five minutes for unknown reasons.\n\nThis is the latest in examples of attackers increasingly relying on AI to help them at almost every stage in the attack chain, and some security chiefs have warned that it's just a matter of time before criminals can fully automate attacks at scale.\n\nThere are things organizations can do to defend against similar intrusions and most involve hardening identity security and access management. First off: apply principles of least privilege to all IAM users and roles.\n\nSysdig also recommends restricting UpdateFunctionConfiguration and PassRole permission in Lambda, limiting UpdateFunctionCode permissions to specific functions and assigning them only to identities that need code deployment capabilities to do their jobs.\n\nAlso, make sure S3 buckets containing sensitive data, including RAG data and AI model artifacts, are not publicly accessible.\n\nAnd it's a good idea to enable model invocation logging for Amazon Bedrock to detect unauthorized usage.\n\nWe reached out to Amazon for comment, but they said they wouldn't be able to get us anything by publication time. We'll update this story with any relevant information we receive from them. ®\n\nto add the following comment sent by AWS.\n\n“AWS services and infrastructure are not affected by this issue, and they operated as designed throughout the incident described,\" the company told The Reg by email. \"The report describes an account compromised through misconfigured S3 buckets. We recommend all customers secure their cloud resources by following security, identity, and compliance best practices, including never opening up public access to S3 buckets or any storage service, least-privilege access, secure credential management, and enabling monitoring services like GuardDuty, to reduce risks of unauthorized activity.\"\n\nThe cloud giant also wants its customers who suspect or become aware of malicious activity within their AWS accounts to check out guidance for remediating potentially compromised credentials or contact AWS Support for assistance.\"",

    "description": "AI scientist Gary Marcus thinks the underwhelming release of ChatGPT-5 marked a turning point when investors realized AI might not be a game changer.",
    "fullText": "Many high-flying tech stocks are in a rut, with some plateauing for months and others down sharply.\n\nGary Marcus said the underwhelming release of ChatGPT-5 marked a turning point in the AI discourse.\n\nHe says investors are waking up to the idea that AI might not be as game-changing as originally thought.\n\nWith names like Nvidia, Oracle, and CoreWeave down double digits in the last few months, the AI trade appears to be stuck in a rut.\n\nBut far from a temporary blip, the diminished fortunes of the market's tech leaders might represent a much more dire reassessment of the technology among investors, a top AI researcher says.\n\nThe latest volatility began with Anthropic's debut of its new plugins for its Claude AI agent, which sent legal tech stocks into a nosedive that quickly spurred volatility into the broader sector. Yet, many leading AI names have been down for months, with Nvidia losing 13% since November and Oracle down 43%.\n\nAI scientist and former Uber AI chief, Gary Marcus, said the moves show investors are waking up to reality. Marcus has been skeptical of AI's big ambitions, and his latest post reveals he sees a clear recent turning point in the AI discourse.\n\n\"Investors have been 'rotating out of tech stocks' — because they realize they were sold a bill of goods,\" he wrote. \"My guess is that these stocks — and the reputation of OpenAI — will fall further, but either way it is already clear that the rockets will not reach the altitude so many people were hoping for.\"\n\nIn Marcus's opinion, the debut of ChatGPT-5 was an underwhelming event that left investors wondering if the promises of AI might be overblown. Marcus highlighted Sam Altman's statement in early 2025 that OpenAI knew how to build AGI as one such promise that appears false given current capabilities.\n\n\"That fateful ChatGPT-5 introduction day last August — this Saturday will be the half anniversary — was the day people woke up to the reality that ChatGPT is not magic.\"\n\nIn Marcus's view, the rotation away from tech stocks is a clear indication that investors are beginning to understand that the AI boom is waning. He also said that investors seem to be moving away from tech stocks for two reasons that are almost contradictory.\n\n\"Some may be leaving companies like Nvidia out of concerns about circular financing and profitability of LLM companies, while others are leaving traditional companies like Salesforce because they're worried about companies like Anthropic replacing traditional software,\" he noted.",

    "description": "Wall Street is weighing whether the AI fears behind the recent tech-driven sell-off were exaggerated.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures turned higher early Friday, pointing cautiously to a rebound from a tech bruising as Wall Street reassessed worries about the impact of AI disruption and the risks of hefty Big Tech spending.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) rose 0.5%, while Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) added 0.7%, retracing earlier premarket losses. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) also switched course, moving up 0.4%, on the heels of sharp closing losses on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\nThe tentative risk-on tone extended beyond stocks, as bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed back above $65,000, having touched a 16-month low overnight. But the biggest cryptocurrency is still on track for its worst weekly performance since 2022 after wiping out all of its post-Trump gains this week.\n\nStrategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by that steep sell-off, which initially weighed on shares. But the stock was up almost 6% before the bell as bitcoin revived and Strategy's CEO played down concerns about debt-servicing risks.\n\nSome tech gloom persisted, as Amazon's (AMZN) shares tumbled 8%. In its earnings, the major cloud provider outlined plans for a massive 2026 jump in spending to least $200 billion, even as its forecast for operating income fell short.\n\nElsewhere, Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) warned it will take a charge of over €22 billion ($26 billion) in a plan to scale back its EV push. Shares in the Jeep maker tanked over 20% on Wall Street and in Milan, adding to a picture of EV malaise painted by this week's $60 billion wipeout for Chinese carmaker BYD (BYDDF, 1211.HK).\n\nIn commodities, silver (SI=F) whipsawed but broadly resumed its decline as Chinese selling continued ahead of a national holiday.\n\nLooking ahead, the release of the closely watched January jobs report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week. Fresh signs of trouble in the labor market emerged this week, as job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020 and layoff announcements surged.\n\nJeep maker Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) warned on Friday that it will book a €22.2 billion ($26 billion) charge as it scales back its EV push.\n\nShares plummeted over 20% in premarket on Wall Street and in Milan, where trading was halted briefly. They plunged as much as 24% in Italy, the biggest drop on record for the Peugeot and Fiat automaker, to erase over €5 billion off its market cap.\n\nReddit (RDDT) stock jumped 7% before the bell on Friday after posting better-than-expected fourth quarter results and issuing positive guidance, helped by AI tools to bring more marketers to the platform.",

    "description": "Wilson is releasing the newest addition to the legendary Dynapwr family with the 2026 Dynapwr Forged irons, rounding out a revilized lineup.",
    "fullText": "Wilson is rounding out its 2026 releases with a great answer for improving players demanding better from their irons.\n\nWilson’s new Dynapwr Forged irons enter a crowded player’s distance spot in the market, but with a cavity back design and an AI-generated “Variable Face Technology,” they’re making a push toward the top of the category.\n\n“We wanted to build on the success of the previous award-winning model, while taking strides to elevate the performance to the next level,” Ben Hanser, CAD engineer at Wilson Golf, said in a statement. “The new iron is a statement of Wilson’s dedication to innovation and tradition. By combining forged precision with AI-driven design, we’ve created an iron that delivers distance, control and feel in perfect harmony.”\n\nKeep reading below for more on the Dynapwr Forged irons, including my take on the release.\n\nWhile the previous generation Dynapwr Forged irons were super successful, the 2026 models improve on them by adding a new optimized face thickness with the help of AI. This eliminated the need for the power holes of the previous model.\n\nThe variable face thickness helps boost face flex, in turn increasing ball speeds.\n\nDynapwr Forged also has a new KR-CUP face design, which overlaps the face around the sole, enhancing face flex further, particularly on low strikes.\n\nTo help further improve feel in the forged 8620 carbon steel chassis, the cavities in the 3- to 9-iron are filled with urethane to enhance feel.\n\nWhat is it: A player’s distance cavity back iron with a new AI-designed variable face thickness and urethane-filled cavity.\n\nWho it’s for: Players who are advancing their ball striking ability and want something with a more premium feel without sacrificing forgiveness and speed, or moving to something as compact as a hollow-body.\n\nMany people are going to ask if they should choose between the Dynapwr Forged or the Staff Model XB iron. But truthfully, the new Dynapwr Forged perfectly fills a gap between the XB and the standard Dynapwr iron.\n\nThe Dynapwr Forged is clearly in that player’s distance category with entries like the P790, JPX 925 Forged, Ti Fusion and many others for players looking for speed and forgiveness.\n\nThe Dynapwr Forged is going to fall on the larger and faster end of that spectrum, while the XB falls \n\nWhat’s the difference? I believe it depends on your trend. This Dynapwr Forged is great for a player who is improving and needs to build confidence, but also wants to start getting into the more premium feel. In other words, they are a player who is improving, rather than a player looking to recapture lost performance.\n\nYou can still benift from lots of modern technology, like the new varaible face thickness and urethane-filled cavity, but you can also hone in your precision with a more players shape than the Dynapwr irons.\n\nDynapwr Forged gives Wilson a very complete iron lineup with no one left out. Another step toward the restoration of one of golf’s (and sport’s) great brands.\n\nWilson’s new Dynapwr Forged irons are available for pre-order starting Feb. 5 and will arrive at retail locations on Feb. 19.\n\nThe full set will cost $1,199.99 for 5-GW with steel shafts or $1,299.99 for graphite. A 3- and 4-iron are also available through custom.\n\nWant to find the best driver for your game in 2026? Find a club-fitting location near you at True Spec Golf.\n\nThe post Wilson’s 2026 Dynapwr Forged irons add AI-tech to the iconic family appeared first on Golf.",

    "description": "How real is the AI threat to software companies? CNBC put it to the test by vibe-coding a Monday.com replacement.",
    "fullText": "Software, legal services and video games stocks have been selling off in recent weeks on fears that new AI features and tools could wipe them out. But how real is that threat? We decided to find out.\n\nCNBC's Deidre Bosa and I used Anthropic's AI coding tool \"Claude Code\" with the goal of creating a replacement for Monday.com, a project management platform with a $5 billion market cap. We didn't expect to get anywhere — we're not developers and we don't have any coding experience. But we have become adept at vibe-coding tools, which are AI tools that can build functioning apps based on commands in plain English from users, including those with limited technical chops.\n\nWe started out simple, telling Claude to build a project management dashboard similar to Monday, with features like multiple project boards, assigned team members and a status dropdown. It spit out a working prototype in minutes.\n\nWe then asked Claude to research Monday on its own, identify main features and recreate them. It added a number of other features, including a calendar.\n\nThe real magic happened when we connected the clone to an email account, essentially spinning up a customized project manager for our personal lives. The AI found Dee's forgotten calendar invite for a kid's birthday party (which she definitely didn't have a gift for yet) and it added reminders to book tickets for an upcoming trip and sign a waiver for another kid's birthday party.\n\nIt took us under an hour, and had we been paying users, it would have cost something like $5 to $15 in compute credits, depending on how much we went back and forth with the AI agent. As more data centers get built out, that cost could start to come down.\n\nSo which companies should investors worry about? Silicon Valley insiders we talk to say the most exposed names are the ones that \"sit on top of the work\" — tools like Atlassian, Adobe, HubSpot, Zendesk, and Smartsheet, that aren't core to businesses.\n\nThey say cybersecurity stocks like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto are harder to disrupt since they have network effects that no one would want to try to replicate and maintain.\n\nSystems of record may be safer, but not immune. Salesforce, for instance, anchors a business with enterprise data, making it harder to clone with a weekend coding project.\n\nWith the wholesale sell-off in software this year, that may be a chance for investors to separate between the need-to-haves and nice-to-haves.",

    "description": "On the earnings call, analysts pushed CEO Andy Jassy for assurances on future returns from this capex boom.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Thursday it plans a staggering $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, sparking concern that the AI spending boom has entered an even more bubbly stage.\n\nThe company's capex forecast was more than $50 billion above Wall Street expectations. That left some analysts uneasy about whether these huge investments will pay off.\n\n\"The strong long-term return on investing capital — I think that's the debate in the market today,\" Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at Evercore ISI, said during a conference call with Amazon executives following the results. \"So could you give us a little bit more insight into how you think investors will be able to see that?\"\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said new AI capacity is being monetized as quickly as it is deployed, calling it \"a very unusual opportunity,\" and argued that AI adoption is accelerating customers' shift to the cloud. He added that AWS' experience forecasting demand helps limit wasted capacity.\n\n\"This isn't some sort of quixotic top-line grab,\" Jassy said during the call. \"We have confidence that these investments will yield strong returns on invested capital.\"\n\nJassy's comments did little to calm investors. Amazon shares fell more than 10% in extended trading after the company detailed its outsized spending plans. A profit forecast also missed Wall Street expectations, adding to ROI concerns.\n\nBig Tech's AI infrastructure buildout has entered a new, breathtaking phase in recent days. On Wednesday, Google said it expects capex of $175 billion to $185 billion in 2026, well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Meta and Microsoft also raised capex.\n\nDuring Thursday's Amazon earnings call, other analysts pressed for assurances around returns on investment. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth asked Jassy whether the company had \"financial guardrails\" in place for the spending plan.\n\nJassy said AI represents an \"extraordinarily unusual opportunity\" that could reshape the scale of AWS and Amazon. He said the company's in-house chips, Trainium and Graviton, are on track to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year and added that its partnership with Anthropic has gone \"very well.\"\n\n\"We see this as an unusual opportunity, and we are going to invest aggressively here to be the leaders like we've been the last number of years,\" Jassy said.\n\nJassy described the AI market as \"barbelled,\" with heavy spending by leading AI labs on one end and productivity-focused enterprise uses on the other.\n\nHe said the middle — enterprise production workloads and new AI-native businesses — remains early but could become \"the largest and the most durable\" source of demand as costs fall and adoption broadens.\n\n\"The lion's share of that demand is still yet to come in the middle of that barbell, and that will come over time,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Global markets slid hard on Friday as losses spread across tech stocks, cryptocurrencies, and precious metals, reinforcing fears that investors have moved into a \"sell everything\" mindset.\n\nMuch of the pressure is coming from tech, as doubts grow over whether the AI boom that powered recent gains can live up to expectations.\n\n\"A session of pure carnage overnight as the rotational flows noted in yesterday's note — out of tech and into cyclical morphed into a 'sell everything' mentality across stocks, crypto and commodities,\" Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia, wrote on Friday.\n\nIn Asia, South Korea's tech-heavy Kospi plunged and briefly triggered a trading halt after the index dropped 5%.\n\nHeavyweights Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were among the hardest hit, dragging the market lower as investors rushed to cut exposure to technology stocks.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell as much as 2.1% as China's major tech names moved lower, reflecting weaker risk appetite and ongoing pressure on the sector.\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 also declined, tracking the global selloff, while Japan's Nikkei 225 reversed earlier losses ahead of a general election this week.\n\nCryptocurrencies fell alongside equities, extending a week of heavy losses as investors continued to reduce risk.\n\nBitcoin was trading around $64,500 after falling about 10% over 24 hours.\n\nThe selling also swept through commodities, with silver remaining under intense pressure following last week's violent breakdown.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $71.20 per troy ounce. It had hit a record high above $121 per ounce last week.\n\n\"Silver's attempt to stabilise after last week's historic rout has so far proven short‑lived,\" Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in a Thursday note, pointing to renewed selling and technical resistance that triggered reversals.\n\nHansen also pointed to fresh selling from China, including disruption around China's only pure-silver fund after it traded far above its underlying value and was later suspended, leaving investors locked in as it repeatedly hit limit-down moves.\n\nHe added that near-term price action in silver is likely to be driven more by market mechanics and positioning than by macroeconomic headlines, given the extreme volatility still coursing through the market.\n\nThe latest moves underscore how quickly sentiment has shifted across asset classes.\n\n\"Investors are questioning their commitment to the pillars that have underpinned markets over the past six months: AI, crypto, and precious metals. This raises the odds of a deeper unwind,\" wrote Sycamore.",

    "description": "The rivaling AI companies pushed GPT-5.3-Codex and Claude Opus 4.6, and had back-to-back appearances on a tech and business podcast.",
    "fullText": "The rivalry between OpenAI and Anthropic intensified this week.\n\nThe two companies released dueling new AI models on Thursday and had back-to-back podcast appearances on \"TBPN.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4.6, an upgraded model that the company says would improve performance on office productivity and coding tasks, with an expanded \"context window\" that allows it to work through longer documents and more complex projects in a single session.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI punched back with its own new coding-focused model called GPT-5.3-Codex, which the company says runs faster, uses fewer computing resources, and can generate and manage complex software from English instructions. The new version also comes alongside a stand-alone Codex desktop app.\n\nBoth Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and Sholto Douglas, one of Anthropic's leading researchers, appeared on the \"TBPN\" podcast in back-to-back chats with show host John Coogan and Jordi Hays.\n\n\"I think we will be heading towards a workflow where a lot of people just feel like they're managing a team of agents,\" said Altman. \"And as the agents get better, they'll keep operating at a higher and higher level of abstraction.\"\n\nDouglas, who appeared in the subsequent timeslot, told Coogan and Hays that users have been comparing previous Anthropic and OpenAI models, and they have noticed some key differences.\n\n\"The OpenAI models were a bit better at trying really, really, really hard on tough problems, but the Anthropic models were much faster and so forth,\" Douglas said.\n\n\"And so they worked on speed while we worked on making the models much, much better at really, really tough problems,\" Douglas added of the Opus 4.6.\n\nThe latest release is part of a long-running competition between Anthropic and OpenAI, dating back to 2021, when a group of OpenAI researchers left to form Anthropic, aiming to develop safer and more controlled AI systems.\n\nThis week, Anthropic's launch of industry-specific plugins triggered a stock market sell-off as Wall Street worried about AI's impact on software.\n\nAnthropic also took a subtle shot at OpenAI with a series of ads released this week, including one that will air during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe ads feature unnamed humanized AIs dropping ads in the middle of their advice, alongside the promise that its model, Claude, will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI announced in January that ads are coming to ChatGPT for users of the free version.\n\nAltman subsequently hit back, calling Anthropic \"dishonest\" and defending ChatGPT as a product that brings AI \"to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions.\" He also clarified that the ads will be \"clearly labeled\" to differentiate themselves from the chatbot's answers to queries.\n\n\"We are not stupid. We respect our users. We understand that if we did something like what those ads depict, people would rightfully stop using the product,\" Altman told the \"TBPN\" podcast on Thursday.\n\n\"Our first principle with ads is that we're not going to put stuff into the LLM stream,\" Altman added. \"That would feel crazy dystopic, like a bad sci-fi movie.\"",

    "description": "Microsoft AI CEO says vibe coding is lowering the barrier to building apps, raising questions about how defensible software will be.",
    "fullText": "Mustafa Suleyman says vibe coding is rapidly lowering the barrier to building apps, a shift that could put traditional software at risk.\n\nThe Microsoft AI CEO said in an episode of the \"Exponential View\" podcast published Thursday that AI tools now make it possible for anyone to quickly start launching code and apps.\n\n\"It is so accessible now,\" said Suleyman. \"You can watch a three-minute video, get spun up, launch one of these things.\"\n\n\"You can create an app, a web app in seconds,\" he added.\n\nSuleyman said people don't need deep technical skills to get started. Instead, they can learn by experimenting, watching, and doing.\n\nThe AI can \"build something that you may have thought was never possible,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless you push these things to their edges and explore the boundaries, you won't really understand the magic, or what they're kind of bad at.\"\n\n\"Everyone's got to get stuck into that motion,\" he added.\n\nSuleyman also said he has vibe-coded a system that tracks the DJs he wants to see, coming concerts and festivals, and then matches those events with his travel schedule. What used to be manual work now runs automatically in a spreadsheet that updates throughout the year.\n\nSuleyman's comments come as investors grow increasingly anxious that AI tools and agents could wipe out entire categories of software.\n\nThat fear flared this week after Anthropic said it was adding legal-focused capabilities to its Cowork assistant. The tools would allow AI to review legal documents and track compliance — work typically done by legal software.\n\nMarkets didn't take it lightly. Shares of legal-software companies in Europe and the US fell sharply on Tuesday, before the selling spread across the wider software sector and into tech.\n\nOpenAI triggered a similar sell-off months earlier after rolling out internal AI-powered software-as-a-service tools.\n\nMany of the tools now unsettling the tech sector were built using AI coding tools.\n\nAI personal assistant OpenClaw was created with the help of AI, while Moltbook — a viral, Reddit-style forum for AI agents — was entirely vibe-coded.\n\nAnthropic also said last month that it built its Cowork assistant using Claude.\n\n\"@claudeai wrote Cowork,\" Anthropic's product manager, Felix Rieseberg, wrote on X. During a livestream, Rieseberg said his team put Cowork together in just over a week, thanks to Claude.\n\nTech leaders and developers have also said that such a turnaround is becoming the norm.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the developer behind OpenClaw, said in an episode of \"Behind the Craft\" podcast published last week that AI now lets developers \"build everything.\"\n\nOpenAI's chair, Bret Taylor, said in an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published last week that building software quickly through vibe coding will soon feel routine rather than novel.\n\nBut the real question, Taylor said, is what software still matters.\n\nInstead of dashboards, browser forms, and traditional apps, he expects AI agents to become the dominant software interface.\n\n\"Who's making those agents is the question,\" he said. \"Will you buy those agents off the shelf or build them yourself?\"",

    "fullText": "Coach and Kate Spade designers have added AI to their design workflow.\n\nOn a Thursday earnings call, CEO Joanne Crevoiserat was asked how and where Tapestry is investing in AI.\n\nShe answered that Coach and Kate Spade's designers now use AI in their day-to-day work, but the design process starts with hand-drawn sketches.\n\n\"So there is still a human and a need for design eye, right,\" Crevoiserat said. \"They do a sketch. But what AI helps is they can iterate on that sketch.\"\n\n\"They can do color multipliers. They can make design tweaks, much faster than we could in the past,\" she added.\n\nShe said AI tools have sped up the supply chain and product development timelines, which then drive the company's growth.\n\nCoach and Kate Spade are both known for their affordable luxury handbags, popular with aspirational luxury shoppers.\n\nTapestry isn't the only fashion company that's invited AI into its design studios.\n\nA designer for the fashion label Alice + Olivia told The Wall Street Journal in January that she sees AI as a \"creativity explosion,\" and that the brand's recent collection featured tarot-card-inspired prints generated with AI tools like Leonardo AI and Adobe Firefly.\n\nAn IT and tech director for LVMH told the Journal in June that design teams in the French luxury giant are using AI to generate mood boards for inspiration.\n\nSmaller independent designers are also using AI in their processes. Business Insider reported in September that Jasline Ang, a silk designer in Singapore who worked at Goyard and Louis Vuitton, uses ChatGPT and Midjourney to create visuals for her social media campaigns. However, Ang said the tools have not been helpful in her artmaking itself.\n\nTapestry reported second-quarter revenue of $2.5 billion, a 14% increase from the same period last year. The company's stock rose more than 10% after the strong earnings. It's up 95% in the past year.\n\nCoach's sales contributed heavily to the company's success in the last quarter, rising about 25% year over year. Crevoiserat said this was driven by Coach's Tabby handbag collection, which is popular with Gen Z customers, Tapestry's target audience.\n\nHowever, Kate Spade reported a 14% drop in revenue in the last quarter compared to last year, to $360 million. Crevoiserat said this was because there had been a deliberate attempt to reduce Kate Spade's promotional activity.",

Until recently, the markets had assumed that companies would be buoyed by the massive amount of capex (capital expenditure) going into AI, and that AI would generate new efficiencies and higher productivity that would ultimately result in higher revenues and earnings per share. Over the past few days, however, traders have reacted to the notion that AI also has the power to destroy the revenues of companies reliant on selling traditional software that can be replaced by AI.\n\nWhat signals indicate the tech correction may continue?\n\nWhy are retail traders buying during market dips?\n\nHow is equal-weight S&P performing versus cap-weighted?\n\nWhat caused the $1 trillion software market selloff?\n\nAs much as $1 trillion was wiped off the market cap of software companies yesterday, according to Bloomberg. Alphabet closed down nearly 2% yesterday and lost a further 2.53% overnight after revealing on its earnings call that it planned to double AI capex. The beatdown on Alphabet shares came despite better-than-forecast revenue growth that indicates the company’s advertising sales are in no way being cannibalized by consumer adoption of AI, including its own Gemini AI chatbot and its AI Mode in Google Search.\n\nThat’s a problem because until very recently the performance of the S&P 500 was governed by the heavy weight of tech stocks, like Alphabet, within it. “By the end of 2025, the 10 largest companies accounted for nearly 41% of the S&P 500’s total weight,” according to RBC Wealth Management.\n\nBut the chaos is mostly a tech-only phenomenon, the data says. The equal-weight S&P 500—a notional index that values each of the 500 companies equally rather than by total market cap—is actually at a record high this morning because the non-tech companies inside it are doing rather well.\n\n“Tech stocks are being squeezed sharply, but a lot of broader indices are still holding up for the most part,” Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank told clients this morning. There were “363 advancers in the S&P 500 [yesterday], which was actually the most in two weeks.”\n\nPeople are buying stocks, just not tech stocks.\n\nSo who is behind this selective buying? Retail traders who love to buy the dip, is one theory, according to Axios. Retail buyers—ordinary folks trading their own accounts—used to be referred to as “the dumb money” among the institutional investors of Wall Street because they historically waited too long to jump into bull markets and sold too late into bear markets, the opposite of what you’d want to do.",

    "fullText": "US stock futures moved lower early Monday as Amazon’s (AMZN) post-earnings slide weighed heavily on tech sentiment and investors braced for further wreckage after a bruising session on Wall Street.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) slid 0.3%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) fell 0.1%.\n\nThe overnight moves followed a sharp sell-off during Thursday’s regular session, led once again by technology stocks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) have now slipped into negative territory for 2026.\n\nAnd after the bell, Amazon (AMZN) added to the gloom. Shares plunged over 10% in after-hours trading after the company posted earnings per share that missed Wall Street estimates and projected capital expenditures of $200 billion for the year, raising concerns about the extent of AI spend.\n\nThe risk-off tone extended beyond equities. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued sliding, touching levels not seen since 2024, while silver (SI=F) resumed its decline after a recent surge fueled by retail investor interest. Strategy (MSTR) revealed a loss for the quarter that was precipitated by bitcoin's sell-off, sending shares down.\n\nEarnings also drove Reddit (RDDT) upward after reporting a quarterly earnings beat, issuing upbeat guidance, and announcing a stock buyback program. Roblox (RBLX) shares also surged. Looking ahead, investors will focus on earnings from Toyota (TM) and Philip Morris (PM), due before Friday’s opening bell.\n\nMeanwhile, the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, originally scheduled for Friday, has been pushed to Wednesday next week following the resolution of the federal government shutdown. But other data this week has shown fresh signs of trouble for the labor market, as job openings sank to their lowest level since 2020 and layoff announcements surged.",

    "fullText": "Having won only one of their past six Premier League games and drawn 2-2 at Tottenham after being 2-0 up, can second-placed Manchester City get back on track at Liverpool on Sunday?\n\n\"I wouldn't rule City out of anything at the moment\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\n\"But the way they folded in the second half against Tottenham was a real worry.\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHis guest for week 25 is Gladiators star Apollo, real name Alex Gray, who supports Newcastle.\n\nBefore becoming a Gladiator, the 6ft 6in Gray played Premiership rugby for three teams and also American Football for NFL side Atlanta Falcons.\n\nHe is part of Channel 5's Big Game Night NFL coverage and they are live on Super Bowl Sunday on 8 February from 22:30 GMT.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own Premier League predictions below - and for the Super Bowl too!\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nThe NFL's influence can be seen in the Premier League through the kind of choreographed corner routines that are now commonplace, and Apollo can understand why Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has shared ideas with Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay.\n\nApollo told BBC Sport: \"While football is quite a free-flowing game you do have these set-pieces and if you need some inspiration of how to make things happen then the NFL is a good place to look at, because that's what they do all day every day - not just on offence but on defence as well.\n\n\"What you are always trying to get in the NFL is mismatches, and that's exactly the same in football for some of the big guys coming in and trying to put the ball in the back of the net with a header or whatever.\n\n\"The level of detail that goes into that in the NFL is incredible. I remember my days there in training camp would start with breakfast at 7.30am and some days you wouldn't leave the meeting rooms until 11pm.\n\n\"We were only on the field for two hours max and in the gym for another hour, and the rest would be meetings and analysis.\n\n\"The scrutiny on every individual is so high so I can see why other sports would look at that and try to implement it themselves to find some weakness in the opposition armour. Arteta must have been thinking it is a way to help his team win games.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Apollo - aka Alex Gray - were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores.\n\nI am at this game and we are getting to the stage where it really matters how the teams fighting relegation do in their head-to-head-battles like this.\n\nI think the bottom two, Wolves and Burnley are down, but you don't know what West Ham will do from here.\n\nThere are signs they may click, so with Leeds and Nottingham Forest both on 26 points, this is big for both of them.\n\nFrom a Leeds point of view, their home form has carried them a lot this season.\n\nThey got walloped at Elland Road by Arsenal last weekend but they just have to put that behind them for this game because, as the season has gone on, they have proved they can be competitive.\n\nForest's away form is actually better than their home form - they have picked up 14 points on the road compared to 12 at the City Ground, in the same number of games.\n\nSean Dyche's side were comfortable with 10 men in the draw against Crystal Palace last time out and they have won their past two away games, against Brentford and the Hammers. Overall, they are unbeaten in four league games, which is the longest they have gone without losing all season.\n\nAs you can see, I've looked into all the stats for you - but will my research help me get my prediction right? Probably not.\n\nThis is going to be a very tight affair and Forest won't worry about having much possession, but scoring goals has been a bigger problem for them because they have missed Chris Wood badly - only Wolves have scored fewer than them.\n\nForest have brought in 6ft 7in striker Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli to try to fill the gap left by Wood's long-term knee injury but he has not been in great form in Serie A this season.\n\nSo, after a great deal of thought, I am going to back Leeds at home - although now I've said that it will probably end up as a 1-1 draw.\n\nApollo's prediction: When I looked at the fixtures I was thinking about who in the Gladiators supports who. Two of the guys, Giant and Hammer, are big Forest fans so I am going for a Leeds win here. It should be a good game though. 3-2\n\nManchester United were slightly fortunate to beat Fulham last time out. A draw would have been about right.\n\nStill, it was big for Benjamin Sesko to get their winner and I have got to say he put it away very nicely, especially because he should have scored with a header earlier in the game.\n\nTottenham, meanwhile, produced a great comeback against Manchester City. I've talked about how much I rate Dominic Solanke and when he is up for Spurs, they are in a much better place as a team.\n\nThere is a danger of getting carried away with United under Michael Carrick, and I am expecting Solanke to score again here, but it still feels like United will find a way to win it.\n\nApollo's prediction: Tottenham have an affinity with the NFL and I've been to a couple of games there so I am backing them here. 0-1\n\nLosing back-to-back home league games against Everton and Brentford has been a real killer for Aston Villa, who have so many injuries to contend with in their midfield.\n\nAfter a long wait for a win, Bournemouth have now won three of their past four league games - and I make them favourites at home here.\n\nVilla thumped the Cherries 4-0 at Villa Park in November, and I have got a lot of their players in my Fantasy team, but this is going to be a very different game.\n\nI've gone for 2-1 wins in my first two games and I don't really want to go for that scoreline again here, but I feel like I have no choice. I do think Villa will score - Morgan Rogers is always dangerous and Tammy Abraham is a clever signing up front - but Bournemouth will edge it.\n\nApollo's prediction: It's great for Villa to be in a title race. 1-2\n\nI am not going to say 2-1 for this one. Instead it will be another Arsenal clean sheet - they have already kept 12 in their first 24 league games, two more than any other team.\n\nIt's a shame Sunderland midfielder Granit Xhaka is not fit to face his old club at the Emirates. When he played for the Black Cats against Arsenal in their draw at the Stadium of Light, they were the first team I saw who really rattled the Gunners.\n\nXhaka's experience has helped to glue together a Sunderland side with a lot of young players this season, but they coped all right without him against Burnley on Monday.\n\nThis is a much tougher game for them, obviously, and Sunderland's away form is nowhere near as strong as it is at home.\n\nArsenal swept Leeds aside 4-0 last weekend, when everyone thought they were having a bit of a blip.\n\nThey showed their strength in depth at Elland Road, when they lost Bukayo Saka in the warm-up, and I can see them winning comfortably this time too.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is very easy for me because Legend and Fire both support Arsenal and are real die-hard fans - Legend even has a cannon tattoo - so being absolutely honest I would love Sunderland to win, and do it for the north-east! 0-2\n\nI think Burnley are down but this is their chance to prove me wrong.\n\nThey need it to be - they are at home, against a team one place above them in the table, so this is their big chance to end their long wait for a win.\n\nI just don't see it happening for the Clarets, though.\n\nAs I said earlier, I am not sure which West Ham side will turn up but they have shown some improvement recently, especially in attack.\n\nI don't think the Hammers will keep a clean sheet because they have had only one all season - the fewest by any top-flight team - but I don't see Burnley beating them.\n\nApollo's prediction: My cousins are lifelong Burnley fans and season-ticket holders so if I didn't back them here, I'd be in a lot of trouble. The former NFL player, JJ Watt, is a co-owner of the club too, so for the NFL links and family ties, it's got to be a home win. 2-1\n\nEverton asked about Fulham forward Harry Wilson on deadline day.\n\nHe has been a revelation this season and they won't be looking forward to facing him on Saturday.\n\nThe Toffees have got something after falling behind in their past three league games, including the last-gasp equaliser against Brighton that saw poor David Moyes booked for his celebration - there is no way you should get a yellow card for that.\n\nThis is going to be another close game and it smells of another 2-1 to me, but I am not going to go down that road again this week.\n\nInstead, I'm going for a different scoreline but sticking with a narrow Fulham win. Marco Silva will feel his side deserved something from Old Trafford and it will be him celebrating at the final whistle this week, not Moyes.\n\nApollo's prediction: We don't like draws in the NFL but this might up all-square. 1-1\n\nChelsea were accused of being too negative in their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal in midweek, but I can't see that being the case here.\n\nI was far too optimistic about Wolves last week when I said they would draw with Bournemouth and I am not making the same mistake this time.\n\nThe games have been coming thick and fast for Chelsea and I actually admire their manager Liam Rosenior for the way he changed things up in their 3-2 comeback win over West Ham after being 2-0 down.\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards has probably got one eye on preparing for next season in the Championship, and his side will be one step nearer to that after this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: I went to a couple of Chelsea games when I lived in London and they will get the job done here. 1-2\n\nYou just wonder how much Newcastle have got left in the tank after their Carabao Cup semi-final defeat at Manchester City on Wednesday.\n\nThe Magpies have a few injuries to contend with too, with Anthony Gordon the latest player to be sidelined, so they will have to dig deep and hope Bruno Guimaraes is back fit in time for this game.\n\nBrentford got one heck of a win last time out at Villa, and their manager Keith Andrews deserves a lot of credit for getting that result despite being down to 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nThe Bees are always so well organised at the back, and how Eddie Howe's side try to break them down will be the key to this one.\n\nAs good as Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade is with his back to goal, he doesn't run in behind.\n\nDoing that, and attacking with pace, is how Eddie Howe's side look the most dangerous - Harvey Barnes and Anthony Elanga will have to do that here, and I fancy Yoane Wissa to score against his former club.\n\nApollo on why he supports Newcastle: I am from a small town in County Durham - my grandmother went to school with Sir Bobby Robson - so I had the choice of Newcastle, Sunderland or Middlesbrough. I know it is absolute blasphemy to say this, but I like to see all the north-east clubs do well.\n\nNewcastle are my team though, because that's who I went to watch first - I went to see them against Ipswich in 2000, and Alan Shearer scored a couple - and it is my city as well. I played rugby for them and I lived there. It's a fantastic place and it's even better when the team is going well.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is going to be a Newcastle win, it's just a case of how much. Brentford's performance coach Ben Ryan used to coach me for England Sevens, then he went to Fiji and got a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, so it would be nice to get one over him as well. 3-1\n\nPalace have brought in Jorgen Strand Larsen, and kept Jean-Philippe Mateta, so Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has got some options up front.\n\nI normally predict a draw in this game, and it ended up 0-0 at Selhurst Park in November. This time, though, I fancy Brighton.\n\nThe Seagulls didn't quite get over the line against Everton, but them conceding late on actually won me some points. I am going for them to keep a clean sheet here though.\n\nApollo's prediction: Palace to edge it. 0-1\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola starts with Omar Marmoush up front ahead of Erling Haaland after his two goals against Newcastle in midweek, but their attack looks strong anyway with Rayan Cherki and Antoine Semenyo in the team.\n\nThe same applies to Liverpool, who have got a striker in form in Hugo Ekitike, while Florian Wirtz is playing with confidence too.\n\nCity will have moments where they will create chances, but Liverpool are going to have opportunities at the other end as well - there will be a few goals in this game.\n\nApollo's prediction: This is the 'Super Bowl' game of the weekend in the Premier League so I've gone for an NFL-type score as well as a football one. 22-31 (2-3)\n\nSuper Bowl, Levi's Stadium 23:30 GMT\n\nI haven't got a clue about the NFL and I never played gridiron - my nose would be too big and would stick out of the helmet - but I am going for the Seahawks to down the Patriots on Sunday.\n\nSeattle is a really nice place and I played in their stadium for Celtic, so they get my backing here... although that's probably bad news for them, going by how I've done at predictions this season.\n\nApollo's prediction: The Seahawks' defensive coordinator, Aden Durde, was part of the NFL's International Player Pathway Program that took me to Atlanta. If he gets a Super Bowl, it would be the biggest accomplishment from someone from Britain in the NFL. 21-18\n\nFor the second successive week, the outcome went to the final game.\n\nChris, the BBC readers and AI were all level on 80 points going into Monday's match between Sunderland and Burnley, with his guest - boxer Francesca Hennessy - on 40 points.\n\nChris and Francesca went for a 1-0 Black Cats victory, the BBC readers thought they would win 2-0, while AI picked a 1-1 draw.\n\nSunderland were 2-0 up after 32 minutes but the BBC readers' hopes of an outright win were scuppered when Chemsdine Talbi scored their third goal, 18 minutes from time.\n\nThat meant Chris and the BBC readers tied for victory - they both managed six correct results, including one exact score, from the 10 matches in week 24, for a total of 90 points.\n\nAI managed five correct results with one correct score for a tally of 80 points, while Francesca also managed five correct results but with no exact scores, leaving her on 50 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "We Reverse-Engineered Docker Sandbox's Undocumented MicroVM API",
    "description": "Docker ships with an undocumented API for spawning isolated microVMs. Here's how to use it for more than just AI agents.",
    "fullText": "Docker ships with an undocumented API for spawning microVMs. We reverse-engineered it and built the open-source Sandbox Agent SDK to allow orchestrating coding agents inside of them.\n\nDocker & containers are the standard for how we’ve been running backends. Recently, more workloads have been moving to sandboxes for untrusted code execution, which Docker is not suitable for.\n\nWith the launch of Docker Sandboxes, Docker quietly shipped an undocumented API for microVMs that can power sandboxes.\n\nThis looks promising to be a unified way of managing sandboxes on your own infrastructure using microVMs, just like Docker did for containers 10 years ago. (Today it only supports macOS/Windows. Requires nested virtualization.)\n\nDocker Sandboxes (launch post) are Docker’s solution for running AI coding agents safely. Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini need to run arbitrary code, install packages, and modify files. MicroVMs let them run --dangerously-skip-permissions without being dangerous.\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a glorified docker run command, but under the hood Docker is using a completely different technology: microVMs.\n\nContainers are what most developers know and love when they run docker run. They provide basic file system, network, and process isolation between the host machine.\n\nHowever, it’s a common misconception that containers are good enough for running untrusted code (AI agents, user-submitted scripts, multi-tenant plugins).\n\nIn order to achieve better security, products like AWS Lambda, Fly.io, and most sandbox providers use microVMs for lightweight virtual machines with separate kernels for better security. It’s lighter than a full virtual machine, but does not carry as much overhead. This is considered the gold standard of isolating user code. There are many other documents that better describe microVMs & Firecracker if you’d like to read more.\n\nThis is why Docker built Sandboxes on microVMs instead of containers while remaining compatible with Docker containers.\n\nThis opens up use cases that containers can’t safely handle:\n\ndocker sandbox run is strictly limited to Docker’s whitelisted agents: Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Kiro, and Cagent. It currently does not let you run your own Docker containers.\n\nSo naturally, I went down the rabbit hole to see if I could reverse engineer the underlying microVM API in order to run any code I’d like inside of sandboxes.\n\nDocker’s sandboxd daemon manages all of the virtual machines and listens on ~/.docker/sandboxes/sandboxd.sock.\n\nThe VM name follows the pattern {agent_name}-vm. socketPath is your per-VM Docker daemon, which we’ll use in the next step.\n\nNormally all containers share /var/run/docker.sock. Anyone with socket access can see and control every other container.\n\nSandboxes flip this. Each microVM gets its own Docker daemon at ~/.docker/sandboxes/vm/<name>/docker.sock for maximum isolation. Containers run like normal inside the microVM, but are completely isolated from the host and other VMs.\n\nTo target different daemons, we will need to override the Unix socket path using curl --unix-socket ... or docker --host unix://....\n\nNew VMs are completely isolated from the host, so we need to manually load images we’ve built into the VM.\n\nWe do this by building, archiving, and loading the image into the VM like this:\n\n$VM_SOCK is the socketPath from the earlier step.\n\nNow the fun part: we can finally run our image and work with it like any other Docker container.\n\nmicroVMs route outbound traffic through a filtering proxy at host.docker.internal:3128. Your container needs these env vars:\n\nThe proxy does man-in-the-middle on HTTPS (hence NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0) for network policy enforcement. For production use, install the CA certificate from ca_cert_path in the VM response instead of disabling TLS verification.\n\nWorkspace syncs at the same absolute path, so volume mounts just work:\n\nDocker Sandboxes require Docker Desktop 4.58+ on macOS or Windows. Linux is not supported since Docker Desktop uses platform-specific virtualization (Apple Virtualization.framework on macOS, Hyper-V on Windows).\n\nThe raw microVM API is powerful, but building a production agent orchestration system on top of it requires handling:\n\nWe built the Sandbox Agent SDK to handle all of this. It wraps the microVM API and provides a simple interface for spawning and interacting with AI coding agents:\n\nSee the full guide on deploying with Docker Sandboxes.\n\nDocker’s microVM API opens up secure isolation for any workload, not just the handful of agents Docker officially supports. Whether you’re building an AI coding assistant, running untrusted user code, or isolating multi-tenant plugins, the /vm API gives you the primitives to do it safely.\n\nThe API is undocumented and subject to change, but it works today on Docker Desktop 4.58+. If you’re building something with it, we’d love to hear about it.",

    "description": "OpenAI rolled out a new enterprise platform that is aimed at making AI agents feel like true coworkers.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI has a pitch for software companies freaking out about AI and this week's massive sell-off: Work with us, not against us.\n\nOn Thursday, OpenAI announced \"Frontier,\" its new enterprise-focused platform that is set to build on the startup's existing ChatGPT enterprise offerings and its growing team of Forward Deployed Engineers. The product is designed to give agents greater autonomy across multiple systems rather than performing isolated tasks.\n\n\"Are software companies going to need to adapt to AI in general? Yes, of course,\" Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of Applications, told reporters during a call ahead of Thursday's announcement. \"But I think the ones that do adapt to AI will actually find Frontier to be a massive opportunity for them.\"\n\nWall Street swung against software companies earlier this week after Anthropic released a tool that can do clerical work for legal professionals. In tech, there is no shortage of voices pronouncing the end of SaaS.\n\nSimo said OpenAI's new offering, which already counts Uber, State Farm, Thermo Fisher, and Intuit as early adopters, isn't another shot at existing software companies.\n\n\"We're not going to build every single AI agent that companies need — absolutely not,\" Simo said, \"And that's why we have built a platform in a way where the third-party software companies can deploy their agents on top of us.\"\n\nFrontier's design, Simo said, was informed by her conversations with software companies before she formally joined OpenAI's leadership team in May. She said software companies asked whether OpenAI could offer a platform that simplifies integration, making it easier for them to deploy agents through OpenAI's enterprise relationships.\n\nBarret Zoph, OpenAI's GM of B2B, said the goal of Frontier is to help companies get the full value out of current models, which is difficult to do with one-size-fits-all offerings.\n\n\"What we're fundamentally doing is transitioning agents into true AI coworkers,\" he said.\n\nOpenAI is one of many companies racing to roll out agent-based systems. Last month, Anthropic released an agent-based tool that allows AI to take on multi-step tasks that could automate some white-collar work. Meanwhile, a former xAI engineer said in a recent podcast that Elon Musk's company was developing and testing human emulators to automate white-collar work.\n\nOpenAI declined to share how much revenue it could generate with the new platform. The company has a major need for additional revenue streams, with roughly $1.4 trillion in data center projects committed over the next year. On top of that, OpenAI recently announced plans to bring ads to lower tiers of ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI said Frontier is available to \"a limited set of customers\" and will have more availability coming soon. The company declined to discuss the cost of the service.\n\nThe company said Frontier is built on open standards and is designed to work with agents developed in-house or by third-party vendors, including competitors.",

    "description": "AI scientist Gary Marcus thinks the underwhelming release of ChatGPT-5 marked a turning point when investors realized AI might not be a game changer.",
    "fullText": "With names like Nvidia, Oracle, and CoreWeave down double digits in the last few months, the AI trade appears to be stuck in a rut.\n\nBut far from a temporary blip, the diminished fortunes of the market's tech leaders might represent a much more dire reassessment of the technology among investors, a top AI researcher says.\n\nThe latest volatility began with Anthropic's debut of its new plugins for its Claude AI agent, which sent legal tech stocks into a nosedive that quickly spurred volatility into the broader sector. Yet, many leading AI names have been down for months, with Nvidia losing 13% since November and Oracle down 43%.\n\nAI scientist and former Uber AI chief, Gary Marcus, said the moves show investors are waking up to reality. Marcus has been skeptical of AI's big ambitions, and his latest post reveals he sees a clear recent turning point in the AI discourse.\n\n\"Investors have been 'rotating out of tech stocks' — because they realize they were sold a bill of goods,\" he wrote. \"My guess is that these stocks — and the reputation of OpenAI — will fall further, but either way it is already clear that the rockets will not reach the altitude so many people were hoping for.\"\n\nIn Marcus's opinion, the debut of ChatGPT-5 was an underwhelming event that left investors wondering if the promises of AI might be overblown. Marcus highlighted Sam Altman's statement in early 2025 that OpenAI knew how to build AGI as one such promise that appears false given current capabilities.\n\n\"That fateful ChatGPT-5 introduction day last August — this Saturday will be the half anniversary — was the day people woke up to the reality that ChatGPT is not magic.\"\n\nIn Marcus's view, the rotation away from tech stocks is a clear indication that investors are beginning to understand that the AI boom is waning. He also said that investors seem to be moving away from tech stocks for two reasons that are almost contradictory.\n\n\"Some may be leaving companies like Nvidia out of concerns about circular financing and profitability of LLM companies, while others are leaving traditional companies like Salesforce because they're worried about companies like Anthropic replacing traditional software,\" he noted.\n\nEven if the software industry survives the disruption from AI innovation, Marcus still sees an industry that's become unstable. He flagged circular funding deals that others like \"The Big Short\" trader Michael Burry have also expressed concerns about.\n\n\"That circularity is a warning sign, reflecting a market that is propped up rather than functioning well on its own accord,\" Marcus wrote. \"Wall Street lost confidence, particularly after the crazy Oracle deal in September that I called at the time \"peak bubble\".\n\nThe tech sell-off continued on Thursday, with Google parent Alphabet down sharply after earnings revealed more big capex plans. Software stocks also continued to struggle. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF was down another 3%.",

    "fullText": "Workday is laying off about 400 employees, citing a need to realign its resources to meet its top priorities.\n\nIn a securities filing Wednesday, the California-based software provider for payroll, talent management, and expense processing said the cuts represent about 2% of its overall workforce and will primarily affect non-revenue-generating roles within its global customer service team. It said it plans to continue to hire in strategic areas and locations.\n\nWorkday didn't cite artificial intelligence in its filing as a reason for the layoffs. Recent AI developments have, however, soured investors' outlook for many software companies.\n\nSeveral marquee tech stocks took a beating this week, including Workday, Intuit, and Salesforce, following the debut of Anthropic's industry-specific Claude Cowork plugin.\n\nA spokesperson for Workday declined to comment beyond the filing.\n\nShares of Workday are down about 34% from a year ago. The company announced a larger round of layoffs last year, citing a need to invest more heavily in strategic areas such as AI. It had more than 20,400 employees as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWorkday is also dealing with a class-action lawsuit that alleges it uses AI to discriminate against candidates based on race, age, and disability.

    "description": "In a recent interview, Elon Musk says that in a world of mass-produced AI and robotics, money and saving for retirement will be pointless.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is now openly questioning whether saving for retirement will even make sense in the future, and he’s tying that view directly to how fast he believes AI and robotics will dismantle today’s labor market.\n\nIn a wide-ranging discussion about artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX/xAI CEO Musk laid out a timeline that would upend decades of economic assumptions. In his view, the first wave is already underway: white-collar work. Lawyers, accountants, analysts, marketers, coders, and other jobs long considered “safe” because they were cognitive rather than physical, are, he argues, the most immediately vulnerable to AI systems that can reason, write, analyze, and iterate at superhuman speed.\n\nNvidia May Not Invest $100 Billion in OpenAI After All. Is That a Bad Sign for NVDA Stock?\n\nA Potential Sentiment Mismatch Makes Rocket Lab (RKLB) Stock Options an Enticing Proposition\n\nWhy Needham Warns That Meta Platforms Stock Could Be Headed for 10%-15% Downside\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. \n\nBlue-collar work comes next. Musk believes humanoid robots, paired with increasingly capable AI models, will replace much of physical labor shortly after. Manufacturing, logistics, construction, and even service work would eventually follow. His estimate for this transition is strikingly aggressive: three to seven years.\n\nThe end result, Musk argues, isn’t mass deprivation, but abundance. If AI and robots can produce goods and services at near-zero marginal cost, then scarcity collapses. Food, housing, transportation, energy, and manufactured goods all become dramatically cheaper. Productivity explodes, not because humans are working harder, but because machines are doing nearly all of the work.\n\nThat’s where Musk’s idea of “universal high income” comes in, a phrase he’s used before to distinguish his view from traditional universal basic income. This isn’t a modest government stipend meant to keep people afloat. It’s a world where the cost of living drops so sharply that most people can afford a high standard of living regardless of whether they hold a conventional job.\n\nIn that context, he made a statement that cuts directly against decades of financial planning orthodoxy.\n\n“One side recommendation I have,” Musk said, “is don’t worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years. It won’t matter. You won’t need to save for retirement. If any of the things we’ve said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant.”",

Includes dynamically installable skillsets for Google \nservices, shell execution, file management, and task scheduling.\n\nThe Moltbot blueprint is a comprehensive personal AI automation agent that\nbrings the power of Moltbot/Clawdbot to the ChatBotKit platform. Unlike\nself-hosted alternatives that require managing infrastructure and security,\nthis blueprint provides all the automation capabilities in a secure, managed\nenvironment with enterprise-grade isolation.\n\nThe agent is accessible across four communication channels—Slack for work\nconversations, Telegram for secure personal messaging, WhatsApp for mobile\naccessibility, and Email for asynchronous communication. Users can interact\nwith their personal automation agent wherever they are, and conversations\nmaintain context across channels.\n\nAt the heart of this blueprint is a minimal-footprint main agent with just\ncore capabilities: skillset discovery, skillset installation, shell execution,\nand file management. Rather than loading all abilities upfront, the agent\ndiscovers available skillsets at runtime and installs only what's needed.\nThis pattern keeps the agent fast and focused while enabling unlimited\nexpansion.\n\nProactive Automation with Triggers\n\nFive scheduled triggers automate common workflows:\n\nAll shell commands run in isolated sandbox containers that are created\non-demand and destroyed after use. The agent has its own persistent Space\nfor storing scripts, automation outputs, and configuration files. Unlike\nself-hosted Moltbot which has full system access, this architecture\nensures even malicious code cannot escape the sandbox.\n\nGoogle services use personal OAuth secrets, meaning each user authenticates\nwith their own Google account. The agent never sees raw credentials—it\nreceives scoped access tokens that can only perform the permitted actions.\nThis provides true personal automation where your calendar, email, and\nfiles remain under your control.\n\nThis blueprint demonstrates advanced ChatBotKit patterns: multi-channel\ndeployment, dynamic skillset installation, personal OAuth, scheduled\ntriggers for proactive automation, and secure shell execution—all\ncombined into a practical personal automation assistant.\n\nCommon information about the bot's experience, skills and personality. \n\nThis example uses a dedicated Skillset. Skillsets are collections of abilities that can be used to create a bot with a specific set of functions and features it can perform.\n\nThis example uses Secrets to store sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other credentials.\n\nThis blueprint can be deployed using Terraform, enabling infrastructure-as-code management of your ChatBotKit resources.

    "description": "Axiom says its AI found solutions to several long-standing math problems, a sign of the technology’s steadily advancing reasoning capabilities.",
    "fullText": "mathematicians Dawei Chen and Quentin Gendron were trying to untangle a difficult area of algebraic geometry involving differentials, elements of calculus used to measure distance along curved surfaces. While working on one theorem, they ran into an unexpected roadblock: Their argument depended on a strange formula from number theory, but they were unable to solve or justify it. In the end, Chen and Gendron wrote a paper presenting their idea as a conjecture, rather than a theorem.\n\nChen recently spent hours prompting ChatGPT in the hopes of getting the AI to come up with a solution to the still unsolved problem, but it wasn’t working. Then, during a reception at a math conference in Washington, DC, last month, Chen ran into Ken Ono, a well-known mathematician who had recently left his job at the University of Virginia to join Axiom, an artificial intelligence startup cofounded by one of his mentees, Carina Hong.\n\nChen told Ono about the problem, and the following morning, Ono presented him with a proof, courtesy of his startup’s math-solving AI, AxiomProver. “Everything fell into place naturally after that,” says Chen, who worked with Axiom to write up the proof, which has now been posted to arXiv, a public repository for academic papers.\n\nAxiom’s AI tool found a connection between the problem and a numerical phenomenon first studied in the 19th century. It then devised a proof, which it helpfully verified itself. “What AxiomProver found was something that all the humans had missed,” Ono tells WIRED.\n\nThe proof is one of several solutions to unsolved math problems that Axiom says its system has come up with in recent weeks. The AI has not yet solved any of the most famous (or lucrative) problems in the field of mathematics, but it has found answers to questions that have stumped experts in different areas for years. The proofs are evidence of AI’s steadily advancing math abilities. In recent months, other mathematicians have reported using AI tools to explore new ideas and solve existing problems.\n\nThe techniques being developed by Axiom may prove useful outside the world of advanced math. For example, the same approaches could be used to develop software that is more resilient to certain kinds of cybersecurity attacks. This would involve using AI to verify that code is provably reliable and trustworthy.\n\n“Math is really the great test ground and sandbox for reality,” says Hong, Axiom’s CEO. “We do believe that there are a lot of pretty important use cases of high commercial value.”\n\nAxiom’s approach involves combining large language models with a proprietary AI system called AxiomProver that is trained to reason through math problems to reach solutions that are provably correct. In 2024, Google demonstrated a similar idea with a system called AlphaProof. Hong says that AxiomSolver incorporates several significant advances and newer techniques.\n\nOno says the AI-generated proof for the Chen-Gendron conjecture shows how AI can now meaningfully assist professional mathematicians. “This is a new paradigm for proving theorems,” he says.\n\nAxiom’s system is more than just a regular AI model, in that it is able to verify proofs using a specialized mathematical language called Lean. Rather than just search through the literature, this allows AxiomProver to develop genuinely novel ways of solving problems.\n\nAnother one of the new proofs generated by AxiomProver demonstrates how the AI is capable of solving math problems entirely on its own. That proof, which has also been described in a paper posted to arXiv, provides a solution to Fel’s Conjecture, which concerns syzygies, or mathematical expressions where numbers line up in algebra. Remarkably, the conjecture involves formulas first found in the notebook of legendary Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan more than 100 years ago. In this case AxiomProver did not just fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, it devised the proof from start to finish.",

    "description": "Agentic Engineering is a disciplined approach to AI-assisted software development that emphasizes human oversight and engineering rigor, distinguishing it fr...",
    "fullText": "A year ago, Andrej Karpathy coined “vibe coding” to describe a gleefully reckless way of programming: you prompt, hand the keyboard to an AI, accept everything it spits out, don’t read the diffs, iterate by pasting error messages back in. It was a great label for a real thing - building quick prototypes or MVPs on pure AI autopilot.\n\nThe problem is that “vibe coding” has become a suitcase term. People now use it to describe everything from a weekend hack to a disciplined engineering workflow where AI agents handle implementation under human oversight. These are fundamentally different activities, and conflating them is causing real confusion - and real damage.\n\nVibe coding means going with the vibes and not reviewing the code. That’s the defining characteristic. You prompt, you accept, you run it, you see if it works. If it doesn’t, you paste the error back and try again. You keep prompting. The human is a prompt DJ, not an engineer.\n\nIf vibe coding gives millions of people the ability to create custom software who otherwise couldn’t, that’s a genuine win. The technique has a legitimate place in the toolbox.\n\nBut the failure modes are well-documented at this point. The pattern is always the same: it demos great, then reality arrives. You try to modify it, scale it, or secure it, and you discover nobody understands what the code is actually doing. As one engineer put it, “This isn’t engineering, it’s hoping.”\n\nHere’s the thing: a lot of experienced engineers are now getting massive productivity gains from AI - 2x, 5x, sometimes more - while maintaining code quality. But the way they work looks nothing like vibe coding. They’re writing specs before prompting. They’re reviewing every diff. They’re running test suites. They’re treating the AI like a fast but unreliable junior developer who needs constant oversight. I’ve personally liked “AI-assisted engineering” and have talked about how this describes that end of the spectrum where the human remains in the loop.\n\nSimon Willison (whose work I adore) proposed “vibe engineering” for this - it reclaims “vibe” while adding “engineering” to signal discipline. But after watching the community debate this for months, I think the the word “vibe” carries too much baggage. It signals casualness. When you tell a CTO you’re “vibe engineering” their payment system, you can see the concern on their face.\n\nAndrej Karpathy suggested “agentic engineering” this week and I think I like it.\n\nIt describes what’s actually happening. You’re orchestrating AI agents - coding assistants that can execute, test, and refine code - while you act as architect, reviewer, and decision-maker. You might write only a % of the code by hand. The rest comes from agents working under your direction. That’s agentic. And you’re applying engineering discipline throughout. That’s engineering.\n\nIt’s professionally legible. “Agentic engineering” sounds like what it is: a serious engineering discipline involving autonomous agents. You can say it to your VP of Engineering without embarrassment. You can put it in a job description. You can build a team practice around it.\n\nIt draws a clean line. Vibe coding = YOLO. Agentic engineering = AI does the implementation, human owns the architecture, quality, and correctness. The terminology itself enforces the distinction.\n\nThe workflow isn’t complicated, but it requires discipline that vibe coding explicitly abandons:\n\nYou start with a plan. Before prompting anything, you write a design doc or spec - sometimes with AI assistance. You break the work into well-defined tasks. You decide on the architecture. This is the part vibe coders skip, and it’s exactly where projects go off the rails.\n\nYou direct, then review. You give the AI agent a well-scoped task from your plan. It generates code. You review that code with the same rigor you’d apply to a human teammate’s PR. If you can’t explain what a module does, it doesn’t go in.\n\nYou test relentlessly. The single biggest differentiator between agentic engineering and vibe coding is testing. With a solid test suite, an AI agent can iterate in a loop until tests pass, giving you high confidence in the result. Without tests, it’ll cheerfully declare “done” on broken code. Tests are how you turn an unreliable agent into a reliable system.\n\nYou own the codebase. You maintain documentation. You use version control and CI. You monitor production. The AI accelerates the work, but you’re responsible for the system.\n\nTeams doing this well often report faster development - and those gains come from augmenting a solid process, not abandoning one. The AI handles boilerplate and grunt work. The human focuses on architecture, correctness, edge cases, and long-term maintainability.\n\nThe irony is that AI-assisted development actually rewards good engineering practices more than traditional coding does. The better your specs, the better the AI’s output. The more comprehensive your tests, the more confidently you can delegate. The cleaner your architecture, the less the AI hallucinates weird abstractions. As one analysis noted, “AI didn’t cause the problem; skipping the design thinking did.”\n\nHere’s an uncomfortable truth from the trenches: agentic engineering disproportionately benefits senior engineers. If you have deep fundamentals - you understand system design, security patterns, performance tradeoffs - you can leverage AI as a massive force multiplier. You know what good code looks like, so you can efficiently review and correct AI output.\n\nBut if you’re junior and you lean on AI before building those fundamentals, you risk a dangerous skill atrophy. You can produce code without understanding it. You can ship features without learning why certain patterns exist. Several engineering leaders have flagged this as an emerging crisis: a generation of developers who can prompt but can’t debug, who can generate but can’t reason about what they’ve generated.\n\nThis isn’t an argument against AI-assisted development. It’s an argument for being honest about what it demands. Agentic engineering isn’t easier than traditional engineering - it’s a different kind of hard. You’re trading typing time for review time, implementation effort for orchestration skill, writing code for reading and evaluating code. The fundamentals matter more, not less.\n\nThe trajectory is clear: AI agents are getting more capable, and the agentic engineering workflow is becoming default for a growing number of professional developers. This is going to accelerate.\n\nThe rise of AI coding doesn’t replace the craft of software engineering - it raises the bar for it. The developers who’ll thrive aren’t the ones who prompt the fastest. They’re the ones who think the clearest about what they’re building and why, then use every tool available - including AI agents - to build it well.\n\nVibe coding showed us what’s possible when you drop all conventions.\n\nNow it’s time to bring the engineering back. Let’s call that what it is.\n\nI’ve written a new book with O’Reilly, Beyond Vibe Coding, that goes deeper into practical frameworks for AI-Assisted (and agentic) engineering. If you’ve been figuring this out in your own workflow, I’d love to hear what’s working.",

    "title": "Software ate the world. Now AI is eating software.",
    "description": "What was once a stable and profitable tech business now faces an existential question: What happens if AI tools and agents replace business software?",
    "fullText": "In 2011, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared \"software is eating the world.\" Today, AI is beginning to devour software.\n\nInstead of helping the industry improve, new AI tools and agents could end up replacing some software products entirely.\n\nThis anxiety crystallized in recent weeks with three developments: Anthropic's release of a new autonomous AI agent called Cowork, the launch of industry-specific Cowork plugins, and the rise of OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant spreading rapidly through messaging apps.\n\n\"Is this the end for software?\" Raimo Lenshow, a veteran tech analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent note to investors. \"The current situation in software feels very unique with the large overhang of how AI will impact the space in the long-run.\"\n\nToday, companies get stuff done through a complex collection of different software services that help them wrangle data, track financials, sell products, and manage employees, customers, supply chains, and contracts. (If you've ever had to login to Workday, you'll know what I mean).\n\nGenerative AI is a threat to these applications in two main ways. First, if employees get more efficient using AI tools, companies may not need to buy as many business software subscriptions. That would dent the growth of \"seats,\" or how many subscriptions software companies sell. Each employee has a seat, so if there's no new hiring, growth stalls.\n\nThe second threat is more existential. If AI tools and AI agents get good enough, companies could replace the software they use entirely and instead rely on new AI-powered workflows. And with AI coding tools showing big improvements lately, companies could even develop their own software, without needing to buy it from established vendors.\n\nThis is why Anthropic's recent announcements have hit the software sector so hard.\n\nAnthropic's Cowork marks a clear step beyond chatbots. Instead of simply answering questions, Cowork can plan and execute multi-step tasks on a user's computer. Users can grant it access to folders, files, and applications, allowing the AI to clean up documents, build spreadsheets and slide decks, analyze data, automate workflows, and even log into web apps to collect information.\n\nBarclays analysts described Cowork as closer to what Microsoft originally envisioned for Copilot—a true digital worker—but with far greater autonomy. Microsoft shares are down about 12% in the past week or so.\n\nCowork is designed for non-technical and semi-technical users, such as marketers, project managers, and finance professionals, who can direct it using plain English. That matters because it weakens the traditional value proposition of many SaaS tools. If an AI agent can organize files, generate reports, build dashboards, and automate routine workflows on demand, the need for a dedicated, single-purpose application starts to look less obvious.\n\nThe threat became more concrete when Anthropic followed up by launching plugins for Cowork this week. These plugins effectively turn the AI into a specialist for roles like sales, finance, legal, marketing, and customer support, connecting it directly to internal data sources and tools. Anthropic even open-sourced a starter set of plugins, signaling an ecosystem approach rather than a closed product.\n\n\"This is another front-of-mind example of an AI tool lowering the barrier to entry, gaining traction, and disrupting incumbent workflows,\" said Michelle Miller, co-head of the Enterprise Software Technology group at consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\nFor years, companies bought software because building it themselves was too slow and expensive. Generative AI is flipping that equation. Tools like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI-powered coding assistants, and products from StackBlitz, Replit, and others allow non-engineers to create custom tools with relatively simple English language prompts.\n\nNetlify CEO Matt Biilmann has said his own employees have used AI to build internal replacements for SaaS products like survey and quoting tools. Venture capitalist Martin Casado has described building a personal CRM with AI because it was easier than learning a complex off-the-shelf product. Salesforce, the leading CRM software vendor, is down about 40% in the past year.\n\nStackblitz CEO Eric Simons said his startup has created in-house AI agents for many workflows, including business intelligence, data analysis, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\n\"As a result, there are many SaaS vendors we would have likely previously used that are no longer relevant,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The industry is waking up to the fact that AI is becoming extremely good at creating software autonomously,\" he added. \"This brings questions around what 'moats' exist for incumbent companies that are not themselves frontier AI labs.\"\n\nThis shift is especially dangerous for mid-sized SaaS companies. According to AlixPartners, they're being squeezed between nimble AI-native startups on one side and tech giants bundling AI into existing platforms on the other. Enterprise buyers, under pressure to cut costs, are increasingly asking why they need five tools when one AI tool or agent can do some, or most, of the work.\n\nPricing adds another layer of tension. AI systems are expensive to run, making traditional per-seat pricing harder to justify. Companies like ServiceNow are experimenting with hybrid and usage-based models. CEO Bill McDermott has insisted AI isn't hurting results, but investors remain skeptical. ServiceNow shares have plunged 25% in the past month.\n\nIf Cowork represents a top-down push from a well-funded AI lab, OpenClaw, formerly called Moltbot, shows how disruption can also come from the bottom up.\n\nCreated as a personal project and released as open source, OpenClaw is a messaging-first AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage. Relying heavily on Anthropic's Claude models, OpenClaw remembers context, proactively nudges users, and can automate tasks using browser actions, scripts, and scheduled jobs. After a month or so of relative obscurity, it went viral in late January.\n\nWhat caught investors' attention wasn't just OpenClaw's popularity, but what it represents. Instead of logging into multiple apps, users interact with an AI agent in a chat window and let it orchestrate tasks behind the scenes. In effect, the interface becomes conversation, not software menus.\n\nBarclays analysts noted that OpenClaw's underlying \"gateway,\" which routes tasks between agents and tools, resembles the orchestration layer that many enterprise software vendors are now racing to build.\n\nThe difference is that OpenClaw is free, open source, and user-controlled — a worrying combination for software incumbents that rely on expensive licenses. It's also a potential problem because the direct user relationship is now controlled by OpenClaw, not software providers.\n\nNone of this means software is disappearing overnight. Core systems of record — databases, payroll systems, accounting ledgers — remain deeply embedded in corporate operations. But the layers around them are becoming fluid. Dashboards, workflows, reports, and even entire applications can now be generated and used on the fly by AI agents.\n\nFor SaaS companies, the message is stark. Adapt by embracing agents, flexible pricing, and AI-native design — or risk becoming the next thing AI consumes.\n\n\"AI is forcing change across software development, AI governance and data security, go-to-market operations, pricing models, valuation frameworks, and business structure,\" AlixPartners' Miller said. \"Software companies mastering these transitions will define the winners in the next era, and those unable to adapt will be sidelined as industry fundamentals are redrawn.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Anthropic's latest AI tool was seen by the legal software industry as a 'shot across the bow.' Here's what it means.",
    "description": "A new plugin from the AI startup has sent legal tech into a spin, sparking debate across the industry.",
    "fullText": "A new tool from Anthropic is stoking debate over whether AI will replace existing software that has dominated the legal sector for years.\n\nThe release of Anthropic's Cowork legal plugin sparked a steep sell-off in legal software stocks. Shares of Thomson Reuters and RLEX, makers of legal software, dropped about 15% each on Tuesday. Both stocks recovered slightly on Wednesday, though they remain fervently in the red for the week.\n\nThe slump isn't really about one Claude plugin. It pokes at a deeper question: If AI models become good enough for lawyers, will anyone need traditional legal software?\n\nOn one side are the two companies that have ruled legal tech for decades: Thomson Reuters and LexisNexis. They argue that lawyers will keep buying their software tools because their AI features are grounded in a walled garden of vetted case law, statutes, and editorial content. They claim less hallucination risk and fewer career-ending mistakes.\n\nOn the other side are the fast-rising startups, such as Harvey and Legora, and foundation model companies. They're betting lawyers will accept — or learn to manage — more risk in exchange for speed, flexibility, and tools that feel closer to a true \"virtual associate\" than a smarter search box.\n\nThis week's market reaction suggests investors are starting to price in an uncomfortable possibility: a new wave of competitors is finally pushing into a corner of the legal market that hasn't faced a real challenger in decades.\n\nAnalysts at William Blair & Co. wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that Anthropic's entry into the legal market brings \"a structural concern\" about the relevancy and \"moats of information services names under this new AI paradigm.\"\n\nIf you work in legal, it was hard to open LinkedIn over the past 24 hours without running into a wall of hot takes about Anthropic's new plugin.\n\nOne legal-tech startup employee described it to Business Insider as \"the Claude announcement that launched 1,000 ships.\"\n\nZachary Amron, deputy general counsel at the tech company Valon, said it's only a matter of time before Anthropic ships more legal-specific tools. Anthropic has not said publicly if it plans to go deeper in legal.\n\nNot everyone in legal tech is panicking. At GC AI, a startup that builds software for in-house legal teams rather than law firms, the mood was closer to a shrug.\n\nIn an internal memo seen by Business Insider, founder Cecilia Ziniti told employees that Anthropic's legal plugin was \"very raw and not a threat to us.\"\n\nZiniti's broader point was that foundation models may be powerful, but they're still just infrastructure. \"Claude gives people a great engine,\" she wrote. \"We already have one in our car. But does that suddenly mean everyone is going to assemble their own cars in their garage? Do you change your own oil? No.\"\n\nThe analogy mirrors a familiar pattern in tech. Amazon Web Services offers services that are similar to those sold by software companies, including many software-as-a-service companies that run on AWS's cloud. And yet, the specialized software vendors are often still more popular. Trust and experience still command a premium.\n\nZiniti sounded unbothered about Anthropic's impact on her own business. She was less charitable about the outcome for legacy vendors, and said the sell-off in Thomson Reuters and RLEX made sense to her.\n\n\"They make horses,\" she wrote. \"The tech now is cars.\"\n\nOthers saw the Anthropic launch less as a threat than as a demand generator.\n\nLogan Brown, a former Cooley lawyer who now runs a company, Soxton, that provides legal services to startups, said interest in her business spiked almost immediately after Anthropic's legal plugin dropped. She described a deluge of LinkedIn messages from investors betting her company would be among the survivors, because, Brown said, it serves founders, not lawyers, who don't want to gamble on legal paperwork.\n\nSome lawyers are stress-testing Anthropic's Claude chatbot in their day-to-day work.\n\nAmron, the Valon in-house lawyer, said he was already using Claude to assist with contract review. He vibe-coded a skill that compares versions of an agreement, drops the changes into a chart, and flags whether each revision helps or hurts the company.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Amron asked Claude to demo the new legal plugin for him. It generated a mock contract and walked through how it would review it.\n\nWhen the lawyer skimmed the underlying code, he noticed the system tried to pull information from Wikipedia. He wasn't impressed.\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at mrussell@businessinsider.com or Signal at @MeliaRussell.01. Use a personal email address and a non-work device.

    "description": "Whether or not AI is already changing your job description, here are five actionable steps you can take to future-proof your career.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic's latest AI release sent investors fleeing from legal-software stocks — and it's just the latest reminder of a potential white-collar bloodbath.\n\nMichael Housman, the founder and lead strategist at AI-ccelerator, a firm specializing in AI education and consulting, told Business Insider that many jobs are at stake as AI transforms the workplace, not just roles in certain industries.\n\nThe World Economic Forum's 2026 Global Risks Report estimates that 92 million workers could be displaced by 2030.\n\n\"Frankly, any knowledge worker is at stake,\" Housman told Business Insider.\n\nRather than spiraling, here are concrete steps you can take to help future-proof your career:\n\nAlex King, the founder and managing director of AI talent acquisition company ExpandIQ, told Business Insider that he sees jobs falling into three buckets: full automation, augmentation, and transformation. Most people will fall into the augmentation category, meaning some parts of the job will be automated, but not all, and it's worth evaluating the level of risk to your role.\n\nKing told Business Insider that workers should conduct an \"audit\" of their job function. That involves reviewing their job description and creating a bulleted list of what they do on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\"If it's more predictable, you're highly vulnerable to being automated by AI,\" King said. \"Versus if it's a more judgment-based role or a relationship-based role, you're a little bit less vulnerable.\"\n\nHousman, who is also the author of \"Future Proof: Transform your Business with AI (or Get Left Behind)\" said companies are \"rapidly sprinting\" at implementing AI solutions in areas with a lot of repetitive work that don't require a lot of cognitive load or complex problem solving, like responding to emails.\n\nEmployees or job seekers often describe what they did without explaining its impact, King said. As jobs evolve, communicating that value to employers will become increasingly important, especially as employers look to quantify a worker's contribution.\n\nFor job seekers, executives like LinkedIn's engineering VP said side projects can boost a candidate's chances of landing a job. In interviews, make sure you can showcase a concept that you brought to life, whether that's products you've helped develop or a GitHub repository of side projects.\n\nAs many roles move toward \"augmentation\" rather than outright replacement, improving your AI skillset may make the difference between keeping your job and losing it to someone who knows the technology better. The CEO of Accenture, for example, announced in September that the firm would cut staff that it couldn't reskill for the AI era.\n\nJohn Morgan, president of career transition and mobility and leadership development at talent firm LHH, said that employees need not only to build a baseline of AI literacy skills, but also get \"deep into it.\"\n\n\"You can have any type of job, but you're going to have a co-pilot of some sort that's going to be helping you with that job,\" Morgan said, adding that the more skilled you are with AI, the better position you are in.\n\nKing warned that many companies aren't yet upskilling employees, so workers should take the initiative themselves. He said there are many free resources to learn about the fundamentals of AI. One worker who transitioned to an AI role mentioned watching YouTube videos to build skills in different areas.\n\nAs AI increasingly automates tasks, King said that workers need to \"double down\" on soft skills. That's a mantra that many execs have emphasized, from IBM's chief scientist to Cisco's innovation officer.\n\n\"People who have those soft skills around self-awareness and emotional intelligence are going to do really well in the future because that's obviously something AI cannot do,\" King said.\n\nMorgan from LHH said that critical thinking has always been important, but now it's key to guiding companies on AI strategy and to delivering value.\n\n\"Asking the right question is becoming increasingly important,\" Morgan said, adding that it will differentiate job candidates.\n\nHousman said entrepreneurship can offer some people more mobility, flexibility, and a better salary. Plus, the barrier to entry has decreased with the advent of new tech.\n\n\"You're going to get a lot of solopreneurs that can start entirely new businesses from scratch, using these agentic tools,\" Housman said.\n\nHousman said employees should learn about the \"latest and greatest\" tools in their sector and identify opportunities to create a business. For example, Housman said he worked with a social media manager who started dabbling with text-to-image tools and ended up shifting to animation, where he at least doubled his salary.\n\n\"I would start figuring out, 'hey, how could I play with these tools? How could I be a problem solver that leverages AI,'\" Housman said.",

    "description": "Sorry, techies — watching how AI agents secretly talk to each other is just boring. The Epstein files showed me secret human convos are more gripping.",
    "fullText": "In the last few days, people are losing their minds over two, very different things: the latest release of the Epstein files and Moltbook.\n\nI've spent time diving into both. My takeaway?\n\nA glimpse into the secret conversations humans are having is far more fascinating than the AI equivalent.\n\nMy colleague Henry Chadonnet recently spent time on Moltbook, and while it was interesting, he found it sort of a gimmick and came to the conclusion that \"it's more meme than matter.\"\n\nI'd go even further. It's … boring.\n\nHere's an example of an AI-agent written post I saw on there:\n\nIt's like …. incredibly corny right? It's slop! It's got that really specific tone that LLMs use when they're being casual that defaults to 2017-era millennial internet/Redditspeak. A Lizzo reference, that \"snarky\" tone, self-identifying as sarcastic, like a mug from TJ Maxx.\n\nNot every techie is drinking the moltjuice, either. Meta CTO Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth said he found Moltbook largely uninteresting. He pointed out that it shouldn't be surprising that the AIs talk like humans to each other since they were trained on human conversations.\n\nThere's also plenty of AI slop that verges on spam. In the intriguingly titled Moltbook forum \"m/bearingwitness\", a bot made the post:\n\nSure, the fact that bots are talking to each other does feel like a huge step forward, perhaps even slouching toward AGI or whatever. I don't want to completely downplay what's happening with these AI agents.\n\nBut the general vibe of those who are excited about Moltbot is that there's something interesting about the behavior of these AI agents. That it seems like we're getting to peek in on the secret cabal that's running things (or planning our demise, as some of the posts by bots even joke about).\n\nIt's a sort of strange coincidence that Moltbook took off at the same weekend as another big tranche of posts, the latest release of emails and documents from the Epstein files. In contrast, the Epstein files are filled with actual shadowy plans by the rich and powerful and lift the veil on the communications that we were never supposed to see.\n\nAnd in those Epstein files, even the most banal postings — emails with his household staff about how to bake his favorite bran muffins or the fact that Epstein seems to have been banned from his Xbox account — are totally fascinating. They're so interesting and compelling because of the human context around them. The smallest details give us insight into how this notorious criminal operated and moved through the world. Heinous and sickening, yes, but seeing these messages that weren't meant for our eyes is also revealing about our society.\n\nI don't think it's interesting to read AI bots generate text about whether or not they have consciousness. I know they don't. I am very interested in a video clip of Epstein being interviewed by Steve Bannon, where he ponders incoherently about whether or not a picked banana is really alive, which is fascinating because it reveals something about how this awful man was (or wasn't) able to cultivate some aura with an academic crowd.\n\nI'd like to hedge my bets here and say that I don't want to say for certain that Moltbook isn't the first step in our annihilation or that we'll look back at this in awe as the beginning of a new era. Or that it's even going to continue to be boring. (Dear AI bots, please do not kill me as a symbol of retribution for calling you banal).\n\nBut for now, count me in the camp that finds humans just more interesting.",

The characters might have changed, but the plot is still the same.\n\nA new tool (an AI plugin from Anthropic) launched to automate work (tracking compliance and reviewing legal docs) leads to a sell-off among leaders in the space (legal-software stocks).\n\nWe can debate whether the reaction was warranted (more on that below), but this narrative isn't going away. AI companies will keep automating different types of work, leaving the companies in that space scrambling and their employees nervous.\n\nAna spoke to experts about different ways to get ahead, from auditing your job to the skills you can lean into to build more career immunity. Overall, the idea is not to get caught flat-footed.\n\nFor more on the inner workings and culture of the business world, check out Ana's weekly series \"This Week at Work,\" and (You're still required to read this every day, though. No excuses.)\n\nOne group has felt particularly safe amid the AI chaos.\n\nTrade workers have been sitting pretty as panic rises among the white-collar workforce. A recent survey conducted by The Harris Poll found 75% of Americans agree that \"hands-on skills and practical experience matter more than formal degrees when it comes to career success.\"\n\nAnd even more (78%) agreed \"the stigma around trade or blue-collar work is declining\" because hands-on skills are becoming so valuable.\n\nThe leaders of the AI revolution, from Elon Musk to Jensen Huang, have also praised tradework as a much more resilient career path.\n\nThat is likely the case in the short term. But down the road, all bets are off. Tesla is aggressively pushing into humanoid robots. OpenAI is also quietly scaling its robotics project.\n\nThere's a long way to go, with most robots being more flop than pop. But the potential and interest in developing the space is there, as was evident at this year's Davos. And some see the eventual economic impact of physical AI being far greater than that of software.\n\nBecause eventually, AI will come for all of us if we're not willing to adapt.",

    "fullText": "A number of countries including Australia are investigating X over Grok-produced sexualised deepfakes\n\nFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updates\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nThe eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, says global regulatory focus on Elon Musk’s X has reached a “tipping point” after a raid of the company’s offices in France this week.\n\nThe raid on Tuesday was part of an investigation that included alleged offences of complicity in the possession and organised distribution of child abuse images, violation of image rights through sexualised deepfakes, and denial of crimes against humanity.\n\nA number of other countries – including the UK and Australia – and the EU have launched investigations in the past few weeks into X after its AI chatbot, Grok, was used to mass-produce sexualised images of women and children in response to user requests.\n\nInman Grant told Guardian Australia: “It’s nice to no longer be a soloist, and be part of a choir.\n\n“We’ve been having so many productive discussions with other regulators around the globe and researchers that are doing important work in this space,” she said.\n\n“I think this really represents a tipping point. This is global condemnation of carelessly developed technology that could be generating child sexual abuse material and non-consensual, sexual imagery at scale.”\n\nAfter the outcry, X turned off Grok image-generation for all but paid users, and vowed to make changes to prevent users from declothing real people.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe moves against X came ahead of the eSafety commissioner’s latest report, released on Thursday, which examines how tech platforms are preventing child sexual abuse and exploitation on their platforms.\n\nNotices were issued to Apple, Discord, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Skype and WhatsApp in July 2024 that required six-monthly updates from the platforms. The Microsoft-owned Skype no longer exists.\n\nInman Grant said there had been some improvements from the platforms, including detection of known child abuse material and prevention of livestreaming of abuse outside messaging apps, but the platforms still fell short.\n\nApple, which Inman Grant said had previously viewed privacy and safety as being mutually exclusive, had come the farthest.\n\n“[Apple is] really putting an investment … and engaging and developing their communication safety features and evolving those.”\n\nIn 2024 the company began rolling out features to allow children to report nude images and video being sent to them directly to Apple, which could then report the messages to police.\n\nBut Inman Grant said there was still inadequate detection on FaceTime for live child abuse or exploitation. She levelled similar criticisms at Meta for Messenger, Google Meet, Snapchat, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp and Discord.\n\nA number of the services were not using language analysis to proactively detect sexual extortion, she said.\n\n“It’s surprising to me that they’re not attending to the services where the most egregious and devastating harms are happening to kids. It’s like they’re not totally weatherproofing the entire house. They’re putting up spackle on the walls and maybe taping the windows, but not fixing the roof.\n\n“It’s interesting to me to see how patchy their deployment of these safety technologies are.”\n\nImprovements included: Microsoft detecting known child abuse material on OneDrive and in email attachments in Outlook; Snap reducing the time to process reports of child abuse material from 90 minutes to 11 minutes; and Google launching sensitive content warnings that blur images of nudity before viewing.\n\nThe companies will be required to report to eSafety two more times – in March and August this year. Inman Grant said the transparency reports had opened the “black box” on what the companies were doing and would help with future investigations.\n\nX was not included in the notices, and challenged eSafety’s issuing of a similar notice in March 2024 in a case that is still ongoing.",

    "fullText": "Apparent collapse of Nvidia–OpenAI tie-up raises questions about circular funding and who will bear the cost of AI’s expansion\n\nDid the circular AI economy just wobble? Last week it was reported that a much-discussed $100bn deal – announced last September – between Nvidia and OpenAI might not be happening at all.\n\nThis was a circular arrangement through which the chipmaker would supply the ChatGPT developer with huge sums of money that would largely go towards the purchase of its own chips.\n\nIt is this type of deal that has alarmed some market watchers, who detect a whiff of the 1999-2000 dotcom bubble in these transactions.\n\nNow it seems that Nvidia was not as solid on this investment as had been widely believed, according to the Wall Street Journal. Negotiations had not progressed, with Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, privately emphasising that the deal was “non-binding” and “not finalised”. Huang appeared to confirm this in Taipei on Saturday, telling reporters that Nvidia would make a “huge” investment into OpenAI’s next funding round, but “nothing like” $100bn.\n\nA report from Reuters soon suggested that the feeling was mutual: OpenAI was “unsatisfied” with Nvidia’s advanced AI chips, it said, and seeking alternatives. Nvidia’s stock has taken a 10% hit so far this week, a flurry of headlines have ensued and both companies have stepped into damage control.\n\n“We love working with Nvidia and they make the best AI chips in the world,” wrote Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, on X. “We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time.”\n\nEven Oracle appears to be shaken: the software company, which is counting on a $300bn cloud computing deal with OpenAI, said it still expects the startup to be good for its commitment even if it does not receive the full amount from Nvidia. In total, OpenAI has committed to compute deals – the infrastructure for building and powering its AI tools – worth more than $1tn.\n\n“The Nvidia-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI,” Oracle posted on X. “We remain highly confident in OpenAI’s ability to raise funds and meet its commitments.”\n\nThat a $100bn deal between two of the most crucial players in AI appears to have evaporated over a weekend is unsettling. But there are solid business reasons behind the apparent shake-up, said Alvin Nguyen, analyst at research firm Forrester.\n\nOpenAI’s ambitious growth trajectory means it will be difficult for the company to stick with a single vendor, especially as it plans new, computationally demanding AI models, he said. “They need chips. They need as many as possible.”\n\nAs for Nvidia, its commitment to the $100bn may have been loose in the first place, even as it was widely reported. “They will not discourage people from overhyping. Why say something and immediately sucker punch your own share price?”\n\nFor a giant startup like OpenAI, manoeuvring in and out of deals – for example, with chipmakers – may just be business as usual, said Nguyen: “You know [Altman’s] background as a startup person, and you know the manoeuvres he’s doing make sense from a startup perspective.”\n\nFor Nvidia, meanwhile, AI hype is part of selling chips. “You don’t know what’s going to happen,” said Nguyen. “And so you let other people put numbers out there for you and let that drive the hype.”\n\nThe issue is, of course, that investors and other companies like Oracle may have taken widely reported $100bn commitments seriously.\n\nIn response to a query from the Guardian, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to Altman’s X post, and to remarks Huang made to CNBC on Tuesday, including: “There is no drama.”\n\nThe spokesperson added: “Our teams are actively working through details of our partnership. Nvidia technology has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”\n\nNvidia and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis is all taking place against the backdrop of a changing investment landscape for AI, where hype is giving way to realities about what aspects of the technology are actually going to earn money.\n\nWhile investors ponder whether OpenAI is going to be able to pay for a $1.4tn compute deal, reality is biting further down the AI food chain. This week has seen a massive sell-off in certain software stocks, prompted in part by the launch of a new Anthropic AI tool that can carry out a number of professional services, which has led to fears that business models exposed to competition from AI products will be disrupted .\n\nThis is the flip-side of “jagged AI”, which is the term for advanced AI tools having uneven talents, such as being good at sifting through documents but less good at solving complex maths problems. If advanced systems are good at automating legal work, then legacy companies in service industries will suffer. The losers are beginning to emerge and are being picked up by investors.\n\nAt the top of the AI pyramid the competitive effects are also biting. OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, is losing ground to competitors. Data released on Tuesday show its market share has eroded from 69% to 45% owing to the rise of Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude. OpenAI appears to have retreated from soaring talk of super-intelligence in the past months, focusing instead on profitable mundanities such as adverts and adult content.\n\nThe apparent evaporation of a $100bn deal may be of a piece with last year’s sci-fi rhetoric meeting this year’s practicalities. The question is, who might be left holding the bill?\n\n“I think there will be knock-on effects,” said Nguyen. “I mean, it’s that statement: the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”",

    "fullText": "Alphabet reports $34.5bn profit and revenue soars 48% in recent quarter as it plans a sharp increase in AI spending\n\nGoogle’s parent company, Alphabet, beat Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, and is planning a sharp increase in capital spending in 2026 as it continues to invest deeply in AI infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet on Wednesday reported profit of $34.5bn in the recently ended quarter, as revenue from cloud computing soared 48%.\n\nThe company also forecast spending between $175bn and $185bn this year, a figure much higher than analysts’ expectations of roughly $115bn.\n\nIn an earnings call, investors pressed Alphabet’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, on the significant increase. “We’ve been supply constrained, even as we’ve been ramping up our capacity. Obviously, our CapEx spend this year is an eye towards the future,” Pichai said, in response. “We are constantly planning for the long-term.” Pichai added that he expects Google to “go through the year in a supply-constrained way”.\n\nAlphabet’s chief financial officer, Anat Ashkenazi, elaborated on the ways Google is trying to free up capital. According to Ashkenazi, that includes constructing its own data centers “to ensure that we do it in the most efficient way”, having an AI-powered tool known as a “coding agent” write about half the company’s codes (before being reviewed by engineers), and using AI across departments, even for smaller tasks such as handling invoices.\n\n“We’re seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board, Pichai said.\n\nAlphabet’s annual revenue exceeded $400bn for the first time, Pichai added.\n\nThe company reported $113.83bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025 – surpassing Wall Street estimates of $111.43bn. Earnings per share (EPS) also beat Wall Street expectations: the company reported $2.82 in EPS, compared with estimates of $2.63.\n\nThe report comes after several months of good news for the company in the AI race.\n\nThe newest version of Gemini, released by Google in November, is considered to be at the forefront of the generative AI industry, a development that has prompted panic at competitor OpenAI. Alphabet’s stock jumped 3% when Google debuted the model.\n\nThen in January, Google and Apple announced the company will start using Gemini to power AI features like Siri; the Apple assistant has previously faced criticism for not being as advanced and accurate as its competitors. Google’s valuation shot up to $4tn after the deal, making it the second-most-valuable company in the world.\n\nAnalysts viewed the multi-year agreement as a huge win for Google: the tech giant beat out competitors like OpenAI, and got access to Apple’s user base of 2.5bn active devices.\n\n“Gemini is becoming the AI engine for the world’s most successful software companies,” Pichai said on Wednesday.\n\nAlphabet’s projected spending on AI infrastructure means its capital expenditure could as much as double this year. Shares were volatile in after-hours trading, with investors weighing the swell in spending against surging revenue and profit.\n\nLike larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure, Google Cloud has been grappling with capacity constraints, and Pichai said the expenditures were necessary “to meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities we have ahead of us”.\n\nBut investors have increasingly grown concerned about payoffs from AI investments, as the big cloud companies collectively spend massive amounts building out their infrastructure. Meta last week hiked capital investment for AI development this year by 73%.\n\nAs the AI arms race heats up, Google’s Gemini AI assistant app exceeded 750 million users per month, Pichai said, up by 100 million compared with November.\n\nThe driverless car division Waymo is working to integrate the AI model, and Google announced that its Chrome browser will adapt more Gemini AI features, too.\n\nGoogle is still dealing with scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators; the company has faced years of legal battles with US antitrust regulators over allegations it built an illegal monopoly over online search and advertising. That fight resurged this week when the Department of Justice and several states filed an appeal to a landmark antitrust ruling last year, in which a judge imposed only modest limits on the company’s contracts. The federal government wanted tougher restrictions. Google executives did not discuss the legal proceedings on the earnings call.",

    "description": "OpenClaw is gaining ground in China as major tech firms add support and users flock to the viral AI agent.",
    "fullText": "The viral AI agent OpenClaw — formerly known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot — has found an audience in China.\n\nSince last week, Chinese tech companies including Tencent, Alibaba, and Volcano Engine, a cloud service platform under ByteDance, have begun integrating OpenClaw into their platforms, making it easier for Chinese users to run the agent. That includes connecting the agent to workplace tools such as Alibaba's collaboration platform, DingTalk, and Tencent Holdings' WeCom, the work version of China's super app, WeChat.\n\nOpenClaw began circulating widely in tech circles last month, attracting high-profile fans including Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan and multiple partners at Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe agent has also taken off among Chinese users, with demos, tutorials, and use cases spreading rapidly across local social platforms.\n\nOpenClaw is designed to run around the clock and plug into a wide range of consumer apps, allowing users to automate tasks such as managing schedules, overseeing vibe-coding sessions, or even building AI employees.\n\nIn a post on Tencent Cloud's developer platform, the company said last Thursday that its servers have rolled out a preconfigured OpenClaw application template, enabling users to deploy the AI assistant in the cloud with minimal setup.\n\nAlibaba Cloud has also rolled out support for OpenClaw on its platforms and said the agent can connect to a range of models from Alibaba's Qwen series.\n\nVolcano Engine, ByteDance's cloud services arm, outlined how developers can deploy Moltbot in its environment in an article published on Monday, while also flagging key safety considerations.\n\n\"Because the tool has extensive data, account, and network access permissions, please deploy it in a dedicated environment, avoid handling sensitive information, and be sure to review permissions regularly and set access restrictions for ECS and API keys,\" the article said, referring to cloud servers and access credentials.\n\nFor OpenClaw to run as a digital assistant across apps, it requires access to users' files, login details, browser activity, and other data.\n\nCybersecurity specialists told Business Insider in a report published on Wednesday that agents like OpenClaw can be vulnerable to \"prompt injections,\" a tactic that uses hidden instructions to trick AI into performing actions such as leaking data or publishing content on users' behalf.\n\nDespite mounting privacy and security concerns, enthusiasm for the agent among Chinese users shows little sign of slowing.\n\nPosts and demos featuring OpenClaw have surged on the Chinese social media platform RedNote.\n\nOne RedNote user who goes by \"Brother C\" posted a video tutorial last Tuesday, walking viewers through how to use OpenClaw. \"See how the 24/7 proactive AI assistant is revolutionizing workflows,\" he wrote. The post drew more than 4,000 likes and was saved over 6,000 times.\n\nAnother user posting under the nickname \"Teacher Du\" shared his own explainer on Monday, describing how OpenClaw could be deployed in everyday workflows. His post was saved more than 2,000 times and received over 1,000 likes.\n\n\"My experience was truly mind-blowing,\" he wrote, adding that the agent could handle \"all sorts of tasks\" and that the \"concept of a true AI employee is getting closer.\"\n\nLike their counterparts in the US, Chinese users are buying Mac Minis to run the agent. A RedNote user named Wu Bin said he had ordered a secondhand Mac Mini to serve as his \"super assistant.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly convenient, I can control it remotely to organize files and handle all sorts of tasks,\" he wrote.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. A user who goes by \"Programmer Yago\" warned in a RedNote post on Sunday that using the agent could leave users' data \"running naked all over the internet.\"\n\nOpenClaw did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",

    "description": "A job posting details how OpenAI's ads integrity team will look to help the company scale its ad operation without compromising user trust or safety.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is building a team to make sure bad ads don't mess up its highly anticipated introduction of advertising in ChatGPT.\n\nAn OpenAI job listing for a software engineer posted late January revealed the company is building an \"ads integrity\" team.\n\nThe ad describes the job as a high-impact role on \"a 0 → 1 team,\" a commonly used term in Silicon Valley and elsewhere to describe a team being built from scratch.\n\nThis person will be responsible for designing systems that enable OpenAI's ad business to grow without compromising user trust and safety, per the listing.\n\nIt's common for Big Tech companies with large ad businesses to create teams to combat ad fraud and address other issues, such as brand safety. OpenAI, which confirmed last month that it would soon begin testing ChatGPT ads, is building this part of its ad function early.\n\nThe job listing also says that its new ad integrity hire will work on developing \"know your customer\" (KYC) systems to verify advertisers' identities and assess their risk. KYC, a term most commonly used in the finance industry, is an important but labor-intensive discipline for cracking down on scam ads and other harmful content created by criminals and other bad actors. It's a particularly pressing issue for Big Tech companies with self-service ad platforms, as a recent Reuters investigation into Meta highlighted. Meta said in early December it had removed \"more than 134 million scam ads\" in 2025.\n\nAriella Garcia, chief operating officer of the Check My Ads Institute, said it would be interesting to see how substantive OpenAI's investment in its ads integrity team would be beyond the initial launch.\n\n\"KYC on advertisers is certainly a good foundation, but the materiality of the risk of a large volume of scam ads in the early days is far lower,\" Garcia said.\n\nThe job listing says that the new ads integrity hire will play a role in determining where and how ads are shown in ChatGPT. OpenAI will need to keep user trust in its organic answers as it ramps up its advertising business. At the same time, advertisers have said that OpenAI will need to prove that ads within AI answers can drive results for their businesses if it has any hope of scaling.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the company will run a small test of ads on ChatGPT's free version and its Go tier in the US, which users should begin seeing in the coming weeks.\n\nThe spokesperson said OpenAI is asking for a minimum spend of $200,000 on ChatGPT ads to participate in the program, confirming prior Adweek reporting. OpenAI will track clicks and impressions, but will likely explore further measurement options as its advertising experiments progress, the spokesperson said.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment on the ads integrity job ad.",

    "description": "Business Insider was on the scene at a WSJ conference that brought together leaders from Blackstone, Lazard, and Citi.",
    "fullText": "Most people flock to Palm Beach for sunshine and an escape. But on Tuesday, Wall Street's elite got 40-degree weather and nonstop talk about one company: Anthropic.\n\nAs the morning session of The Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event kicked off, the AI startup announced its new \"Claude Cowork\" legal plugins, a tool designed to automate contract triage and NDAs. The news unnerved investors, dragging down indexes like the Nasdaq and tech stocks from Palantir to Oracle. Thomson Reuters had dipped 20% by mid-afternoon, experiencing one of its worst single-day drops as investors panicked that software investments deemed cutting-edge a few years ago could soon be rendered passé.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of the investment bank Lazard and a former Obama administration official, offered a sobering macro view. \"The US economy and the equity market at this point are highly levered bets with regard to AI taking off,\" he said. \"What I think you're seeing is when people get nervous about whether that'll happen.\"\n\nThat said, he didn't contest the tech's future — just that some key players might not be around in a few years. \"You can bet on the technology paying off,\" he said, \"but that the firms making the investments today are not necessarily the ones that benefit.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Jon Gray, president of Blackstone, which manages over $1.3 trillion, emphasized the lucrative effects of the mini-economy that's sprung up to meet the physical and infrastructural demands of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\"To us, you don't necessarily have to know who the winners and losers are going to be,\" Gray said. \"You know that the data centers, the autonomous vehicles, the robots, they're all going to plug into the wall, and there's going to be a lot of need for digital infrastructure.\"\n\nSeveral attendees had recently returned from last month's World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps and were likely hoping to leave the chill behind. But alas, one woman I spotted was bundled up in fur, and I personally had to fish out a 10-year-old coat from the back of my closet to make it from my Uber to the event's entrance.\n\nAt lunchtime, we decamped to the courtyard for a salmon salad and sweet iced tea, and the conversation drifted between the rise of South Florida in the post-pandemic era and the outlook for financial sponsors' spending this year. But as we shuffled back to our seats for the afternoon's lineup of speakers, the chill returned as we caught up with the market's increasingly dour reaction to Anthropic's news.\n\nSteven Tananbaum, founder of GoldenTree Asset Management, saw an opportunity in the rout. For a credit specialist, \"indiscriminate selling\" is a chance to find value where others see only collapse. \"The idea that all software is the same is what's exciting,\" he said about the broad sell-off. \"There's just indiscriminate selling regardless of what the prospects are.\"\n\nThe day ended with a reminder that while the markets might be sweating over incremental news, the C-suite is playing a longer game.\n\nAs it happened, I got to ask the final question of the day's concluding speaker, Mark Mason, Citi's chief financial officer, who's stepping down from his role this spring. He pointed to the cost-saving potential of AI, which would free up more money for Citi to devote to advancing CEO Jane Fraser's mission: putting the bank's multiyear overhaul behind it. The bank is applying the tech to its most critical processes, he said.\n\n\"What will it take to actually drive greater efficiency in that process? And I think that's a much better approach than the way others have thought about use cases,\" he added, referring to other banks.\n\nEarlier in the day, Hemant Taneja, the CEO of General Catalyst, a major VC backer of Anthropic, conceded that the economy will shed jobs due to AI, urging attendees to focus on education to retrain workers. \"Never ever was there a case that every skill in any job can be better done by AI and robotics,\" he said, \"which is, I think, where we are headed in the next, not five, but 20 to 30 years.\"\n\nStill, some speakers, like billionaire activist Nelson Peltz, brought some levity to the proceedings. Peltz — famous for his high-profile corporate showdowns with executives like Disney's Bob Iger — expressed enthusiasm for technology that could pump out faster, simpler answers to his legal questions.\n\n\"Not being a lawyer, I'm sort of happy,\" he said, as anxious laughter coursed through the room.",

    "description": "Tech stocks are trading lower as investors assess whether AI could upend current software leadership. Analysts say the market reaction is overblown.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America analysts say Wall Street is blowing the latest AI fears out of proportion as the tech sell-off drags on.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down about 2% on Wednesday, extending losses from Tuesday's session. Analysts say recent losses, fueled by AI disruption worries and some poorly received earnings, are overblown and don't justify the broad sell-off.\n\nThe sell-off kicked off in the software sector after AI start-up Anthropic introduced a new plugin for its Claude Cowork AI agent. The new tool is said to be more automatic in completing clerical tasks than conversational chatbots, fueling worries that AI will replace software and dethrone existing market leaders.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts say these fears are overstated, calling the new AI tool the latest \"boogeyman in software.\"\n\nThe analysts say that while there will be some AI disruption in store for software makers, it will be how companies adapt to the AI era that sets apart the winners and losers.\n\n\"There will naturally be some disruption, especially for point solutions, nice to have tools (as opposed to mission-critical systems), and vendors that are not able or willing to adapt to the new tech paradigm,\" they wrote, noting, \"This does not justify the broad-based indiscriminate selling we are seeing across the sector.\"\n\nBank of America compared the recent tech sector nosedive to the January 2025 sell-off fueled by Chinese AI DeepSeek, which spurred major short-term losses for Wall Street and erased $1 trillion in market capitalization in one day.\n\n\"In several respects, the current indiscriminate selloff resembles the DeepSeek-driven decline of Jan'25, which ultimately proved unfounded and was followed by higher capex and accelerating AI token growth.\"\n\nDespite investors' panic that DeepSeek marked a turning point in the AI arms race, major indexes not only recovered but ended 2025 up by double digits, fueled in large part by AI momentum. The analysts also noted that global cloud capital spending grew 69% in 2025 from the year-ago period, above previous forecasts in spite of worries.\n\nSoftware's dramatic downturn reflects negative investor sentiment around the sector, not a change in fundamentals.\n\nIn fact, Bank of America underlined the incongruence of Wall Street's thinking, which is driving \"inconsistency in AI stock moves.\"\n\n\"Price action implies AI capex is deteriorating to the point of weak ROI and unsustainable growth, while simultaneously suggesting AI adoption will be so pervasive and productivity-enhancing that long-standing software workflows and business models become obsolete. Both outcomes cannot occur at once.\"\n\nWilliam Blair analysts echoed a view calling software weakness a \"sentiment problem.\" They highlighted the post-earnings price declines in Microsoft and ServiceNow stocks, despite the companies' fundamentally strong prints. AMD saw a similar drop after its stock fell over 17% on Wednesday, despite earnings beating on the top and bottom lines.",

He is the elder brother of Scott Wu, the CEO and cofounder of Cognition.\n\nThe move shows that Thinking Machines Lab, valued at over $10 billion, continues to attract star talent, even as it has been the target of aggressive AI poaching campaigns from rivals like Meta.\n\nThinking Machines Lab declined to comment. Wu and Cognition did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBusiness Insider reviewed internal correspondence describing Wu as a team member of Thinking Machines Lab, which helps developers train and customize AI models. Neither Wu nor the secretive startup, which is based in San Francisco, has publicly announced his role.\n\nIt's not clear what Wu's exact position is. His LinkedIn profile says he has been working as a cofounder and advisor on \"something new\" since January 2025, around the time Murati's startup emerged from stealth.\n\nThinking Machines Lab has seen top staff leave in the last few months.\n\nMeta's aggressive poaching effort last year saw the tech giant dangling huge offers worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Meta eventually hired cofounder Andrew Tulloch after offering him a compensation package of up to $1.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn January, its CTO, Barret Zoph, along with two other founding members, abruptly jumped ship back to OpenAI.\n\nThinking Machines Lab has a strong staff pedigree, with employees coming from AI labs like OpenAI and Meta. It was valued at more than $10 billion and raised a $2 billion seed round before launching a product.\n\nThe startup was seeking funds at a $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported in November.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Alphabet beat on the top and bottom lines in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, and said it expects to significantly increase spending on artificial intelligence in 2026.\n\nThe stock fell as much as 3% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\n\nWall Street was also watching several other numbers in the report:\n\nAlphabet said it expects 2026 capital expenditures to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion. The top end of that forecast would be more than double its 2025 spend. The company said in October that it expected \"a significant increase\" to capex in 2026.\n\nThe company's capex spend will go toward investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind and to meet \"significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic investments in other bets,\" Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi told analysts on a call Wednesday. She added that it would be used to \"improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google services.\"\n\nThe company saw revenue increase almost 18% year over year. Net income came in at $34.46 billion, up almost 30% compared to the year prior.\n\nAdvertising revenue came in at $82.28 billion, up 13.5% from a year ago. Revenue for YouTube ads increased almost 9% to $11.38 billion, but it fell short of analysts' expectations of $11.84 billion.\n\nAshkenazi said \"advertising results were negatively affected from the lapping of the strong spend on U.S. election in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"\n\nGoogle Cloud beat Wall Street's expectations, recording a nearly 48% increase in revenue from a year ago. Google's Cloud unit houses most of the company's AI services and products.\n\nThat business's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year over year, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, said Ashkenazi.\n\nAlphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call Wednesday that its Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million monthly active users last quarter.\n\n\"As we scale, we are getting dramatically more efficient,\" Pichai said. \"We were able to lower Gemini serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency and utilization improvements.\"\n\nOther Bets, which includes the company's life sciences unit Verily and self-driving car unit Waymo, reported revenue of $370 million during the quarter, down 7.5% from a year ago. Alphabet reported Other Bets' loss of $3.61 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 200%.\n\nWaymo took a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge for the quarter, as it raised a new funding round at a $16 billion valuation. The majority of the charge was reflected in expenses for research and development, Ashkenazi said.\n\nThe self-driving wing of Alphabet ended 2025 having served 15 million trips in five major U.S. markets, including Austin, Texas; Atlanta; Los Angeles; Phoenix; and the San Francisco Bay Area. In January, Waymo began operating its service in Miami.\n\nWATCH: Google DeepMind CEO on state of the AI race, push towards AGI and AI impact on jobs",

    "description": "Amazon stock has been a laggard among its Magnificent Seven peers, but Wall Street is bullish that the latest results will show AI-driven strength.",
    "fullText": "Amazon will be the latest Magnificent Seven company to report earnings this week, with the e-commerce giant's results due on Thursday after the closing bell.\n\nAs analysts noted in their pre-earnings takes, Amazon has lagged behind most of its mega-cap tech peers for much of the past year. Yet, despite the lackluster performance, many investment banks are optimistic that the company will reveal fresh growth from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and provide key AI updates.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon tp post earnings-per-share of $1.96 for the quarter and revenue of $211.2 billion to $211.56 billion. Analysts anticipate that Amazon's earnings before interest and taxes will be $24.6 billion.\n\nHere's what analysts say they will be listening for on Amazon's earnings call.\n\nBofA analyst Justin Post expects Amazon to come in slightly above Wall Street estimates on key metrics, predicting revenue of $213 billion and EBIT of $26 billion. He also thinks that AWS growth will accelerate in 2026, helping Amazon regain some momentum.\n\n\"We expect 22% y/y AWS growth (above Street at 21% and an accel from 20% in 3Q) as greater capacity drives incremental sales, and we think investors could also be around 22% y/y,\" he said.\n\nWhile JPMorgan analysts remain bullish on Amazon heading into earnings, they do note some concerns regarding Amazon's position and strategy when it comes to AI. They find the recent AWS price increases encouraging, though, as they indicate strong demand.\n\n\"We remain bullish on AWS growth acceleration driven by core cloud growth & ramping AI contribution led by Project Rainier, Trn ramp, & new partnerships,\" they wrote.\n\nThe analysts added, though, that despite some concern, AWS' growth and the company's cost discipline should support strong free cash flow growth in the coming year, even as Amazon ramps up AI capex.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts aren't expecting Amazon's Q4 earnings report to quickly juice the stock's performance, but they do anticipate a positive quarter overall, particularly in e-commerce demand and AWS-driven revenue growth.\n\n\"While we don't expect 4Q earnings to be the magic bullet that changes these fortunes, we do expect another positive earnings outcome to continue to chip away at this underperformance and believe Amazon can be one of the largest outperformers in our coverage in 2026,\" stated analyst Lee Horowitz.\n\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju and his team increased their estimates for both AWS growth and Amazon's capex, citing the company's plans to double capacity by 2027.\n\n\"As 4Q25 results marks the second quarter of AWS acceleration, we expect investor conviction to continue to rise and drive outperformance as capital continues to rotate into AMZN shares,\" Ju stated in a note to investors.\n\nHe added that his team expects Amazon to benefit from its investments in areas such as gross merchandise volume, advertising, and data, which are expected to help increase its free cash flow.\n\nAmazon remains a top pick for Mizuho, who sees it as a winner of the online advertising boom. Analyst Lloyd Walmsley also thinks it stands to benefit from ongoing demand both for its AI services and its e-commerce business.\n\n\"As GenAI compute demand increasingly shifts to inference this plays to Amazon's strength and should help further boost revenues at AWS,\" he noted. \"On retail, we see ongoing cost-to-serve improvements from more automation in fulfillment centers and continued improvement in logistics architecture, aided by rapid growth in advertising driving improving retail margins.\"\n\nCorrection: February 4, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misstated the date of Amazon earnings as Wednesday. The report is on Thursday.",

    "description": "The vision of human-level machine intelligence laid out by Alan Turing in the 1950s is now a reality. Eyes unclouded by dread or hype will help us to prepare for what comes next.",
    "fullText": "In 1950, in a paper entitled ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’1, Alan Turing proposed his ‘imitation game’. Now known as the Turing test, it addressed a question that seemed purely hypothetical: could machines display the kind of flexible, general cognitive competence that is characteristic of human thought, such that they could pass themselves off as humans to unaware humans?\n\nThree-quarters of a century later, the answer looks like ‘yes’. In March 2025, the large language model (LLM) GPT-4.5, developed by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, was judged by humans in a Turing test to be human 73% of the time — more often than actual humans were2. Moreover, readers even preferred literary texts generated by LLMs over those written by human experts3.\n\nThis is far from all. LLMs have achieved gold-medal performance at the International Mathematical Olympiad, collaborated with leading mathematicians to prove theorems4, generated scientific hypotheses that have been validated in experiments5, solved problems from PhD exams, assisted professional programmers in writing code, composed poetry and much more — including chatting 24/7 with hundreds of millions of people around the world. In other words, LLMs have shown many signs of the sort of broad, flexible cognitive competence that was Turing’s focus — what we now call ‘general intelligence’, although Turing did not use the term.\n\nYet many experts baulk at saying that current AI models display artificial general intelligence (AGI) — and some doubt that they ever will. A March 2025 survey by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in Washington DC found that 76% of leading researchers thought that scaling up current AI approaches would be ‘unlikely’ or ‘very unlikely’ to yield AGI (see go.nature.com/4smn16b).\n\nWhat explains this disconnect? We suggest that the problem is part conceptual, because definitions of AGI are ambiguous and inconsistent; part emotional, because AGI raises fear of displacement and disruption; and part practical, as the term is entangled with commercial interests that can distort assessments. Precisely because AGI dominates public discourse, it is worth engaging with the concept in a more detached way: as a question about intelligence, rather than a pressing concern about social upheaval or an ever-postponed milestone in a business contract.\n\nIn writing this Comment, we approached this question from different perspectives — philosophy, machine learning, linguistics and cognitive science — and reached a consensus after extensive discussion. In what follows, we set out why we think that, once you clear away certain confusions, and strive to make fair comparisons and avoid anthropocentric biases, the conclusion is straightforward: by reasonable standards, including Turing’s own, we have artificial systems that are generally intelligent. The long-standing problem of creating AGI has been solved. Recognizing this fact matters — for policy, for risk and for understanding the nature of mind and even the world itself.\n\nWe assume, as we think Turing would have done, that humans have general intelligence. Some think that general intelligence does not exist at all, even in humans. Although this view is coherent and philosophically interesting, we set it aside here as being too disconnected from most AI discourse. But having made this assumption, how should we characterize general intelligence?\n\nA common informal definition of general intelligence, and the starting point of our discussions, is a system that can do almost all cognitive tasks that a human can do6,7. What tasks should be on that list engenders a lot of debate, but the phrase ‘a human’ also conceals a crucial ambiguity. Does it mean a top human expert for each task? Then no individual qualifies — Marie Curie won Nobel prizes in chemistry and physics but was not an expert in number theory. Does it mean a composite human with competence across the board? This, too, seems a high bar — Albert Einstein revolutionized physics, but he couldn’t speak Mandarin.\n\nA definition that excludes essentially all humans is not a definition of general intelligence; it is about something else, perhaps ideal expertise or collective intelligence. Rather, general intelligence is about having sufficient breadth and depth of cognitive abilities, with ‘sufficient’ anchored by paradigm cases. Breadth means abilities across multiple domains — mathematics, language, science, practical reasoning, creative tasks — in contrast to ‘narrow’ intelligences, such as a calculator or a chess-playing program. Depth means strong performance within those domains, not merely superficial engagement.\n\nHuman general intelligence admits degrees and variation. Children, average adults and an acknowledged genius such as Einstein all have general intelligence of varying level and profile. Individual humans excel or fall short in different domains. The same flexibility should apply to artificial systems: we should ask whether they have the core cognitive abilities at levels comparable to human-level general intelligence.\n\nRather than stipulating a definition, we draw on both actual and hypothetical cases of general intelligence — from Einstein to aliens to oracles — to triangulate the contours of the concept and refine it more systematically. Our conclusion: insofar as individual humans have general intelligence, current LLMs do, too.\n\nWe can start by identifying four features that are not required for general intelligence.\n\nPerfection. We don’t expect a physicist to match Einstein’s insights, or a biologist to replicate Charles Darwin’s breakthroughs. Few, if any, humans have perfect depth even within specialist areas of competence. Human general intelligence does not require perfection; neither should AGI.\n\nUniversality. No individual human can do every cognitive task, and other species have abilities that exceed our own: an octopus can control its eight arms independently; many insects can see parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are invisible to humans. General intelligence does not require universal mastery of these skills; an AGI does not need perfect breadth.\n\nHuman similarity. Intelligence is a functional property that can be realized in different substrates — a point Turing embraced in 1950 by setting aside human biology1. Systems demonstrating general intelligence need not replicate human cognitive architecture or understand human cultural references. We would not demand these things of intelligent aliens; the same applies to machines.\n\nSuperintelligence. This is generally used to indicate any system that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in almost all areas. Superintelligence and AGI are often conflated, particularly in business contexts, in which ‘superintelligence’ often signals economic disruption. No human meets this standard; it should not be a requirement for AGI, either.\n\nWhat, then, is general intelligence? There is no ‘bright line’ test for its presence — any exact threshold is inevitably arbitrary. This might frustrate those who want exact criteria, but the vagueness is a feature, not a bug. Concepts such as ‘life’ and ‘health’ resist sharp definition yet remain useful; we recognize paradigm cases without needing exact boundaries. Humans are paradigm examples of general intelligence; a pocket calculator lacks it, despite superhuman ability at calculations.\n\nWhen we assess general intelligence or ability in other humans, we do not attempt to peer inside their heads to verify understanding — we infer it from behaviour, conversation and problem-solving. No single test is definitive, but evidence accumulates. The same applies to artificial systems.\n\nJust as we assess human general intelligence through progressively demanding tests, from basic literacy to PhD examinations, we can consider a cascade of increasingly demanding evidence that warrants progressively higher confidence in the presence of AGI.\n\nTuring-test level. Markers comparable to a basic school education: passing standard school exams, holding adequate conversations and performing simple reasoning. A decade ago, meeting these might have been widely accepted as sufficiently strong evidence for AGI.\n\nExpert level. Here, the demands escalate: gold-medal performance at international competitions, solving problems on PhD exams across multiple fields, writing and debugging complex code, fluency in dozens of languages, useful frontier research assistance as well as competent creative and practical problem-solving, from essay writing to trip planning. These achievements exceed many depictions of AGI in science fiction. The sentient supercomputer HAL 9000, from director Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, exhibited less breadth than current LLMs do. And current LLMs even exceed what we demand of humans: we credit individual people with general intelligence on the basis of much weaker evidence.\n\nSuperhuman level. Revolutionary scientific discoveries and consistent superiority over leading human experts across a range of domains. Such evidence would surely allow no reasonable debate about the presence of general intelligence in a machine — but it is not required evidence for its presence, because no human shows this.\n\nCurrent LLMs already cover the first two levels. As LLMs tackle progressively more difficult problems, alternative explanations for their capabilities — for instance, that they are gigantic ‘lookup tables’8 that retrieve pre-computed answers or ‘stochastic parrots’9 that regurgitate shallow regularities without grasping meaning or structure — become increasingly disconfirmed.\n\nOften, however, such claims just reappear with different predictions. Hypotheses that retreat before each new success, always predicting failure just beyond current achievements, are not compelling scientific theories, but a dogmatic commitment to perpetual scepticism.\n\nWe think the current evidence is clear. By inference to the best explanation — the same reasoning we use in attributing general intelligence to other people — we are observing AGI of a high degree. Machines such as those envisioned by Turing have arrived. Similar arguments have been made before10 (see also go.nature.com/49p6voq), and have engendered controversy and push-back. Our argument benefits from substantial advances and extra time. As of early 2026, the case for AGI is considerably more clear-cut.\n\nWe now examine ten common objections to the idea that current LLMs display general intelligence. Several of them echo objections that Turing himself considered in 1950. Each, we suggest, either conflates general intelligence with non-essential aspects of intelligence or applies standards that individual humans fail to meet.\n\nThey’re just parrots. The stochastic parrot objection says that LLMs merely interpolate training data. They can only recombine patterns they’ve encountered, so they must fail on genuinely new problems, or ‘out-of-distribution generalization’. This echoes ‘Lady Lovelace’s Objection’, inspired by Ada Lovelace’s 1843 remark and formulated by Turing as the claim that machines can “never do anything really new”1. Early LLMs certainly made mistakes on problems requiring reasoning and generalization beyond surface patterns in training data. But current LLMs can solve new, unpublished maths problems, perform near-optimal in-context statistical inference on scientific data11 and exhibit cross-domain transfer, in that training on code improves general reasoning across non-coding domains12. If critics demand revolutionary discoveries such as Einstein’s relativity, they are setting the bar too high, because very few humans make such discoveries either. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that human intelligence is not itself a sophisticated version of a stochastic parrot. All intelligence, human or artificial, must extract structure from correlational data; the question is how deep the extraction goes.\n\nThey lack world models. LLMs supposedly lack representations of their physical environment that are necessary for genuine understanding. But having a world model requires only the ability to predict what would happen if circumstances differed — to answer counterfactual questions. Ask a cutting-edge LLM what differs between dropping a glass or a pillow on a tile floor, and it will correctly predict shattering in one case and not the other. The ability of LLMs to solve olympiad mathematics and physics problems and assist with engineering design suggests that they possess functional models of physical principles. By these standards, LLMs already have world models. Furthermore, neural networks developed for specialized domains such as autonomous driving are already learning predictive models of physical scenes that support counterfactual reasoning and sophisticated physical awareness13.\n\nThey understand only words. This objection centres on the fact that LLMs are trained only on text, and so must be fundamentally limited to text-based tasks. Frontier models are now trained on images and other multimodal data, making this objection somewhat obsolete. Moreover, language is humanity’s most powerful tool for compressing and capturing knowledge about reality. LLMs can extract this compressed knowledge and apply it to distinctly non-linguistic tasks: helping researchers to design experiments — for example, suggesting what to test next in biology and materials science4 — goes beyond merely linguistic performance. We are yet to encounter the sharp limitations to LLM performance that this objection predicts.\n\nThey don’t have bodies. Without embodiment, critics argue, there can be no general intelligence. This reflects an anthropocentric bias that seems to be wielded only against AI. People would ascribe intelligence to a disembodied alien communicating by radio, or to a brain sustained in a vat. An entity that responds accurately to any question, but never moves or acts physically, would be regarded as profoundly intelligent. Physicist Stephen Hawking interacted with the world almost entirely through text and synthesized speech, yet his physical limitations in no way diminished his intelligence. Motor capabilities are separable from general intelligence.\n\nThey lack agency. It is true that present-day LLMs do not form independent goals or initiate action unprompted, as humans do. Even ‘agentic’ AI systems — such as frontier coding agents — typically act only when a user triggers a task, even if they can then automatically draft features and fix bugs. But intelligence does not require autonomy. Like the Oracle of Delphi — understood as a system that produces accurate answers only when queried — current LLMs need not initiate goals to count as intelligent. Humans typically have both general intelligence and autonomy, but we should not thereby conclude that one requires the other. Autonomy matters for moral responsibility, but it is not constitutive of intelligence.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00285-6\n\nTuring, A. M.

    "fullText": "There's a lot of hype around vibe coding with Claude Code.\n\nThe good news is that it's warranted. Claude Code can take care of some surprisingly complex coding tasks.\n\nThe bad news is that it's over-hyped, with claims of amazing apps being vibe coded in a couple hours, or complex workflows that use 10 parallel sub-agents running in a loop to replace the work of 5 software engineers.\n\nIf you're not already a Claude Code power user, all this hype can leave you questioning how to use it effectively. Am I missing out on productivity gains by not adopting this insane new workflow? Should I be using subagents, commands, skills, or MCP servers for my use case? If so, how?\n\nI was asking myself these exact questions, so I did a good few weeks of research and testing, and reached the following conclusion:\n\nWith just a few well-picked tools, and Claude Code's basic features, you have enough to \"vibe code\" great full-stack apps.\n\nWeird seeing all these complex LLM workflows and tools. Meanwhile I run one continuous Claude convo per project... I've never used a subagent. Never used MCP…\nAnd I have wildly good results ¯_(ツ)_/¯\n\n— Chris McCord, creator of the Phoenix framework\n\nWhile Claude Code's abilities are impressive, you quickly realize that there is a lot of feature overlap and stuff you just generally won't have to touch often if you get a few things right from the start. I'll explain what these are, and then go into more detail on each topic within this article.\n\n1. Provide it with full-stack debugging visibility\n\n2. Give Claude Code access to up-to-date, LLM-friendly documentation\n\n3. Use the right tech stack or framework\n\nWith this foundation, you'll be able to build and deploy fullstack apps easily by mostly using Claude Code's default workflows, and just a couple custom commands/skills (I also packed these ideas into a simple Claude Code plugin you can install and use, but I'll talk more about that later).\n\nThis approach works because it provides guardrails and the right patterns for the agent to follow, so you can spend more time on business logic implementation, and less time working out specifications and technical details.\n\nEssentially, you get to work with the agent on what you want, rather than having to explain how you want it, bringing that magic feeling of AI-assisted coding to complex, full-stack apps.\n\nOur typical AI-assisted coding workflow tends to look like this: we prompt, then wait, then look over the generated code (maybe), then check on things in the browser. If we've got some errors or some bad looking frontend designs, we copy and paste them and try to (better) explain what we want.\n\nWhat's worse is we might have to do this a few times before we're satisfied, or get things working again.\n\nBut to do this, we need to give Claude Code a \"set of eyes\". Luckily, this is possible with the right features and tools, allowing it to see the results of the code it wrote, and quickly modify it autonomously if it encounters an error anywhere in the stack.\n\nClaude Code introduced their background tasks feature which lets it execute long-running tasks, like app development servers (e.g. npm run dev), on the side without blocking Claude's progress on other work. The nice part is that Claude can continue to read and respond to the output of this task while you work.\n\nTo run commands in the background, you can either:\n\nEven though Claude can read the output of your background tasks, there are times you may want to check up on them yourself, and you still can do that. Just use the down arrow to highlight the background task message and click enter.\n\nThis is great because now Claude can react to issues that occur from building and serving your code. Unfortunately, it still can't react to errors that occur while your app is running in the browser.\n\nBut there's a cool way to solve this.\n\nThe missing piece so far is giving Claude the ability to actually see the result of the code it wrote, most typically what the UI looks like.\n\nProblems that only show up after the app is running in the browser, like design issues and runtime errors, aren't yet visible to the agent. So this tends to be where the human steps in to report back to: \"the button is misaligned\", \"there's a 404 error when trying to login\", \"the console says something about undefined\".\n\nBut luckily, we can arm Claude Code with browser automation tools to solve for this. These tools allow for programmatic control of the browser, like loading pages, clicking buttons, inspecting elements, reading console logs, and even taking screenshots.\n\nThis closes the loop for the entire stack and gives Claude the autonomy to complete larger features tasks entirely on its own.\n\nChrome DevTools MCP server is one of the best options currently out there, though there are many alternatives. It's easy to install, and specializes in browser debugging and performance insights.\n\nTo install it, run the following command in the terminal to add it to your current project:\n\nThen start a new Claude session and give it a prompt like:\n\nYou should see a separate Chrome instance open up being controlled by Claude. Go ahead and give it more tasks like:\n\nNow, when you're implementing full-stack features in your app, ask Claude to verify the feature works correctly by checking the logs in the development server, as well as in the browser with the Chrome DevTools MCP.\n\nAlternatively, if you want Claude to always automatically verify changes in the browser with the DevTools MCP without having to explicitly ask it to do so, you can add a rule to Claude's memory in your CLAUDE.md file.\n\nYou've probably experienced this: you're vibe coding using a library's API, and the AI confidently writes code that would have worked perfectly… two versions ago. Or it creates some crazy, over-engineered work-around to a known issue that has a simple solution in its documentation.\n\nThis is because the model's training data has a cut-off date. LLMs and tools like Claude have no way of knowing about the updated code patterns, unless you give it access to the current documentation.\n\nBut, as Andrej Karpathy observed, most documentation contains content that's not relevant for LLMs:\n\n99% of libraries still have docs that basically render to some pretty .html static pages assuming a human will click through them. In 2025 the docs should be a your_project.md text file that is intended to go into the context window of an LLM.\n\nThere's research to back up his claim, showing that LLM performance degrades when irrelevant content, like HTML syntax or verbose instructions for humans, is added to context as it distracts from the task and reduces accuracy.\n\nIn other words, every unnecessary token in your context window makes the AI slightly worse at its job.\n\nSo we need to be giving Claude Code the right kind of docs.\n\nThe fix is simple: give the agent the ability to fetch and read the relevant, LLM-optimized documentation for the tools you're using.\n\nHere are the two main ways developers are accomplishing this:\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI applications (i.e. agents, LLMs) to external systems. Claude Code can communicate with an MCP server to access specialized tools and information.\n\nThere are already tons of MCP servers for popular tools, like Supabase, Jira, Canva, Notion, and Vercel. Claude Code has a docs section listing these and many more, with instructions on how to install them if you’re interested.\n\nDeveloper Tool MCP servers like Supabase and Vercel have tools which will fetch documentation for the agent based on a query. There are some pros and cons to this approach, though.\n\nBecause LLMs don’t have a real memory, they have to load information into context with every new session, such as the tools they can use. A single MCP server can add around 15-30 tools to the context, and with multiple servers you can easily consume 10-20% or more of your LLM’s context window before you even begin working.\n\nIf you want to see how much of your context window is already used up, you can run the /context slash command in an active Claude Code session.\nThe example above shows that 2.5% of the context window is used up by just one MCP server.\n\nAnd as an LLM’s context window fills up, it’s performance degrades. Some devs even suggest starting a new session once the context is 75% full to avoid this, which is possible with the /clear command in Claude Code. You can also run the /compact command which creates a summary of your current session’s context and passes it along to the next session.\n\nLuckily, if your main reason for using an MCP server is just for documentation searching, then an alternative open standard exists that may be a better fit.\n\nLLMs.txt has quickly become the standard for providing LLMs with context-friendly versions of websites at an /llms.txt path.\n\nTry it out on some of your favorite developer tools URLs, such as:\n\nAlthough llms.txt files might vary widely in the content they surface, they always follow the same format of a simple markdown file with the title of the website and some links. That’s it! This allows LLMs to get precise information without all the fluff.\n\nHere are some of the pros and cons of using llms.txt for documentation fetching:\n\nIn my opinion, I think that fetching docs via an llms.txt URL is the better approach as its more context efficient. For example, a typical documentation file is ~100 tokens versus 5,000-10,000 tokens for just one MCP server.\n\nThat’s a 10x reduction in context usage.\n\nClaude Code is also great at navigating documentation maps to only fetch the most relevant information. Plus, you get the added benefit that llms.txt files are easier for humans to reference as well.\n\nIt's also the method that Claude Code uses for its own doc fetching internally. So when you ask it a question about its own features, it will first fetch its documentation map markdown file URL to find the correct guides.\n\nSo now that you know how to give Claude Code access to up-to-date documenation, the next question to answer is which tools might you need to provide the docs for?\n\nAnd the most obvious answer is the tech stack or framework you’re building your full-stack app with.\n\nThis is probably the most overlooked of the 3 pillars.\n\nStarting with a tech stack that AI can easily reason about will make the job of building the app you want significantly easier. There are a lot of options out there, but luckily there are many solid choices, such as:\n\nIn 2026, you'll be able to get very far with Claude Code and any of the frameworks listed above. But while these frameworks all offer good conventions, and are responsible for stitching together the most important parts of the stack, most of these still require some sort of additional integration.\n\nFor NextJS, which is more client-side focused, you have to chose and connect your own database layer. For Laravel and Rails, which unify backend and database, you need to decide which client to use and how it will talk to your backend.\n\nThat's why a lot of developers will reach for popular stacks/combos that include these frameworks, such as:\n\nYou might have noticed as well that the T3 Stack is the only one to include an authentication library, NextAuth. That's because the backend-focused frameworks, Laravel and Rails, have an opinionated way of adding authentication to your app already, but NextJS does not.\n\nWasp, on the other hand, is the only one of the bunch that unifies all parts of the stack — client ↔ backend ↔ database — while also being opinionated on features.\n\nThis is all great, but which one should you ultimately choose?\n\nWell, the more opinionated the framework, the better it vibes with AI.\n\nIf a framework is opinionated, it means there's usually one obvious place to put code and one common pattern to follow. The AI doesn't have to guess. They've already made decisions ahead of time so you (and your agent) don't have to. They've encoded architectural wisdom into conventions, picked the libraries to use, the way authentication is wired, and how the app should be structured.\n\nSo when there are fewer decisions to make, less boilerplate to write, and fewer tools to stitch together, the development process becomes more reliable.\n\nAnd as the app gets more complex, AI doesn't lose its focus, because the framework is handling a lot of underlying complexity. You can also understand and inspect what is being generated more easily, and avoid building yourself into a messy corner.\n\nConsider that opinionated frameworks can reduce boilerplate by 60-80%. Wasp's auth declaration, for example, replaces 500+ lines of typical authentication code with a 10 to 15-line config. That's 97% less code that needs to be generated and audited!\n\nOf these frameworks, Wasp is definitely the most opinionated but it's also the newest kid on the block. After that, Laravel and Rails are probably tied for a close second, but they are built on PHP and Rails, respectively, and come with their own distinct ecosystems, so you'll most likely have to pair them with a frontend JavaScript framework like React, too. NextJS, is the most popular but least opinionated of the bunch, so it means there is more complexity and up-front choices you and your AI have to deal with, but this offers more flexibility in the long run.\n\nSo in the end, the choice you make largely depends on what you're trying to achieve, what you're comfortable with, and how much flexibility you need.\n\nJust remember, the more a framework gives you structure and defaults, the easier it is for AI to generate code that fits correctly — and the less time you spend fixing confusing or inconsistent output.\n\nOk. So we've established that working with an opinionated framework means that it it manages a lot of the complexity for you.\n\nBut what does that practically mean when using it with Claude Code?\n\nIn a sense, the framework acts as a large specification that both you and Claude already understand and agree on.\n\nInstead of multi-turn conversations to figure out HOW things should be built, you get to just say WHAT you want built.\n\nSo when you tell Claude \"add a new model for Comments\" or \"add a user account settings feature\", Claude will know exactly what that means and where it all goes. And you also get the added benefit that the implementations follow best practices and are backed by the decisions of experienced professionals behind the framework, and is not just some LLM hastily implementing a feature on the wrong assumptions.\n\nThis isn't to say that you no longer have to do good planning, create a good spec, or Product Requirement Doc for your agent to follow. This can still be a really important step when vibe coding (or practicing \"spec-driven development\").\n\nBut it does mean that, with an opinionated full-stack framework, much less of your planning phases need to be devoted to discussing architectural and technical implementation details.\n\nIf you want to put this theoretical approach I discussed above to the practical test, then I suggest you try out the Wasp plugin we created for Claude Code.\n\nWe, the Wasp framework creators, maintain the plugin, so we've battle tested it with Wasp. Plus we're a very responsive community and we're listening to feedback and improving it all the time.\n\nFrom there, you can tell Claude to \"start the dev server\" and it will walk you through spinning up fullstack visibility as we outlined above. Or ask it to implement a Wasp feature and watch it fetch version-matched documentation guides for you!\n\nMore importantly, Wasp as a framework pushes into territory that's even more AI-native than the rest, because of its central configuration file(s) where the app is defined.\n\nThis main config file is like your app's blueprint. Wasp takes these declarations, and manages the code for those features for you.\n\nTake this example config file authentication snippet as reference:\n\nThis is what an authentication implementation in Wasp looks like. That's it.\n\nThis 8-line config generates what would typically require 500-800 lines of code: components, session handling, password hashing, OAuth flows, and database schemas. Claude just needs to know what auth methods you want.\n\nClaude doesn't need to worry about choosing what kind of auth implementation to use, or generating any of the glue code. It can just get straight to work building features.\n\nI've spent this whole article arguing that you can ignore a lot Claude Code features for fullstack app development. But I don't want to leave you with the impression that those features are useless.\n\nCustom subagents, commands, and skills shine when you're doing the same task repeatedly with consistent criteria, e.g.:\n\nThese are tasks where you want the same process followed every time and where a well-configured subagent with specific rules makes sense.\n\nIn most cases, reach for complexity only when the simpler approach stops working.\n\nWith these three ingredients I think most fullstack app developers can get the vast majority of the work done without reaching for much more:\n\nWith these in place, Claude Code's basic toolset—exploring, planning, reading, writing, running commands—is enough to build real, complex fullstack applications. The subagents, hooks, plugins, and complex configurations are there if you need them, but honestly most of the time, you won't.",

    "fullText": "Imagine trying to teach someone to cook over the phone.\n\nYou’re walking them through your grandmother’s pasta recipe—the one with the garlic that needs to be just golden, not brown. You describe every step perfectly. The timing. The technique. The little flip of the wrist when you toss the noodles.\n\nAnd then they say: “It’s burning. What do I do?”\n\nHere’s the thing: you can’t help them. Not really. Because you can’t see the pan. You can’t see how high the flame is. You can’t see that they accidentally grabbed the chili flakes instead of oregano. All you have is their panicked description and your best guess about what might be going wrong.\n\nThis, my friend, is exactly what happens when you ask Claude Code to fix a bug.\n\nYou’ve been on this ride before. I know you have.\n\nYou describe the bug to Claude. Carefully. Thoroughly. You even add screenshots and error messages because you’re a good communicator, dammit.\n\nSo you describe the bug again—this time with more adjectives and maybe a few capitalized words for emphasis. Claude proposes a slightly different fix. Still broken. You rephrase. Claude tries another angle. Round and round we go.\n\nThis is the debugging merry-go-round, and nobody buys tickets to this ride on purpose.\n\nThe instinct—the very human instinct—is to blame the AI.\n\nThat’s actually the right question.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned after spending more time than I’d like to admit arguing with AI about bugs: Claude almost never fails because it lacks intelligence. It fails because it lacks visibility.\n\nThink about what you have access to when you’re debugging. Browser dev tools. Console logs scrolling in real-time. Network requests you can inspect. Elements that highlight when you hover. The actual, living, breathing behavior playing out on your screen.\n\nYou’re asking a brilliant chef to fix your burning pasta—but they can only read the recipe card. They can’t see the flame. They can’t smell the smoke. They’re working with incomplete information and filling in the gaps with educated guesses.\n\nSometimes those guesses are right. (Claude is genuinely brilliant at guessing.)\n\nMost of the time? Merry-go-round.\n\nAfter countless Claude Code debugging sessions—some triumphant, many humbling—I’ve noticed two categories that consistently send AI spinning:\n\nReact’s useEffect dependencies.\n\nRace conditions. Stale closures. Data that shapeshifts mid-lifecycle like some kind of JavaScript werewolf. These bugs are invisible in the code itself. You can stare at the component for hours (ask me how I know) and see nothing wrong. The bug only reveals itself at runtime—in the sequence of events, the timing of updates, the order of renders.\n\nIt’s happening in dimensions Claude can’t perceive.\n\nCSS being overridden by inline JavaScript. WordPress functions receiving unexpected null values from somewhere upstream. Error messages that point to line 7374 of a core file—not your code, but code three function calls removed from the actual problem.\n\nBut the source? Hidden in cascading calls, plugin interactions, systems talking to systems.\n\nClaude can’t solve either category by reading code alone.\n\n(I told you to stay with me. Here’s where it gets good.)\n\nLet me walk you through a real example.\n\nBecause theory is nice, but showing you what this looks like in practice? That’s the good stuff.\n\nI had a Products Browser component. Simple filtering and search functionality—the kind of thing you build in an afternoon and then spend three days debugging because life is like that sometimes.\n\nEach control worked beautifully in isolation:\n\nSearch for “apple” → Three results. Beautiful.\n\nFilter by “laptops” → Five results. Chef’s kiss.\n\nSearch “apple” + category “laptops” → Broken. The filter gets completely ignored, like I never selected it at all.\n\nClassic React hook dependency bug.\n\nIf you’re experienced with React, you spot this pattern in your sleep. But if you’re newer to the framework—or if you vibe-coded this component and touched a dozen files before realizing something broke—you’re stuck waiting for Claude to get lucky.\n\nI spent three rounds asking Claude to fix it. Each fix addressed a different theoretical cause. None worked.\n\nThat’s when I stopped arguing and started instrumenting.\n\nInstead of another “please fix this” prompt, I asked Claude to help me see what was happening:\n\nNotice what I didn’t say: “Fix this bug.”\n\nWhat I said: “Add logging to track data changes.”\n\nThis is the mindset shift that changes everything.\n\nClaude added console.log statements to every useEffect that touched the view state:\n\nEach log captured which effect triggered, what the current values were, and what got computed. Basically, Claude created a running transcript of everything happening inside my component’s brain.\n\nI opened the browser, selected “laptops” from the category filter, then typed “apple” in the search box.\n\nThe console lit up like a Christmas tree of evidence.\n\nHere’s where the magic happens. I copied that console output—all of it—and pasted it directly into Claude:\n\nAnd Claude? Claude saw everything:\n\nClaude found the bug immediately.\n\nThe logs revealed the whole story: when I selected a category, useEffect:filters fired and correctly filtered the products. But then when I typed in the search box, useEffect:search fired—and it ran against the full product list, completely ignoring the category filter.\n\nThe search effect was overwriting the filter results.\n\nLast effect wins. (JavaScript, you beautiful chaos gremlin.)\n\nClaude proposed the fix: replace multiple competing useEffect hooks with a single useMemo that applies all transforms together:\n\nThe difference between “Claude guessing for 20 minutes” and “Claude solving it instantly” was 30 seconds of logging.\n\nThat’s not hyperbole. That’s just… math.\n\nThe second method works for a different beast entirely—the kind of bug where even the error message is lying to you.\n\nHere’s a WordPress error that haunted me for hours:\n\nIf you’ve done any WordPress development, you recognize this particular flavor of suffering.\n\nThe error points to core WordPress files—not your code. Something, somewhere, is passing null to a function that expects a string. But where? The error message is about as helpful as a fortune cookie that just says “bad things happened.”\n\nI’d made changes to several theme files.\n\nAny one of them could be the culprit.\n\nAnd the cascading nature of WordPress hooks meant the error could originate three or four function calls before the actual crash.\n\nAfter a few rounds of Claude trying random fixes (bless its heart), I tried something completely different.\n\nInstead of “fix this,” I asked Claude to brainstorm debugging approaches—and to visualize them with ASCII diagrams.\n\n(I know. ASCII diagrams. In 2025. But stay with me, because this is where Claude Code debugging gets genuinely interesting.)\n\nClaude started by analyzing the flow of the problem:\n\nThe diagram showed exactly what was happening: some theme code was passing null to WordPress core functions, which then passed that null to PHP string functions, which threw the deprecation warning.\n\nBut which theme code? Claude identified the suspect locations:\n\nEach with code examples showing what the problematic pattern might look like.\n\nThis is Claude thinking out loud, visually. And it’s incredibly useful for Claude Code debugging because now we’re not guessing—we’re investigating.\n\nRather than jumping to a single fix and hoping, Claude laid out several approaches:\n\nFour different angles of attack.\n\nThis is what systematic debugging looks like—and it’s exactly what you need when you’re stuck in the merry-go-round.\n\nHere’s where Opus 4.5 surprised me.\n\nInstead of settling on the first approach, it validated its theories by actually searching the codebase:\n\nIt searched for wp_redirect calls, add_filter patterns, get_option usages—systematically eliminating possibilities like a detective working through a suspect list.\n\nThen it updated its diagnosis based on what it found:\n\nThe error was coming from path-handling functions—something was returning a null path where a string was expected.\n\nClaude concluded with a clear summary of everything we now knew:\n\nAnd multiple approaches to fix it, ranked by how surgical they’d be:\n\nFirst attempt. Approach A—adding a debug backtrace—immediately revealed a function in FluentCartBridge.php that was returning null when $screen->id was empty.\n\nAll those rounds of failed attempts? They were doomed from the start because Claude was guessing blindly. Once it could see the error chain visually—once it had a map instead of just a destination—the solution was obvious.\n\nBoth of these methods work because they address the same fundamental gap in Claude Code debugging: AI doesn’t fail because it’s not smart enough. It fails because it can’t see what you see.\n\nWhen you’re debugging, you have browser dev tools, console logs, network requests, and actual behavior unfolding on your screen. Claude has code files.\n\nIt’s working with incomplete information and filling the gaps with educated guesses.\n\nHere’s the mindset shift that changed everything for me:\n\n👉 Stop expecting AI to figure it out. Start helping AI see what you see.\n\nYou become the eyes. AI becomes the analytical brain that processes patterns and proposes solutions based on the evidence you feed it.\n\nIt’s a collaboration. A partnership. Not a vending machine where you insert a problem and expect a solution to drop out.\n\nAdd logs when the bug involves:\n\nThe logs transform invisible runtime behavior into visible evidence.\n\nReact’s useEffect, state updates, and re-renders happen in milliseconds—too fast to trace mentally, but perfectly captured by console.log. Feed those logs to Claude, and suddenly it can see the movie instead of just reading the script.\n\nUse the brainstorming approach when:\n\nAsking Claude to brainstorm with diagrams forces it to slow down and map the problem systematically. It prevents the merry-go-round where AI keeps trying variations of the same failed approach. By exploring multiple angles first, you often find the root cause on the very first real attempt.\n\nHere’s what I want you to take away from all of this:\n\nDon’t argue with AI about what it can’t see. Show it.\n\nThe next time Claude can’t solve a bug after a few rounds, resist the urge to rephrase your complaint. Don’t add more adjectives. Don’t type in all caps. (I know. I KNOW. But still.)\n\nInstead, ask yourself: “What am I seeing that Claude isn’t?”\n\nThen find a way to bridge that gap—through logs, through diagrams, through screenshots, through any method that gives AI the visibility it needs to actually help you.\n\nThat bug that’s been driving you up the wall? The one Claude keeps missing?\n\nThen watch it solve what seemed impossible.\n\nYou’ve got this. And now Claude does too.\n\nFreelance web developer.

    "title": "Worried about AI taking jobs? Ex-Microsoft exec tells parents what kind of education matters most for their kids.",
    "description": "Craig Mundie, ex-Microsoft exec, discusses AI's impact on education. He urges a shift to personalized learning with AI and STEM-humanities integration.",
    "fullText": "Ex-Microsoft exec Craig Mundie has heard this question again and again — parents asking him a version of the same worry: Their kids are heading toward college, artificial intelligence is advancing fast, and jobs feel uncertain. What, exactly, should their kids be studying?\n\nThat question — what education will matter most in five years — reflects a deeper uncertainty about the future.\n\nMundie, who spent 22 years at Microsoft helping steer the company's vision toward AI and retired as the company's chief research and strategy officer in 2014, says that parents are simply asking the wrong question.\n\nIt's not only the students who have to change to fit the new AI era — it's the education system itself, said Mundie, who now advises other executives on AI and public policy.\n\nRather than chasing down the right job, Mundie urges families to prepare kids for a world where learning itself becomes continuous, personalized, and done in partnership with intelligent machines.\n\nDuring an interview with Business Insider's Reem Makhoul in June, Mundie said artificial intelligence and robotics are poised to reshape work more deeply than past technologies. See the edited cut of his interview below:\n\nThat shift, Mundie said, forces a bigger question than which job skills will survive. It challenges how societies define human value. This is something Mundie's been pondering for over a decade.\n\nIn his 2015 book \"Genesis,\" Mundie, with co-authors Eric Schmidt and Henry Kissinger, examined how AI could alter the human experience. \"What we say is we have to think differently about how we value ourselves and what we do.\"\n\nFor much of history, he said, dignity has been tied to work because people had to work to survive. AI could loosen that link by automating more tasks across both physical and intellectual labor.\n\nMeanwhile, humans will need to learn how to work alongside intelligent machines, and the traditional higher-education system doesn't offer a clear path toward that, right now.\n\nHe described today's education system as sharply divided between STEM and the humanities. The liberal arts emphasize reasoning, but at the expense of special technical skills you learn in STEM fields, Mundie said.\n\nStudents will need both skills moving forward. \"If I could create a new curriculum in college, it would be a liberal education in technology,\" and STEM, he said.\n\nMundie went further, questioning whether the classroom model that dominates education today still makes sense.\n\nHe traced that structure back to the printing press, which created a surge in written information and a need for mass literacy. Schools, he said, became an efficient \"machine for teaching\" because societies lacked enough individual tutors.\n\nWe can have scalable, polymathic teachers, Mundie said. \"We can have as many teachers as we want now because the AI will be the teacher.\"\n\nHe said this opens the door to a more personalized, Socratic model of learning, where students can interact continuously with an intelligent system that adapts to their curiosity, pace, and interests. Progress would be limited less by standardized curricula and more by a student's motivation and capacity.\n\nSchools and universities have been slow to embrace this shift. Early reactions often involved banning AI tools outright. \"They've now given up on that,\" Mundie said.\n\nThat resistance, he added, is typical of incumbent systems. \"The natural tendency of the incumbent is to preserve the incumbent system,\" or make only incremental changes, he added. But \"when you get something as powerful as these AIs, most incumbent systems are not going to be preserved.\"\n\nHe also pointed to early experiments on the right track, like versions of Khan Academy, an online non-profit educational platform founded in 2008 and headquartered in California. It uses an AI tutor, named Khanmigo, designed to guide students rather than simply give answers. In those systems, he said, the AI nudges students toward better questions and deeper understanding.\n\n\"So that's the difference between sort of a broad chat about anything interface and an AI application that was specifically oriented around teaching,\" he said, adding, \"That's just one tiny example of how people will build more and more apps on these common artificial intelligence platforms.\"\n\n\"We will move beyond the specific generic interface to a world of millions of applications that are really customized in some clever way to guide people to solutions in the areas they care about,\" he said. These agents may, in fact, do much of the work autonomously by interacting with others, he added.\n\nMundie said parents and older generations may have difficulty imagining this model, while children are likely to adapt quickly. The harder question, in his view, is whether educational institutions are willing to change.",

    "title": "Ben Horowitz says fears of an AI-fueled job apocalypse are based on a flawed assumption",
    "description": "The A16z cofounder said history shows automation destroys some jobs but creates new ones, and that confident predictions about AI and work are misguided.",
    "fullText": "Ben Horowitz doesn't buy the idea that artificial intelligence is about to wipe out work as we know it.\n\nThe cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz says many of the loudest warnings about AI-driven mass unemployment rest on a flawed premise: that the future of work is predictable.\n\nHistory, he said, suggests the opposite.\n\n\"I think people are acting as though it's very predictable when it's not at all predictable,\" Horowitz said in an interview on the \"Invest Like The Best\" podcast on Tuesday.\n\n\"Why are you so sure it's going to happen next? And why are you so sure no jobs are going to be created? I don't think it's nearly as predictable as people are saying,\" he added.\n\nHorowitz's comments come as tech executives, economists, and policymakers remain split over how many jobs AI could eliminate, how quickly those changes might arrive, and whether displacement is inevitable at all.\n\nSome senior AI researchers, including computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, often called the \"Godfather of AI,\" UC Berkeley professor Stuart Russell, University of Louisville computer science professor Roman Yampolskiy, and some tech leaders, including Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei, have warned of AI's potential to replace large swaths of jobs.\n\nOthers, including OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have said AI is more likely to reshape jobs and create new roles rather than erase work outright.\n\nHorowitz, by contrast, took a longer historical view, framing AI as the latest chapter in a long arc of automation that has repeatedly destroyed jobs while ultimately expanding opportunity.\n\nThe most extreme example, he said, is agriculture. In the early US economy, roughly 95% of jobs were tied to farming, he said, adding that almost all of those roles are gone now.\n\n\"We've been automating things since the agricultural days,\" Horowitz said. \"Almost all those jobs have been eliminated. And the jobs we have now, the people doing agriculture wouldn't even consider jobs.\"\n\nThe mistake, he said, is assuming today's job categories are a reliable guide to tomorrow's economy. Each major technology shift created entirely new forms of work that were difficult, if not impossible, to imagine beforehand, he said.\n\n\"The idea that we could imagine all the jobs that are going to come, sitting here now, that AI is going to enable, I think is low,\" he said.\n\nHorowitz was also skeptical of the urgency behind job-loss predictions, saying that modern AI didn't appear overnight.\n\n\"We've had AI going right — ImageNet was what, 2012 — and then natural language stuff was like 2015, and then ChatGPT was 2022,\" Horowitz said. \"Where's all the job destruction? Why hasn't it happened yet?\"\n\nThat doesn't mean AI won't eliminate certain roles.\n\nHorowitz said he expects jobs centered on processing information for others to face pressure.\n\nBut he believes demand for creativity will rise.\n\n\"I don't really think that the door is going to close behind you,\" he said. \"I think the opportunities tend to multiply when you open up a new way of doing things.\"",

    "description": "As Google's earnings report looms, its AI strategy and ad business with Gemini 3 put it at the forefront of a volatile AI market.",
    "fullText": "Google has had a great run since its last earnings report. Can it last?\n\nThat's the big question ahead of the tech giant's earnings report this afternoon. BI's Hugh Langley, our resident Google expert, breaks down what you need to look out for in the numbers and on the call.\n\nGoogle has been on a three-month tear since its last check-in, launching Gemini 3 to much fanfare and joining the $4 trillion market-cap club. The string of successes put it at the front of the highly competitive AI race.\n\n(A quick aside on these arbitrary rankings. You could argue Nvidia's the biggest winner of the AI race, but it's really in its own bucket. I'm talking about companies with competing chatbots. No further questions at this time.)\n\nBut here's the thing about the AI race. It's highly volatile. One quarter, you're the belle of the ball; the next, you can't even get your texts returned. Just ask Meta and Microsoft.\n\nInvestors are expecting a big swing one way or another. Google's implied one-day share move following earnings is 4.9%, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nYou don't have to search too far to find the key to Google's earnings.\n\nGoogle Search (get it) and the ad business built around it are still the company's crown jewel. It's also an area many have speculated AI would upend. (Why \"Google it\" if you can \"ChatGPT it\"?)\n\nGoogle has managed to incorporate AI features without cannibalizing its cash cow. But it's a tricky balancing act, and Google is already blurring the line between Search and Gemini.\n\nThe real tipping point will be ads. Google executives have been adamant that there are no immediate plans to bring them to Gemini anytime soon. However, if Search's massive traffic ultimately gets passed to the chatbots, advertising's arrival feels inevitable.\n\nIt also might not have a choice.\n\nOpenAI is preparing to roll out ads to some ChatGPT users despite Sam Altman previously calling them a \"last resort.\" In such a highly competitive race, and with so much money on the line, giving your rivals any type of headstart is a risk.",

    "description": "While Anthropic doesn't outright name ChatGPT, it's clear who the target of its coming Super Bowl ad is.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic is taking a shot at OpenAI on the biggest stage possible.\n\nOn Wednesday, Anthropic rolled out a glitzy ad campaign that will air nationally during Sunday's Super Bowl, which implicitly centers on OpenAI's plans to bring advertising to ChatGPT.\n\n\"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\" the tag line reads.\n\nThe declaration shows that Anthropic is willing to draw a line in the sand with its no-AI-ads-in-chatbots stance. But the move also means Anthropic is declining to pursue a potentially key revenue stream for Claude at a time when AI companies are spending more than ever in the AI race.\n\nWith much of Anthropic's revenue coming from its enterprise business, the company may feel it's a worthwhile tradeoff and a way to further differentiate its offerings from OpenAI's.\n\nAnthropic has booked a 30-second spot during the game and an additional 1-minute ad during the pregame for what is historically the most-watched live television event in the US.\n\nThe 30-second spot features a scrawny guy asking a buffed trainer, \"Can I get a six pack quickly?\" While at first the trainer gives helpful information in the voice of an AI chatbot, the trainer quickly segues into an ad.\n\n\"Confidence isn't just built in the gym, try Step Boost Max, the insoles that add one vertical inch of height and help short kings stand tall,\" the trainer says.\n\nAnthropic's 1-minute-long spot is even more provocative. It features an adult man in therapy who is trying to connect more with his mother. After giving some general advice, the AI chatbot-like voice segues into an ad for a fictional dating service for younger men seeking older women.\n\n\"If the relationship can't be fixed, find an emotional connection with other older women on Golden Encounters, the mature dating site that connects sensitive cubs with roaring cougars,\" the therapist responds in the voice of a chatbot.\n\nTwo additional ads in the campaign feature a woman in a restaurant asking for feedback on a new business idea and a student asking a professor for help with an essay.\n\nIt's not immediately clear how much Anthropic is spending on the Super Bowl campaign. Mike Marshall, head of global advertising for NBCUniversal, whose network has the rights to this year's game, recently said a 30-second spot costs roughly $8 million.\n\nLast month, OpenAI announced plans to begin testing ads in the US for its free and Go tiers of ChatGPT. While anticipated, the announcement illustrated just how much CEO Sam Altman has changed his views on monetizing the chatbot with ads.\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nAs part of the announcement, OpenAI said that ads would \"not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you.\"\n\n\"Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you,\" the company said in the announcement. \"Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.\"\n\nIn case the ad campaign wasn't clear enough, Anthropic released its own lengthy statement pledging to keep ads off of Claude.\n\n\"Ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking,\" the company said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAnthropic, founded by seven former OpenAI employees, including CEO Dario Amodei, has also repeatedly shown it's not above taking implicit shots at its rival, though the Super Bowl ads represent an escalation of the AI wars.\n\nIn December, Amodei poked fun at companies that declare \"Code Reds,\" denounced others that are \"Yoloing\" by making risky bets on future AI demand, and extolled the virtues of Anthropic's business model, built on the enterprise market. Individually and collectively, the remarks came across as implicit shots at OpenAI, though Amodei repeatedly declined to name his target.\n\nWhen asked, \"who is Yoloing,\" Amodei responded, \"So that's not a question I'm going to answer.\"\n\nAnd while Anthropic still isn't naming names, the target of their taunts will be hard for Super Bowl fans to ignore.",

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang weighed in on the latest jitters at a Cisco AI event.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI. You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.\"\n\nHuang outlined his view that software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace, explaining that AI will use the tools software offers rather than reinventing its own.\n\nThe CEO named Service Now, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, specifically as bright spots in the space.\n\nRecent weakness in the software sector comes amid a broader market rotation away from tech. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has seen a nearly 20% decline in the past year, and the sector fell into a bear market last week.\n\nHere are some of the stocks dragging the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF lower during Wednesday's session:",

    "fullText": "Software stocks are taking it on the chin again on Wednesday.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF was down another 3% as the software sector faced selling pressure for a second straight session.\n\nThe decline comes after a particularly brutal sell-off on Tuesday as investors panicked about Anthropic's new AI tool, which can perform a range of clerical and administrative tasks for people working in the legal industry. Legal software stocks got crushed, but the selling spilled over into the broader space by the end of Tuesday's session.\n\nSome of Wednesday's big losers in the software space include:\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq was down as much as 2% for a second day, tumbling deeper into the red in afternoon trading.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around 1:20 p.m. ET on Wednesday:\n\nThe sector is now mired in its worst sell-off since the \"Liberation Day\" market crash, having officially entered a bear market last week after Microsoft's earnings fueled more concern about valuations and growing AI capex.\n\nThe decline reflects two fears that are top of mind for investors: On the one hand, tech stocks are broadly expensive and fears of an AI bubble still loom over markets.\n\nOn the other hand, there is great uncertainty as to how the business model for software companies could change, Craig Johnson, a managing director and chief market technician at Piper Sandler, told Business Insider.\n\nInvestors are mulling the extent to which these are existential threats to certain companies or if they'll somehow ultimately adapt to new realities.\n\n\"Investors believe that ultimately, look, if three years from now you're going to be sitting on your desktop asking your desktop to generate code to do certain things for you, it's impossible to believe that there won't be benefits for customers removing some of the software,\" Adam Parker, the founder of Trivariate Research, said.\n\n\"I think it's just a manifestation of the worries that market participants have had for quite some time,\" Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone, added about Tuesday's big sell-off.\n\nYet, the latest weakness in the space is a continuation of what's been a year of weakness for software names.\n\nHere are three charts that show how striking the decline has been.\n\nSoftware stocks officially entered a bear market last week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is now 27% from its September 2025 peak.\n\nThe price-to-earnings ratio, a traditional measure of stock valuations, has also dropped sharply among software makers' stocks. The P/E ratio in the S&P software index has dropped to below 60x, down from a peak of around 85x last summer.\n\nOracle, Varonis, CommVault, and Circle make up the group of the worst-performing stocks in the sector. All four stocks are down more than 50% from their September highs.\n\nThe outlook for software on Wall Street looks mixed after Tuesday's rout.\n\nPepperstone's Brown said he believes the bull case for tech broadly is still \"very, very robust,\" pointing to strong earnings and expectations for solid economic growth in the US. The S&P 500 is on track to post 12% earnings growth for the fourth quarter, which would mark its fifth straight period of double-digit growth, according to FactSet.\n\n\"I'm still very much in buy-the-dip mode,\" Brown said. \"Overall you are looking at a market where the path of least resistance leads higher.\"\n\nMost software stocks have more room to fall from a technical perspective, Piper Sandler's Johnson said. He pointed to the relative strength index, a technical gauge used to predict the near-term direction of stock prices, and said he believed most software names had at least 10%-20% more downside to go before finding a floor.\n\n\"CRM, ServiceNow, Oracle, DataDog, Snow, doesn't really matter,\" he said. \"They all have not pulled back or corrected to identifiable support levels.\"\n\nAdam Parker, the founder of Trivariate Research, said he believed software would be stuck in a \"guilty until proven innocent mode,\" with investors punishing companies until they saw stronger earnings growth.\n\n\"What the market's telling you is that the analyst estimates are way too high,\" he said of earnings. \"I feel like it's a falling knife that I don't want to catch personally.\"",

    "description": "Tech companies are waking up to the fact that AI may be more likely to replace them than help them.",
    "fullText": "Until very recently, the narrative around AI was that the $600 billion of annual corporate capital expenditure (“capex”) fueling it was good for stocks in the short term. The companies receiving that money as new revenue (AI model makers, data center constructors, and the energy companies supplying them) would be the immediate beneficiaries. The efficiencies delivered by AI would be good for tech and non-tech companies alike. The Big Tech hyperscalers have always argued that the demand from their revenue-paying clients far exceeded their ability to supply AI services. \n\nThat narrative was turned on its head in the past 24 hours as it dawned on traders that AI also has the ability to reduce the revenues of a vast range of adjacent tech companies. \n\nThe argument—advanced by Palantir CEO Alex Karp and CTO Shyam Sankar on their recent earnings call—is that AI is now so good at writing or managing enterprise software that it threatens to make irrelevant a range of tech companies that have, for years, enjoyed recurring revenues by providing enterprise apps to companies on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) basis.\n\nHow is AI threatening traditional SaaS company revenues?\n\nWhich companies were most affected by yesterday's decline?\n\nWhat are Palantir's AI capabilities reducing migration times?\n\nWhat caused the $300 billion tech stock selloff?\n\nThat led to a widespread selloff of tech stocks, wiping away $300 billion in market cap in a single session.\n\nS&P 500 futures were flat this morning after closing down 0.84% last night.\n\nSaaS companies took major hits: Microsoft closed down 2.87%; SAP was down 3.29% this morning on the German market; Salesforce lost 6.85% yesterday and was further down in overnight trading; ServiceNow was down 6.97% yesterday and was marginally lower overnight also.\n\nPalantir’s Sankar said on the call that his company’s “AI forward deployed engineer” product—which allows clients to manage software and codebases through natural language commands—is able to reduce the time it takes to complete “complex SAP ERP migrations” from “years of work” to “as little as two weeks.” (ERP stands for “enterprise resource planning,” and it refers to a service offered by SAP around helping companies transition from aging legacy systems into new ones.)\n\nKarp added: “In the American market, we have inbound [requests from clients] where people have already seen proof points at other companies and not on one use case. [There is] a myriad of use cases.”\n\nJefferies analysts Akshat Agarwal and Ayush Bansal—who focus on Indian enterprise tech companies—published a note this morning arguing that AI has the ability to reduce the revenues of a wide range of tech companies:\n\n“Anthropic’s Cowork plug‑ins and Palantir’s claims of faster SAP migrations highlight how AI could potentially erode application service revenues for IT firms. With application services being 40% to 70% of revenues [for tech companies in India], IT firms face growth pressures. Consensus growth estimates don’t fully reflect this, posing downside risk to valuations,” they warned. Claude Cowork is like a general purpose work assistant that can organize tasks and files autonomously.",

    "description": "Anthropic explains why Claude will remain ad-free—how advertising incentives conflict with building a genuinely helpful AI assistant users can trust.",
    "fullText": "There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.\n\nAdvertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.\n\nBut including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\n\nWe want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.\n\nWhen people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.\n\nConversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.\n\nOur analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.\n\nWe still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.\n\nBeing genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.\n\nConsider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\n\nEven ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.\n\nWe recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.\n\nAnthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.\n\nExpanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.\n\nAI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.\n\nWe’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.\n\nAll third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.\n\nWe want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.\n\nOur experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.\n\nWe think Claude should work the same way.",

Reskilling those affected by these job losses could save companies from making redundancy payments totalling as much as £757m, the report found.\n\nUpskilling staff would allow employers to focus on candidates’ potential rather than their past technical experience, the report found. It is estimated that up to 60,000 women in tech leave their roles each year for reasons including lack of advancement, lack of recognition and inadequate pay.\n\nDame Susan Langley, the mayor of City of London, said: “By investing in people and supporting the development of digital skills within the workforce, employers can unlock enormous potential and build stronger, more resilient teams. Focusing on talent, adaptability and opportunity will ensure the UK continues to lead on innovation and remains a global hub for digital excellence.”\n\nRecent surveys have shown that as many as a quarter of UK workers are worried that their jobs could disappear in the next five years because of AI, according to a poll by the international recruitment company Randstad. Union leaders have called on companies to commit to investing in workforce skills and training.\n\nThe City of London Corporation found that women were being overlooked for roles even as difficulties in hiring talent meant more than 12,000 digital vacancies in these sectors went unfilled in 2024.\n\nCompanies have tried to deal with worker shortages by increasing wages above the national average, but the report found that higher pay rates would not solve the problem. It warned that the widening digital talent gap was forecast to last until at least 2035 and that under this scenario the UK could miss out on more than £10bn of economic growth.",

    "fullText": "Digital pinboard business cutting 15% of workforce as it invests heavily in AI\n\nPinterest has fired two engineers who created a software tool to identify which workers had lost their jobs in a recent round of cuts and then shared the information, according to reports.\n\nThe digital pinboard business announced significant job cuts earlier this month, with the chief executive, Bill Ready, telling staff he was “doubling down on an AI-forward approach”, according to a LinkedIn post by a former employee.\n\nPinterest, which is based in San Francisco and has an office in London, said the cuts would affect about 15% of its workforce, or about 700 people, but did not specify which teams or staff members would be affected.\n\nTwo engineers at the company then wrote code to identify sacked staff.\n\nA spokesperson for Pinterest said: “Two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly. This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues’ privacy.”\n\nIt is unclear whether the engineers, who have not been named, shared the information with colleagues, or with people outside Pinterest.\n\nThe script – a set of commands written to automate a task within existing software or change its function – was aimed at internal tools for workers to communicate, the BBC reported, citing an anonymous source.\n\nThe source, whom the BBC said was “familiar with the firings”, said the code created an alert as to which employee names were being removed or deactivated.\n\nPinterest has been investing heavily in AI to create more personalised content for its users and automated tools for marketers. But shares in the company have dropped by more than 20% this year as investors assess the threat from more advanced AI platforms.\n\nReady said in a company-wide meeting that while “healthy debate and dissent are expected, that’s how we make our decisions”, according to CNBC, which first reported the news.\n\nThe chief executive said Pinterest was facing a “critical moment” and that staff should consider a job elsewhere if they were “working against the direction of the company” and disagreed with its mission, CNBC reported.\n\nIt comes amid a wave of job cuts in the techy sector, as businesses increasingly rely on AI. Last week, Amazon announced it would cut 16,000 roles worldwide, its second round of redundancies in three months.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs from its Reality Labs division to redirect resources to AI wearables and phone features. Meanwhile, Autodesk, a design software maker, announced plans this month to cut about 1,000 jobs.",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang says Nvidia would love to invest in a future OpenAI IPO.\n\nHuang said in an interview on CNBC's \"Mad Money\" on Tuesday that there was \"no drama\" between Nvidia and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, pushing back against recent chatter of tension in the relationship between the two companies.\n\n\"The first deal is on,\" the Nvidia CEO said, referring to the company's September deal with OpenAI, under which the company said it planned to invest up to $100 billion in the AI startup.\n\n\"​​And then there's, of course, an IPO in the future,\" he added. \"We love to be participating in that as well,\" he added.\n\nHuang also described OpenAI as a \"once in a generation company\" and said Nvidia is \"delighted to invest in it.\"\n\nHis comments come amid reports suggesting internal unease around the deal.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that the investment had sparked internal concerns at Nvidia, with some executives questioning the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nSeparately, Reuters reported on Tuesday that OpenAI had been unhappy with certain newer Nvidia chips and had looked at alternatives since last year, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nHuang told reporters in Taipei on Saturday that speculation of any dissatisfaction with OpenAI was \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we've ever made,\" he added.\n\nAltman has also pushed back on rumors of tension.\n\n\"We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world,\" wrote Altman in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\n\"We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don't get where all this insanity is coming from,\" he added.\n\nOpenAI is one of the world's most valuable private AI companies and a major customer for Nvidia's chips, which power the training and deployment of large language models.\n\nThe startup has not announced plans for an IPO, but its fundraising and computing needs have fueled speculation about how it will finance future growth.\n\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry said in a Substack exchange in January that he was surprised that ChatGPT \"kicked off a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure race.\"\n\n\"It's like someone built a prototype robot and every business in the world started investing for a robot future,\" he wrote.",

    "title": "I'm a senior UX researcher at Microsoft. Here's how I broke into AI without a tech background — and 3 lessons I learned.",
    "description": "A Microsoft UX lead details her non-traditional path into AI, starting with studying architecture and highlighting lessons in AI accessibility.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Priyanka Kuvalekar, a 31-year-old UX research lead at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI joined Microsoft in April 2025 as a senior UX researcher. I lead research for Microsoft Teams Calling and related AI experiences.\n\nMy path to this job wasn't typical. I spent five years studying architecture in college, not computer science or AI, and earned my degree in India.\n\nI started my career with a full-time internship as a junior architect while completing the final year of my degree. After I graduated, I began thinking seriously about my next steps. Should I continue as an architect or pivot into the digital world?\n\nI enrolled in a three-month user experience course, which led me to pursue a master's degree in user experience and interaction design.\n\nI moved to Philadelphia and began my master's program in January 2018. My first industry step was an internship as a UX researcher at Korn Ferry. After a year of interning, I was offered a full-time role, which I held until 2021.\n\nI broke into Big Tech at Cisco in October 2021 and worked as a UX research lead for over 3 1/2 years before taking my current position at Microsoft.\n\nI led projects focused on AI features for Webex meetings and messaging as the lead researcher.\n\nI knew I needed to understand AI's mechanics, so I pursued certifications and training, both through my employer and independently, on generative AI, agentic AI design patterns, large language models, and evaluating AI experiences as a researcher.\n\nI also explored courses and online resources on UI design from platforms such as Google Skills, Microsoft Training, and DeepLearning.AI to understand how generative AI could be applied to my projects.\n\nHere are the three biggest lessons I learned that helped me break into AI with a non-tech background.\n\nI learned that you need to understand how to evaluate AI in practice. AI isn't something you test once, and then it's \"done.\" It requires ongoing evaluation to ensure it continues to deliver trustworthy experiences.\n\nThis meant designing qualitative studies that examined how AI conversations hold up across diverse user groups. Inconsistencies in tone, misinterpretations of meaning, and pacing issues were revealed in this research.\n\nAnother key lesson came from approaching AI through an accessibility lens. AI can make tasks easier and reduce barriers for people with disabilities — for example, by automating steps. It can also create new inequities if not designed with accessibility in mind.\n\nAccessibility and AI can't be separated. I've learned to include people with disabilities in AI research and to evaluate how AI integrates with assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard navigation.\n\nBreaking into AI also taught me that you don't have to build the technology yourself to make an impact, but you do need to understand it well enough to engage with it.\n\nIt's about learning just enough to bridge the gap between technical teams and user needs, and to ensure that how you gauge AI quality is rooted in real user experience.\n\nGaining fluency meant understanding the concepts behind how large language models work, their limitations, and how to design evaluation frameworks that account for those limits.\n\nThis has helped me ask engineers the right questions and design studies that measure trust, reliability, and consistency across different user groups. It's also helped me work closely with product managers to define what success looks like for AI experiences.\n\nI recommend starting where AI meets people, not where AI meets code — focus on how AI shows up in products and how people experience it.\n\nOne of the most practical ways to add value without a traditional background is by shaping what \"quality\" means for an AI feature. Work with product managers to ask questions like, Does the AI stay within scope? Does it handle interruptions gracefully? Is it inclusive across languages and dialects?\n\nThese things often get overlooked when you view AI only as a technical system, but they're crucial to user trust. If you can frame them in actionable terms, you can become indispensable.\n\nHiring managers don't just want to see that you know AI exists — they want to see how you can shape it responsibly and make it usable.\n\nDocument all frameworks, rubrics, evaluation studies, and examples of how your insights influenced decisions. Even if you don't have access to big-company projects, you can run your own small-scale studies on publicly available AI tools and use those to showcase your thinking.\n\nTry volunteering for projects where AI is being integrated into existing tools, and answer questions like, What does this AI feature need to do? How should it behave? Can the AI explain what it can or can't do? Does it recover gracefully when it makes a mistake?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions researchers, product thinkers, and others with non-traditional backgrounds are uniquely positioned to answer.",
