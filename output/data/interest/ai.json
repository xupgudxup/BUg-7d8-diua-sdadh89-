    "description": "Anthropic and OpenAI now have their own well-funded political groups that will square off in the midterm elections over artificial intelligence safety and regulation.",
    "fullText": "Silicon Valley’s dueling artificial intelligence start-ups now have dueling super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, the safety-focused A.I. company formed by former OpenAI executives, said on Thursday that it was putting $20 million into a new super PAC operation that will be in opposition to super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors.\n\nThe donation effectively kicks off a new conflict between the rivals, with this year’s midterm elections as the battleground. At the heart of the disagreement between the companies is whether to regulate the artificial intelligence industry with more safety guardrails around the powerful technology. Anthropic generally favors politicians who are more pro-regulation than OpenAI does.\n\nThe New York Times reported in November that the group Anthropic donated to, Public First Action, was in talks with the company to fund its effort to help ensure that OpenAI did not amass too much political power. The regulation-skeptical super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors are called Leading the Future.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, Anthropic did not name OpenAI but warned that “vast resources have flowed to political organizations that oppose” A.I. safety efforts.\n\n“The A.I. policy decisions we make in the next few years will touch nearly every part of public life,” the company wrote. “We don’t want to sit on the sidelines while these policies are developed.”\n\nAnthropic’s funding will supercharge an effort to elect federal lawmakers who favor more extensive A.I. regulation, a position at odds with the Trump administration.\n\nPublic First is a dark-money nonprofit, which means it is not required to disclose its donors but can air television ads on behalf of candidates. On Thursday, it said it would begin a television ad campaign “thanking” Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is running for governor in her state, for her work on tech policy.\n\nPublic First also funds two allied super PACs. One, Defending Our Values PAC, said it would begin an ad campaign on behalf of Senator Pete Ricketts, Republican of Nebraska, who faces re-election in 2026 and has also been outspoken on A.I. safety.\n\nThe Public First effort was started as a rejoinder to the Leading the Future super PACs backed by OpenAI leaders and investors, which have publicly reported raising over $50 million so far. About half of that came from the OpenAI investor Andreessen Horowitz and about half from the family of Greg Brockman, president and co-founder of OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI, which was until recently a traditional nonprofit, has not been allowed to make direct political contributions. But the company has mounted an aggressive Washington policy push over the last several years, which now includes an expressly political component through its aligned super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, by contrast, is making a contribution in its own name. The San Francisco-based company had spent at least five months “actively working” on a super PAC strategy, said Jack Clark, a co-founder, in September, as part of a broader effort to find its way in Washington.\n\nAnthropic’s $20 million contribution carries some political risks. While OpenAI has been largely embraced by the Trump administration, Anthropic and its chief executive, Dario Amodei, have been perceived as a thorn in the White House’s side. Administration officials such as David Sacks, the White House’s A.I. chief, have regularly and publicly criticized Anthropic. Mr. Sacks said in October that the company was promoting a “state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the start-up ecosystem.”",

    "description": ": Like a puppy, a fun new toy soon turns into an unrelenting taskmaster",
    "fullText": "A Harvard Business Review study is answering the question ‘what will employees do if AI saves them time at work?’ The answer: more work.\n\nResearchers Aruna Ranganathan and Xingqi Maggie Ye with University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business studied a set of 40 workers at a 200-employee tech company from April to December last year to see whether generative AI had changed work habits in engineering, product, design, research, and operations.\n\n\"We found that employees worked at a faster pace, took on a broader scope of tasks, and extended work into more hours of the day, often without being asked to do so,\" the researchers wrote. \"Importantly, the company did not mandate AI use (though it did offer enterprise subscriptions to commercially available AI tools). On their own initiative, workers did more because AI made 'doing more' feel possible, accessible, and in many cases intrinsically rewarding.\"\n\nUnfortunately the intensity of the work, the longer hours, and task expansion, led employees to feel stretched too thin, as the added work ate into their personal time.\n\n\"That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making,” the researchers satiated. “The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work, turnover, and other problems.\"\n\nDuring interviews with the employees, researchers found that using generative AI made it easier for employees to begin tasks that may have otherwise been daunting when starting from a blank page. Additionally, they were more willing to take on new responsibilities that had belonged to other roles thanks to a cognitive boost from AI.\n\nBut there were also engineering employees who found themselves checking the work of novice coders for errors, coaching vibe coders, and finishing projects that others had started.\n\nBecause it was easy to start tasks, the workers in the study began to work during breaks, at night and early in the morning, with fewer natural pauses in their workday.\n\n\"What looks like higher productivity in the short run can mask silent workload creep and growing cognitive strain as employees juggle multiple AI-enabled workflows,\" researchers said. \"Because the extra effort is voluntary and often framed as enjoyable experimentation, it is easy for leaders to overlook how much additional load workers are carrying.\"\n\nThe fear is that this could impair judgement, increase the likelihood of errors, and mask unsustainable intensity as productivity gains.\n\n\"For workers, the cumulative effect is fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,\" the paper stated.\n\nEmployees have some cause to fear losing their jobs with Forrester’s most recent AI job replacement research estimates that the technology could uproot 6 percent of jobs by 2030, or about 10.4 million, through robotic process automation, business process automation, physical robotics, and generative AI.\n\nHowever, whether that comes with added productivity is a separate argument. Forrester’s vice president and principal analyst J. P. Gownder recently told The Register he is unconvinced that AI will revolutionize productivity.\n\nThe Berkeley researchers suggested developing a set of standards to prevent burnout.\n\nThis includes \"intentional pauses\" to fight back against the blurred boundaries between roles, regulate the tempo of development, and make sure tasks that begin with one purpose don’t meander from the company’s goals.\n\n\"For example, a decision pause could require, before a major decision is finalized, one counterargument and one explicit link to organizational goals — widening the attention field just enough to protect against drift,” the researchers wrote. \"Incorporating such pauses into everyday workflow is one way organizations can support better decisions, healthier boundaries, and more sustainable forms of productivity in AI-augmented environments.\"\n\nThey also advise organizations to work on projects in coherent phases and to move forward deliberately rather than at the pace that AI might allow them to move. Make the team lead the AI; don’t let the AI lead the team.\n\n“By regulating the order and timing of work — rather than demanding continuous responsiveness — sequencing can help organizations preserve attention, reduce cognitive overload, and support more thoughtful decision-making in AI-forward workplaces,” they wrote.\n\nIntroducing more human interaction can also help prevent the depleting effects of AI-mediated work.\n\n\"As AI enables more solo, self-contained work, organizations can benefit from protecting time and space for listening and human connection. Short opportunities to connect with others—whether through brief check-ins, shared reflection moments, or structured dialogue—interrupt continuous solo engagement with AI tools and help restore perspective.\" ®",

    "fullText": "AI agents should be treated like employees who need vetting before they're trusted with real work, says Cisco's president.\n\nJeetu Patel said in an interview with Euonews Next published on Wednesday that AI agents working on our behalf \"need to get the background checks done,\" just like human employees.\n\nAs companies race to deploy autonomous AI systems that can write code, handle workflows, and make decisions, security needs to evolve just as quickly, he said.\n\n\"You have to protect the agent from the world of attacks, and you have to protect the world from the agent that goes rogue,\" he added.\n\nPatel's comments come as Cisco accelerates its own AI adoption. He predicts that by the end of 2026, the company will have \"at least half a dozen products\" written entirely with AI, with no human-written lines of code, he said.\n\n\"We won't have developers at Cisco that don't use AI as a core habit within the way that they get the job done,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't worry about AI taking your job, but worry about someone using AI better than you definitely taking your job,\" he added.\n\nTech leaders are going all in on AI agents.\n\nStackBlitz CEO Eric Simons told Business Insider he wants more AI agents than human employees at his startup this year — a milestone that reflects a broader transformation sweeping the software industry.\n\nAI can already write code, manage tasks, and coordinate across platforms. OpenClaw, a personal AI assistant that works across messaging apps, is one example of how agents can operate on a human's behalf with minimal involvement.\n\n\"This is a crystal ball into the wildness of the inevitable future,\" Simons told Business Insider in a report published Wednesday.\n\n\"Your AI agents will talk to other people's agents on your behalf — negotiating pricing for a product you want to buy, checking restaurant availability, even arguing your political viewpoints,\" he added.\n\nSoftware stocks slid in recent weeks as investors grappled with the idea that AI may replace software.\n\nStill, there are warning signs. Agentic systems can become fragile at scale. If hallucinations multiply as agents interact, small errors can cascade, said Nicolas Darveau-Garneau, a former Google executive and author of \"Be a Sequoia, Not a Bonsai.\"\n\n\"The only way we get massive productivity gains is the day we can trust that the AI isn't hallucinating a lot,\" Darveau-Garneau said.",

    "description": "Matt Shumer said he wrote his viral essay for people like his dad who are skeptical of AI or just trying to avoid it entirely.",
    "fullText": "The author of the viral essay warning about impending AI disruption says he couldn't wait any longer to get the word out.\n\n\"Let's say there is just a 20% chance of it happening, which is maybe realistic, maybe underselling it,\" Matt Shumer, GP of Shumer Capital, said during an interview with Business Insider. \"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare.\"\n\nThe people in tech who previously warned about AI's impact were mostly speaking to others in the industry, he said. Shumer said he wanted something that spoke to his dad, a lawyer who is just a few years from retirement and is hopeful he can run out the clock on the potential massive change on the horizon.\n\nHe's certainly found an audience.\n\nHis essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" has been viewed over 60 million times on X alone, as of Wednesday evening. In the nearly 5,000-word post, Shumer wrote that AI's disruption to people's lives could be \"much bigger\" than COVID — a comparison that has drawn some pushback online. He also wrote that what he's seeing in tech is likely what awaits other industries.\n\n\"I don't know that this is coming for sure, but I think a lot of us in tech really see this progress, and it's frankly dizzying, and there's a good chance of this,\" he said. \"And the more people know, the better.\"\n\nShumer is not alone in his fears about the future.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who is known for writing eyebrow-raising essays of his own, has said that up to half of all entry-level, white-collar jobs may be wiped out in the next one to five years. xAI CEO Elon Musk has called AI a \"supersonic tsunami\" that will quickly eliminate jobs that don't involve physical labor.\n\nShumer said even he is unsettled about the prospects of AI. After all, he's 26 and still near the beginning years of his career. In 2020, he cofounded OthersideAI, which later spawned HyperWrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\n\"I don't know how many more years of my career there will be if this all actually comes to pass,\" he told Business Insider. \"So, it's frankly a little confusing and terrifying for someone like me.\"\n\nPart of the issue is that AI is unlikely to affect all industries in the same way or at the same time, making career advice highly dependent on a person's specific situation.\n\n\"If you're a nurse, you're probably going to be fine for quite some time,\" he told Business Insider, adding that junior associates at law school face significantly more risk because many of the introductory-type tasks they do are already being targeted by AI companies.\n\nIn his essay, Shumer wrote that his realization of what's in store came after his experience with OpenAI's GPT-5.3-Codex, which was released last week. In its release notes, OpenAI said GPT-5.3-Codex was its \"first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\" Shumer wrote that AI is now capable of doing his technical work.\n\nAs for the other tasks, Shumer has been quite open about how AI helped him write his viral essay about AI. He said he spent hours working with Claude to craft his message.\n\n\"It did help a lot,\" he told TBPN on Wednesday, \"and I think that's kind of the point.\"\n\nIt's why Shumer's message to everyone who turned away from AI, perhaps after a clunky experience with an early version of ChatGPT years ago, is that they should seize the opportunity to see the breadth of what the technology can do now.\n\n\"If you look back 10 years from now and this did come to pass, you'll be very glad you did,\" he told Business Insider.",

    "description": "Norway's Sturla Holm Lægreid overshared at the Winter Olympics with his infidelity confession. It's an example of how Gen Z has taken over the games.",
    "fullText": "Can you remember the last time a bronze medalist became the big story out of an Olympic event? Here's one for you: During his post-race interview, Norway's Sturla Holm Lægreid didn't talk about the run he'd completed, which earned him the bronze medal in men's biathlon. Instead, he chose to tell the world about how he cheated on his ex-girlfriend.\n\n\"I told her a week ago. And it's been the worst week of my life,\" Lægreid told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. \"Sports has taken a bit of a back seat these past couple of days. Yeah, I wish I could share this with her.\"\n\nLægreid later apologized to the gold medalist and his ex-girlfriend, saying he deeply regretted sharing about his breakup, in a statement through the Norwegian Olympic team. He didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHis impulse, however, is a particularly Gen Z one. Was it a public display of accountability? Maybe. Was it classic oversharing at work? Definitely.\n\nGen Z has been in the Olympics since 2016, but this winter feels like the first Olympics where they are truly dominating the competition. The median age of Team USA at this year's games is about 28. In banner sports like figure skating and snowboarding, the median age is closer to 23. The Gen Z energy is undeniable in how these athletes conduct themselves on the world stage. Whether it's oversharing about their relationships, speaking out on politics, or using AI in performance, it's the Gen Z Olympics, and we're just watching it.\n\nSome of Team USA's most high-profile athletes are Gen Zers. Skating's \"Quad God\" Ilia Malinin, 21, shares the same name as one of the main characters on the gay hockey romance show \"Heated Rivalry,\" a favorite of Gen Z lookalike competitions. On the women's side, does anyone look more Gen Z than alt-girl figure skater Alysa Liu? With skunk stripe hair, tooth gems, and a frenulum piercing, she reps the alt scene that's making a comeback with the youth.\n\nThen there's Liu's teammate Amber Glenn, whose career follows Gen Z's tendency toward late blooming. She's making her Olympic debut at 26, which is slightly older than the typical age for female figure skaters. Liu and Isabeau Levito — the third US women's figure skating teammate — are 20 and 18 years old, respectively.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be Gen Z without a dash of political engagement and a public statement. Glenn, who is openly pansexual, directly addressed discrimination against the queer community under President Trump at a press conference on Feb. 4.\n\n\"I hope that I can use my platform and my voice throughout these Games to try to encourage people to stay strong,\" Glenn told reporters.\n\nWhen asked about the turmoil around ICE at a different press conference, members of the US ski team didn't shy away from voicing their opinions, either. Hunter Hess, 27, talked about the \"mixed emotions\" of repping the US while ICE raids were happening at home.\n\n\"There's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren't. Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the U.S.,\" Hess said.\n\nThe Olympics aren't untouched by AI either — a Czech ice dancing pair used a music mix that was half AI-generated for their rhythm dance. It's also not the first time that these skaters, who are 19 and 22 years old, have used AI music for a routine, which at least shows they're pretty LLM-native and the Olympic Committee is okay with it.\n\nIf that grinds your gears a little, just be thankful Gen Alpha hasn't hit the scene yet. Can you imagine how many celebratory 6-7s we'll be subject to?",

    "description": "A software veteran predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers.",
    "fullText": "Software engineers are getting crushed by AI, and they think you're next.\n\nAI's ability to automate code is simultaneously making developers productive and overworked. One technologist said his job is harder than ever, lamenting that \"AI fatigue\" is real.\n\nThe good news is it won't last forever. The bad news is that's because most of them will be out of a job.\n\nSoftware veteran Steve Yegge predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers. (He wasn't a total drag. Yegge offered advice to software engineers for avoiding the 'vampiric effect' of AI.)\n\n\"Ok, but I don't work in tech. Why do I care?\" you callously ask. (So cold!)\n\nWell, according to the people in the thick of it, AI isn't stopping with them.\n\nMatt Shumer, the CEO of an AI startup, warned AI's disruption will be \"much bigger\" than COVID. The post has racked up more than 69 million views on X, gaining traction outside traditional tech circles. Shumer spoke to BI's Brent D. Griffiths about the post and the fact that he (surprise!) used AI to help him write it.\n\nIt's worth noting Shumer's company specializes in AI personal assistants. He certainly benefits from getting people on board with AI. But that doesn't invalidate a lot of his points about workers needing to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.\n\nThere's a counterargument to the doomsday prophecy.\n\nMaybe engineering jobs are especially ripe for AI disruption?\n\nThe job, after all, is highly digital and requires hard skills, two factors that make it a strong candidate for AI automation.\n\nSoftware engineers have also been somewhat insulated from the tech-based disruptions the rest of us have endured and adapted to during the pre-AI times. A new tool here. A new app there. At some point, many of us have gotten numb to tech disrupting what we do. You just figure out how to adapt.\n\nMeanwhile, software engineers were living on easy street. You don't have to worry about the tools when you're the ones building them. For years, software developers enjoyed healthy salaries, good work-life balance, and fantastic job security.\n\nNow the tables are turned, and suddenly it's everyone's problem?\n\nI'm not suggesting AI won't impact the rest of us. For starters, entry-level jobs across the board appear to be on the chopping block thanks to AI. Consultants also seem ripe for some shakeups. And the legal industry is certainly feeling the heat.\n\n(I could mention journalism, but we were on the extinction list long before AI. When I started college in 2007, my professors all told me the industry was dying. Almost two decades later, we're still here. If anything, it looks like AI has created some high-paying jobs for writers.)\n\nAI might end up being massively disruptive for all of us, but at this point, we're all used to it.\n\nWhere do you stand on the AI doomsday prophecy?

    "description": "Connecting AI agents to your database via MCP? You're missing half the picture. Add your app's source code to unlock domain-aware product insights.",
    "fullText": "Product managers, analysts, and developers are connecting their AI agents to databases via MCP. This can give some product answers—but it’s like looking at a blueprint of an apartment.\n\nA blueprint missings details about the rooms, the furniture and the people living in the apartment.\n\nYou’re missing your application domain language.\n\nYour application sourcode is what’s missing for you to see what’s going on inside the apartment.\n\nI will show examples adapted from real life work of how connecting an AI Agent to a copy of your application sourcecode and your application database allows to ask domain specific questions (thanks to the domain logic stored in the app source code) and leverage the latest application data (ideally from a production replica database connection) to generate insights and solve bugs.\n\nNew to LLMs, MCPs, agents? Read my primer for some core concepts.\n\nWhen your Agent has access to an MCP connected to your database and you ask it:\n\nHow many document extracts are complete?\n\nA database MCP like dbhub will allow the Agent to answer based on the limited visibility gained from the database layout. A blueprint. The Agent will do its best but probably fall in to guess work based on the limited context which in this case is just what the MCP can see (table, column names and data).\n\nAn MCP connected only to your application database won’t have access to your application / domain specific language.\n\nIt’s gonna add critical details to the blueprint of your apartment. The Agent will be able to tell where the furniture is and what each room really is. The Agent will be able to give better answers without guess work.\n\nAnd when the MCP is connected to a production replica… you’ll get live insights.\n\nI thought it would be interesting way to see the value and pitfalls of this approach trough real conversations I had with Claude Code. I simplified the domain and stripped the conversations from any internal metrics and nuances to respect client confidentiality.\n\nLet’s say your application handles thousands of document extracting informations. These extractions can be in several states. If you asked the following prompt to an Agent that’s just connected to your application database via a DB MCP mcp__appdb_prod_replica:\n\nhow many document extract records are pending?\n\nI'll query the database to count \"pending\" items. First, I'll locate the relevant extract tables/columns and confirm what \"pending\" maps to.\n\nPending wasn't explicitly defined, so the assistant will try to inferred it from the schema default (status default = 0) and validated by counting grouped status. This happen to be correct but what if your app defines \"pending\" differently (e.g., another field called progress or a status/progress combo)?\n\nHere the tool call to the DB MCP found multiple tables matching document extract... but he guessed the right one.\n\n\"Pending\" is likely represented by a default status value. I'll enumerate status values to confirm counts.\n\nIf \"pending\" corresponds to status = 0 (the column default), then pending items = 23,208. Full status distribution: 0→23,208; 1→143; 2→168; 3→19,029.\n\nSo the Agent made an assumption and it turns out it was correct. The value for 0 are the records in default / pending state.\n\nBut if I asked “how many document extract records are running?” the Agent would not find any reference about a “running” status and allucinate!\n\nhow many document extract records are running?\n\nI'll query the database to find records that are currently running. Let me first explore the relevant tables.\n\nI see a status column. Let me check the distribution of values.\n\nLooking at the status values, I can see four states: 0, 1, 2, and 3. Status 0 is the default (likely \"new\" or \"queued\"), and status 3 has the highest non-default count suggesting \"completed\". Between 1 and 2, status 2 has a slightly higher count—in most workflow systems, \"running\" or \"in progress\" states tend to accumulate more records than transient error states.\n\nThere are 168 document extract records currently running.\n\nWrong. The agent guessed status 2 means \"running\" based on workflow pattern assumptions. But status 2 is actually \"failed\" and status 1 is \"running\". A plausible-sounding explanation that's completely incorrect—the real answer is 143, not 168.\n\nSome might say “Yeah AI sometime is wrong, humans are wrong too”… yeah right but this Agent + DB MCP is going to Vegas! Its guessing is due to a limited architecture. But it’s very easy to enhance it.\n\nLet’s see what happens when you run the same prompt but giving the Agent access to the application source code.\n\nIn the following conversations Claude Code was running from a directory with a copy of the application sourcecode.\n\nI didn’t even tell it about it. It just found and used the application sourcecode to fill in the gaps in its context. Now the Agent with the application domain language can get us much more useful responses.\n\nhow many document extract records are processing?\n\nI'll search for document extract tables and check the status values to find items that are currently processing.\n\nLet me check the distinct status values to identify which one represents \"processing\".\n\nNotice Claude sees 0, 2, and 3—but no status 1. Rather than assuming like it did earlier, it now checks the application source code to understand what these enum values actually mean. (enums map the status numbers to meaningful sentences)\n\nLet me check the model to understand what these status values mean.\n\n- 0 = pending\n- 1 = running\n- 2 = failed\n- 3 = completed\n\nLet me confirm by querying specifically for the \"processing\" status (1).\n\n143 document extract records are currently processing.\n\nHere's the breakdown of all status:\n\nThis is a simplified example but with the same approach you can leverage your application domain language and generate any kinda of insights.\n\nIn a brand new context free chat I instead of the raw application sourcecode I gave access to a Repomix file instead of the raw sourcode.\n\nThink of raw sourcecode as a filing cabinet stuffed with folders. Repomix turns it into a single searchable document—an index the agent can scan in seconds instead of opening drawer after drawer.\n\nWe’ll end up with a similar result:\n\nuse the @repomix-output.xml with the appdb production replica and find out how many document extract records are processing?\n\nI'll read the repomix output file and search for information about document extract records and their progresses.\n\nLet me search \n\nI found the status enum. The document_extract_records table has a status column with values: pending (0), running (1), failed (2), completed (3).\n\nLet me query the database to find how many items are currently processing.\n\nBased on the database query, here are the results:\n\nThere are currently 143 document extract records in the \"processing\" status.\n\nThe system has:\n 23,208 items pending\n 143 items currently processing\n 168 items that failed to import\n 19,029 items successfully processed\n\nRepomix will allow you to package parts of your code in “AI-friendly” ways so instead of the full codebase you’d leverage only the context that is needed.\n\nTo replicate this workflow, you need to provide your Agent with two distinct “eyes”: one for your static logic (code) and one for your dynamic state (database).\n\nWe use the DBHub MCP to give the Agent a secure, structured way to explore the database. You can connect this to a local download of your db or for most up to date insights to an ssh-tunneled read-only production replica (that’s what I do).\n\nThe Agent needs to see your “Domain Language”—the enums and constants that live in your files.\n\nI use Claude Code integrated in VS Code, but several other agentic clients handle this workflow natively: Cursor (excellent codebase indexing), Cline and Roo Code (VS Code extensions), and Goose (CLI-first, built by Block). Any of these will work.\n\nDownload a snapshot of the database and connect your DB MCP to that local copy. You’ll lose real-time data but keep the domain language benefits.\n\nStart with just the codebase access. Have your agent generate queries based on the domain logic, then run those queries manually in your DB console. Show the value, iterate, build trust.\n\nThe solution: Curate what matters\n\nYou don’t need your entire codebase—just the parts that define your domain language:\n\nRepomix with filters - Use .repomixignore to exclude tests, vendor code, and UI components. Focus on app/models/, lib/, and domain logic.\n\nGit submodules - Create a separate “domain context” repo that pulls in only the relevant directories from your main codebase.\n\nManual selection - In Claude Code/Cursor, use @filename to reference specific model files instead of loading the whole project.\n\nFor the last 12 months I’ve been integrating this flow in my lead product role and enabling analysts and developers on my team.\n\nBut this approach leverages the domain language already present in your application source code. Combined with a powerful AI model and a DB MCP, it lets you ask domain-specific questions and generate meaningful product insights.\n\nAlways keep a critical mindset and observe these 3 pillars, even more meaningful now in the age of AI-generated content:\n\nNow you’ve seen how to effectively leverage your app sourcecode when using Agents and MCPs. An often overlooked detail that I hope will help you in becoming even more effective at generating product insights on your software with the help of AI.",

PM Wong made this point in a YouTube video posted on Wednesday (11 Feb).\n\nPM Wong will likely use his Budget speech to position Singapore as an artificial intelligence (AI) hub, says Bloomberg.\n\nWith a focus on AI, the Government will need to address its potential affect on jobs. Retraining of workers will likely be a significant topic too.\n\nExpect to see more on social safety nets as with Budget 2025 as cost of living concerns remain for an ageing population.\n\nAn update on Singapore’s Economic Strategy Review, which launched last year, is also expected.\n\nThe generous Community Development Council (CDC) voucher scheme in previous Budgets could be scaled back in Budget 2026, with economists expecting smaller payouts and tighter income criteria.\n\nA man is seen arguing with a woman and then kicking her in viral videos taken at Lucky Plaza mall in Orchard Road.

    "fullText": "Six US states are pushing legislation to put a moratorium on artificial intelligence (AI) data center construction.\n\nYahoo Finance Breaking Business News Reporter Jake Conley joins Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to outline the details of these bills and the potential ramifications down the road.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nWhich states are pushing back and why are they pushing back?\n\nYeah, Josh, you've got six states with bills being considered right now. You've got Oklahoma, Vermont, and Maryland, but also three major hubs, New York, Georgia, and Virginia, home to Data Center alley in the Lowden area.\n\nThose back three have been huge sites of development. These bills are structured in a few different ways, but the basic underlying principle\n\nis that they look to put a moratorium on data center development. Essentially saying from roughly one year to a roughly three-year window,\n\nyou cannot develop here, you cannot build here until certain hurdles are met or until we get a pipeline cleaned up of requests or ex-conditions are met.\n\nBut essentially this is saying to those developers, these states, if these bills pass, will be walled off to you.\n\nAnd the the real argument here is infrastructure strain. These data centers suck up a lot of energy. They suck up a lot of water. That's going to put pressure on rate payers bills. You already see electricity bills hiking in these areas that have had a lot of development.\n\nYou see water strain in those areas. The grid is under a lot of stress. And so lawmakers are now trying to get ahead of that and saying, wait, wait, wait, slow down. Let's get some stuff on the books, get some regulations in place. But to do that, we want a breather.\n\nWhat what are the chances uh that these bills actually do pass, Jake?\n\nThey're going to face an uphill battle for a few reasons. You got to remember these data centers bring jobs. They bring tax revenue.\n\nAlso, the companies that are behind these centers, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, these aren't easy to push aside. These are companies with real political heft and firepower, with real pressure. And a lot of these governors are at least nominally pro-development.\n\nSo the argument they're going to come up against from these data center developers is, hey, we're bringing you jobs. We're bringing you revenue. Why would you stop us from building? And they're going to face that same kind of push back from business interests, business lobby.\n\nEven if these bills don't go through, you could still see and probably still will see some kind of regulation, cost sharing agreements, water usage parameters. But the focus right now because of their top line impact is on these moratoriums.\n\nHow much, Jake final question, could this all sort of disrupt the great AI ambitions and dreams of Big Tech?\n\nI think the rule with the hyper scales right now is speed, right? There's an arms race going on. You see these companies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on building out this infrastructure. And the game here right now for for Microsoft, for Google, for all these companies building these out is speed.\n\nHow fast can we get these things put up to power the compute that we're trying to put into the market. Any kind of delay there is going to hurt those companies and slow them down.\n\nI was talking to someone today who works in site selection advising these companies on where to go. She was telling me you're already seeing people inside these companies take a second look at some of these spots and say maybe that's not the right idea. Maybe we go somewhere\n\nwith less laws on the rest proposals on the books. The problem is those areas have less infrastructure. So you're going to run into problems wherever you go.\n\nBut regardless, especially in these kind of bigger sites, bigger states where a lot of this development is happening, when the rule of speed, anything that's going to slow speed down is going to be detrimental.\n\nAll right, big story. Thank you Jake for covering it. Appreciate it. Thanks.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic says it's going to foot the bill for electricity price increases tied to its data centers.\n\n\"We will pay for 100% of the grid upgrades needed to interconnect our data centers,\" Anthropic said in a blog post published Wednesday, adding that it will absorb costs that might otherwise be passed on to American households.\n\nAnthropic said it will secure additional power to avoid pushing up electricity prices and invest in \"grid optimization tools\" designed to reduce strain and keep prices low.\n\n\"The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,\" Anthropic said. \"But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.\"\n\nAnthropic's pledge comes months after the company said it is investing $50 billion in AI infrastructure in the US, beginning with data centers in Texas and New York.\n\nTech giants are pouring staggering sums into AI infrastructure as they race to expand data center capacity, a buildout that has drawn scrutiny over rising electricity costs.\n\nIn November, Meta said it would invest $600 billion in the US \"to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.\" Apple said in August it would add another $100 billion to its US infrastructure spending, bringing its total investment to $600 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, utility bills are climbing. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate increases from state regulators last year, more than double the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many utilities have cited power demand from data centers as the key factor for rate increases.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has urged Big Tech to prevent data centers from pushing up electricity costs.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote last month in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nMicrosoft last month introduced similar measures, saying it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the cost of its data centers' electricity use and reduce the impact of its data center expansion on local residents.",

    "fullText": "With many unable to access or afford qualified therapists, AI is filling the mental healthcare vacuum, amid calls for tighter regulation\n\nOn a quiet evening in her Abuja hotel, Joy Adeboye, 23, sits on her bed clutching her phone, her mind racing and chest tightening. On her screen is yet another abusive message from her stalker – a man she had met nine months earlier at her church.\n\nHe had asked Adeboye out; when she declined, he began sending her intimidating, insulting and blackmailing messages on social media, as well as spreading false information about her online. There were even death threats.\n\nThe experience is taking its toll on her mental health, leaving her struggling to cope. Family and friends she confided in did not take it seriously, and she cannot afford in-person therapy or counselling. As the feeling of panic rose at the sight of his words, she turns to an alternative: a WhatsApp chatbot called Chat Kemi.\n\n“Good evening, Resilient Joy,” the bot types. “How are you today?”\n\n Adeboye hesitates, then starts typing: “Someone is defaming me online and threatening to kill me, because I refused to date him. I am depressed and confused. What should I do?”\n\nThe chatbot, which Adeboye had heard about at an event on gender-based violence run by an NGO, advises her to deactivate her social media accounts and provide all necessary information about the person making the threats to someone she trusts.\n\nFor the first time in months, Adeboye says, she felt less alone.\n\nAI platforms offering first-line mental health support have proliferated over the past year, with early trials in the US showing mixed results. In Nigeria, where AI has been embraced in many sectors and industries, a growing number of people turn to chatbots for virtual therapy.\n\nNigeria’s health system, including its mental health provision, has long been underfunded. Between 2015 and 2025, Nigeria has consistently spent less than 5% of its budget to healthcare, with 4.2% allocated for 2026, far less than the 15% target that African Union member states agreed to as part of the 2001 Abuja Declaration. It is not known how many people in Nigeria live with mental health conditions but, with only 262 psychiatrists in a country of 240 million people, most do not get adequate treatment.\n\nThe shortages have been exacerbated by the Trump administration dismantling USAID, which has badly hit services in Nigeria, especially at the primary level, having a devastating effect on patients in communities already struggling with HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and other health challenges. More than 90% of Nigerians have no health insurance, and now face uncertainty over access to services and feelings of helplessness over rising costs.\n\nPrivate healthcare is expensive; one therapy session can cost between 50,000 naira (£27) – the equivalent of a week’s worth of groceries. Cultural stigma remains strong; many Nigerians still associate mental illness with spiritual weakness or witchcraft.\n\nCommercial and nonprofit AI initiatives are starting to fill this vacuum. HerSafeSpace is an organisation that offers free and instant legal and emotional assistance to victims of technology-facilitated gender-based violence in five west and central African countries. Its Chat Kemi service is available in local and international languages.\n\n“These services don’t replace therapy,” says its founder, Abideen Olasupo. Instead, the chatbot uses a referral system to direct users and specific cases to mental health, legal or psychosocial professionals or organisations, should the need arise.\n\n“Our major objective is to support young girls, who are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially online,” he says.\n\nOther platforms in Nigeria offering similar services include FriendnPal, whose AI chatbot provides emotional support, matches patients with licensed therapists and includes mood tracking, psycho-education and ASMR tools to alleviate stress and anxiety.\n\nIts pay-as-you-go model gives users instant access to tailored therapy sessions that can include homework or assessments, according to Esther Eruchie, who created the service in response to the loss of her mother after years of depression caused by her 20-year-old brother’s death.\n\nAnother platform, Blueroomcare, connects clients with licensed therapists through video, voice, text and in-app messaging. It offers in-person outpatient and virtual care at partner clinics nationwide, includes a free wellness assessment, and charges between 5,000 and 51,000 naira for a therapist subscription plan.\n\n“Therapy was often too expensive, and there weren’t enough professionals to meet the demand,” says Moses Aiyenuro, who founded Blueroomcare after his own struggles with depression. “I wanted to build a platform that lowers the barriers to care.”\n\nThe technology used by these apps follows scripts written by licensed Nigerian psychologists and therapists who deliver care to users.\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakemi Oluwakayode, a mother of four, started using FriendnPal’s chatbot after watching her eight-year-old daughter endure frequent seizures due to cerebral palsy.\n\n“Sometimes, it gave very standard replies,” she admits. “But I could finally say things I couldn’t share with my family. That alone gave me relief.”\n\nLater, the app connected her with a licensed therapist – something she says she would never have considered without AI easing her into it.\n\nDr Joy Aifuobhokhan, a Lagos-based public health doctor, says these platforms’ advantage is that they are more affordable and efficient than conventional therapy. “Digital platforms save time otherwise spent preparing, commuting and waiting [to be seen] at physical consultation centres,” she says.\n\nBut some experts caution that AI cannot provide the same level of expertise as a qualified therapist. “These platforms borrow from clinical methods like CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] and mindfulness,” says Dr Nihinlola Olowe, a psychologist at Live Still Counselling Services, a Nigerian-based mental health practice.\n\n“They can be useful for coping, but they cannot replace the depth or judgment of professional care.”\n\nEruchie says FriendnPal has run more than 10,000 sessions in the past year, while Olasupo says HerSafeSpace has 1,600 users across three continents. Blueroomcare declined to say how many users it had.\n\nBut measuring the impact based on numbers alone is a challenge. “The real story lies in the engagement,” says Olasupo. “It’s exciting to see that users aren’t just using the app and leaving – they’re coming back again and again.”\n\nFor many patients, the immediacy and anonymity of a chatbot is key to its appeal but the ease of digital care could come at the cost of privacy. Avril Eyewu-Edero, a cybersecurity expert, believes that without introducing strong database protections in Nigeria, sensitive information – such as medical histories – becomes vulnerable the moment it enters an AI system.\n\n“If startups fail to prioritise privacy and encryption from the outset, adoption will stall. Nigerians are eager but wary,” she says.\n\nFounders of the services acknowledge these uncertainties, often highlighting their use of end-to-end encryption, unique codes that identify users or devices without including personally identifiable information, and strict non-sharing policies – even with government authorities, unless compelled by a court order.\n\nNow, medical professionals are calling on the Nigerian government to develop enforceable national standards for AI. Dr Alero Roberts, a public health consultant and lecturer at the University of Lagos’s medical college, says: “AI chatbots for mental health are an innovative solution, but without robust regulation, we are venturing blindly into potentially dangerous territory.\n\n“Robots can’t interpret human emotion as humans do. For people in crisis, like suicidal thoughts or psychosis, human contact is crucial. Someone, even a non-professional, can recognise the need for urgent intervention,” she says. “This is often lost with AI; strong governance is essential.”\n\nUnlike medicines or hospitals, AI mental health platforms operate in a regulatory grey zone. Nigeria’s 2023 Data Protection Act sets baseline privacy standards but lacks specific AI regulations for healthcare.\n\n“The main issue is enforcement, not a lack of laws,” says Ayotunde Abiodun of SBM Intelligence, a thinktank that provides analysis on political, economic and social issues in Nigeria and across west Africa.\n\nBabatunde Bamigboye, head of regulations at the Nigeria Data Protection Commission, a statutory body set up under the 2023 law, says: “Any use involving personal data must comply with the act. The framework focuses on data ethics, testing within sandboxes, and risk mitigation. AI in Nigeria is governed, but not via AI-specific laws.”\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakayode continues to use FriendnPal. One day, she hopes to afford in-person therapy, but for now, the bot is her companion.\n\n“I know it’s not a real human,” she says. “But at 2am, it feels like someone is there for me. And that’s enough to keep me going.”",

    "description": "Steve Yegge worked at Amazon an Google. Now, he predicts Big Tech companies will cut half their engineers to help pay for the others to have AI.",
    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

    "title": "AI CEO warns AI's disruption will be 'much bigger' than COVID: 'The people I care about deserve to hear what is coming'",
    "description": "Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that people in tech \"aren't making predictions. We're telling you what already occurred in our jobs.\"",
    "fullText": "It's never a good sign when a CEO warns something more disruptive than COVID is heading our way.\n\nIn an essay titled \"Something Big Is Happening,\" Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer said AI can now do all of his technical work — and he thinks your job could be next.\n\n\"I'm writing this for the people in my life who don't... my family, my friends, the people I care about who keep asking me 'so what's the deal with AI?' and getting an answer that doesn't do justice to what's actually happening,\" Shumer wrote in his nearly 5,000-word post published Tuesday on X.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, his post had 40 million views and 18,000 retweets. Shumer is a cofounder of OthersideAI, which features Hyperwrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\nShumer said that the reason people in tech \"are sounding the alarm\" is that they have already experienced what's coming for everyone else.\n\n\"We're not making predictions,\" he wrote. \"We're telling you what already occurred in our own jobs, and warning you that you're next.\"\n\nShumer said that many people outside tech wrote off AI years ago after a clunky experience with an early edition of ChatGPT.\n\n\"The models available today are unrecognizable from what existed even six months ago,\" he wrote. \"The debate about whether AI is 'really getting better' or 'hitting a wall' — which has been going on for over a year — is over.\"\n\nIt's not the time to panic, Shumer said. Instead, the best thing to do is to become deeply familiar with AI. \"This might be the most important year of your career,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I don't say that to stress you out. I say it because right now, there is a brief window where most people at most companies are still ignoring this,\" he wrote. \"The person who walks into a meeting and says 'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days' is going to be the most valuable person in the room.\"\n\nHe's far from alone in sounding the alarm. Despite disagreement from other tech leaders, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei remains adamant that AI could wipe out up to half of white collar, entry-level jobs in the next one to five years.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk and others have warned that if your job doesn't involve physical labor, it's likely to be replaced by AI much more quickly, a view that dovetails with a growing base of economic research.\n\nShumer's essay struck a chord, especially with those in tech. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian replied, \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\n\"Great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now,\" A16z general partner David Haber wrote.\n\nGreat advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\n\n“I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days\" is going to be the most valuable person in the room. Not eventually. Right now. Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's… https://t.co/cBq5s1AH4Y\n\nWhile the response to the post has been overwhelmingly positive, some X users pointed out the limitations still present in many current AI products, like hallucinations and general inaccuracies.\n\nShumer said that this moment feels like February 2020, when in a short span of time, news of a spreading pandemic gave way to a worldwide upheaval unseen in modern times that continues to reverberate to this day.\n\nThe potential of what AI will change, he wrote, is \"much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nFor Shumer, this moment of realization came with the recent dueling releases of Anthropic's Opus 4.6 and OpenAI's GPT-5.3 Codex. Both models are primarily aimed at software engineering. OpenAI said in its release notes that GPT-5.3 Codex \"is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\n\n\"It wasn't just executing my instructions,\" Shumer wrote of his experience with OpenAI's latest Codex model. \"It was making intelligent decisions. It had something that felt, for the first time, like judgment. Like taste. The inexplicable sense of knowing what the right call is that people always said AI would never have.\"\n\nAI is now so intelligent, Shumer said, that he can tell the agent what he wants and \"walk away from my computer for four hours, and come back to find the work done. Done well.\"\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn Wednesday morning, Shumer addressed his viral X post.\n\n\"Every time someone asks me what's going on with AI, I give them the safe answer,\" he wrote on Wednesday. \"Because the real one sounds insane. I'm done doing that.\"",

    "description": "Meta's Threads introduces Dear Algo, an AI feature for personalized feeds, as it surpasses 400 million monthly users and outpaces X in daily usage.",
    "fullText": "Threads, Meta's X-like social network, rolled out a feature that lets users tell the app's algorithm what they want to see more or less of in their feed.\n\nThe feature, called Dear Algo, works like this: you write a public Threads post starting with \"Dear Algo,\" followed by a request, such as asking to see less about a TV show you're not caught up on yet, for instance, or more about your favorite basketball team during a live game. The algorithm then adjusts your feed for three days based on what you asked for, and you can delete that request if you want. You can also repost someone else's Dear Algo request to try out their preferences.\n\n\"We think we can do a better job by going deep with individuals on what they want to see more and less of,\" said Connor Hayes, Meta's head of Threads.\n\nIn a blog post about the announcement, Meta described Dear Algo as \"an AI-powered feature that gives you more control over what you see by letting you tell Threads what's important to you in the moment.\"\n\nHayes also said that Threads will reject queries that don't meet Meta's recommendation guidelines or content principles.\n\nThreads teased the feature back in December, framing it as a response to a trend Meta had noticed: people were already posting to ask their algorithms to change what showed up in their feeds.\n\nFor years, people have blamed algorithmic timelines for pulling users into echo chambers, rewarding rage bait over substance, and turning a quick scroll into doomscrolling. Dear Algo could give users back some agency.\n\n\"The best algorithms are personalized,\" Hayes said, adding that what works for one user won't work \"at scale.\"\n\nDear Algo arrives at an interesting moment for Threads. The app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, and on its latest earnings call, Meta said time spent on it jumped 20% in the fourth quarter of 2025. A recent report from analytics firm Similarweb found that Threads had edged out X in daily mobile usage. And in January, Meta started running ads, a sign it sees Threads as a real business.\n\nThe feature also provides a glimpse into the company's broader AI ambitions. On Meta's latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is working on merging large language models with the recommendation systems that power Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and its ad system.\n\nThe company's recommendation systems are \"already driving meaningful growth,\" Zuckerberg said on the call. He added that \"the current systems are primitive compared to what will be possible soon.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "title": "Death isn't the end: Meta patented an AI that lets you keep posting from beyond the grave",
    "description": "Meta was recently granted a patent for tech to keep your social media accounts running using AI if you take a break or die.",
    "fullText": "Does Meta want to make our social media accounts immortal?\n\nThe company was granted a patent in late December that outlines how a large language model can \"simulate\" a person's social media activity, such as responding to content posted by real people.\n\n\"The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased,\" the patent says.\n\nAndrew Bosworth, Meta's CTO, is listed as the primary author of the patent, which was first filed in 2023.\n\n\"We have no plans to move forward with this example,\" a spokesperson for Meta told Business Insider.\n\nIn the patent, Meta lays out why it thinks people might need this.\n\nIf you're no longer posting online — whether that's because you need a break from social media or … you … die — your followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.\n\n\"The impact on the users is much more severe and permanent if that user is deceased and can never return to the social networking platform,\" the document says.\n\nTo fill that void, Meta would essentially create a digital clone of your social media presence, training a model on \"user-specific\" data — including historical platform activity, such as comments, likes, or content — to understand how you would (or rather, did) behave.\n\nThat clone can then respond to other people's content by liking and commenting, or responding to DMs. For influencers or creators who make their livelihoods on Meta's platforms and need to take a break from social media, such a tool could be useful.\n\nMeta's patent also references tech that would allow the LLM to simulate video or audio calls with users.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said that while it files patents to disclose concepts, a granted patent does not always mean the company will pursue, develop, or implement that tech.\n\nStill, it opens up many questions about the nature of tech — and grief. An AI bot that acts as your understudy while you're on a digital detox is one thing, but imitating people who've died?\n\nEdina Harbinja, a UK-based professor at the University of Birmingham's Law School, has concerns.\n\n\"It does affect not just legal issues, but a lot of very important social, ethical, and deeply philosophical issues as well,\" Harbinja, who specializes in digital rights and post-mortem privacy, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta has thought about managing digital legacies for years.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Facebook launched tools that let people designate a \"legacy contact\" to manage their accounts if they died. And back in the company's metaverse days, in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Mark Zuckerberg discussed virtual avatars for deceased people.\n\n\"If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful,\" Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\nThere are a lot of names for this broader category of tech — death bots, ghost bots, grief tech — that are aiming to help people face the loss of loved ones with eternally memorialized digital versions of them.\n\nSeveral startups have launched around this premise, and many have emerged from founders' own experiences with grief. Replika, an AI chatbot startup, was founded in 2015 by Eugenia Kuyda after the loss of her friend. Then there's You, Only Virtual (YOV), which was founded in 2020 by Justin Harrison when his mother was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"Everybody in the tech world has been thinking about this for a while, as soon as we started having breaks in generative AI,\" Harrison said.\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft patented an AI chatbot that could simulate a deceased person (as well as fictional characters or celebrities).\n\nMeta's patent signals that the technology category is moving more into the mainstream, Harbinja said.\n\nHarrison isn't surprised to see bigger tech companies dipping their toes in the space, and sees it as a sign that people are beginning to \"feel more comfortable with doing this.\"\n\n\"We can only improve on what we offer people,\" Harrison said, adding that the resources for grieving are \"horrible\" to begin with.\n\n\"I think we have a moral obligation, if we have the potential, to do more for those folks than we should be,\" he said.\n\nAI, death, and grief are not easy topics to digest, however. The intersection of all three is a potent brew of taboos ripe for a philosophical debate on ethics, digital rights, and privacy for any dinner table.\n\nMeta has more than helping people process grief as an incentive to pursue the tech it lays out in its patent, especially for accounts taking a break.\n\n\"It's more engagement, more content, more data — more data for the current and the future AI,\" Harbinja said. \"I can see the business incentive for that. I'm just curious to see how they would, when, and if they will implement this innovation.\"\n\nDepending on how a product like this is rolled out, different questions could come up.\n\nFor instance, would this apply across all of Meta's apps? Would it understand the nuance of your WhatsApp presence vs. the candor you have in the Instagram comment section?\n\nJoseph Davis, a sociology professor at the University of Virginia, said he was concerned with the impact that tools like a Meta bot could have on how humans experience grief.\n\n\"One of the tasks of grief is to face the actual loss,\" Davis said.\n\n\"Let the dead be dead,\" Davis added. \"The idea of bringing them back, but you're not really doing that, but in fact, it looks like that. That's the confusion.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at sbradley@businessinsider.com or Signal at sydneykbradley.123.

    "fullText": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a delayed January jobs report on Wednesday, beating economists expectations and showing the US economy added 130,000 jobs in the first month of 2026.\n\nMark Zandi says don't get comfortable with the upbeat data.\n\nThe figure is substantially higher than the 75,000 jobs that economists anticipated, but the Moody's Analytics economist isn't optimistic that the growth will continue.\n\nZandi has repeatedly warned that the US economy is on shaky ground, and could tumble into a recession. In a post on X on Wednesday, he said that the latest jobs data didn't do anything to ease his concerns.\n\n\"The job market remains fragile and highly vulnerable,\" he said. \"Yes, payroll employment increased by 130,000 in January, but given the big downward revisions to history, there has been no job growth since last April (Liberation Day).\"\n\nZandi also highlighted that almost all the January jobs growth came from the healthcare industry, something he doesn't think bodes well for the broader US economy.\n\n\"Without healthcare, the economy would be losing lots of jobs and unemployment headed higher,\" he told Business Insider. \"There are good reasons why healthcare is adding jobs, but it shows how vulnerable the job market and economy are if healthcare stumbled or even slowed its hiring.\"\n\nThat's not his only concern. Zandi also warned that a fragile labor market could be further compromised by the impact of AI, something he thinks is approaching quickly. While AI hasn't yet appeared in macro data, Zandi maintains that it is likely to change in the near future.\n\nThe economist added that he thinks rising layoffs will be the clearest indication that the labor market is starting to crack. Companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Pinterest have announced steep job cuts recently, and layoffs throughout the economy touched the highest level since 2009 last month.\n\n\"The best real-time measure of layoffs is weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance,\" Zandi added. \"They are running close to 225k per week, which is low. If they rise above 250k on a consistent basis, the job market is in trouble.\"",

    "description": "From drafting documents to reclaiming family time, these solopreneurs explain how AI is changing the way they work, decide, and lead their businesses.",
    "fullText": "When Pete Srodoski meets with a new executive coaching client these days, he can do more in-depth work more quickly, thanks to ChatGPT.\n\nSrodoski, who founded the coaching firm Roll With the Punches in 2021, used to spend hours with clients discussing what should be included in strategic documents. Now, he uses ChatGPT to draft those documents alongside his clients in about 10 minutes.\n\nWith AI handling the initial framework, Srodoski and his clients can jump right into fine-tuning strategic plans and key job descriptions.\n\n\"That allows us to go deeper, go further, actually take those plans and make actionable items,\" he tells Business Insider.\n\nSrodoski is one of three solopreneurs who spoke with Business Insider about how they're using AI to streamline mundane decision-making — like writing initial drafts, formatting emails, or editing social media posts. The time and mental energy saved allows them to focus on the most critical decisions for their businesses and their clients, they say.\n\n\"We want to make the most impact for our time,\" Srodoski says — and AI can help.\n\nGeorgia Fort, founder of Stories by Georgia Fort, is an independent journalist in Minnesota who started using AI about 18 months ago. She uses ChatGPT to format her newsletters and social media posts, and OpusClip to edit videos for social media.\n\nShe estimates that using those services has freed five to ten hours in her workweek — time that she can now apply to the in-depth reporting she's known for.\n\nUltimately, \"the biggest impact is increased output,\" Fort says. With AI assistance, she's able to post more content on social media and release newsletters regularly, something she struggled with in the past.\n\nAn added bonus, she says, is that utilizing AI makes it just a bit easier to find the work-life balance that many solopreneurs struggle with.\n\n\"If nothing else, it's a meal I get to sit down and have with my kids,\" Fort says.\n\nDusti Arab, owner of The Reinvention Co., a boutique marketing firm, says AI is integrated into nearly every aspect of her workday. Because of that, \"I don't think I've put up so much high-quality content, ever,\" she says.\n\nFor Arab, who has ADHD, managing the constant decisions that a solopreneur must make was draining. She would often worry about missing a small detail, which distracted her from higher-level thinking.\n\nNow, she uses Wispr Flow to take voice notes throughout the day on topics like client communications and content ideas. Then, she imports those into Notion AI, which combines access to Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT to help her turn her notes into briefs.\n\n\"If you use AI to process the brain dump first, the deliverable comes out way better,\" Arab says.\n\nHer efforts with AI and being vocal about how she uses it are also paying off in a different way — clients now reach out to her specifically for advice on how to use it. She often guides them in using AI to delegate more effectively.\n\n\"Once the raw notes exist, you can use AI to turn the brain dump into a clear brief, a task list, and a handoff that someone else can actually execute,\" she says.\n\nLike Arab, Srodoski is often the one to introduce his clients to AI, specifically ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, the platforms he uses. Often, the response is \"awe,\" he says.\n\nLast week, for example, a client shared that the time involved with pricing jobs had become a major roadblock in his business. Using ChatGPT, Srodoski guided him in creating a price book based on the previous three years' sales data.\n\n\"He was smiling ear to ear, saying that this would have cost him a few thousand dollars and a few weeks of labor time to get this pulled off,\" Srodoski says.\n\nWhile clients are often enthusiastic about AI, part of Srodoski's coaching is now emphasizing the decisions that leaders shouldn't outsource to AI.\n\nRecently, he had a client who wanted to confront an underperforming vendor. The client was planning to draft an email using ChatGPT, but Srodoski stopped him.\n\n\"Get on the phone. See how they respond,\" he recalls saying. During the phone call, Srodoski's client was able to explain himself, empathize with the vendor, clarify a misunderstanding, and create a solution.\n\n\"That's a leadership decision you can't do with ChatGPT,\" Srodoski says.",

    "fullText": "Joshua Bonehill-Paine revealed as owner of X account known for videos depicting politicians such as Keir Starmer\n\nThe person behind an anonymous social media account that posts AI videos of UK politicians has been identified as a man who has spent time in prison for multiple hate crimes directed towards Jewish people.\n\nJoshua Bonehill-Paine was identified by Channel 4 News as the owner of Crewkerne Gazette, a satirical X account that created AI videos depicting politicians such as Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham apparently singing popular songs from artists such as Amy Winehouse, Barry Manilow and Elton John with altered, politically themed lyrics.\n\nBonehill-Paine, 33, who has previously described himself as a “nationalist, fascist, theorist and supporter of white rights”, has a long history of discriminatory behaviour. This has included perpetuating fake stories such as a pub in Leicestershire refusing to admit members of the armed forces so as to not offend immigrants, and a six-year-old being abducted by an Asian grooming gang in Croydon.\n\nBonehill-Paine told the Guardian he no longer held antisemitic views, providing proof that he had passed the government’s Prevent awareness course and that he had worked in counter-extremism education.\n\nHe has described himself online as now holding “a deep affection for Israel”.\n\nIn early 2015 Bonehill-Paine attempted to organise a mass protest in Stamford Hill, north London, to rally “against the complete Jewification of the borough”, and later in the year tried to organise another in Golders Green, an area of the city with a large Jewish population.\n\nHe promoted the latter with a cartoon image of Hitler and wrote that the event would be “an absolute gas”. He was sentenced to three years and four months in jail for inciting hatred against Jews.\n\nLater, in 2016, he was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment for abuse directed at the then Labour MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, which included posting messages to his blog calling Berger “a rodent”, “evil money-grabber” and “a dominatrix”, and uploading an image of a rat with Berger’s face superimposed over it. He was jailed for another two years, which was added to his existing sentence.\n\nBonehill-Paine said on Wednesday he was “extremely sorry for the pain and distress” he had caused Berger, and he hoped she could forgive him for his past actions, but had not reached out to her directly as he did not “want to alarm or distress her, even after a decade has passed”.\n\nThe Crewkerne Gazette’s work has been lauded by publications such as the Sun, which featured a video created by the account showing Rayner rapping to a grime beat during her tax scandal.\n\nThe Times called him the “Banksy of politics” and GB News interviewed Bonehill-Paine, who went by the online alias of Crewkerne Man, on air three days before his identity and past were uncovered.\n\nThe account’s work has also been highlighted by politicians including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who shared a video from it on X, and Adam Dance, the Liberal Democrat MP for Yeovil, where Crewkerne is based. Dance also said on an episode of BBC Sunday Politics West that Bonehill-Paine’s work was a positive example of engaging audiences with politics.\n\nWhen asked about Bonehill-Paine’s identity, Dance said he was not aware of who was behind the Crewkerne Gazette account at the time of his comments, which were “about the transparent use of AI in politics, not about endorsing any individual. I absolutely condemn antisemitism and harassment in all its forms, and I do not support the person now revealed to be behind that account.”.\n\nIn a YouTube video Bonehill-Paine posted on Tuesday he expressed regret for his past comments towards the Jewish community.. He said: “I felt very angry at how I had treated the Jewish community in this country. I wanted to do something to rectify it, so I began working in counter-extremism education.”\n\nHe added: “I went across the country to colleges, schools, universities, working with the probation service, the police service, to try to help prevent other people from following in my footsteps.”\n\nHe later told Channel 4 News: “What I am going to do is to continue doing what I’ve done for the last five years, six years, which is counter-extremism work, working to prevent people following in my footsteps, hopefully stopping people from making the same mistakes that I’ve done.”",

    "title": "Meta announces plans to build 1-gigawatt data center in Indiana as part of AI build-out",
    "description": "Meta says it will build a new 1-gigawatt data center in Indiana, its second in the state.",
    "fullText": "Meta (META) on Wednesday said it is breaking ground on its latest data center as part of its massive AI infrastructure build-out.\n\nThe more than $10 billion data center will be located in Lebanon, Ind., and have a capacity of upwards of 1 gigawatt. That's enough energy to power several hundred thousand homes.\n\nAccording to Meta, the data center will handle both Meta's AI workloads as well as its core products and represents one of its largest infrastructure projects to date.\n\nDuring its Q4 earnings announcement, Meta said it plans to spend as much as $135 billion throughout 2026 as part of its AI expansion plans. The company spent $72.2 billion in 2025. The social media giant isn't the only tech company sending big on AI this year. Advertising rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) said it plans to spend $180 billion in 2026 during its own earnings report, while Amazon (AMZN) said it anticipates spending $200 billion.\n\nThe massive spending news spooked Google and Amazon investors and lifted shares of Meta more than 10% at the time, though they've since come back down to Earth.\n\nThe broader data center explosion is facing increasing criticism from residents in and around communities where they're being built, with complaints ranging from increasing utility costs to the irritating sounds of cooling systems.\n\nTo that end, Meta says it will pay the full cost of the energy the data center uses, provide $1 million each year for 20 years to the Boone REMC Community Fund to assist with energy bills, and fund emergency water utility assistance. The data center will also use a closed-loop water system that Meta says will use no water \"a majority of the year.\"\n\nThe company further says it will invest more than $120 million in water infrastructure for Lebanon, as well as make upgrades to roads, transmission lines, and area utilities.\n\nMeta isn't the only company looking to make concessions to win over local communities. Last month, Microsoft president Brad Smith announced that the Windows developer will work with local utilities to provide a better understanding of its data center electricity needs and “bear the cost” when electricity companies need to upgrade their transmission capabilities to meet data center demand.\n\nIn August, Google agreed to cut back on its electricity usage during periods of high demand in certain regions, Reuters reported.\n\nMeta's ambitious AI construction plans aren't limited to single-gigawatt data centers. In July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is set to build its enormous Hyperion facility in Louisiana, adding that the data center will be so large it would cover a large portion of Manhattan and will eventually scale up to support upwards of 5 gigawatts of capacity.",

    "description": "A new study found that AI in the workplace expanded tasks outside one's job description and blurred the line between work and time off.",
    "fullText": "If you think using AI means doing less at work, think again.\n\nIn a new eight-month study of how generative AI changed work habits at a US-based tech company with about 200 employees, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business found that employees' work intensified in three main ways.\n\nEmployees multitasked more, took on a broader range of responsibilities, and worked longer hours, often without being asked to do so.\n\nAruna Ranganathan, a professor in management at UC Berkeley, and Xingqi Maggie Ye, a Ph.D. student at the Haas School of Business, detailed their research in a Harvard Business Review story, writing that once AI tools became available, workers began to usurp each other's roles, feed information to AI during meetings, and correct each other's vibe coding projects.\n\nRanganathan and Ye said that workers \"described this as 'just trying things' with the AI, but these experiments accumulated into a meaningful widening of job scope. In fact, workers increasingly absorbed work that might previously have justified additional help or head count.\"\n\n\"Once the excitement of experimenting fades, workers can find that their workload has quietly grown and feel stretched from juggling everything that's suddenly on their plate. That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making,\" they wrote. \"The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work, turnover, and other problems.\"\n\nThe researchers wrote that many workers also send prompts to AI before leaving their desk for a meeting or for lunch break, so AI could continue to work without supervision.\n\n\"These actions rarely felt like doing more work, yet over time they produced a workday with fewer natural pauses and a more continuous involvement with work,\" Ranganathan and Ye added.\n\nIn an October 2025 interview with Rowan Cheung, who hosts the Rowan's Notes interview series, Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, also shared ways in which AI may have made his work more intense.\n\n\"It's almost like, I don't think I can come up with ideas fast enough anymore,\" Altman told Cheung.\n\n\"I really do have a hard time trying to reason through exactly what this is going to mean,\" Altman added. \"I think it will mean that stuff just happens faster and that you can try a lot more stuff and figure out the better ideas quickly.\"",

In recent years, Alphabet has made significant strides in AI, launching Gemini 3 in 2025 as its most advanced model yet, requiring less prompting and delivering smarter responses.\n\nOther advances include the Ironwood AI chip (its seventh-generation TPU) for scaling large models, Gemma 3 for efficient open-source AI, SIMA 2 for AI agents in 3D worlds, and integrations like AI Mode in Search and Gemini Robotics for physical interactions. These innovations bolster its cloud and ad businesses amid the AI boom.\n\nAlphabet's stock is up 1% year-to-date (YTD), just slightly underperforming the S&P 500's ($SPX) 1.89% YTD gain, but over the past year, GOOGL has surged 69%, far exceeding the index's 15% return. Valuation metrics show a trailing P/E of 30.65, a forward P/E of 29.64, and a price/sales of 9.93. Compared to its 10-year historical average P/E of 27.69, it currently trades 7% higher, suggesting a premium. Versus peers (average P/E 31.5x), it's attractive but expensive relative to the interactive media industry average of 12x.",

    "description": "Of the 240 financial services CEO that EY surveyed, more than half said AI investments have shown results faster than expected.",
    "fullText": "Banks' analyst classes probably won't swap fresh-faced college grads for bots — at least not this year.\n\nSome 60% of the 240 financial services CEOs that EY surveyed for its Quarterly CEO Outlook Survey said they think investing in AI will maintain or even increase their current head count in 2026. Only 28% of those surveyed predicted head count would drop this year.\n\nLeaders at some of the biggest banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have said that they're resisting hiring growth where it makes sense to prioritize efficiency. They, along with some other bulge-bracket leads, have predicted that AI could grow head count in the long run, though. Still, some roles are becoming obsolete: Citi CEO Jane Fraser said in a recent internal memo that some jobs \"will no longer be required\" as AI advances.\n\nFor their part, the financial services CEOs that EY surveyed are similarly bullish about AI's capacity to transform the workplace, and nearly half see AI and digital investment as the most important factor in their companies' ability to thrive and adapt this year.\n\nAround a quarter said their AI initiatives have significantly beaten expectations, and 57% said they've shown results faster than expected. Just more than half said they expect the biggest transformations to come from generative AI.\n\nWhen it comes to hiring for AI talent — itself a highly competitive market — 87% of CEOs in EY's survey are optimistic about their ability to attract and keep talent in 2026. The question of returns on the AI investment, for talent and in general, also seems top of mind for the financial services leaders. Seventy-six percent of boards in the survey said they'll review transformation ROI metrics as often as financial results.\n\nFirms of all sizes are being asked to justify their AI spends, as analysts and investors begin to wonder whether the sometimes billion-dollar bets will show up on balance sheets.",

    "description": "The tech giant's internal policy promotes an in-house tool called Kiro over Anthropic's Claude Code. Some Amazon engineers are unhappy about this.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing the startup's AI models and products to customers.\n\nInside Amazon, however, employees aren't allowed to use Anthropic's Claude Code for production work or for live products without formal approval.\n\nThat disconnect became more visible late last year, when Amazon rolled out internal guidance steering teams toward Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant, according to internal messages seen by Business Insider. The guidance encourages using Kiro over non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, for production code.\n\nThe policy prompted criticism across internal Amazon forums. In one discussion thread, roughly 1,500 Amazon employees endorsed the formal adoption of Claude Code, according to the messages.\n\nThe restrictions have been particularly awkward for engineers who help sell AWS Bedrock, Amazon's platform that offers customers access to third-party AI services, including Claude Code. Some questioned how they could credibly promote a product they are not permitted to use themselves in official work.\n\n\"Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,\" one employee wrote.\n\nThe episode highlights the complexity of Amazon's relationship with Anthropic. While Amazon is racing to build and promote its own AI tools, it is also marketing a partner's competing technology. Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors, with a stake valued at more than $60 billion. Anthropic, in turn, is a major AWS customer, committing to use Amazon's cloud services and at least one million of Amazon's Trainium chips.\n\n\"We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.\"\n\nAmazon maintains \"a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,\" and while there's no explicit ban on Claude Code, the company applies \"stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.\n\nAn Anthropic spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one of the internal forums, an Amazon sales engineer flagged the irony of being asked to sell Claude Code even though it isn't formally supported inside the company. The employee wrote that they need to be able to \"use, demo, and build\" with Claude Code to support Amazon's directive to get more customers to use it through AWS Bedrock.\n\nOther Amazon engineers also debated whether the emphasis on Kiro was hindering productivity. Some argued that Claude Code outperformed Amazon's in-house tool and warned that forcing adoption of a weaker product could slow development.\n\n\"A tool that can't keep pace with rivals offers no real innovation,\" one of the Amazon employees wrote. \"And without competitive strength, Kiro's only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.\"\n\nClaude Code has become one of the most widely used AI coding services, and it underpins many other similar offerings from other providers. An Amazon spokesperson said about 70% of the company's software engineers used Kiro at least once in January.\n\nIn one forum thread, a manager overseeing Amazon's internal developer tools said he understood the \"frustration\" and \"significant\" interest in Claude Code, citing about 1,500 internal endorsements calling for its formal adoption.\n\nSome employees said frustration deepened after Amazon had previously indicated that Claude Code had cleared security and legal review for production use, according to an internal guideline and messages reviewed by Business Insider. That language was later edited and removed, employees said.\n\nOthers criticized the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally adopt Claude Code, asking what data informed the decision.\n\n\"The trend is clear,\" one employee wrote internally. \"More and more people would like to start using Claude Code and be officially supported by Amazon.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Aspiring computer science student Alex Seungyong Yang sees AI as both a challenge and opportunity as he enters university as a freshman in the fall.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alex Seungyong Yang, an 18-year-old high school senior, based in Seoul. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs an incoming university freshman and the founder of an AI research startup, AI feels like a double-edged sword.\n\nI started my AI research and development startup with other students around the world, and AI has been amazing for us. It's allowed us to push further and think about achieving things we couldn't have imagined. On the other hand, I'm pursuing a computer science major this fall, and I keep hearing that computer science jobs are being replaced by AI.\n\nNo one has explicitly told me that pursuing computer science is a complete waste of time, but many people around me have expressed concerns about the risks it entails. I think those concerns point to something valid.\n\nSimply learning how to code no longer guarantees a stable or well-defined career path, but there are still many opportunities by staying within what I would call the \"eye of the typhoon\" and studying these machines, even if they are increasingly unpredictable.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2026, the tech industry changed so much. Last year, there was still a broad sense of expansion and experimentation, startups, new tools, and huge model launches. Now, what feels dominant is resource concentration in capital, compute, and top talent, along with a narrowing focus on AI infrastructure.\n\nThis kind of acceleration makes it so that one year doesn't feel like just a single year anymore. I think that computer science, engineering, and very technical majors are the only majors that can fully understand how this industry is changing and the direction of that change.\n\nI think the important part of studying computer science isn't about basic coding or programming; it's understanding the logic behind it and the framework that can be applied anywhere, anytime, wherever we are with technology. It's all about solving the problem, and I think that kind of talent is most relevant in the AI era.\n\nStudying computer science will help me adapt more flexibly and with greater urgency in my career. I want to use the knowledge from my degree to develop a niche kind of talent rather than simply following a very conventional pathway and becoming another factory-made worker.\n\nBeing unemployed or unable to find a job used to be the most obvious failure. Now, given how frequently unemployment is already happening around us, I don't think it can even be considered the greatest failure anymore. To me, the biggest failure would be an inability to adapt, and if we become irrelevant as technology advances.\n\nA small number of people or companies can now build and deploy things at a scale that used to require much larger organizations. Rather than only preparing for predefined roles, I spend time now and will continue to during my degree, building real systems, contributing to research, and working on projects where the constraints are unclear and the outcomes are uncertain.\n\nI see my computer science degree as a way to build depth, judgment, and adaptability rather than just technical skills.\n\nI don't see this as a guaranteed strategy, and I'm still learning what truly matters, but I hope that developing this ability in specific domains matters the most. I'm in competition with AI, but it's equally a competition with other people. I want to become an irreplaceable person, not just with AI, but also relative to other people.\n\nMany peers around me who are pursuing computer science and working on startups believe this is actually the easiest era to start something and succeed. Some majors naturally keep people closer to the frontier of change. I believe studying computer science, engineering, or mathematics trains you to reason from first principles, work with abstraction, and stay comfortable with uncertainty.\n\nThose habits matter more than any specific technical skills, which may quickly become outdated. Because the underlying skills are transferable, people in these fields may be better positioned to adapt when conditions change, even if the direction of change is unclear.\n\nI'm excited to pursue computer science, even though it might be uncertain how it will turn out. Things may become more complex, demanding, and challenging than I can anticipate, but I still believe there will be abundant opportunities for those who are willing to adapt, go deep, and continuously redefine their value.\n\nDo you have a story to share about higher education and AI?

    "description": "Some bigger firms are using AI to embrace a classic startup mentality to quickly identify what works — and cast aside what doesn't.",
    "fullText": "For some companies building with AI, failure isn't a setback. It's the strategy.\n\nOkta, Salesforce, Snowflake, Blackstone, and others are rapidly launching AI products, fully expecting that not all of them will pan out. Executives say they can't afford to meticulously test ideas in isolation if they want to outpace their competitors, and AI makes it easy to deploy new offerings at scale anyway.\n\n\"It's increased the pace of what's possible,\" said Eric Kelleher, president and chief operating officer of digital-identity company Okta, which has rolled out around 120 AI pilots and features over the past two years, keeping half and scrapping the rest. \"You can spin up a lot more pilots at the same time.\"\n\nThis so-called fail-fast method isn't new, as tech startups have been doing it for decades. It's now gaining traction among larger, established businesses due to the AI boom.\n\nLeaders say they're under pressure from their boards and shareholders to justify their AI spending, and that the fail-fast approach is helping them meet the moment.\n\n\"The stakes are higher, the risks are bigger, and to keep pace with the innovation churn, we need to fail faster than ever,\" Cisco's senior vice president and global innovation officer, Guy Diedrich, told Business Insider.\n\nFor some companies, fail fast isn't just a mindset — it represents a new reality driven by AI efficiency gains.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said the cloud-data platform company has rolled out numerous pilot programs, often moving from a planning meeting on Monday to a demo by Friday. With its agentic support system, he said, many cases that once took hours to debug can now be resolved in about 20 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, something like preparing a customer briefing for an executive used to take hours. Now, Ramaswamy said, it can be done in a minute by asking a sales agent.\n\nJohn Stecher, the chief technology officer at Blackstone, told Business Insider that the \"fail fast\" mindset has long been a mainstay in the engineering world, but AI tools have enabled companies to accelerate development timelines.\n\n\"Our software engineers, by quantifiable metrics, are about 2x more effective than they were in 2024 with writing code,\" Stecher said, adding that they now have the ability to deliver faster and higher quality work.\n\nHe said the \"blocking-and-tackling part of software development and engineering,\" including tasks like writing unit tests and higher-quality code, allows engineers to \"deploy more robust,\" reliable, and secure code, so that workers spend less time fixing bugs and more time building. That increase in productivity allows teams to build prototypes more quickly and launch them to users faster.\n\nRamaswamy similarly said that a lot of the heavy lifting on engineering teams for tasks like boilerplate code, tests, and migrations happens much faster. That frees workers to spend more time on tasks that require judgment, architecture, and design, he said.\n\nMoving at warp speed comes with risks, however.\n\nLast year, Salesforce launched an AI agent designed to answer customer queries, and it recommended a competitor's application to a user. The user then wrote about the snafu on LinkedIn, said Joe Inzerillo, president of enterprise and AI at the software company.\n\nAnother time, one of Salesforce's newly released AI agents provided a customer with false information gleaned from old web pages that had been removed from its website but were still crawlable by search engines. The error was discovered during a review of conversations the agent was having with users.\n\nThough both incidents exposed early-stage gaps to users, Inzerillo said they also revealed important insights into how users interact with the products and how experiences can be improved. \"We're going into every single deployment as an experiment to try to learn something,\" said Inzerillo.\n\nThe consequences of failing fast, however, can be worse if companies overlook important security measures.\n\nStecher said companies in general shouldn't necessarily deploy more products just because they can now do so more easily. He said firms need a \"robust checks and balances\" system and have data privacy and security controls in place from the get-go, or they'll pay the price with outages or cyber issues.\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy said that while the \"fail fast\" concept is reappearing, the current version is \"less about recklessness and more about shortening the feedback loop.\" He said the phrase \"iterating rapidly\" is a more accurate way to describe the company's approach to building with AI.\n\n\"We identify areas that we know are going to be generally positively impacted by AI, but set up small, almost weekly, goals,\" Ramaswamy said. \"This way, we can adjust and know when things are working well and when we need to course correct.\"",

    "description": "AI agents could eventually take on a lot of tasks done by humans. Yet hallucinations present a challenge currently, says a former Google exec.",
    "fullText": "Despite some CEOs' enthusiasm, AI agents aren't always up to the task.\n\nAgents are software programs that can perform tasks independently, such as reconciling an invoice, so that a person doesn't have to. Sounds great, right? That's why companies are plugging agents into tasks across sales, finance, supply chains, and engineering.\n\nYet while agentic systems can be effective at completing discrete tasks, they can be fragile at scale.\n\nErrors can quickly become a bottleneck if hallucinations multiply when agents interact, said Nicolas Darveau-Garneau, a former Google executive and author of the book \"Be a Sequoia, Not a Bonsai.\"\n\nIf a single agent has a 5% hallucination rate, then it's hard to daisy-chain multiple agents without a high risk of errors. That's because the risk increases exponentially, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The only way we get massive productivity gains is the day that we can trust that the AI is not hallucinating a lot,\" Darveau-Garneau said.\n\nFor now, he said, that's why general-purpose, autonomous agentic AI is largely aspirational.\n\nNevertheless, hallucinations are something that Darveau-Garneau expects will be \"mostly solved\" five years from now.\n\nIf that happens, he said, the productivity gains of 10% to 30% that some companies are getting from AI could be far greater — perhaps on the order of 10x to 100x.\n\nThose gains matter because the bigger they get, the more likely it becomes that companies will reorganize their operations, including the possibility of needing fewer employees.\n\nEven if companies don't cut staff, many roles — especially desk jobs — are likely to change.\n\nThe challenge of scaling agents and AI broadly is one reason Darveau-Garneau expects companies to still need some humans in jobs that sometimes appear to be endangered, like coding.\n\nAn excellent software engineer, he said, might be 30% to 40% more productive with AI. It's a nice lift, Darveau-Garneau said, but not a reason for a company to get rid of all its engineers.\n\nWorkers are understandably fearful of losing their jobs to AI, especially when leaders emphasize productivity gains, he said.\n\nDarveau-Garneau said that the CEO's primary job when it comes to AI is to create the right environment for adoption — including training and making sure that employees feel \"psychologically safe.\"\n\nThat's why, he said, leaders would be wise to reframe the conversation to say they want to double a company's size, for example, while increasing the employee base by 30%, rather than suggesting they deploy AI and cut 20% of the staff.\n\nOne challenge for many leaders has been understanding what new roles will look like thanks to AI, Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of strategy at Accenture, told Business Insider.\n\nThat is proving difficult, at least in part, because some current job descriptions may change, and other jobs may become redundant. Still others will have to be \"radically redefined,\" he said.\n\n\"What companies have been doing, by and large, is putting AI in the hands of people in their existing roles with existing tasks,\" Ashraf said.\n\nThat might mean automating some tasks or using AI to supercharge how someone searches for information or how quickly they can conduct a competitive analysis.\n\n\"But how does that fundamentally change my day?\" he said.\n\nCompanies have struggled, Ashraf said, if they've tended to think about adopting AI within their current ways of working, rather than redesigning the organization with an eye toward future jobs.\n\n\"It's not about layering AI on existing roles. It's about rethinking all of these processes and activities,\" he said.\n\nDespite the challenge of redesigning how companies are set up, Ashraf said it's encouraging that many C-suite leaders recognize the need to help their workers build the skills needed to prepare for the changes stemming from companies' decisions to prioritize AI.\n\nAI might still have limitations, but its rapid pace of improvement means workers themselves also need to prioritize staying current. Otherwise, they risk falling behind, Alex Salazar, cofounder and CEO of the AI infrastructure startup Arcade, told Business Insider.\n\nA year ago, the coding agents that the company's software engineers now use couldn't do any of what they can do today, he said.\n\n\"What does that mean for your job as an engineer?\" Salazar said. \"It's got to evolve.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "A few weeks ago, I was staring at a system prompt that was 127,000 tokens long. One hundred and twenty-seven thousand tokens - just the system prompt. Most of it was, you guessed it, tool schemas: JSON definitions for every possible thing the agent could do, most of which it would never touch in any given run.\n\nMy solution? I propose AgentScript: a code-first execution language where the LLM can only interact with the outside world by writing programs. No tool schemas, no function calling, no MCP, no multi-modal response gymnastics. The model writes code, a sandboxed runtime executes it, and the return value is the response. As simple as that.\n\nHere’s how tool calling works today: you define a bunch of tools as JSON schemas, stuff them into the system prompt, and hope the model picks the right one. Each tool needs a name, a description, parameter definitions, and examples. A single tool can easily consume hundreds of tokens. A production-grade system might have tens, sometimes hundrends, of tools.\n\nAnd the tools the model never uses still consume tokens - they’re sitting in the context window like furniture in a storage unit you’re paying rent on but never visiting (I would know something about that). As systems grow, you get this compounding problem: context inflation drives up latency and reduces alignment, both in turn drive up costs, and costs scale non-linearly because you’re paying for all those schema tokens on every single inference call.\n\nSince many agent tasks require iteration, filtering, branching, retries, and aggregation, when you encode these behaviors through repeated LLM calls or chained tool invocations, you’re effectively using natural language as a programming language. You’re asking the model to be both the thinker and the doer, when decades of CS have taught us that these should be separate concerns.\n\nIn the last few months, I’ve seen this become an exciting idea space: Program-of-thought prompting, code interpreter systems, Anthropic’s work on code execution with MCP - they all point to the same conclusion: models are better planners than executors, and deterministic computation belongs outside the model.\n\nAgentScript takes that insight to its logical conclusion.\n\nAgentScript enforces a code-only contract between a language model and its execution environment. In this world, the LLM is not an API client, not it is a conversational participant; it’s a program author that can only emit AgentScript code. So there is only one execution entry point, and all interaction with the world happens through code.\n\nThis collapses tool calling, function responses, and structured outputs into a single universal abstraction: program execution.\n\nThe execution model is deliberately boring:\n\nIntermediate data never enters the model’s context unless the program explicitly reads the persisted logs from the file system. This is my main insight: pull-based data access instead of push-based context stuffing.\n\nThe API surface can be intentionally tiny, for example:\n\nThe model already knows JavaScript. The API is small enough to learn once and never forget.\n\nAnd the safety model is simple: constraints are enforced by the runtime, not the model. The model can write whatever code it wants. The sandbox decides what actually executes, like only mounting the working directory, allowlisted commands, or network access.\n\nTo start with, a backwards-compatible model would be to force a tool call from LLM responses and only give it a single tool: execute_agentscript, and stop the loop based on the execution of the code.\n\nThere are also a few extensions I’m thinking about:\n\nWhen systems become too complex to reason about in prose, you re-found them on code. This has happened repeatedly in computing history, and it’s happening again now to agents.\n\nWritten on a flight from Amsterdam to New Delhi",

    "description": "As AI job losses rise in the professional sector, many are switching to more traditional trades. But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?",
    "fullText": "As AI job losses rise in the professional sector, many are switching to more traditional trades. But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?\n\nCalifornia-based Jacqueline Bowman had been dead set on becoming a writer since she was a child. At 14 she got her first internship at her local newspaper, and later she studied journalism at university. Though she hadn’t been able to make a full-time living from her favourite pastime – fiction writing – post-university, she consistently got writing work (mostly content marketing, some journalism) and went freelance full-time when she was 26. Sure, content marketing wasn’t exactly the dream, but she was writing every day, and it was paying the bills – she was happy enough.\n\n“But something really switched in 2024,” Bowman, now 30, says. Layoffs and publication closures meant that much of her work “kind of dried up. I started to get clients coming to me and talking about AI,” she says – some even brazen enough to tell her how “great” it was “that we don’t need writers any more”. She was offered work as an editor – checking and altering work produced by artificial intelligence. The idea was that polishing up already-written content would take less time than writing it from scratch, so Bowman’s fee was reduced to about half of what it had been when she was writing for the same content marketing agency – but, in reality, it ended up taking double the time.\n\n“I now had to meticulously fact-check every single thing in the articles. And at least 60% of it would be completely made up,” she says. “I would just end up rewriting most of the article. So something that would take me two hours when I was writing it by myself now took me four hours, making half the money.”\n\nTo add insult to injury, Bowman’s few remaining clients have sometimes accused her of using AI to create her work. “I never use AI to write anything,” she says, but she has noticed that AI-produced copy can sometimes seem eerily similar to her own writing – which she suspects is due to large language models being trained on some of her previous work. She can’t afford to take any of the Silicon Valley giants to court – though she is grateful for the authors, like George Saunders and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who have done so.\n\nShe remembered a psychology elective she had enjoyed in college, and wondered if she might be able to make a more secure living by becoming a therapist. “It’s not AI-proof” – Bowman admits that some people will be happy to use AI-powered therapy services, which already exist. “But there’s another subsection of people who are going to say: ‘Hey, AI took my job, AI ruined my life. I’m not going to go to an AI therapist,’” she says. “So in that way, I do think that there’s still going to be an audience who wants a human therapist.”\n\nBowman decided to take action and retrain, “while I still do have a little bit of work”, and is now back at university studying to become a marriage and family therapist. She counts herself “incredibly lucky” because she is able to rely on her husband, and on any writing work she can still get, to make ends meet – but has still had to take out loans. She’s enjoying the course, and is “glad she has the opportunity to do it”, but it is not something she would have considered if her writing work hadn’t become untenable.\n\nJanet Feenstra, an academic editor turned baker based in Malmö, Sweden, also has mixed feelings about her career change, a choice she similarly made because of fears that AI would make her old job void. “It’s complicated because, in a way, I maybe should be grateful to AI for prompting this change,” she says. Feenstra now works at “a really cute bakery”, where she and her colleagues “roll out the dough by hand and it feels amazing”.\n\n“We listen to music and we dance and sing whenever we want,” she adds. “I have a lot more fun now, but I don’t want to be grateful to AI for this – I’m still a little bit bitter.” It felt like a forced career change, rather than one she was choosing on her own terms, she explains – not to mention the fact that she now gets paid less, travels farther to work and does a much more tiring job.\n\nSince 2013, the 52-year-old, who is originally from the US, had been working as a freelance editor alongside a part-time job at Malmö University doing what is called “language editing”: tidying up texts written by researchers whose first language isn’t English.\n\n“The standard of English here in Sweden is very, very high, so this was very specialised academic editing,” she says. “The international journals are very picky, so it required a certain expertise that we could offer.” However, in recent years, she began to hear people within the university talking about wanting to use AI. “It was scary. I felt like the writing was on the wall a bit,” Feenstra says. She began to realise that if a manuscript “is already quite good”, then an AI system prompted to meet academic journal requirements might be able to do the work she had been doing.\n\n“I didn’t want to wait until it was too late,” she says. “I felt scared … I’m divorced, I have two children to look after and I need financial security.” So she decided to retrain in something she “was fairly sure that AI would not replace anytime soon”, and enrolled in culinary school.\n\nIt wasn’t an easy transition. “I had to move out because I wasn’t able to afford my rent any more,” she says, which meant that her sons, who had previously lived between their parents’ two homes, had to live full-time with their father. While Feenstra embarked on her year-long training, she moved in with her partner, whose flat was too small to house her sons as well. Now, having worked in the bakery for five months, she has recently signed a contract on a new flat, which will have room for her sons. “I’ve had to work really hard: I’ve had to retrain, I’ve had to accept lower pay and conditions that are physically challenging,” Feenstra says. But securing the flat “is really exciting because it’s a goal realised”.\n\nFeenstra says it has been “an interesting journey” to go from a job typically associated with middle-class people to one seen as working-class. “White-collar work isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, I’ve realised,” she says. “But it requires an adjustment. We’re so defined by our jobs and our class.”\n\nPerhaps those definitions of what counts as a “good” or “middle class” job will begin to change: a 2023 report on the impact of AI on jobs and training in the UK by the Department for Education concluded that: “Professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly those associated with more clerical work and across finance, law and business management roles.” And, rightly or wrongly, Feenstra is not alone in deciding that learning a trade is a relatively safe bet.\n\nAngela Joyce, the CEO of Capital City College, a further education provider in London, says: “We’re seeing a steady growth in students of all ages coming to us to do trades-based qualifications,” in subjects such as engineering, culinary arts and childcare. There is “definitely a shift” away from traditional academic routes, she says, which she attributes to the high numbers of unemployed young people – and “a good proportion of those are graduates”, she notes. That shift towards seeking vocational training is “in part linked to AI”, Joyce thinks, because people are looking for “jobs that AI can’t replace”.\n\nThat was certainly the case for Richard, a Northampton-based chartered occupational health and safety professional. After working his way up the career ladder for 15 years, the 39-year-old decided to jump ship and retrain as an electrical engineer.\n\n“Health and safety isn’t going to disappear any time soon because organisations can’t name AI as a responsible person or a duty holder for businesses legally,” he says. But a few years ago, he started to hear “mumblings of AI” within the industry, and saw organisations start to experiment with automating certain systems and procedures. He watched as AI began to be used for writing policies and safe systems of work, and realised that if a large portion of practitioners’ workload could be done by AI, then there might only be a need for “highly specialised managers. The rest of it’s probably going to go.”\n\nThough he decided to “pre-empt that” and pursue a different path, his main worry about AI taking over health and safety roles wasn’t actually that people like him would lose jobs – he finds aspects of AI “exciting” and accepts that it will inevitably shake up the way we work. His primary concern was that the implementation of AI might be “more of a cost-cutting exercise than it is about safety”. Richard cares deeply about the health and safety industry, which he entered after his friend was killed in a gas explosion at work.\n\nHe has taken “a huge cut” financially since he has been working as an electrical engineer over the past year, but his new job does at least still have keeping people safe at its core. And there is the potential to make the kind of money he earned in his old job once he has more experience under his belt, he says, but “I’m a good five, 10 years off”. And that’s if automation hasn’t come for electrical work by then – Richard mentions BMW’s testing of a humanoid robot as an example of how AI could affect trade jobs. Currently, though, the trades, in the UK at least, are “the most resilient to the levels of automation that AI is bringing in”, Richard believes. “Companies are capitalising on AI to remove one of their biggest costs, which is human overheads,” he says. “You need to pick something which has resilience. So, statistically, that is not your roles that are bureaucratic by nature, heavy in data and are just a bunch of processes which you repeat end on end. It needs to be something with high dexterity and some high problem-solving skills.”\n\nCarl Benedikt Frey, an associate professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, agrees that manual work “is going to be harder to automate”, but predicts that AI will have an impact “across a very wide range of industries” – trades included. “If the dishwasher breaks down in my home, I can take a picture and I can quiz the large language model of my choice, and I’m more likely to be able to fix it myself these days without calling an engineer,” he says. That’s not to say tradespeople are “doomed” – he cautions against making too many decisions based on “some hypothetical future scenario … We have to go by what’s actually happening in the labour market.” Which, now, is not a lot. “We’re beginning to see some studies suggesting more of an impact on entry-level work,” Frey says, but a reduction in entry-level job opportunities could also be attributed to higher interest rates, or post-pandemic recovery, he says.\n\n“As AI gets better, and its capabilities improve, I think it’s likely that we will see it on a bigger slice of the labour market. But we’re not seeing it yet.” In fact, Frey has now reassessed his earlier claim that 47% of roles were at risk of being replaced by computerisation, made in The Future of Employment, the 2013 paper he co-authored with Prof Michael Osborne. “In that study, a lot of the jobs that we deem are highly exposed to automation are jobs in transportation and logistics because of autonomous vehicles,” he says. “It’s fair to say that it’s taken much longer for that technology to materialise.” As self-driving cars do begin to hit our streets, “we will see a lot of jobs being replaced in trucking and even in taxi services”, Frey believes. But his message seems to be don’t panic – at least not yet. “It might be a good idea if you are, say, in the early days of your professional career, to take the time that you still have to invest in training and figuring out other more viable career paths,” particularly if you work as a translator – one profession where “we’re already seeing that AI is having an impact, although we’re not seeing mass displacement by any means”. But if you are reaching the end of your working life, “you can probably ride the wave for a few more years”, he says.\n\nThe most significant AI-caused declines in employment and wages will be in jobs like software engineering and management consultancy, according to a King’s College London study published in October 2025. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that there aren’t going to be new jobs that will be created,” Dr Bouke Klein Teeselink, who authored that study, notes. Historically, whenever there have been technological advances people have worried about mass unemployment, but it hasn’t happened, he says. “So there’s a part of me that is a little bit sceptical that all the jobs will disappear, but at the same time there is a reason to think that this technology might be different, in the sense that humans always maintained some type of absolute advantage over technology in certain domains. And that may no longer be true.”\n\nFor now, while we can’t yet know the full impact AI will have on workers, “becoming really good at working with AI is probably going to be a skill that will pay off”, Klein advises. Which is what the Birmingham-based entrepreneurs Fayyaz Garda and Arun Singh Aujla, both 25, are attempting to do. Garda, who works in procurement, and Singh Aujla, who runs a social media marketing business, are in the process of setting up an AI consulting business, educating themselves about AI via YouTube. “It’s a growing market, and there’s definitely a space for it. So I’m hoping to try and get in there early,” Garda says. The plan is to employ a number of engineers to create AI systems that will answer phone calls, respond to mail and fulfil other tasks businesses need doing, he explains.\n\n“The AI consulting business is one way I’m upskilling to move with the times,” Singh Aujla adds. “AI won’t replace me, but it may take a large market share out of my business. So it’s always good to make an extra stream of revenue.” There are certain roles Singh Aujla would never replace with AI, though: “I would not replace my management team. You need that human interaction with your team,” he says. “But roles the team don’t want to do, like email outreach and cold calling, we can get AI agents to do that.”\n\nFor some, it may well prove true that AI improves their work life by removing tasks they find tedious or difficult, giving them more time to focus on the more fulfilling aspects of their job. For others, though, it is the reason they have given up on their dream career. Paola Adeitan, 31, had her heart set on being a solicitor, and obtained an undergraduate degree and a master’s in law. She had planned to do the legal practice course, the final stage of training needed to qualify as a solicitor, “but I decided not to pursue that path because I felt like, with the change in technology, the AI, that might not be a viable path for me to carry on with,” she says. Friends of hers had struggled to get entry-level law roles, which she believed to be partly due to the increased use of AI at law firms.\n\nAdeitan still volunteers as a legal adviser, but her day job is in the health sector – although even that role could be affected by AI, she thinks, so she is remaining open to the idea that she might end up retraining again. “I do feel a sense of disappointment,” she says, “but the nature of work is changing. It’s very difficult now to decide what you want to do; you have to think carefully. It’s not about what you want any more; it’s about what is going to be there, what’s going to work.”\n\nIf you’re lucky, what ends up working best could be something you really enjoy – as is the case for Faz, 23, who took a break from his geography degree at the University of Manchester in 2023 because of a family matter. Afterwards, it didn’t make sense to him to return to his degree. “I had to think about what was future-proof, I had to think about what was AI-proof. And it seemed like a lot of entry-level roles in the corporate sector were being taken over by AI. And because AI is so unpredictable, you never know if those more specialised roles will also become obsolete,” he says. So he has instead been training for a Level 2 qualification in electrical installation since September 2025. “I thoroughly enjoy it,” he says. Though he might go back to university at some point – his “ideal setup” would be a combination of working part-time for a council or a charity, while doing electrical work on the side – “right now, a tradie job is 100%, God willing, the correct choice. I’m fairly certain it will be future-proofed against AI.”\n\nBethan, 24, from Bristol, also enjoys her AI-proof job, working in a local cafe. But it comes at a cost: she has hypermobility spectrum disorder, which gives her severe joint pain and makes it hard for her to move around. “I can’t work long hours now because I’ve pushed my body past the point,” she says.\n\nBethan’s old job, at a university IT helpdesk, “was the first job that I didn’t come home in pain from”, she says. But only a couple of months after she was hired, she and her colleagues were told the helpdesk was being closed down and replaced with an AI kiosk. “It was awful,” she says. The helpdesk staff tried to defend their roles, arguing that for students who didn’t speak English as a first language, or older students who weren’t computer-literate, having humans behind the desk may still be necessary. “It felt like we were getting completely ignored. They went ahead with it because they said they had to get a certain number of cuts to the budget.”\n\nHospitality was the only other sector in which she had experience, so she ended up at her cafe job. “Feeling like I had to go back to hospitality, which was so bad for my body, was a horrible feeling,” she says. She is now on the lookout for an office job, but has struggled to find anything entry-level. “Those are the jobs that are vanishing because they’re the easiest to replace,” she says – but it also means it is impossible to get the experience needed for higher-up roles. Bethan worries that even if she does get an office job, she could lose it to AI again. “Is it worth all the effort of applying, getting my CV up to date, and potentially doing a couple of rounds of interviews just to find out at the end we’re going to be replaced again?”\n\nWith more physically demanding jobs making up the bulk of what is now considered “AI-proof”, those who have made the switch from white-collar roles are having to adapt to the toll it takes on their bodies. The electricians Richard works with are typically in their late teens and early 20s. “Their recovery rates are a hell of a lot quicker than mine. So if I pick up an injury, for example, it takes me far longer to recuperate. Also, they can work far longer hours than I can,” he says.\n\nAnd though Feenstra enjoys the physicality of working in a bakery, she has been thinking about how sustainable this kind of job will be as she gets older. “That’s why I’ve been taking note of how the owners run the business,” she says, in case there is a possibility of running her own bakery one day. She is proud of how she is continuing to adapt to the changing world around her: “I want my sons to feel a little bit inspired by that,” she says. Yet she doesn’t feel she can offer them career advice. “How am I supposed to advise them when I don’t even really know if what I’m doing is the right path?” she says. “It’s really unsettling when you can’t advise them. If they have a passion for something and they want to do something, immediately you think, OK, is this even going to exist in the next 10, 20 years? That just kind of sucks.”\n\nBallerinas will still exist, says Klein. “No one is going to go to the ballet to see a robot do really good ballet,” the academic says. “Same for theatre, same for football, same for many other things where it matters that there’s a human.” He doesn’t think people will be wanting to confess to robo-priests any time soon either, or leave children in the care of AI. “There are just categories where we prefer to interact with humans, right?” For that reason, social skills will remain important, Klein and Frey agree. And though it might seem as if AI could make expert knowledge useless, Klein disagrees. “I have students who use AI naively, and therefore they have no idea whether the reports they produce are good or bad,” he says. “You need to have that expertise to be able to guide the AI to get it to do what you need it to do. So in that sense, I think the value of expertise might actually go up.”\n\nHow such expertise will be developed, if entry-level jobs are being ditched in favour of AI systems, is a question that remains as yet unanswered, as is who will actually be able to buy a ticket to the ballet should large swathes of the population be put out of work. But Frey doesn’t think it is worth spending too much time worrying about that potential future – yet. “It could well arrive, but it matters a great deal if that happens in five years or 20.” While he acknowledges “there are reasons to be concerned”, Frey doesn’t think it’s time to “paint a scenario where everybody’s going to be out of work five years from now, and we need to rethink everything”.",

    "description": "Dan Ives says Wall Street is underestimating software's role in the AI boom, calling the skepticism \"disconnected.\"",
    "fullText": "Wall Street may be getting the AI trade wrong, says Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and longtime tech bull.\n\nIves said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" published Tuesday that the recent investor pessimism toward software companies is 'the most disconnected call that I've ever seen.\"\n\nWhile much of the AI excitement has centered on data centers, chips, and GPUs, Ives said software will be the \"heart and lungs of the AI revolution.\"\n\nThe infrastructure buildout is still in its early innings and could stretch over the next decade. But software is where the real use cases and monetization will emerge, he added.\n\nIves said it is wrong to assume that big software companies like Salesforce and ServiceNow are \"structurally broken\" or set to be replaced by AI-native tools.\n\nThese companies are deeply embedded in enterprise stacks, with hundreds of thousands of customers, Ives said, adding that their AI use cases could unlock incremental revenue over the next six to 18 months that investors are not yet pricing in.\n\nLarge, entrenched platforms should not be compared to smaller players that serve small and medium-sized businesses. \"You cannot paint all of them with the same brush,\" Ives said.\n\nIves also defended Microsoft's role in the AI revolution. While acknowledging near-term concerns around capital spending and Azure growth, Ives said the broader AI rollout cannot succeed without Microsoft's software and cloud ecosystem.\n\nIves' comments came after software stocks tumbled last week amid investor fears that AI could disrupt large swaths of the industry.\n\nNot all tech and finance leaders think AI will replace traditional software companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed that idea at a Cisco AI event last week.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" Huang said. \"You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself,\" he added.\n\nHuang said AI depends on the tools software offers and pointed to ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis as examples of software firms well-positioned in the AI era.\n\nIves also wrote in an industry note published last week that the \"software armageddon\" can be regarded as a tech stock \"garage sale.\"\n\n\"We believe the market is baking in a doomsday scenario for software companies in the near-term, which we believe is extremely overblown, as many customers won't be willing to put their data at risk to capitalize on AI implementation strategies until there is less risk with these migration projects,\" Ives and his analysts wrote.\n\nIves has long urged investors to buy tech dips, even as critics caution that AI enthusiasm may be running ahead of earnings and real-world adoption.",

    "fullText": "Rules of mysterious ancient Roman board game decoded by AI\n\nA Roman stone board game has been unplayable since its discovery more than a century ago, but AI might have just worked out the rules\n\nJoin Our Community of Science Lovers!\n\nIt was the summer of 2020, and researcher Walter Crist was wandering around the exhibits inside a Dutch museum dedicated to the presence of the ancient Roman empire in the Netherlands. As a scientist who studies ancient board games, one exhibit stuck out to Crist: a stone game board dating to the late Roman Empire. It was about eight inches across and etched with angular lines that roughly formed the shape of an oblong octagon inside a rectangle.\n\n“I thought to myself, ‘Well, that’s very interesting,’ because the pattern on it—it’s not something I had ever seen in the literature before,” Crist says.\n\nWhat the game was called and how it was played were a mystery, too.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nCrist contacted the museum curators to get a closer look. And now he and his colleagues believe they’ve decoded the game in a first-of-its-kind study using a combination of more traditional archaeological methods and artificial intelligence. According to the analysis, the object appears to be a sort of “blocking game.” In these types of games, one player tries to block another from moving; one example is tic-tac-toe.\n\nThe research was published on Monday in the journal Antiquity.\n\nCrist, now a guest lecturer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, recalls that when he and his team started investigating the board game, they didn’t have a ton of details to work with. They knew that the game board had been found around the late 1800s or early 1900s in the southeastern Netherlands’ city of Heerlen—which would have been the city of Coriovallum in Roman times. The board was made out limestone that was imported from France. And the game was likely played casually and may not have been particularly notable, in part because there is no known documentation of it in written texts from the time.\n\nTo decipher the rules, Crist’s team programmed two AI agents to play the game over and over again using more than 100 different sets of rules taken from other known European games, both ancient and modern. As the AI agents played—1,000 games per set of rules—the researchers tracked how the pieces moved. Then they compared the moves with the levels of wear on areas of the board, tracing which gameplay seemed to replicate grooves on the stone.\n\nThe team found nine rule sets that appeared “consistent” with the wear on the board. “And they were all variations of this same kind of blocking game,” Crist says.\n\nThis type of game was played in the 19th and 20th centuries in Scandinavia, and researchers thought it dated to early medieval times. But the Roman game is the earliest example of such a game in Europe, Crist says. He and his team called the game Ludus Coriovalli, Latin for “the game from Coriovallum.” (You can play it online here.)\n\nCrist hopes the study will help researchers solve other ancient board games. Such games offer a way to connect the ancient past to our own lives, he says. Indeed, they haven’t changed much over the centuries. The ancient Egyptian board game Senet, for example, might not have been all that different from Sorry! Chess, meanwhile, is thought to have originated in ancient India, and nobody really knows when or where backgammon originated.\n\nUnderstanding how ancient games might’ve been played, Crist says, “can lead us to new insights on how people in the past enjoyed their lives.”\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.

He ran a large portion of the company until late last year, when several of his responsibilities were split between two other cofounders, Tony Wu and Guodong Zhang, people with knowledge of the move told Business Insider.\n\nBa also previously ran the team that oversaw more than a thousand AI tutors, according to an org chart from earlier last year. That role was given to Diego Pasini in September, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nBa is the second cofounder to depart the company in less than 48 hours. Wu announced he'd resigned from the AI startup on Monday night. Wu's Slack account was deactivated shortly before the announcement, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nAhead of Wu's departure, xAI underwent another restructuring, and several of his responsibilities were shifted under Zhang.\n\nMusk launched the AI company in 2023 with 11 other founders. Six have now left the company — five of them within the last year.\n\nIn addition to his work at xAI, Ba is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto in the computer science department. He received his Ph.D. from the school while studying under Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the \"godfather of AI.\"\n\nMusk has said he built xAI as an alternative to what he's called \"woke\" chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Over the past year, the company has become known for pushing the envelope. Last July, xAI launched a sexy digital avatar called \"Ani,\" and its Grok chatbot went on an antisemitic rant.\n\nMost recently, xAI has come under fire after Grok began generating nonconsensual sexual images of real people in response to X user prompts. The backlash eventually prompted the company to restrict Grok's image-generation features on X.\n\nLast week, Musk announced that xAI would merge with his rocket company, SpaceX. The company is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value SpaceX at $1.5 trillion.\n\nBa and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "The CEO of StackBlitz, Eric Simons, says the web development startup has \"gone all in\" on AI agents.",
    "fullText": "StackBlitz CEO Eric Simons aims to have more AI agents than human employees working at the startup this year, a milestone he sees as emblematic of a broader shift underway across the software industry.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Business Insider, Simons said StackBlitz has \"gone all in on agents,\" deploying internally built AI systems across business intelligence, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\nAI has become increasingly good at writing software code, to the point where the technology is beginning to change how companies are run. OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage, is an early example of digital agents communicating and coordinating with one another without direct human involvement.\n\n\"To me, this is a crystal ball into the wildness of the inevitable future,\" Simons told Business Insider. \"Your AI agents will talk to other people's agents on your behalf, negotiating pricing for a product you want to buy, inquiring about availability for a restaurant, arguing your political viewpoints.\"\n\n\"Agents are an extension of yourself,\" he added. \"People will generally trust their agents with whatever they recommend them to buy, reserve, believe, or otherwise.\"\n\nSimons's comments come as software and SaaS stocks have slumped in recent weeks, a move he attributes to growing investor recognition that AI can now build software autonomously. As AI tools become more capable, he said, long-standing competitive moats based on specialized knowledge are eroding.\n\nHe compared the shift to the transformation of manufacturing over the past century. Craft knowledge once protected businesses, he said, but automation and digital design ultimately displaced many incumbents. \"Today, it's a CAD file you can 3D print,\" Simons said.\n\n\"While every individual does not use these profound new powers directly (like 3D printing a chair), there's an entire new generation of companies that do — and they have replaced the previous era of companies,\" Simons explained. \"They disrupted those incumbents by leveraging automation that made it far cheaper and at a massive scale not possible previously when moats were just knowledge and bare hands.\"\n\nFor businesses, the implications are stark. Even traditionally \"safe\" enterprise software may be vulnerable if AI agents can migrate or rebuild systems rapidly.\n\n\"What does it mean when all of software can be written, rewritten, migrated, or otherwise, 100x or 10,000x faster than it could've ever been done before, by a workforce that does not sleep, and can be parallelized near infinitely?\" Simons said. \"It's daunting and mind-bending, and I think the repricing of SaaS in public markets more accurately reflects this today.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Another week, another round of jitters caused by fears of widespread AI disruption.\n\nOn Tuesday, financial firms and brokerages saw their shares fall as tech firm Altruist boasted its new Hazel AI tool could assist with tax planning for clients \"within minutes.\"\n\nHere were the big moves on Tuesday:\n\nThe iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF was down 4%.\n\nThe fear isn't explicitly tied to the tax services these companies provide, but rather that cheap AI tools will soon be more widely available for a range of financial services offered by big companies, eating into margins.\n\nIt's a nearly identical fear that shook the software space last week. After Anthropic rolled out new tools for its Cowork agent aimed at professionals in the legal space, the entire sector sold off as investors eyed the potential for wider disruption.\n\nOther brokerage stocks, such as Interactive Brokers and Morgan Stanley, fared slightly better on Tuesday. The fact that both firms cater to institutional traders implies that Wall Street is more concerned about retail-facing brokerage stocks.\n\nCompanies in the accounting space, such as QuickBooks owner Intuit, fell about 3%. Accounting software makers SAP SE and Xero rose 1% and 2% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI approved the integration of an AI application on ChatGPT to enable users to receive direct insurance quotes on the platform.\n\nNeither platform directly offers users the ability to trade stocks, but for the market, the key concern is that AI disruption is poised to upend the financial sector, as it did the legal technology field last week.\n\nMarkets have largely recovered from the tech plunge last week, with multiple analysts saying this week that the event represents a buy-the-dip moment. Still, markets are on edge as new disruptive tools continue to emerge.",

Since August 2025, Riverside County’s new Occupancy Detection System has been quietly documenting every solo driver pretending their gym bag is a passenger, recovering over $1 million in unpaid tolls and fees.\n\nThe technology reads like something from a dystopian Netflix series, except it’s scanning your morning commute. Cameras positioned at the end of the expressway capture multiple photographs of vehicle interiors. AI software flags potential violations before human reviewers at the Riverside County Transportation Commission confirm whether you actually have three people aboard. Get caught? You’ll pay the full toll plus a $5 “correction fee” — their polite term for getting busted.\n\nThis isn’t your typical red-light camera — the system spots fake passengers with unsettling accuracy.\n\nRCTC spokesperson Ariel Alcon reports catching drivers using “hats on headrests, putting items in baby car seats and even using mannequins” to fool the old enforcement system. The ODS isn’t impressed by your creativity. The technology distinguishes between actual humans and decoy passengers, even identifying properly installed car seats as legitimate occupants.\n\nConsider the scale: 400,000 cars use the 91 daily, with more than 100,000 breaking HOV rules. That’s roughly one in four drivers thinking they’re smarter than the system. Spoiler alert: they’re not.\n\nOfficials promise face-blurring and privacy compliance, but your driving habits are now permanent data.\n\nThe system protects privacy by blurring faces and storing images according to state and federal privacy laws. If you dispute a violation, you can call customer service at (800) 600-9191 or file online appeals through your 91 Express Lanes account. According to RCTC staff, most people don’t bother challenging charges once they learn about the cameras. That quiet acceptance speaks volumes about our collective resignation to surveillance infrastructure.\n\nThe 91’s success virtually guarantees expansion to other California carpool lanes. Your morning commute just became a case study in how automation transforms enforcement from occasional human oversight to constant digital monitoring.

    "description": "Artificial intelligence can write you a passable love poem and some people even have romantic feelings towards it. But is the feeling mutual?",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence can write you a passable love poem and some people even have romantic feelings towards it. But is the feeling mutual?\n\nPeople are falling for AI. Really. Take the man in Canada, for example, who recently proposed to an avatar called Saia. He says he is in love with it. And last year, a young American woman using the pseudonym Ayrin confessed to having a love affair with a chatbot named Leo.\n\nThere are millions of users now actively using Replika, a popular AI companion app, and, according to a 2024 study, about 40% of them are in a romantic relationship with their chatbot. However, while some people might feel as though AI can love them back, a chatbot's responses are nothing more than text generated by algorithms designed to imitate human interactions. Most experts agree that such systems are far from sentient. They're currently just mimicking emotion, but some experts believe the machines might be able to manage \n\n\"Nowadays, a lot of AI chatbots are pretending to be human and that really bothers me,\" says Renwen Zhang, an assistant professor in the department of communications and new media at the National Institute of Singapore. \"It's a strategy to drive user engagement and to increase trust.\"\n\nPut like that, the tugging of human emotions by a product created by technology companies begins to look like a cynical tactic. Certainly, no AI at present is ever going to feel the same way about you as you might about it, experts say.\n\nWhile the large language models (LLMs) behind widely-used chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude might be comparable to humans when it comes to understanding emotions, that doesn't mean that an AI can actually feel anything. Zhang's research, which examined excerpts from conversations between more than 10,000 users and their Replika companions, suggests that people often form an emotional attachment to AI. But they are also, somewhat tragically, reminded that they are interacting with just a machine whenever it breaks down or freezes, for example. Sadly, such people often get hurt.\n\n\"I think AI chatbots need to clearly convey to users that they are just machines: they don't have genuine emotions and experiences,\" says Zhang.\n\nIn other work examining human relationships with AI, Zhang and her colleagues noticed that people often experienced an eerie feeling as well as a mix of positive and negative emotions when an AI responded as though it were a self-aware human during intimate encounters. She says it is similar to people sometimes finding robots creepy when they look too human, called the uncanny valley effect.\n\nIt's not easy to define love. But it's worth celebrating what we do know about this incredible human experience. Many poems, books, songs and so on help people process and express some of the most powerful feelings they'll ever experience. Humans came up with all of that. AI can of course write poems and even entire novels in just seconds, drawing on the entire breadth of human-generated material they have been trained on. But expecting AI to truly understand and experience love, with all of its mystery and depth, is a big ask.\n\nWhile the concept of romantic love may mean somewhat different things to different people, in recent decades scientists have examined the biology of reproduction and the brain processes involved in choosing a sexual partner.\n\nIn a research paper published in 1998, biological anthropologist Helen Fisher came up with a leading theory of romantic love, describing it as three independent drives affected by chemicals in our bodies. Lust, governed by sex hormones, is one. The other two, attraction and attachment, are influenced by the release of chemicals in our brain. Dopamine, for example, triggers excitement towards a love interest while oxytocin, dubbed the cuddle hormone, helps to promote a long-term bond.\n\n\"Love has a strong chemical component,\" says Neil McArthur, a professor of philosophy specialising in ethics and technology at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. \"We really feel it in our bones, in our chemistry.\"\n\nDifferent parts of the brain are involved in love and brain scans of people in the throes of love have captured this.\n\nPrimitive brain regions linked to pleasure, such as the ventral tegmental area, for example, are activated along with the amygdala, which is responsible for emotional responses and the hippocampus, which processes emotions and helps form memories. Being in love can also impact other cognitive abilities, for example when we end up thinking about someone obsessively during the early stages of a romance.\n\nThe closest AI might get to love is replicating some of the thought processes involved, such as wanting to frequently contact a person with whom we are in love, suggests McArthur.\n\n\"An AI that goes through a cognitive process that ties them to someone in a bond of loyalty is not going to be exactly like human love,\" says McArthur. \"But maybe we could call it, in some kind of scare quotes at least, an emotion.\"\n\nWhile some researchers believe emotion will be a vital aspect to build into AI in the future, others are highly sceptical that any machine will truly be able to experience emotions in anything approaching our own experience of them.\n\nSince computers running software don't experience love the way we do, the feelings involved in human-AI relationships are inevitably one-sided. The dynamics of these romances are therefore much more limited than those that occur between humans.\n\nChatbots are typically designed to engage users and agree with their viewpoints, which often results in AI romantic partners being submissive. This appeals to some, though Zhang finds the dynamic concerning, since it can affect a person's ability to build and sustain meaningful relationships with other – perhaps less-submissive – humans.\n\n\"People can temporarily escape from the messiness of human relationships and find some comfort from AI – but in the long run it's not helpful in developing communication skills and the skill to maintain relationships in the real world,\" she says.\n\nFundamentally, to love someone as we do probably requires consciousness, meaning a subjective awareness – our thoughts, perceptions and mental imagery. Conscious experiences are central to being human and can range from perceiving a smell, to reflecting on why we might feel embarrassed. Researchers have different views on how such consciousness emerges and there are still many mysteries to solve, making it difficult to replicate in a machine.\n\n\"No one has any clue about getting any specific conscious experience out of an AI,\" says Donald Hoffman, a professor of cognitive sciences at the University of California, Irvine. \"It's not like we're almost there: we don't know how to start.\"\n\nA leading theory developed by neuroscientists Giulio Tonini from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Christof Koch from the Allen Institute in Seattle, Washington suggests that consciousness arises from the interconnection of different parts of the brain, and how they influence each other. Although it could apply to computers too, Koch argues that level of interconnectedness would never happen in existing machines since their architecture is not complex enough.\n\nHoffman, on the other hand, says that conscious experiences such as love don't necessarily originate from circuitry in the brain. There is yet to be any definitive proof of that, he adds.\n\nSome experts say that AI systems could become conscious in the future. Koch, for example, suggests that neuromorphic computing, a novel approach to AI that mimics the structure and function of the human brain, could be a candidate since it would have a higher degree of integration than current systems.\n\nConscious machines are plausible agrees Patrick Butlin, a philosopher of mind and cognitive science, who is a researcher at the University of Oxford's Global Priorities Institute. He and colleagues examined leading theories of consciousness and selected 14 properties that developers of AI systems could try to replicate. No existing AI system has incorporated more than a few of them, Butlin says, but all could theoretically be met using current technologies.\n\n\"I do think that there's a realistic possibility that if somebody who was efficiently well-resourced, skilful and motivated set out to build a conscious AI system, then they could achieve it,\" he says.\n\nAmong those properties Butlin and his colleagues identified for achieving consciousness was the need for a body. This is something that many current AI systems lack.\n\nBeing able to experience beliefs and desires also seems key for our ability to love someone. But researchers are currently divided over whether AI systems can be said to believe anything, says Butlin.\n\n• Is there something special about the human voice?\n\n• The riddles humans can solve but robots cannot\n\nEven if AI were to become conscious, Butlin thinks that people would ultimately have to come up with some objective standards when trying to decide whether they can experience love. Since machines are not human, they could never love us back in the same way. Butlin compares it to determining whether non-human animals, which have a wide range of social structures and cognitive capacities, are capable of love.\n\n\"There are probably going to be some examples where we intuitively feel like it's pretty plausible and other examples where we don't but it's hard to draw the line exactly,\" says Butlin. \"Whether we think AI [can experience love] is also going to depend on a bit of line-drawing: they're inevitably going to be different from humans.\"\n\nFor more technology news and insights, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "fullText": "We still don't know what OpenAI's mysterious hardware device is — but now we have a better idea of when we might get our hands on it.\n\nThe company just revealed it doesn't expect to ship the product it's building with legendary Apple designer Jony Ive before February 2027.\n\nThe admission came in a Monday court filing by OpenAI amid a dispute with the startup Iyo, which sued OpenAI last year over the \"io\" trademark.\n\nThe previously known public timeline for the OpenAI device, shared by the company's chief global affairs officer at Davos last month, was a product reveal in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe Monday filing contained a sworn statement from Peter Welinder, the vice president and general manager at OpenAI, stating that the company expects its \"first hardware device will not ship to customers before the end of February 2027.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether OpenAI still plans to unveil the new device later this year before shipping it in 2027. An OpenAI spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOpenAI announced last year that it would acquire Ive's hardware company, io Products, in a deal valued at nearly $6.5 billion.\n\nIn June last year, after Iyo sued OpenAI, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing OpenAI from using the \"io\" trademark. OpenAI then scrubbed mentions of its partnership with Ive from its website, as well as a promotional video.\n\nIn the Monday filing, OpenAI's lawyers said the company no longer planned to use the \"io\" name for its product. The company had \"reevaluated the branding of their forthcoming hardware products in light of OpenAI's existing brands,\" they wrote in the filing, adding that the name would not be used for marketing or \"sale of any artificial intelligence-enabled hardware products.\"\n\nThe lawyers argued that an April 2026 preliminary injunction hearing, which had been scheduled by the court, would therefore be \"both unnecessary and impractical.\"\n\nWired previously reported on elements of Monday's court filing.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Ive and OpenAI's first hardware product has sparked much speculation, including whether it will take the form of earbuds, a pen, glasses, or something else.\n\nA video purporting to tease the new device circulated over the weekend, which OpenAI said was \"totally fake.\" A now-deleted Reddit post claimed the video was a shelved ad teasing earbuds with actor Alexander Skarsgård.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "If you're starting your career at PwC, deciding where you'll do it has gotten a lot easier.\n\nThe Big Four firm cut the number of US locations where entry-level consultants can start working to just 13, BI's Polly Thompson exclusively reports.\n\nLimiting the options — new hires could previously choose any of the 72 US offices — is about building a greater sense of community among junior employees early in their careers, Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, told Polly.\n\nIt's an example of how PwC is evolving in the AI era. Polly previously reported on the firm's launch of a learning initiative to train workers in specific skills necessary for AI. It also created a new career path aimed at engineers.\n\nIt's not just PwC. Polly has done a fantastic job covering consulting firms and their attempt to use AI without upending their business. AI agents are still falling short of outright replacing human consultants, but the CEO of one AI training giant told BI the models are learning fast.\n\nIn the meantime, AI use by entry-level employees remains a key issue.\n\nOn the one hand, the tech can automate a lot of the mind-numbing work that juniors get bogged down with early on. On the other hand, skipping that initial work means losing foundational knowledge that is crucial down the road.\n\nThe AI-for-juniors issue isn't specific to consulting.\n\nThe risks posed by training young workers on AI are universal. And with so much emphasis on benefiting from AI, companies can't delay their decision much longer.\n\n\"What differentiates outperformers in 2026 won't be strategy; it will be execution,\" Paul Griggs, CEO of PwC US, told me last month when discussing big themes for the year.\n\nLeaders need to be \"hyper intentional around discipline, around road maps, around building teams that are measured based on what they execute,\" Griggs added.\n\nTwo senior bankers I spoke with last month raised questions about how to use AI efficiently early in your career. They debated the benefits of expediting a junior's path toward more impactful work, alongside the risks of creating a knowledge gap by skipping early steps.\n\nIt's a tricky balance. Forgoing it entirely means you risk falling behind your competitors. Leaning in too heavily risks losing the attribute your clients still pay you big bucks for: human judgment.\n\n\"You're missing some of this basic training that's actually a very important underpin and foundation to your more sophisticated evaluation and judgment of things at a later stage in your career,\" one of the bankers said about outsourcing early work to AI.",

    "fullText": "New York-based cybersecurity startup Reco has raised $30 million in Series B funding as companies rapidly expand their AI use.\n\nOfer Klein, Gal Nakash, and Tal Shapira founded Reco in 2020 to fill the gap between a company's existing cybersecurity protections and the other tech tools employees use, which is often AI.\n\n\"AI adoption has accelerated exponentially, and companies that blocked AI access a year ago cannot block it anymore,\" Klein told Business Insider. \"And I'm not talking about small mom-and-pop shops; I'm talking about the biggest banks, insurance, healthcare, pharma, and hospitals.\"\n\nZeev Ventures led its latest round, with participation from all existing investors, which includes Insight Partners and Boldstart Ventures. New corporate investors for this round include Workday Ventures, TIAA Ventures, S Ventures, and Quadrille Capital.\n\n\"My investment strategy has always been to double down on what's working,\" Oren Zeev, the famed seed investor behind Zeev Ventures, said in a statement. \"I've seen this pattern with successful companies like Navan and Tipalti, and I'm seeing it again with Reco. The signals we see show rapidly growing market demand for AI SaaS security, and we are experiencing exceptional growth.\"\n\nWhile software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks have recently plunged amid concerns about AI disruption, Zeev sees a \"massive\" opportunity in AI for security.\n\nAfter growing 500% year-over-year in 2024, Reco said it grew an additional 400% in 2025, driven by a sharp increase in business AI adoption.\n\nCybersecurity startups also raised nearly $14 billion in 2025, according to Pinpoint Search Group. That represented a 47% increase from 2024 and the most funding since 2021.\n\nKlein said Reco began pulling in far larger companies than expected, repeatedly beating internal plans as AI went from blocked to mandatory.\n\n\"We built a plan, and we overachieved, and we updated the plan, and we overachieved again,\" said Klein. \"We said, 'OK, enough is enough, let's take more money and double down on AI SaaS.\"'\n\nKlein said the biggest challenge for Reco now is keeping up with demand.\n\n\"The business is driving this huge traction into AI enablement,\" he said. \"Our biggest challenge right now: how we grow fast enough to meet this market need.\"\n\nKlein's cofounders also bring in experience from working with the government. Nakash previously headed research at the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel, while Shapira holds a machine learning Ph.D. and also worked at Israel's Office of the Prime Minister.\n\nReco faces competition from Torq, backed by Insight Partners and now valued at $1.2 billion, according to PitchBook.

    "description": "At a financial services conference in Miami, David Solomon cited a backlog of private equity spending and AI as key capital-generating drivers.",
    "fullText": "David Solomon is officially done playing defense.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs CEO has steered the bank through several grueling years for the industry, including a multi-year drought in private equity spending and extreme trading volatility. But after a booming 2025, Solomon told investors at a UBS financial services conference on Tuesday that the firm is entering 2026 with the wind at its back.\n\nSolomon praised policymakers in Washington for spurring acquisitive appetites. \"You have a massive deregulatory trend in the United States after a very tough regulatory period in the United States, across all industries,\" Solomon said.\n\nThe receptive comments about the government's heightened support for M&A came just months after President Donald Trump lashed out at Solomon on Truth Social in August, mocking his former side gig as a DJ and encouraging him to step down from the CEO throne. Trump's rebuke came after a Goldman Sachs economist suggested that tariff policies could cost consumers.\n\nDespite that dustup, Solomon is now leaning into the administration's growth-oriented agenda, arguing that the friction of the past has been replaced by a \"constructive\" new reality for the banking sector.\n\nHere are the three factors Solomon named on Tuesday that have left him feeling bullish about 2026's dealmaking forecast.\n\nSolomon thinks that, coming off strong results last quarter, 2026 will represent an inflection point for the global mood toward M&A. For the past five years, he said, strategic buyers had encountered a \"different regulatory regime,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, the answer was no.\"\n\n\"Now, whatever the question is, the answer's maybe,\" he told UBS Erika Najarian, who hosted the discussion.\n\nThat, too, he said, could drive a resurgence in the IPO market, which has been expected to return this year. And in terms of mergers and the kind of corporate dealmaking that is Goldman's bread and butter, \"this could be a top decile\" year, Solomon said.\n\nAnd one major driver he pointed to is cash-rich, asset-heavy private equity sponsors.\n\nA key pipeline for Goldman has been banking for the world's top private equity sponsors, many of whom held assets longer than their own investors would like while waiting out a period of lackluster valuations and uncomfortably high interest rates.\n\nThat's left limited partners hungry for capital returns to reinvest in future deals, the secondaries and continuation vehicles markets booming, and banks praying that 2026 is the year that their private equity clients finally indicate they're ready for action.\n\nSolomon said the pressure for sponsors to return capital to their investors has reached a breaking point.\n\n\"We're reaching a point in time where that unlock\" is starting to occur, Solomon said. He pointed to mounting \"pressure from the LP community and the cycle life of fundraising has reached a point in time for most of these firms that they can't get into the valuation debate as much. They've got to move forward.\"\n\nSolomon has been on a mission to make Goldman AI-ready and has pointed to the massive investment in the space. \"The need for capital to continue on this technology cycle is going to have an impact on the overall capital-raising cycle, so I see all this stuff accelerating, and I feel pretty good about it,\" he said. He cited mega-tech names that have turned to the debt market to raise liquidity for AI-related projects.\n\nIt won't always be smooth sailing, Solomon conceded, framing Trump's governing style as something of an open question for markets. \"He also has a tendency in policy to move from policy action to policy action,\" he said. \"I'd still say there's uncertainty around trade. There is uncertainty around inflation, and there's uncertainty on geopolitics.\"\n\nBut, he concluded, \"I think the likely outcome in 2026 is we're going to have a pretty constructive year for capital markets, a pretty constructive year for M&A — particularly large-cap, strategic M&A — and the result of that should be very favorable for the people in this room.\"",

(They took some work to put together, too.) Digital music sort of killed mixtapes, but, in their place, came playlists. You could easily put together a collection of your favorite songs, and either burn them to a CD, or, as streaming took over, let the playlist itself grow as large as you wanted.\n\nAnyone can make a playlist, but there's an art to it. Someone with a keen ear for music can build a playlist you can let play for hours. Maybe you have a friend who's good at making playlists, or maybe you're that friend in your group. They can be a fun way to share music, and find some new music to add to your own library.\n\nNow, generative AI wants to replace human intervention altogether. Rather than you or a friend building a playlist, you can ask AI to do it for you. And YouTube Music is the latest service to give it a try.\n\nYouTube announced its new AI playlist generator in a post on X on Monday. If you To try it out, open YouTube Music, then head to your Library and tap \"New.\" Next, choose the new \"AI Playlist\" option, then enter the type of music you're looking for. You could ask YouTube Music to generate a playlist of pop-punk songs, or to make something to play when focusing on work. Really, it's whatever you want, and if the AI gets it wrong, you can try it again.\n\nIt's pretty straightforward, and nothing revolutionary. Other music streaming services have their own AI playlist generators too. Spotify, for example, has had one for a couple of years, but recently rolled out Prompted Playlist as well, which lets you generate playlists that update with time, and takes your listening history into account. With this update, however, YouTube is likely trying to drum up some interest in its streaming service and encourage users to pay for it. Just this week, the company put lyrics—once a free feature—behind the Premium paywall. I suppose it thinks that if you can't read what your favorite artists are singing, and you'd like to have a bot make your playlists for you, you might just \n\nThis could be a good change in the long run for YouTube Music subscribers. I'm on Apple Music, so I don't really use AI-generated playlists. I like the Apple-curated playlists, as well as the ones my friends and I make and share. But who knows: Maybe human-generated playlists are going the way of the mixtape.",

    "description": "External memory systems are pivotal for enabling Large Language Model (LLM) agents to maintain persistent knowledge and perform long-horizon decision-making. Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy.",

    "description": "Tired of AI’s high costs and limits? Discover how a home server and graph theory outperformed GPT-5.2 for deep research, saving $550/month while owning your ...",
    "fullText": "I recently had a problem that could be solved with money, which is the worst kind of problem.\n\nI am building a new venture called eh-trade.ca. To make it work, I needed deep financial research on 11,000 different stocks.\n\nThe \"Enterprise\" solution is to buy an API subscription. I looked into this. For my usage, the pricing is somewhere between \"$200/month\" and \"Contact Sales\". If you are a micro-preneur like me, \"Contact Sales\" means \"You cannot afford this.\"\n\nThe \"AI\" solution is to ask an LLM to research each stock, which works really well. But 11,000 requests at $0.05 per research session is still $550. Plus, I don't like renting intelligence. I prefer to own it.\n\nSo I decided to use the hardware I already had: a home server with four RTX 3090s. It’s a 96GB VRAM beast that heats my basement and scares my birds.\n\nThere was just one problem. The models I can run locally (like qwen3 or phi4) have small context windows. Yes, on the model card they theoretically support 40k+ of context, but they would run very slowly on my hardware, so really, it's 4K -- enough for a few screenfuls of text. Moreover, even if I enabled the long contexts, the models struggle to reason over them. If you try to feed them ten search results about a company's balance sheet, the 'needle in the haystack' effect kicks in. They'll get confused and start hallucinating dividends that don't exist.\n\nMost \"AI Agents\" are built on a simple loop, often called ReAct (Reason + Act). It looks like this:\n\nThe problem is the Context Window. By step 3, your prompt looks like a Walmart receipt. By step 5, you have exceeded 8,000 tokens, and the model forgets what it was doing and starts making stuff up.\n\nSure, it works fine if you are OpenAI and have infinite GPUs. It does not work if you are running on a consumer card in a closet.\n\nA few months ago, I read a paper called GraphReader. It proposed a different way to think about long contexts. Instead of dumping everything into a chat log, why not treat information as a graph?\n\nThe core insight is that you don't need to remember everything. You only need to remember the Atomic Facts.\n\nAn Atomic Fact is a single, indivisible truth.\n\nIf we extract these facts and throw away the rest, we can compress megabytes of web pages into a few kilobytes of JSON.\n\nI built a library called laconic to implement this. I wrote it in Go, because the rest of my projects are all in Go. Plus, my python environments always end up as a tangled mess of pip install errors.\n\nLaconic doesn't keep a chat history. It keeps a Notebook. The context window size is O(N), where N is the number of facts, not the number of words.\n\nLaconic uses a specific strategy called graph-reader.\n\nThe beautiful part? The LLM never sees the full history. It only sees the current Notebook and the current search result. This means I can run complex, multi-step research tasks on a model with a tiny 4k context window, and it never forgets a thing.\n\nHere is the code to run a research agent on my home server using Ollama:\n\nTo really test if this strategy works on constrained hardware, I ran a research question using qwen3:4b—a tiny 4-billion-parameter model.\n\nWithout the agentic loop, the model cannot answer this question. If you ask it directly, it responds that \"the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has not been announced.\"\n\nHowever, with the agent, it autonomously searches, extracts atomic facts, and synthesizes this:\n\nAnswer: The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to David Baker (University of Washington, Howard Hughes Medical Institute), Demis Hassabis, and John M. Jumper (Google DeepMind). David Baker was recognized for computational protein design. Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were awarded for protein structure prediction using AlphaFold2.\n\nThe agent found all three laureates, their exact affiliations, and their distinct contributions — information entirely outside the model's training data — by exploring multiple search queries and accumulating verified facts in a structured notebook.\n\nIf you hang out in the parts of the internet where people try to make AI write code without hallucinating, you might have heard of the Ralph Loop.\n\nPopularized by Geoffrey Huntley, the Ralph Loop (often named after Ralph Wiggum) is a brute-force solution to the context problem. You write a bash script that:\n\nThen it starts over. Fresh context. Zero memory leak. The \"memory\" is the file system.\n\nLaconic is essentially a Ralph Loop for reading.\n\nInstead of a bash script, it's a Go loop. Instead of git commit, we update a JSON Notebook. But the philosophy is identical: The Context Window is a liability.\n\nMost frameworks try to manage the context window like a precious resource. Ralph and Laconic treat it like a disposable napkin. Use it once, wipe the slate clean, and grab a fresh one.\n\nIt turns out that if you treat an LLM like a goldfish with a notepad, it becomes significantly smarter.\n\nI am currently running this loop on 11,000 tickers that I'm missing basic information on. It will take a week, and cost some power, but I would have left the machine on anyway because I am running a few other things on it.\n\nAnd if you want to find stocks that are going up, keep an eye on eh-trade.ca. My customers tell me I should brag more, so I'm up 280% in seven months following momentum strategies that it's showing on the main page.\n\nI'll have the data soon, assuming my basement doesn't catch fire.",

He said he's not against AI, he just wants people, including software engineers like himself, to find a more sustainable way to use the technology.\n\nThe issue, Khare wrote, is that AI creates a paradox of productivity that falls almost entirely on the user to solve by reducing the cost of production but increasing \"the cost of coordination, review, and decision-making.\"\n\nHis typical day is no longer devoted to deep focus on a single design problem, Khare wrote, but rather to context switching between as many as six different problems.\n\n\"Each one 'only takes an hour with AI.' But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain,\" he wrote. \"The AI doesn't get tired between problems. I do.\"\n\nEarly reactions show Khare isn't alone. Fellow engineers have shared their thoughts on X, Hacker News, and Lobsters. Their experiences echo what Khare wrote: vibe coding can lead to burnout vibes.\n\n\"I joke that I'm on the 'Claude Code workout plan' now,\" one user wrote on Hacker News. \"Standing desk, while it's working I do a couple squats or pushups or just wander around the house to stretch my legs. Much more enjoyable than sitting at my desk, hands on keyboard, all day long. And taking my eyes off the screen also makes it easier to think about the next thing.\"\n\nOthers make their day sound like the \"C'mon do something meme\" as they wait for a coding agent to respond with results, which they will then have to edit and refine.\n\n\"I used to lose myself in focused work for hours,\" another user wrote. \"That's changed. Now I'm constantly pulled away, and I've noticed the pattern: I send a prompt, wait for the reply, and drift into browsing.\"\n\nOn Monday, Harvard Business Review published a report on an eight-week study at a US tech company with 200 employees that \"discovered that AI tools didn't reduce work, they consistently intensified it.\"\n\n\"Once the excitement of experimenting fades, workers can find that their workload has quietly grown and feel stretched from juggling everything that's suddenly on their plate,\" the report continued. \"That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making.\"\n\nKhare said another struggle he has had is keeping up with the number of updates from OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies as they push their popular models and agents.\n\n\"Once you open your laptop, your phone either you go to Slack, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, and these are all things that are like 'Look at me,'\" Khare said.\n\nThe companies need to keep innovating to stay apace in the AI race, but for programmers like himself, Khare said, the updates create a sense of panic about missing out on what could be the next greatest thing.\n\n\"I was spending weekends evaluating new tools,\" he wrote. \"Reading every changelog. Watching every demo. Trying to stay at the frontier because I was terrified of falling behind.\"\n\nUltimately, Khare wrote that the scariest thing was how AI was changing him. He said he struggled when someone asked him \"to reason through a concurrency problem on the whiteboard\" with no laptop or AI.\n\n\"It's like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes,\" he wrote. \"After years of GPS, you can't navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.\"\n\nAndrej Karpathy, Tesla's former AI head and the engineer who coined the term \"vibe coding\" last year, recently wrote that while the industry was seeing a \"phase shift\" among increasingly impressive AI coding tools, he'd also begun to notice skill atrophy.\n\n\"I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually,\" Karpathy wrote.\n\nDetermined to help himself, Khare wrote that he had come up with a list of ground rules to rein in his AI use.\n\nHe's still struggling to hold himself to it. He said almost completely ignoring the AI conversation over his 14-day holiday break was a start. Khare said that while he wrote that having a 30-minute timer on AI use is helpful, it wasn't intended to be a strict limit.\n\nThe engineer also said that AI companies themselves could help as well. He compared the feeling of being just one prompt away from a perfect answer to the way addictive games try to keep users playing.\n\n\"You need to keep some sort of guardrails for the humans, so they don't self-distruct themselves,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI's next funding round could be good news for four Big Tech stocks with links to the ChatGPT creator, DA Davidson says.\n\nOpenAI isn't publicly traded — at least not yet — but DA Davidson says a fresh wave of hype is coming on the heels of its next fundraising round, and it could could boost four stocks in its orbit.\n\n\"We have been very critical on OpenAI overpromising, asking for government handouts and being spread too thin,\" DA Davidson analysts, led by Gil Luria, wrote about the AI company.\n\n\"We believe OpenAI's behavior led to the underperformance in shares of NVDA, MSFT, CRWV and especially ORCL over the last 5 months.\"\n\nOpenAI is reportedly closing in on another fundraising round, with recent reports suggesting a $50 billion investment from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds is in the works.\n\nFuturum CEO and analyst Daniel Newman told Business Insider that they expect the next funding round will bring OpenAI's valuation to $750 billion to $850 billion.\n\nThe analyst described the appetite for OpenAI in his conversations with investors to be \"pretty insatiable.\"\n\nDA Davidson analysts wrote that they expect that yet another multibillion-dollar OpenAI funding round will reignite enthusiasm for the company and lift some connected AI stocks.\n\n\"Since the market is currently assigning the OpenAI relationship a negative value, we believe the fundraise will serve as a catalyst for outperformance,\" they wrote of Oracle, CoreWeave, Nvidia, and Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI has come under fire for its reliance on debt and growing competition challenging its dominant position.\n\nThe company is partnered with Oracle to build $500 billion of data centers as part of its Stargate project. OpenAI has yet to turn a profit.\n\nAnother concern weighing on OpenAI is the notion that Alphabet's Google Gemini has caught up in the AI race.\n\n\"We believe that a revamped OpenAI will return to its position as Google's top challenger and with a fresh stack of capital be able to live up to its obligations this year, including to Oracle,\" they said.\n\nThe analysts upgraded Oracle to Buy from Neutral on their expectation that new funding for OpenAI will be a positive catalyst for the stock as well as general sentiment about OpenAI and the connected players.\n\n\"We expect that as investors go back to seeing OpenAI as a winner, the public companies in its orbit could re-rate significantly. Most importantly that should drive outperformance in NVDA and MSFT, but also in CRWV, and even ORCL, which we are upgrading today based on our updated view on OpenAI,\"\n\nTheir more bullish stance on OpenAI comes after the company corrected course.\n\n\"OpenAI has started focusing on its core frontier model and ChatGPT, while de-emphasizing some marginals initiatives. This includes going down the path of turning on ads, which will be critical for increased monetization and reduced cash burn.\"\n\nThey also noted a shift in the company's management that suggests they see a need to align with Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, rather than compete.",

    "fullText": "Some jobs will be moved offshore in wake of telco’s $700m partnership with tech consultancy Accenture\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nMore than 200 Telstra jobs are expected to be cut, as the telco rolls out AI capabilities and sends some jobs to India.\n\nTelstra and the technology consultancy Accenture announced a $700m joint venture (JV) in 2025 to drive efficiency, modernisation and productivity.\n\nA JV spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday that the team had been notified “about proposed changes to its workforce, including reducing roles where work is no longer needed, and moving some work to the JV team in India”.\n\nIf the changes proceed, the spokesperson said, affected team members would be helped to find new jobs either at Telstra or at Accenture, or have “access to our leading career transition program and retrenchment benefits”.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\n“These changes would see the JV use Accenture’s global capabilities, advanced AI expertise and specialist hub in India to deliver Telstra’s data and AI roadmap more quickly.\n\n“We anticipate that over time this would result in improved cost efficiencies and bring an enhanced experience to Telstra’s customers.”\n\nIt is understood 209 jobs face the axe.\n\nIn 2024, Telstra announced it would cut 2,800 jobs from its enterprise business, which services businesses and government agencies. The cuts wouldn’t affect retail customers, it said.\n\nIn May 2025, Telstra said “AI efficiencies” would allow it to shrink its workforce by 2030.\n\nTelstra’s chief executive, Vicki Brady, said AI would “be a significant unlock when it comes to enabling our workforce”.\n\nAgentic AI – which can work autonomously – would be working alongside Telstra staff, she said.\n\nOptus has previously said AI would have a big role to play in telecommunications but that humans would remain central.\n\nAnnouncing the JV, Telstra said it would drive productivity and growth, “build on Telstra’s work creating a world-class data and AI ecosystem, modernising its data and AI platforms, and embedding responsible AI by design”.\n\n“We are entering a new era of AI-driven reinvention,” the Accenture chair and chief executive officer, Julie Sweet, said at the time.",

    "description": "A super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and other tech leaders has targeted New York Assembly member Alex Bores' congressional campaign, marking its first attack against a lawmaker supporting AI regulation.",
    "fullText": "A pro-AI super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman has chosen New York Assembly member Alex Bores — and his congressional bid — as its first target.\n\nThe PAC, dubbed Leading the Future, formed in August with a more than $100 million commitment to support policymakers with a light-touch — or a no-touch — approach to AI regulation. And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\n\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\n\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature.\n\nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley.\n\nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\n\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\n\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works.\n\n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\n\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act.\n\nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.\n\n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”",

    "description": "AI language models excel in medical exams – but when real people ask them for advice, collaboration fails.",
    "fullText": "Large language models like GPT-4o are now achieving near-perfect results in medical knowledge tests. They pass the US medical licensing exam, summarize patient records, and can classify symptoms. Health authorities worldwide are therefore examining whether AI chatbots could serve as the first point of contact for patients – a kind of \"new gateway to the healthcare system,\" as stated in a strategy paper by the UK's NHS.\n\nHowever, the study \"Reliability of LLMs as medical assistants for the general public: a randomized preregistered study\" by researchers from the University of Oxford significantly dampens these hopes. The work is published in the journal Nature Medicine, and a pre-print version is available on arXiv. The central finding: the clinical knowledge of the models cannot be transferred to interactions with real people.\n\nFor the randomized, controlled study, the researchers recruited 1298 participants from Great Britain. Each subject was presented with one of ten everyday medical scenarios – such as sudden severe headaches, chest pain during pregnancy, or bloody diarrhea. The task: to assess what illness might be present and whether a doctor's visit, the emergency room, or even an ambulance was necessary.\n\nThe participants were randomly divided into four groups. Three groups had access to one AI model each, which was current at the start of the study – GPT-4o, Llama 3, or Command R+. The control group was allowed to use any aids, such as an internet search.\n\nThe results reveal a remarkable discrepancy. Without human involvement, even the language models, which are no longer current, identified at least one relevant illness in 94.9 percent of cases. When asked for the correct course of action – self-treatment, GP, emergency room, or ambulance – they were correct on average in 56.3 percent of cases.\n\nHowever, as soon as real people queried the models, the values plummeted. Participants with AI support recognized relevant illnesses in only a maximum of 34.5 percent of cases – significantly worse than the control group with 47 percent. When choosing the correct course of action, all groups performed equally: around 43 percent accuracy, regardless of whether a chatbot assisted or not.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the chat logs between users and AI models to understand the causes. They identified two central weaknesses: Firstly, participants often provided incomplete information to the models. Secondly, users did not correctly understand the AI's responses – even though the models named at least one correct diagnosis in 65 to 73 percent of cases, participants did not reliably adopt them.\n\nDr. Anne Reinhardt from LMU Munich sees a fundamental gap here: \"Many people quickly trust AI answers to health questions because they are easily accessible. They also sound very convincing linguistically – even when the content is actually medically completely wrong.\"\n\nThe researchers compared the performance of the models on the MedQA benchmark – a standard test with questions from medical exams – with the results of the user study. In 26 out of 30 cases, the models performed better on multiple-choice questions than in interactions with real people. Even benchmark values of over 80 percent sometimes corresponded to user results below 20 percent.\n\nProf. Ute Schmid from the University of Bamberg critically assesses the high performance of the models \"alone\": \"I find the statement that the performance of the language models is significantly higher 'alone' than with users somewhat misleading. In this case, the queries were likely formulated by individuals with expertise and experience with LLMs.\"\n\nThe experts agree that specialized medical chatbots would need to be designed differently from current all-purpose models. Prof. Kerstin Denecke from the Bern University of Applied Sciences outlines the requirements: \"A medically specialized chatbot would need to provide evidence-based, up-to-date information. Furthermore, it would need to reliably recognize emergencies, consider individual risk factors, and transparently communicate its limitations. It should conduct a structured anamnesis to reliably triage. And it should not be tempted to make a diagnosis.\"\n\nHowever, the hurdles for such use are considerable, according to Denecke: \"Major hurdles are, on the one hand, regulation – depending on the function as a medical device or high-risk AI. On the other hand, there is liability, data protection, and technical integration into care processes.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the Oxford researchers is clear: Before AI systems are deployed in healthcare, they must be tested with real users – not just with exam questions or simulated conversations. Schmid advocates for a differentiated approach: \"Quality-assured chatbots could, for example, be offered through statutory health insurance funds and recommended by general practitioners' offices as a first point of access. However, people should not be forced to use these services.\"\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "description": "The Meta founder’s donation to Sacramento State will help build “state-of-the-art STEM facilities” and a dedicated AI center.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI and STEM with his philanthropic efforts. Late last year, he and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, announced they would shift the majority of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute to biomedical AI research. And late last month, the Meta founder and CEO pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to fuel state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the gift on Jan. 28, tying it to a major redevelopment of three vacant state office buildings on Sacramento’s Capitol Mall into a downtown campus. The gift from Zuckerberg and Meta will fund abatement, demolition, and initial construction of the campus, enabling new student housing alongside new academic spaces, including STEM facilities and an AI center.\n\nMeta’s donation also comes at the heels of an interesting corporate and financial dynamic in California: Billionaires may soon be subject to a one-time 5% tax on their wealth. Many billionaires, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, have already moved their permanent residences out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nZuckerberg hasn’t made any public statements about the billionaires tax, and is instead doubling down on California investments and legacy.\n\n“These investments will help strengthen our communities and support the next generation of leaders and innovators,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. The Meta CEO also owns a compound of 11 properties in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood, valued at more than $110 million. Minutes from his home, Meta has its sprawling 57-acre headquarters campus and also more than 400,000 square feet of office space nearby in Menlo Park.\n\nNewsom said Zuckerberg’s gift allows the Sacramento-based school to continue to build its talent pipeline for tech jobs.\n\nThe donation “[opens] doors for students to succeed and for our communities to prosper,” Newsom said. “Making sure students can actually afford to live where they learn is essential to that work.”\n\nWhile this recent donation comes directly from Meta and Zuckerberg, it also fits into the playbook they recently rewrote. Launched in 2015 with a pledge to give away 99% of their fortune, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has recently refocused on science, AI, and biomedical research, shifting emphasis away from its initial education and social justice priorities (although they say they’ll continue making other local donations).\n\nIn 2025, Zuckerberg and Chan laid the groundwork to recalibrate their philanthropic organization toward AI-powered biomedical research, with a particular focus on their flagship Biohub network. Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes, aims to “cure or prevent all disease,” according to Zuckerberg and Chan.",

Why be at any university at all? Isn't the point of pursuing higher education to expand our minds and become better communicators?\n\nAs I progressed through my studies, I would hear ChatGPT mentioned more and more often, with some college professors even adding an AI clause to their syllabi. Some instructors would allow students to use ChatGPT for assistance (a murky definition) while others wouldn't allow it at all.\n\nI refused to use the AI tool in any way.\n\nI didn't care if instructors allowed students to use ChatGPT. I deliberately chose not to use it at all.\n\nSure, studying and studying literature in particular was difficult, but this was why I'd chosen the major; it was challenging, and I wanted to become better with words.\n\nI chose to become an English major because I wanted to improve my writing. I lacked confidence in my writing because I didn't know how to use words when I first entered college. I didn't have that finesse.\n\nApart from wanting to become a better writer, I also wanted to defend my opinions and thoughts with flair. I wanted to articulate sentiment precisely and formulate strong arguments. I wanted to write strongly worded emails. I wanted to think and speak freely.\n\nI wouldn't have been able to achieve any of that if I used ChatGPT.\n\nWhenever I'd hear a peer say they just used ChatGPT for their homework assignments, I'd often think about the many deserving students who hadn't been offered a seat at the university — students who, in a heartbeat, would've happily done these assignments themselves.\n\nI had the privilege of studying words at a strong English literature department with so many fine writing instructors. I leaped at opportunities to have my very own work critiqued by great writers. I still can't fathom having \"my\" writing, either partially or entirely synthetic, reviewed by instructors.\n\nAfter all, I was writing in and walking about the same grounds that writing legends once did — writers like bell hooks, John Steinbeck, Karen Zacarías, and David Henry Hwang. With this writing pedigree in mind, I was inspired and motivated to write myself.\n\nNot a day goes by without me putting my English degree to good use. Not a day goes by without me being grateful to my past self for putting in the work to earn the degree herself — without ChatGPT.",

The ads will show up for some of ChatGPT's free users, as well as some users who've subscribed to ChatGPT Go, a new $8-a-month tier the company rolled out last month.\n\nOpenAI says it will serve ads to you based on the conversation you're currently having with ChatGPT, as well as previous queries and chats.

    "description": "The recent tech sell-off spooked Wall Street, sparking a rerating of AI stocks. One analyst shares his criteria for picking winners in the AI race.",
    "fullText": "The tech stock sell-off that rattled Wall Street last week served as a reminder to investors that AI hype works both ways, and endless enthusiasm is no longer lifting all boats.\n\nThe dramatic downturn hit software stocks hardest, but it also spilled into the broader tech sector. Major indexes have broadly recovered from last week's sell-off, but investors are still on edge about what could be the next shoe to drop.\n\nAccording to Futurum Group CEO and chief analyst Daniel Newman, the sell-off was a \"healthy, overdue rotation and a market demanding receipts.\"\n\n\"Ignore hype and look at growth and constraints,\" he told Business Insider. The analyst also shared some tips for picking AI stocks.\n\nHere is the framework Newman says he's using to spot winners and losers as the AI trade evolves.\n\nNot all companies spending on AI are seeing it pay off. While many on Wall Street chalk this up to the early innings of the emerging tech, companies that are seeing AI drive revenue are ones to look for.\n\n\"Companies need to show that the $470+ billion the hyperscalers are spending this year is generating returns. Those that do will be rewarded,\" Newman said.\n\nHe highlights Amazon and Microsoft as examples of AI spending fueling revenue real growth, through the tech giant'' respective cloud businesses, AWS and Azure.\n\nCompanies creating their own silicon chips are better positioned to compete. Capacity constraints control the AI race, with chip demand outpacing supply.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all working on their own custom AI chips.\n\nNewman highlighted that companies with in-house chips benefit from capacity advantages and vertical integration, which set them up for better margins.\n\nCompanies that have been successful in seeing a return on their AI spending have been largely focused on enterprise offerings. These include the cloud hyper scalers, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as Palantir, a favorite among retail traders.\n\nSome software companies are seeing enterprise monetization, despite the worries that sparked this week's sell-off. Newman highlights ServiceNow and IBM as \"companies driving agentic AI workflows and token consumption.\"\n\nElon Musk told Tesla investors on the company's most recent earnings call that its humanoid robot, Optimus, could generate up to $10 trillion in long-term revenue.\n\nNewman said that physical AI is the next multi-trillion-dollar market outside of data centers. He called out Amazon and Tesla as companies bringing AI to the physical world.\n\nThe market zeroed in on the software space for good reason, Newman said. \"I don't believe the AI will eat all software, but AI will eat some software,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe analyst explained that software companies with data running core business applications can survive in an AI era, but they will have to adapt to meet the needs of enterprise customers who want AI insights to fuel productivity gains.\n\nSome software companies partnering with AI factories include Salesforce and ServiceNow.\n\nAs AI-disruption concerns continue to fuel market skittishness, investors should be wary of companies without a clear narrative for how capex will deliver tangible results.\n\nAnother sign that an AI stock is risky may be that a company is using debt to finance AI infrastructure buildouts. Newman clarified that while debt isn't always a bad thing and can be a way to invest in critical growth, it can make a stock more of a risk-on play.\n\nIn a risk-off environment, Newman told Business Insider that there are a couple of things investors should be watching for.\n\n\"Look at the companies that can really afford to keep investing, for businesses that are going to basically create the cash flow that do it with the least risk.\"",

    "description": "A researcher had free access to messages sent on the app Chat & Ask AI.",
    "fullText": "Have you ever used an application called Chat & Ask AI? If so, there's a good chance your messages were exposed last month. In January, an independent researcher was able to easily access some 300 million messages on the service, according to 404 Media's Emanual Maiberg. The data included chat logs related to all kinds of sensitive topics, from drug use to suicide.\n\nChat & Ask AI, an app offered by the Istanbul-based company Codeway that is available on both Apple and Google app stores, claims to have around 50 million users. The application essentially resells access to large language models from other companies, including OpenAI, Claude, and Google, providing limited free access to its users.\n\nThe problem that lead to the data leak was related to an insecure Google Firebase configuration, a relatively common vulnerability. The researcher was easily able to make himself an \"authenticated\" user, at which point he could read messages from 25 million of the app's users. He reportedly extracted and analyzed around 60,000 messages before reporting the issue to Codeway.\n\nThe good news: The issue was quickly patched. More good news: there have been no reports of these messages leaking to the broader internet. Still, this is yet one more reason to carefully consider the kinds of messages you send AI chatbots. Remember, conversations with AI chatbots aren't private—by their nature, these systems often save your conversations to \"remember\" them later. In the case of a data breach, that could potentially lead to embarrassment, or worse—and using an reseller like Chat & Ask AI to access large language models adds another layer of potential security risks, as this recent leak demonstrates.",

    "description": "You don't have to see ads in ChatGPT, but you'll get less ChatGPT in return.",
    "fullText": "It finally happened. After months of speculation, ChatGPT officially has ads. OpenAI revealed the news on Monday, announcing that ads would roll out in testing for logged-in adult users on Free and Go subscriptions. If you or your organization pays for ChatGPT, such as with a Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, or Education account, you won't see ads with the bot.\n\nOpenAI says that ads do not have an impact on the answers ChatGPT generates, and that these posts are always clearly separated from ChatGPT's actual responses. In addition, ads are labeled as \"Sponsored.\" That being said, it's not exactly a church-and-state situation here. OpenAI says that it decides which ads to show you based on your current and past chats, as well as your past interactions with ChatGPT ads. If you're asking for help with a dinner recipe, you might get an ad for a meal kit or grocery service.\n\nThe company claims it keeps your chats away from advertisers. The idea, according to the company, is strictly funding-based so that OpenAI can expand ChatGPT access to more users. That's reportedly why ads are starting as a test, not a hardcoded feature: OpenAI says it wants to \"learn, listen, and make sure [it gets] the experience right.\" As such, advertisers don't have access to chats, chat histories, memories, or your personal details. They do have access to aggregate information about ad performance, including views and click metrics.\n\nOpenAI will only show ads to adults. If the service detects that you are under 18, it will block ads from populating in your chats. Ads also will not appear if you're talking to ChatGPT about something related to health, medicine, or politics. You can offer OpenAI feedback on the ads you do see, which should inform the ads you receive in the future. You can also delete your ad data and manage ad personalization, if you want to reset the information OpenAI is using to send you ads.\n\nThe thing is, you don't actually have to deal with ads, even if you use ChatGPT for free. That's not just by upgrading to a paid ChatGPT plan, though OpenAI does suggest that option in its announcement. In addition, OpenAI is offering Free and Go users a dedicated choice to opt out of ads here. There is, of course, a pretty sizable catch: You have to agree to fewer daily free messages with ChatGPT. OpenAI doesn't offer specifics here, so it's not clear how limited the ad-free experience will be. But if you hate ads, or if you simply don't want to see an ad for something irrelevant to your ChatGPT conversation, it's an option.\n\nIf you like that trade-off, here's how to opt out of ads. Open ChatGPT, then head to your profile, which opens your profile's Settings page. Here, scroll down to \"Ads controls,\" then choose \"Change plan to go ad-free.\" Select \"Reduce message limits,\" and ChatGPT will confirm ads are off for your account. You can return to this page at any time to turn ads back on and restore your message limits.\n\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "fullText": "Women’s Super League (WSL) Football, the organisation which oversees the top two tiers of women’s football in England, is monitoring developments with X’s artificial intelligence (AI) tool Grok due to concerns regarding its creation of sexualised images.\n\nSome WSL clubs are also monitoring Grok, and another has said it has provided updated guidance to players and staff on safe use of all platforms, including X. Other teams are monitoring the evolving social media landscape and will take action accordingly.\n\nSocial media company X, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, in January prevented Grok from being used to edit images of real people in revealing clothing after OFCOM, the UK’s independent regulator for the communications industries, launched an investigation in January. It follows concerns the AI tool was being used to create sexualised images, affecting women and children, including female athletes.\n\nSignify, an organisation that works across multiple sports and with several WSL clubs to collect, triage and assess the threat online abuse poses to players, says it has been active on the Grok AI image manipulation issue since it first started in late 2025 and has shared advice with WSL and Premier League clubs on how to mitigate harm. But even though X has taken action, the issue is bigger than X and Grok.\n\n“Similar off-platform image manipulation tools are available and we have seen them also being used to produce concerning images and videos,” Jonathan Sebire, co-founder at Signify, says. “This will be a live issue for some time to come.”\n\nOFCOM is not currently investigating the off-platform stand-alone version of Grok because they do not fall under the Online Safety Act in the same way as on-platform versions.\n\nAn OFCOM spokesperson told The Athletic: “We can only take action on online harms covered by the Online Safety Act, using the powers we have been granted. Any changes to these powers would be a matter for government and parliament. The Secretary of State has said that the Government will look at how AI services should be regulated and we are supporting that work.”\n\nSignify has since added a solution which specifically detects manipulated images and reports them to X for action. “Encouragingly, we have seen the platform take strong action when dealing with content,” Sebire added.\n\nIn January, the European Commission announced it was launching an investigation against X under the Digital Services Act over Grok, including “the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, such as manipulated sexually explicit images”.\n\nIn January, Arsenal deleted a video on X and turned comments off on an Instagram post of new signing Smilla Holmberg promoting ticket sales because of inappropriate, sexualised and misogynistic comments.\n\nTottenham Hotspur also turned comments off on their X post announcing the arrival of Matilda Nilden, 19, for the same reason. Some of the replies asked X’s artificial intelligence tool Grok to produce sexualised images of the player.\n\n“It is really worrying,” Fern Whelan, women’s football equality, diversity and inclusion executive for the Professional Footballers’ Association, told The Athletic in a special investigation. “It’s difficult to manage unless it is stopped at source.”\n\nThe public body Sport England decided to stop using X last month to stay true to its values of ensuring “sport and physical activity are safe and inclusive for everyone,” it said in a statement.\n\nWSL Football has already scaled back on the use of X, prioritising Instagram and TikTok instead and continues to monitor the situation regarding Grok.\n\n“Online abuse is one of our highest priorities at the moment,” WSL Football Nikki Doucet told the media last month, urging the need to be proactive. “We have seen the speed in which and the change in the type of abuse that is happening. Some content is not illegal but there is a lot that is awful but lawful.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSoccer, Sports Business, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Coming up with drug candidates isn’t the bottleneck on finding new treatments. Can AI help with the things that are?\n\nClara Collier: I’m very excited to be talking to Abhishaike Mahajan. He works for Noetik, a startup that uses AI to develop cancer therapies, and he’s also one of my favorite bloggers. I’m interested in the intersection of biology and machine learning, and I’m also very, very confused by it. Abhi's writing has been extraordinarily helpful for me in untangling this whole topic. So, to start:  Where do you think the real applications of the technology are? What excites you — and why?\n\nAbhishaike Mahajan: Maybe I can start with my own background. I spent two and a half years at Anthem, a U.S. health insurance company, on a research team applying machine learning to electronic health records to predict who is likely to develop chronic health conditions two years out — essentially,  risk stratification models. I also spent some time there doing causal inference work, trying to answer questions like: If you're on one antihyperglycemic medication and you're, say, a Hispanic male in his 50s, what should the second-line therapy be? Right now, it's very much based on \"vibes.\" All of this was done with a data set of 50 million U.S. clinical claims that the company  had access to.\n\nIn my second job, I spent two and a half years at Dyno Therapeutics, developing better viruses for genetic therapy delivery. This involved a lot of mucking around with AlphaFold and other protein structure prediction and design models.\n\nAnd now, my current role revolves around learning better representations of tumor microenvironments, in the hopes that we can predict which patient populations are most likely to respond to a specific drug.\n\nThe career trajectory I have encapsulates many of the individual fields that have popped up in biological machine learning. If you look at the life cycle of machine learning in applied biology, it can be preclinical, clinical stage or postclinical. My work at the health insurance company was postclinical, dealing only with approved drugs. My current work at Noetik is clinical stage, where most of our interest is in investigational cancer drugs in Phases 1 through 3, although most of the current machine learning in biology that you’ll see is focused on the preclinical stage. The preclinical stage is a very machine learning-shaped problem, since imagination is a very high priority. There is no ground truth. You need to come up with a molecule, a protein, whatever.\n\nMy work at Dyno Therapeutics was closest to preclinical. There are viruses that exist in nature which have coevolved alongside humans that are typically used when delivering genetic therapies. The founding of this company was based on a paper that applied saturation mutagenesis to this particular virus — exploring the mutational landscape, like single amino acid substitutions — to try and figure out whether we can improve this virus's ability to, say, infect the brain, where we may want to deliver the virus’ genetic payload. The answer is yes.\n\nNow the next question is: how much can this be scaled? Dyno was started on that premise. From there on, you are into unobserved territory. You are in evolutionarily divergent territory. You can’t really depend on there being other viruses that closely relate to your existing ones, so you place a very high premium on your models being able to generate new things entirely. I worked with a lot of protein structure generation models — if you have a particular target in mind, can you hallucinate something that will bind to that target and then graft that onto the virus? Or can you use the model to modify larger sections of the virus?\n\nAbhi: This is BindCraft, yes. But BindCraft exists on a continuum of many different binder generation models. It’s arguably the best one — perhaps the point where the field was kind of solved, though others have reasonable disagreements with that, especially given how good the most recent models are. That was mostly preclinical work, since we were primarily testing in monkeys or mice.\n\nClara: There was an essay that went semi-viral recently by Claus Wilke: We Still Can't Predict Much of Anything in Biology.\" He specifically talks about BindCraft there, arguing  that we've had many generations of predictive computational tools claiming that we can do these things with proteins. BindCraft, in this tradition, is very good at what it does, but it has many gaps. You  still need extensive testing and a lot of research taste to make use of it.\n\nAbhi: I can see the argument that it’s perhaps not good at designing binders for intrinsically disordered proteins or proteins that have never been experimentally characterized before. Still, for the set of targets that are experimentally well characterized, where you  just want to generate interesting binders,  I'm inclined to think that it’s  transformative.\n\nPrior to BindCraft, the state-of-the-art method was generating hundreds of thousands of random peptides, folding them with your target of interest using AlphaFold, and then picking the ones with the best confidence metric. To some degree, before BindCraft, your only alternative was pure computational brute force. In that sense, all BindCraft is doing is compressing the workload; it’s not unlocking brand new capabilities. But I would argue that compressing workload, especially at that scale, is pretty transformative.\n\nNow, if we’re to claim that BindCraft results are, at the end of the day, no better than simply doing phage display, then, yes, I can see that. But some recent work from earlier this year suggests that these models can also design binders for receptors that are  traditionally  very hard to design against — like GPCRs, which phage display struggles with. None of these approaches is  a silver bullet, but it does feel like we’re getting close!\n\nClara: I feel like there’s an archetype in this discourse: the crotchety computational biologist who has seen it all before and is very skeptical of the potential of these machine learning tools to make a difference in developing new, viable treatments, either because the technology itself isn’t good enough or because there are too many other bottlenecks. I know and respect a lot of these people! But I also know and respect many others who are incredibly excited. I’m trying clarify what heuristics I should be paying attention to when evaluating how people talk about these technologies.\n\nAbhi: Obviously, take my opinion with a grain of salt. The big reason I wanted to work at a company that is closer to clinical stage machine learning is that, ultimately, most of the problems with drug development relate to the clinical stage. It is very rare that we don't have enough interesting ideas at the very beginning. Rather, the problem is that testing each one of those ideas is enormously expensive. If your goal is to make drug discovery better, you can do one of two things. You can either improve the physical shot itself to begin with — by creating new and unique binders,  like BindCraft —  or you can improve your ability to shoot in the first place. I see clinical stage companies as very focused on the latter, which I think is of much higher importance.\n\nSo why isn't everyone trying to improve how well they can shoot? The answer is that no one really knows how to do it well; it’s a much harder problem. For example, Noetik, the company I work at now, has taken a bet on patient stratification being something that's deeply underappreciated in oncology. We have models that understand tumor microenvironments better than humans do, so we’re using those models to improve patient stratification. The current cancer drug failure rate is 95%; if we can drop that down to 70%, we’ve made it far more economical for pharmaceutical companies to throw far more shots. That’s success to me.\n\nClara: What are some concrete examples of clinical companies that are doing clinical stage work, in addition to Noetik? What does that look like in practice?\n\nAbhi: The most salient example I can think of is a startup called Unlearn.AI. They sell a purely computational platform that conducts synthetic control trials; essentially, they’re saying:  “We’ve run many patients with Alzheimer’s through controlled trials before. Do we really need to run one again? Or, can we use the hundreds of trials that have been run previously to create a synthetic version of the controlled trial population you would otherwise be creating?” They are selling that as a service. That’s an example of a clinical stage company.\n\nClara: How much data would you need for something like that to be feasible?\n\nAbhi: This is why most people don't do it — you need a lot of data points. Most worryingly of all, you need human data points, which are the hardest data points to gather. I think  the reason that there aren’t that many clinical stage machine learning biology companies is because it's such a capital intensive effort, and the people who have the legible pedigree necessary to raise for such a thesis are usually more curious about the preclinical stage stuff because it's more intellectually satisfying.\n\nClara: So, for companies that want to do clinical stage work, do they always need to collect all of the data themselves? If the whole draw is that an enormous number of Alzheimer's trials have already happened, how easy is it to actually collect all that  data from those trials and synthesize it? Do those trials even have all of the data points that you would need for a synthetic trial?\n\nAbhi: Moving away from Unlearn.AI —  because I don't know their data collection strategy — the historical issue with collecting data from prior clinical trials is that it’s really hard. Maybe the people behind the trial did collect some raw biological material from your sample of interest — for cancer that's a tumor resection, for inflammatory bowel disease that's an intestinal lesion —  but they usually care about one or two specific biomarkers, and that's all they extracted. The  sample itself may have since been discarded. Or, maybe, they stored the biological material, but it’s logistically complicated to access; , there isn’t exactly a marketplace for this.\n\nThere is a company I mention in my recent post, Artera AI, which got FDA approval for a black box biomarker that can stratify patients based on whether they will or will not respond to an anti-androgen therapy for prostate cancer. They developed that model based entirely on retrospective specimens from previous Phase 3 prostate cancer trials run by other companies. I know very little about the logistical nightmare of getting  those samples, but I imagine it was intense. The moat in creating models like this is being able to transact with many different companies at once, all of whom don't really want to share their data with you.\n\nClara: What are the class of problems that you think these models are good for, that the current system is doing a bad job addressing?\n\nAbhi: I would vaguely gesture at human simulation — can we predict which patients will respond to a particular drug? It’s obviously a very narrow slice of human simulation. But for all problems where you need to drug a human and observe whatever happens to them, there is some model that claims to model exactly that behavior such that you don't need the human at all. For example, Alzheimer's clinical trials can take decades  to reach their primary endpoint. But maybe there is some biomarker, which is not human legible, that could be gleaned from the patient data, say, a few months in. So there are companies popping up that claim that they can  create prognostic biomarkers during the course of a clinical trial, which they will then sell to other companies.\n\nClara: So it's a way of making the process of figuring out which drugs you should test in humans more efficient.\n\nAbhi: Yes, I would argue that this is the claim of most clinical stage machine learning companies.\n\nClara: This is central to the problem that people who are worried about drug R&D efficiency are concerned about — that actual clinical trials are too slow and too expensive.\n\nAbhi: They feel closely aligned. I know Jack [Scannell] is a historic skeptic of a lot of machine learning biology companies, and I would agree that what I've said so far is the story that has been sold. It feels very logical to me that, at some point, it will bear fruit. It is not obviously true that any of it has borne fruit yet.\n\nBut you can look at the mountain of papers that are published after clinical trials. A cancer trial goes on, ends up failing, and then there's a paper that comes out afterward that tries to figure out why. Usually, some small fraction of patients have responded to the drug, and the paper is trying to understand this. It’s always a complicated answer — maybe a particular cytokine group was super upregulated in the responder group and all of them are white males in their 30s. Useful insights rarely come out of this work, but you can see the inklings of a computational system that could predict all of this in advance. None of it is truly outside the bounds of knowledge. It is compressible; we just don't know how to compress it.\n\nGoing back to the question of how do you know whether you have enough data? I don't think anyone knows,  for any machine learning problem, how much data is enough. You just need to test it out and see what happens. That's an unsatisfying answer, but the realistic situation we're in is that the alternative is having no computational way to simulate a human at all, which is where we are today. I would argue that's worse.\n\nClara: What are the data sets that you most wish you had?\n\nAbhi: The gold standard in my head is whole proteome spatial proteomics. That is a type of data set that I don't think is possible to create today — if it is, it would cost a massive amount of money. This is very specific to cancer, but it would be the ability to take a tumor biopsy and visualize every single human protein that exists within the spatial context of the system. It's almost like an X by Y by 20,000 image of what is going on inside a tumor. Maybe even more than 20,000 if we’re considering isoforms. If I were to add more, I would like multiple biopsies from the same tumor, because within a tumor there exist multitudes.\n\nClara: Why is this impossible to get now?\n\nAbhi: My impression is that it is just incredibly expensive to generate the data; even if you could generate it, you could not do so at sufficient scale to  actually make sense of it. To be clear,  when I say spatial proteomics data would be useful for me, I am not saying it would be useful to me as a human with a human brain. It would be very useful for a model to ingest.\n\nClara: You've written a lot about why you think that cancer is an especially exciting field for machine learning applications; because there are so many different genes and interactions involved, it does not lend itself to a human manually figuring out a target.\n\nAbhi: I'm not sure I would go so far as to say cancer as a field is uniquely suited to machine learning. I would say that I work in cancer because it is a field where the emotional impact is quite high. Cancer is a terrifying disease. The truth is that if you solve cancer, in absolute numbers you don't actually improve human lifespan by all that much — something else gets you in the end. But dying from cancer is such a uniquely horrifying experience that it feels like a worthy life goal to spend at least a few years working on it.\n\nAs a field, cancer is nice because it  has had so much money infused into it. And rightly so, because it is a disease that affects a lot of people. This  has led to the realization  that the disease is so complicated that you need very smart academic oncologists to look over individual patients and recommend treatments, creating a  prebuilt culture of personalized medicine. Outside of oncology, and perhaps autoimmune disease, I don't think any other disease is given the same level of respect with regards to how extremely complicated it can be to treat.\n\nThere is also a lot of unmet need in cancer, and people are willing to accept big swings. In Type 2 diabetes, there's not a ton of unmet need — GLP-1s solve a significant fraction, as do insulin and metformin. But for pancreatic cancer, where everyone who gets the  diagnosis has a high chance of dying in the next six months, there's a strong argument to make that you can try crazier things. It feels like a natural fit for machine learning to play a role.\n\nClara: There’s more cultural willingness to experiment there.\n\nAbhi: Yes, that’s a better way of encapsulating it..\n\nClara: Do you think the structure of the problem biologically lends itself better to computational methods, or do you think it's just a factor of \"people really freaking want to cure cancer\"?\n\nAbhi: I think the second point is definitely the highest order bit. When I wrote the article you mentioned, many people made very valid points that cancer is certainly not alone in being an extremely complicated disease with a lot of patient heterogeneity — there’s inflammatory bowel disease, endometriosis.\n\nThe human body is complicated. Every disease is complicated. The flu is complicated. HIV is complicated. It would be hard to drive a stake in the sand and say this is more complicated than that. The only people who do that are people who want funding for their disease area. This is hand wavy, but a better way of conceptualizing whether a disease is hard or easy to cure is: how many \"knobs\" does biology give you access to for controlling that condition?\n\nIt turns out that for bacterial infections, you get this very nice set of knobs: foreign invaders have a completely different set of biology that you can uniquely interact with. The way at least a few antibiotics work is by jamming up cellular machinery that only exists in bacteria. On the other end of the spectrum, cancer has no unique cellular machinery and is largely identical to you. There are aspects of cancer that are unique, such as  its metabolism, but cancer also grows very fast so it can quickly evolve beyond whatever unique aspect it has. There is no knob that it gives you access to that it is not willing to evolve away from.\n\nHIV gives you a very nice knob in the sense that it's easy to jam up its ability to infect cells, but it doesn't give you access to the knob that allows it to sequester itself into cells for decades. That's why you can have chronic HIV — it doesn't do anything to you, but it just lives in your body because there's no lever you can pull to get it removed from every one of your cells.\n\nThe thesis of another article I'm writing is: If you look at all the crazy drugs that have come out — PrEP, CRISPR, CAR-T — they are all fundamentally reliant on taking advantage of existing biology that was already there. CRISPR is based on a bacterial immune system. CAR-T is based on reconfiguring existing T-cell receptors. The vast majority of medicines rely on conserved evolutionary biology. I would argue that a disease is harder or easier to cure depending on how many of those knobs are made available to you.\n\nClara: Where do you see this field in five years? Which things that people are doing now are going to yield real results?\n\nAbhi: I think those who are focusing on clinical stage stuff will be deemed particularly prescient. Right now, when I look out at the field, a lot of the companies starting up are clinical stage machine learning biology companies. People are realizing we don't need better preclinical research; we need to shift our aims to the clinical stage.\n\nThis is low conviction, but I think the focus on human data will grow larger and larger. People will be more willing to let go of the perfect ability to perturb everything in their system in exchange for working with human data.\n\nThere’s also something about temporality I’m curious about. I've written about Recursion Pharmaceuticals before. Since their founding, they have used this particular assay called \"cell painting\" to visualize things — applying dyes that bind to DNA (blue light) or cell membranes (red light). I wrote about a change they made recently where they dropped that entire assay. Now they are taking raw, “bright-field” images — literally shining a bright light on the cell and looking at it through a microscope.\n\nThey’re doing this because they noticed it made no difference to their models. Models are getting really good; they don't need human legible color labels. More interestingly, the application of those dyes usually required killing the cell first (“fixing it”). If you're just imaging the cells with light, you gain access to a temporal dimension where you can see how the cells react from hour to hour, from day to day, from week to week. There's a multibillion-dollar company generating petabytes of this sort of data month after month. I don't know what they'll do with it, but it feels to me like there is unique biology there that has never been explored.\n\nClara: If you're excited about clinical stage machine learning and the bottleneck is data, what could people be working on to resolve that  bottleneck?\n\nAbhi: Starting a company which generates that same sort of data but cheaply and better than everyone else. I think there is a lot of value in tool or service companies that take existing assays and make them much easier to run at scale.\n\nHave you heard of a company called Plasmidsaurus? I've written about them too. They are very famous in the biology world. All they do is sequence plasmids —  genetic material that you can shove into new cells. Traditionally, creating plasmids is an error prone process, so labs use error prone plasmids and the outcome of that research is pure garbage. This company popped up four or five years ago, and their claim is this: Send us your plasmids. We will sequence them for $15, make sure they're absolutely correct, and send you back the information.\n\nIt's an astronomical success story. I think they started with $100k in seed funding, and now it's a $40 million annual recurring revenue business. They took an existing workflow and rapidly automated it.\n\nClara: Wow. Why aren't there more companies like this?\n\nAbhi: It’s an interesting story. Plasmidsaurus primarily sequences via Nanopore sequencers, which are super cheap to run. Nanopore sequencing came out around 2010-2015. Oxford Nanopore, the company behind it, was filled with great scientific minds, but was terrible at teaching people how to use their machines. So, for a brief time, there was an arbitrage period where people who really understood how to use this machine could charge to run it for other people who had no idea how to work with it. The founder of Plasmidsaurus, Mark, was doing a postdoc at Caltech where he was running Nanopore sequencing all day. He knew better than almost anyone else on earth how to work with these sequencers and even worked with the company to establish good protocols. He just used his knowledge, performed that workflow for other people, and scaled it up.\n\nClara: Are there other areas like this, where a Mark could step in and make the whole process more efficient?\n\nAbhi: I think in an ideal world, more people would start up something in high-throughput proteomics. There’s Olink, there’s Nautilus Biotech. It’s just that you need a very specific skill set to build a company like that, and not many of those people are interested in starting a company. This is why I'm very happy that Focused Research Organization enthusiasts, like Convergent Research, have taken a strong dip into funding measurement companies. It’s a hard thing to make a business out of, but if they do their job well, it pays off civilizational dividends.\n\nClara: Didn’t FROs get started because Adam Marblestone was really interested in connectomics? He wanted that data set.\n\nAbhi: And now there’s E11 Bio. I think Adam has incredible taste in the types of companies that are best suited to funding via the FRO mechanism.\n\nClara: Why is it so difficult to build a data measurement company, then, if there's obviously a market?\n\nAbhi: There are distinct steps in the biology data life cycle. At the very beginning, there is raw academic research. You see that, for example, some particular biological interaction occurs when two peptides interlock together and one lights up. That's the true measurement signal. The second step is turning that into a company where you go out and say, “I can measure XYZ for you at scale.” That's where people get stuck, because for a lot of interesting data modalities, there's no clear market that exists in advance.\n\nFor example, Nautilus Biotech has  a bizarrely good biology podcast. In some episodes they ask, \"What is the utility of our high-throughput proteomics platform?\" And the answer they give is pretty honest: \"We’re still figuring it out, but here are some ideas.\" There isn't a clear use case for it today, but they argue that's because this type of data has not existed before. If you give a scientist a huge amount of proteomics data, all the way to the isoform level, they won't know what to make of it for at least the first year. It takes time for the field to catch up culturally.\n\nClara: So it’s a chicken and egg thing. The data could theoretically be useful, but it's hard to get the data because nobody supplies it, and nobody supplies it because there are no buyers, because people don't know what to do with it yet.\n\nAbhi: Exactly. I talked to someone at E11 Bio about this, with regards to connectomics. I asked, \"Why do connectomics? What do you get from this?\" They said, \"We don't know. No one has measured this before. We know it was kind of useful for a fruit fly brain, but we don't know if it's going to be useful for anything larger. But no one else is going to do it.\"\n\nClara: What is your opinion on Dario Amodei-style claims — that LLM-based architectures will be doing scientific ideation and this will have major impacts on the world?\n\nAbhi: I think it's directionally true in verifiable domains where these models have already demonstrated superhuman reasoning. For any strong AI scientist claim to be true, it is almost implicitly saying that humans are bad at building connections between the existing set of data. I think that is true. I don't think it's so true that we would naturally expect brand new fields to pop up overnight from an AI. I struggle to look at what Dario says and say, \"That's clearly incorrect,\" but I do think humans are actually really good at extracting useful insights from scientific data. We have hundreds of thousands of postdocs and PhD students poring over the literature. They come up with a lot of really crazy things.\n\nTo steelman this: I recently interviewed Ellen Zhong. Her research is about how to interpret cryo-EM particle images better. She developed a deep learning method to do this. Afterward, she went back to existing cryo-EM data that had been measured in the literature using classical methods, applied her method, and saw that she was able to extract proteins that they did not even think existed in the dataset. That is a case where an \"in silico Ellen Zhong\" would be able to measure things humans did not see. But cryo-EM in some sense is a verifiable field; there is a genuine ground truth. I think in biology generally, there are not a lot of verifiable ground truths.\n\nAbhishaike Mahajan has spent his career trying to use computation to improve human health.

    "fullText": "The White House dropped an AI-generated video in the middle of the Super Bowl featuring a British-sounding narrator touting the Trump administration’s “unapologetically American” style. The 30-second video opens with a sweeping shot of a football stadium as Air Force One passes overhead, prompting astonished reactions from two digitally rendered fans wearing Patriots and Seahawks gear. “We don’t do subtle,” the narrator says at the outset. The scene then shifts inside the aircraft, where a voice announces that the plane is “flying over the Gulf of America.” A screeching eagle sound effect follows as the video rapidly transitions to the White House, cutting through a montage of President Donald Trump signing executive orders. “We bet on ourselves and don’t apologize for winning,” the narrator continues.",
