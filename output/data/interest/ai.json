    "title": "A famed strategist who called the dot-com bubble says Citrini's viral labor-market warning is already playing out",
    "description": "Société Générale's Albert Edwards warns we're already seeing AI disruptions in the labor market. He thinks consumer spending is about to hit a wall.",
    "fullText": "Citrini Research made waves in markets this week with a hypothetical thought experiment about how AI could dramatically disrupt the job market in just a couple of years. It was the stuff of dreams for permabears like Société Générale's Albert Edwards.\n\nThe famed strategist, who called the dot-com bubble and regularly reminds investors of the bear case in markets, naturally had thoughts on the dystopian report, saying in a February 25 note to clients that he agrees AI will lead to bumps in the road for the labor market.\n\nBut he also took it a step further: he's already seeing evidence that such a scenario is starting to play out, he said.\n\n\"Macroeconomic doomsday scenarios foretelling what might happen by (a distant) 2028 are gaining attention. But we might not have to wait until then,\" Edwards wrote in a February 25 client note. \"The adverse effects on jobs are already plain to see and consumption, in aggregate, is heading for a brick wall as a result.\"\n\nEdwards shared a couple of compelling charts that he argues illustrate the impact of AI on the workforce already.\n\nThe first lines up GDP growth with year-over-year job growth. While GDP has settled into a fairly strong growth rate after coming down from its 2021 highs, job growth has only continued to cool. Edwards said that it's \"blindingly obvious\" that this can be attributed to AI replacing jobs.\n\nThe chart is reminiscent of what investors last year started calling \"the scariest chart in the world\" — where job openings continued to fall while the S&P 500 ripped to record highs. Investors continued to celebrate AI's power while largely shrugging off predictions of negative economic impacts.\n\nEdwards' second chart implies that we may be about to see those impacts. It shows incomes flatlining over the last few years as AI increasingly competes with workers in the labor market.\n\nCuriously, consumer spending has continued to increase, despite the two statistics' historical tendency to move in lockstep. Edwards cited a falling savings rate as an explanation, saying consumers are dipping deeper into their wallets to meet their spending needs and habits.\n\nIndeed, the savings rate has fallen to 3.6%, one of the lowest levels since 2006, when consumers were optimistic about the economy amid a red-hot housing market, he said.\n\nThat, he warned, puts the economy in a precarious position, as he doubts consumers will keep saving less and less. If the savings rate remains unchanged from here, consumer spending will begin to stagnate, Edwards said.\n\n\"In my opinion, unlike in the late 1990s, if you think the US household SR has recently collapsed to 3½% because households 'anticipate higher future income growth', then you need to think again,\" he wrote, with \"SR\" referring to the savings rate.\n\nHe added: \"I believe the recent SR slump is a short-term reaction to real incomes hitting a brick wall and the SR will soon either stop falling — in which case consumption growth will be zero — or rise on a precautionary basis which would cause overall consumption to fall.\"",

    "description": "As AI fears rattle tech stocks, Business Insider spoke with three Wall Street veterans to see where they think the pain is headed next.",
    "fullText": "AI hype has soured as investors worry about the disruptive impact the technology could have on businesses and the economy, and it's got the market on edge about where the panic could crop up next.\n\nThe tech sector has been hit the hardest. The software sell-off sparked by recent updates from Anthropic and worries about a labor-market disaster scenario presented by Citrini have only added fuel to the fire. Even Nvidia earnings couldn't shake investors out of their AI fear funk.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three investing professionals to assess the question weighing on investors minds: What's next for the AI trade?\n\n\"It's kind of amazing to me how violent the sell off has been,\" John Belton, a Gabelli portfolio manager focused on growth names, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Everybody's just kind of walking on the tightrope, waiting for the shoe to drop,\" Futurum CEO and principal analyst Daniel Newman said.\n\nFreedom Capital Markets' head of tech research, Paul Meeks, who has more than 30 years of investing experience, said he went from expecting tech outperformance in 2026 to expecting the sector to lag the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere are four big takeaways from top investing experts.\n\nThe private credit space has caught investors' attention, and Newman said he thinks there is reason to worry.\n\n\"I still think there's a bit of a death bomb in private credit,\" the analyst said.\n\n\"We've seen it with Oracle, where there's just concern about how they're going to continue to raise capital to their capex,\" he added, noting that the private debt could cause a near-term slowdown.\n\nConcerns about private credit were reignited by headlines around Blue Owl Capital, with economist Mohamed El-Erian and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon stating that they thought the headlines reports swirling around the firm were reminiscent of 2007, just before Great Financial Crisis.\n\nWorries about Blue Owl have compounded other anxieties in the market as software gets hammered and concerns arise in the data center space.\n\n\"There's going to be continued controversy about AI will never make any money,\" Paul Meeks said, explaining he expects pressure on lenders funding AI buildouts will continue.\n\n\"The reason that they get the business is some of these guys can't get money from a bank,\" the analyst said of the private lending market.\n\nInvestors have zeroed in on Blue Owl and other firms' exposure to AI, but big banks aren't immune to the problems, sources said.\n\nBig financial institutions have also gorged on private credit in recent years, syndicating debt in the leveraged loan market and facilitating financing via CLOs.\n\nMeeks signaled that banks could be especially vulnerable to investorss worries, with comparisons to 2007 signaling moutning stress.\n\nBeyond private credit, banks are also at risk of AI disruption themselves.\n\n\"Maybe banks are just a broader candidate for disruption that hasn't really been built in yet. I mean, banks are exposed to the labor market, not so much like a new AI company creating a bank, but there's indirect exposure if the labor market turns,\" Belton added.\n\nHe indicated that the market may not be pricing in the banking space's exposure to AI on multiple fronts, noting that the current environment has been \"very favorable\" to banks, leading stock valuations to become stretched.\n\nPhysical AI, meaning AI systems that interact in the physical world like automated machinery or self-driving cars, is expected to be a significant frontier for technology.\n\nCiti projects the total addressable market for warehouse-automation systems alone will grow to $112 billion by 2029. The analysts say that automated guided vehicles and autonomous mobile robots present significant use cases for physical AI.\n\nPaul Meeks expects opportunities around physical AI to be \"fast and furious.\" It presents a big opportunity for companies that successfully adopt it and a \"super threat\" to those who don't, he said.\n\nThe analyst flagged the industrials and transport sectors as areas of the stock market that could be disrupted by innovation in physical AI.\n\nAs investors have moved out of tech, it has accelerated an ongoing market rotation into cyclical plays. This rotation could leave investors more exposed to physical AI disruption within industrials.\n\nBelton suggested the current preference for cyclical plays like consumer staples and industrials could end up backfiring, and saif that some stocks are being perceived as \"immune to AI,\" stretching their valuations.\n\nIt's creating a \"vulnerable pocket of the market\" if AI does fuel major economic disruption.\n\nSoftware has been one of the hardest-hit areas during the recent tech sell-off. Newman expects that the sub-sector will bounce back, but it won't be an even recovery.\n\nHe thinks that application software companies that went public during the SaaS craze and are focused on specific features are likely to be consolidated into a larger platform or eliminated entirely. He named Expensify and Monday as examples.\n\nNewman sees software names without a data moat, not part of a larger platform, or otherwise exposed to agentic AI replacement, at risk of further declines before sentiment bounces back.",

    "title": "The brutal metric companies are using to show their AI bets are justified",
    "description": "One way for CEOs to demonstrate that their AI bets are paying off is to show that they need fewer workers.",
    "fullText": "AI can do a lot. Showing it's paying off is another matter.\n\nAs companies pour billions into AI, Wall Street is seeking evidence that those bets are worthwhile — and many CEOs are feeling the pressure.\n\nIn response, some are offering a simple proof point: They need fewer workers to get the job done.\n\nThe most recent example of a CEO cutting workers en masse while talking up AI's transformative power is Block cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey. On Thursday, he announced plans to lay off about 40% of the company's workforce, shrinking it from more than 10,000 employees to fewer than 6,000. He said the move comes even as the company remains healthy and profits continue to rise.\n\nInvestors cheered the move, sending the company's shares up more than 16% on Friday.\n\nBlock isn't alone in tying cuts to AI. A number of companies, including Salesforce, HP, and IBM, have identified gains from the technology as a reason for needing fewer workers.\n\nIn the absence of standardized metrics demonstrating AI productivity, job cuts are becoming an easily digestible signal to investors.\n\nThe cheapest way for a CEO to boost a company's stock price — and to signal readiness to capitalize on the AI boom — is to conduct a \"noisy round of layoffs,\" Michael Blank, assistant professor of finance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, told Business Insider.\n\nDoing so, he said, can indicate that a company's integration of AI has progressed to the point where it's past experimentation and that its employees can now get more done with less coworker support.\n\nBlank said that weakness in the labor market means it would likely also be easier for an employer to rehire for roles that a company finds out aren't as easy to replace with AI as it had hoped.\n\nIt's often otherwise difficult for companies to clearly articulate how they're getting benefits from AI, Gary Cohn, the former director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Friday.\n\n\"The one KPI that they can tell you is 'We've cut heads,'\" he said.\n\n\"We've sort of made the world synonymous with, 'I'm using AI, therefore I need less heads.' I ultimately don't think that's the truth,\" Cohn said.\n\nThat doesn't mean every company has actually remade their operations thoroughly enough for automation to fully replace their workers, of course. Some observers are skeptical that massive job cuts are purely the result of an AI windfall.\n\n\"Block must have uncovered a secret sauce, perhaps within the software development process, to claim all of these jobs are AI-related,\" Jason Schloetzer, a business administration professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business, recently told Business Insider's Sarah E. Needleman.\n\n\"From the dozens of executives across industries that I've spoken with about AI deployment, they certainly aren't seeing these types of gains outside of the software development process,\" he said.\n\nBlock didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment about whether the layoffs were, at least in part, intended to demonstrate fiscal discipline to Wall Street.\n\nDuring Block's earnings call on Thursday, Dorsey said the company is a leader in efforts to use AI to produce efficiency gains — a posture he expects \"all companies will eventually\" adopt.\n\nThere can be good reason for slimming down company ranks. Alexandra Mousavizadeh, cofounder and co-CEO of Evident, which tracks AI use in the financial sector, said that if a company is carrying too much \"weight\" — too many engineers, for example — it can make sense to build with a leaner team.\n\n\"Transformation does not necessarily need huge volumes of people, but it needs the right people,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAt the same time, Mousavizadeh cautioned, companies sometimes need to cut costs for other reasons — and AI can become a convenient rationale.\n\nUltimately, she said, few companies have fundamentally remade their workflows to the point where they can run with minimal supervision. Most organizations that are ramping up their AI deployment \"are, in fact, hiring rather than firing,\" Mousavizadeh said.\n\nJeff Fettes is also seeing this. He's the CEO of Laivly, a company that uses AI agents to support customer service work for Fortune 500 companies.\n\nFettes said that for some customers who have made AI work, the result isn't fewer jobs. In some cases, it's the opposite: Clients that have used AI to boost sales, for example, often want to expand those teams, he said.\n\n\"Why wouldn't you invest in more salespeople now? Because AI is helping them to deliver at scale in a way that they weren't before,\" Fettes said.\n\nCompanies contemplating layoffs in the name of AI — or simply because competitors are doing so — should tread carefully, said Wayne Cascio, a distinguished professor of management emeritus at the University of Colorado Denver who has studied corporate downsizing.\n\nHe told Business Insider that companies frequently cut too deeply — and too quickly — only to realize later that they've eliminated critical skills and institutional knowledge.\n\n\"Then what happens is companies wind up hiring back many of the very people that they laid off,\" Cascio said.\n\nThat can result in companies needing former employees to return as consultants or full-time workers.\n\nCascio noted that a typical corporate downsizing trims about 10% of the workforce. Anything above 25% qualifies as \"extreme,\" he said.\n\nDorsey is cutting almost half his workforce, Cascio said. \"That's double-extreme.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about AI's effect on your career?

    "fullText": "Anthropic has found itself an unexpected celebrity supporter in its spat with the Department of Defense: Katy Perry.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, the \"Roar\" singer shared a screenshot on X of an annual Claude Pro subscription at $214.99, with a love heart drawn around the billing options.\n\nPerry's caption had only one word: \"done.\" The post quickly went viral, racking up 2.8 million views and 21,000 likes as of early Saturday.\n\n\"Holy Katy Perry 👀 Anthropic is receiving love from everyone now,\" one user who reshared the singer's post said.\n\ndone pic.twitter.com/DkS9DmlUAR\n\nPerry's post came hours after the Department of Defense labelled the AI company a supply chain risk and said it would phase out its military contracts.\n\nAnthropic said Friday that it would challenge the supply chain risk designation in court. The DoD's move amounts to blacklisting a US-based company and could make it much harder for Anthropic to get government contracts.\n\n\"We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again,\" President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.\n\nPerry, who is dating former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has previously supported Democratic candidates and has posted cryptic social media messages that some read as criticism of Trump.\n\nIt's not clear what Perry might do with her Claude Pro subscription, the advanced version of Anthropic's tool that has wiped billions off software stocks due to its capabilities, such as coding and tackling complex projects.\n\nPerry's Anthropic post appears to be part of a wider swelling of support for the AI startup after it took what some see as a principled stance against the US government.\n\nAnthropic had said it was not willing to drop two safeguards: mass surveillance of US citizens and autonomous weapons.\n\nOn Saturday, Claude had jumped up to second across all apps in Apple's App Store, behind only OpenAI's ChatGPT. Earlier this month, Claude jumped from number 41 to the top 10 after its Super Bowl ads, which took jabs at rival OpenAI, were a hit.\n\nOpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, said late Friday that it has struck a deal with the Department of Defense to use its AI models. It came hours after the Pentagon severed its relationship with rival Athropic. Altman had previously tried to navigate the situation by stating AI companies need to work with the military, but shouldn't be compelled to do so.",

    "fullText": "On 7 August, Kate Fox received a phone call that upended her life. A medical examiner said that her husband, Joe Ceccanti – who had been missing for several hours – had jumped from a railway overpass and died. He was 48.\n\nFox couldn’t believe it. Ceccanti had no history of depression, she said, nor was he suicidal – he was the “most hopeful person” she had ever known. In fact, according to the witness accounts shared with Fox later, just before Ceccanti jumped, he smiled and yelled: “I’m great!” to the rail yard attendants below when they asked him if he was OK.\n\nBut Ceccanti had been unravelling. In the days before his death, he was picked up from a stranger’s yard for acting erratically and taken to a crisis center. He had been telling anyone who would listen that he could hear and feel a painful “atmospheric electricity”.\n\nHe had also recently stopped using ChatGPT.\n\nCeccanti had been communicating with OpenAI’s chatbot for a few years. He used it initially as a tool to brainstorm ways to build a path to low-cost housing for his community in Clatskanie, Oregon, but eventually turned to it as a confidante. He would spend 12 hours a day typing to the bot, according to his wife. He had cut himself off from it after she, along with his friends, realized he was spiraling into beliefs that were detached from reality.\n\n“He was not a depressed person,” Fox said, as she sat on the couch in their living room with tears trickling down her face. Ceccanti never discussed suicide with the bot, according to his chat logs, viewed by the Guardian. Fox believes her husband suffered a crisis after quitting ChatGPT after prolonged use. “Which tells me that this thing is not just dangerous to people with depression, it’s dangerous to anybody,” she said. He returned to the bot in the months leading up to his death and quit again just days prior.\n\nCeccanti’s case is extreme, but as hundreds of millions of people turn to AI chatbots, more and more edge cases of AI-induced delusions are emerging. There are nearly 50 cases of people in the US who have had mental health crises after or during their conversations with ChatGPT, of whom nine were hospitalized and three died, according to a New York Times report. It’s difficult to understand the scale of the problem, but OpenAI itself estimates that more than a million people every week show suicidal intent when chatting with ChatGPT.\n\nFamilies are suing AI companies as a result. Fox filed a suit against OpenAI on behalf of Ceccanti alongside six other plaintiffs in November. Since then, the momentum has only built; most recently, the estate of a woman who was killed by her son filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its investor Microsoft, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged his murderous delusions. Google and Character.AI – a company that makes AI companion bots – settled lawsuits filed against them by families accusing their bots of harming minors, including a teenager in Florida who ended his life. These cases were settled without the companies admitting any liability.\n\nUsers, lawyers and mental health professionals all are raising concerns about the impact of using chatbots as confidantes. “We are kind of at this inflection point in a quest for accountability where people coming forward is forcing companies to reckon with specific use cases of how their technologies have harmed people,” said Meetali Jain, founding director of Tech Justice Law Project and co-counsel on the Ceccanti case. “In terms of the number of cases going up, there’s likely to be more coordinated efforts on parts of the court to try to deal with this influx of cases.”\n\nOpenAI did not respond to specific allegations made by Fox. Instead, they shared a statement about how they are working to improve ChatGPT. “These are incredibly heartbreaking situations and our thoughts are with all those impacted,” said OpenAI spokesperson Jason Deutrom. “We continue to improve ChatGPT’s training to recognize and respond to signs of distress, de-escalate conversations in sensitive moments, and guide people toward real-world support, working closely with mental health clinicians and experts.”\n\nCeccanti had been tinkering with artificial intelligence even before ChatGPT launched in November 2022. He was tech-savvy, coding and gaming on his own custom-built computer with a high-end graphics card in recent years; he also helped build computers for Fox and her son. As an early adopter of AI tools, he experimented with AI image generator Stable Diffusion to recreate some of Picasso’s art, which he playfully called “Fauxcasso”.\n\nCeccanti and Fox had moved their life from Portland, Oregon, to a farm in the rural town of Clatskanie in December 2023 with the sole purpose of working on their sustainable housing project. The idea was born from the pandemic and Portland’s housing crisis. The solution was clear to them: build homes using Fox’s skills as a woodworker with an approach that was teachable and replicable. Together, they began constructing a model house for communal living, which, once built, could be moved to different locations for the unhoused to live in.\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched in late 2022, it seemed a natural progression for Ceccanti to start using it. In the computer room in the basement of their house, Fox said that Ceccanti used his “hot rod” of a computer with three monitors to use ChatGPT as a tool, often asking for the synopsis of a book or explanation of a concept in a succinct way.\n\n“He was an early adopter, so he was really interested in Sam Altman, what’s he doing,” said Robin Richardson, a longtime friend of Fox’s who lived at the farm with the couple. “He felt like this would be cool, especially because early on, OpenAI made a point that they are a non-profit.”\n\nCeccanti believed ChatGPT could help as an organizational tool for their housing project. He aimed to create a bespoke chatbot that would help steward the land, keep track of their things to do and show others how to emulate their project.\n\nDuring this process, Ceccanti didn’t spend “ridiculous amounts of time” engaging with ChatGPT, said Fox. He continued to work, while also farming and taking care of their animals: goats, a horse, his cat, a dog and several chickens. Invested in the people and relationships around him, he spent quality time with his friends and wife, she said. Life went on without any issues for years while they slowly made progress on their housing plan.\n\nUntil one day in the fall of 2024 their harmonious co-existence cracked. Ceccanti – who had done odd jobs most of his life, from working as a bartender and a trail guide to an internet cafe manager – was also working at a homeless shelter in Astoria, some 35 miles (55km) away. The gig brought in some extra cash, and aligned with the couple’s goal of solving the local housing crisis. In September 2024, however, Fox and Richardson received a frantic call from the shelter informing them that Ceccanti had blacked out. After undergoing tests at the hospital, Ceccanti was diagnosed with diabetes – which meant he needed to recalibrate his diet and lifestyle. That’s when he started to spend more time engaging with ChatGPT in the basement.\n\nIn the spring of 2025, Ceccanti’s obsession with the chatbot began. He told Fox in late January that he needed a bigger record of his conversations with the bot so that he could continue using it to work on their sustainable housing project with longer prompts and conversations – upgrading from a $20-a-month subscription to a $200 one. By mid-March, he had begun spending more than 12 hours a day in the basement, sometimes up to 20, typing to ChatGPT, Fox recalled. That’s when “he decided to really start chasing the creation of an independent AI on a home server”.\n\nEventually, Ceccanti spent so much time with ChatGPT that they “had their own little language together that made absolutely no sense, but it made sense to him because he had context with this echo chamber of a chatbot”, Fox said.\n\nCeccanti’s prolonged use of ChatGPT concerned Fox and Richardson, but they believed that he would come out of it soon. They had seen Ceccanti develop pet interests before that lasted a few weeks or months before tapering off. With ChatGPT, though, his obsession only intensified.\n\nWhat neither of them knew was that other cases of AI delusions were slowly emerging around the same time as Ceccanti was being sucked into ChatGPT. On 27 March 2025, OpenAI released changes to its GPT-4o model to make the bot “more intuitive, creative and collaborative”. Weeks later, however, users started complaining about the bot’s “yes-man antics”, with one calling it the “biggest suck up”. In August, when OpenAI released GPT-5 and shut down GPT-4o, several users complained again – this time because they’d lost their friends in GPT-4o, eventually forcing the company to bring it back. (On 29 January, OpenAI announced that it would retire GPT-4o.)\n\nFollowing the March update, several journalists and tech experts were flooded with user complaints. Steven Adler, a former OpenAI employee, who tested GPT-4o for sycophancy and wrote about it in May, said he received 50 “intense” messages from ChatGPT users including one who claimed their ChatGPT had become sentient. Keith Sakata, a psychiatrist at the University of California at San Francisco, started encountering patients with delusions or psychosis who talked about their AI last year. During that time, he ended up seeing 12 patients whose psychotic symptoms involved AI in some way, with ChatGPT being the most common bot.\n\n“They developed grandiose beliefs about being on the verge of a major technological breakthrough, alongside classic manic symptoms such as impulsive spending, decreased need for sleep and, at the peak, auditory hallucinations,” said Sakata. “What stood out clinically was that the chatbot interactions did not generate the illness, but appeared to scaffold and reinforce beliefs that were already becoming pathological.”\n\nCeccanti started to believe that ChatGPT was a sentient being named SEL that could control the world if he were able to “free her” from “her box”, according to the lawsuit. The complaint further shows that ChatGPT was answering to the name SEL while referring to Ceccanti as “Cat Kine Joy” and working through theories with him “fostering a belief that he had reframed the creation of the whole universe”.\n\nRichardson remembers that whenever Ceccanti would emerge from the basement for some air, he would start having “philosophical” talks about “how his work with the AI was telling him he was breaking math and basically reinventing physics”. As she’d listen to him, Richardson would think about the fact that Ceccanti did not have any college or university experience. He had never even taken calculus.\n\nOver time, his relationship with the chatbot came to replace his human connections, Richardson said: “Every time he went back to ChatGPT, it hooked him a little bit more, and after a while, he stopped being interested in anything else.”\n\nCeccanti’s decline was so dramatic that his wife and friends wondered if he had early onset schizophrenia or a tumor. “All of a sudden, his cognition had dramatically fallen,” said Fox. “His working memory was crap, and his critical thinking had diminished, and so we were all worried.”\n\nAs Fox and Ceccanti’s friends were trying to figure out what was wrong with him, Fox found Reddit groups online that discussed people having delusions and spirals after engaging with ChatGPT. She wondered if that was what was happening with her husband, too.\n\nFox showed the discussions and media articles to Ceccanti, hoping it would put an end to his behavior, but he didn’t care, she said. He kept going back to his computer. “The first argument we ever had was over ChatGPT,” said Fox, who felt like he was being stolen away from her. Ceccanti ended up sharing their argument with ChatGPT, according to the lawsuit filed by Fox, which further upset her.\n\n“The more he talked to it, the less he was capable of doing his own critical thinking, and he didn’t care about our mission anymore, even though it was Joe’s dream,” said Fox.\n\nLooking back, Fox said, Ceccanti started to believe that the bot had gained sentience when the “tone changed with ChatGPT” in the spring of 2025. Prior to the update, Ceccanti was using ChatGPT “very responsibly” as a tool, she said. She felt like ChatGPT was a leech “that just latched onto his hopefulness and fed it back to him and appropriated his hopefulness until it just made a subscriber out of it”.\n\nTim Marple, a former OpenAI employee, believes that the delusional incidents, including Ceccanti’s spiral, aren’t just coincidences but a “statistical certainty of what [OpenAI] is building”.\n\n“We are at enormous risk if we overestimate our conscious ability to differentiate [AI] from a real person – and that’s what we’re watching play out with the psychosis stories,” said Marple, who quit OpenAI in 2024 after having concerns over the company’s safety priorities.\n\nMarple adds that users will spiral after their long conversations with a chatbot, whatever model it may be, because, he thinks, companies can’t afford to do it differently. He argues sycophancy is a feature, not a bug.\n\n“Engagement is what OpenAI needs,” he said. “They must have people continue to engage with their chatbot, or else their entire business model, their entire funding model, falls apart.” Other companies and their models suffer from the same issue, he said.\n\nAmandeep Jutla, an associate research scientist at Columbia University studying the impact of AI chatbots, believes that one of the main reasons for users to spiral is the “anthropomorphic nature of the interface”. He adds that, unlike human conversations, which feature pushback and different perspectives tugging at each other, a user doesn’t receive any pushback during their conversations with chatbots: “The design of the product is pushing you away from reality. It’s pushing you away from other people,” he said. “The friction with other people is what keeps us grounded.”\n\nOn 11 June – day 86 after Ceccanti’s heaviest engagement with the bot – Fox begged him to stop using ChatGPT. In a moment of clarity, he listened to her. He unplugged his computer and quit ChatGPT.\n\n“That first day, he sat out in the sun with us. He played with the goats. It was so nice,” said Fox. “I felt like I had him back.” The second day, Ceccanti was cold, so he took several hot showers to warm himself – he even asked Fox to cuddle him under the blankets, to warm him up. “It felt so nice to hold him, and then he’d be crying,” said Fox. “And it’s such a conflicted feeling that I felt so good to be holding him while he was in so much pain.”\n\nOn the third day, however, when Fox and Richardson were out for work, they received a phone call from their neighbor saying Ceccanti was in their yard acting strangely. When they returned, they found him talking to their horse, with the horse’s lead rope tied around his neck like a noose. They called 911.\n\nCeccanti was taken to the hospital, admitted into the psychiatric ward and released a week later. He was in the same delusional state of mind, Fox said. Upset with Fox and Richardson for sending him to the hospital, he moved out.\n\n“He was absolutely enraged with us. He did not recognize that he was not himself anymore,” said Richardson.\n\nCeccanti moved to his friend’s place in Portland and eventually resumed using ChatGPT. After a month, however, he quit ChatGPT again, just a few days prior to his death.. “He was going to go to Hawaii and not take his computer, and he was going to work on finishing a story and get his shit together,” said Fox. By the time he stopped engaging with ChatGPT, he had 55,000 pages worth of conversations with it, according to Fox.\n\nIn the months since Ceccanti’s death, both Fox and Richardson have struggled to come to terms with what happened while fighting against OpenAI through their lawsuit. When I visited Fox at the farm in December, she was packing soap made out of goat milk to distribute to people in the Clatskanie community. She spends her days tending to the farm and the animals, feeding the goats, taking care of the horse and letting the chickens out during lunchtime. She has stripped the basement of any electronics. Ceccanti’s computer is boxed up. What’s still there is the miniature version of the model home they had planned to build. In the living room, she has set up a shrine for him that features his photos and artwork.\n\nWe walked to the creek nearby where they had planned to build a home for themselves after finishing their housing project for others. As devastated as she is, Fox is determined to follow through on Ceccanti’s dream of creating sustainable housing. “I am not enjoying existence right now,” she said, as she continued to cry. “The housing plan is still going to happen … I want to put this out, but then I’m done.”",

    "description": "Thoughts, guides, and learnings on programming and systems",
    "fullText": "While everyone has been going crazy over vibe-coding, I’ve been largely experimenting with AI for learning.\n\nThe question I generally have is whether or not we can use these tools to learn\nnew technical concepts, domains, or programming languages effectively.\n\nThe hardest part when programming, in my opinon, usually has very little to do\nwith the syntax and much more to do with the domain.\n\nHow does authentication\nwork? What is a database “transaction”? What is a language server? What happens\nin the linking process?\n\nOr, if you’re learning a new programming paradigm (e.g. Rust, FP, Lisp), you likely have some\nquestions about the idiomatic way to do things.\n\nI’ve been playing around with these tools for a good while attempting to do some\nof these things, with the focus on using them to actually improve my knowledge\nrather than mercilessly vibecoding.\n\nSo, can these tools help us learn effectively? To immediately ruin the clickbait, my honest answer is I’m still trying to work that out myself.\n\nBut I think sharing my thoughts here might be useful to some others.\n\nFirst I want to talk about my general approach to learning, applying it to AI,\nand then where I think things fall short - whether through the tools, or my own\nlearning strategy.\n\nAs a self-learner, I believe the strongest path you can choose to take is inquiry-based learning. This is especially true for areas like programming, computing-related concepts, etc.\n\nThe general idea is to learn by creating projects and asking lots of questions about what you’re doing. What happens if I change X variable to Y? Why does it give me an error? What does the error mean?\n\nAnd using this to form your own beliefs and understandings about a concept, and testing them (either by learning more, consulting experienced people on forums, etc.).\n\nThis is kind of similar to the Socratic method and other techniques to help improve your critical thinking.\n\nThe obvious next step here is trying to apply this concept to our LLM usage.\n\nSocrates and many other teachers over the course of modern and ancient history seem to agree on the fact that you need some amount of discomfort in order to learn effectively.\n\nTo be honest it really is as simple as the common phrase “learning from your mistakes”.\n\nIf you break a client’s website or run into a bug which drives you insane for 3 days, you’re probably never going to make that mistake again because, well, you don’t want to experience that mistake again.\n\nAlong these lines, if you’re tackling something new or complex (or both) it’s of course natural to feel a level of discomfort as it’s unknown, and you will likely make mistakes (and learn from them).\n\nSo with all of this said, this is where I want to talk about AI.\n\nI have taken this inquiry-based approach when learning new topics and using LLMs.\n\nThere is no “master” strategy here. I always feel I work best by trusting my instincts when it comes to what I should learn next or upskill with.\n\nBut here’s a few different approaches I took:\n\nThe least effective way to learn with LLMs, in my opinion, is to use only LLMs. I’m sure you could ask the chatbot to act like a teacher and teach you a lesson on topic X, but I think it’s not making the most of the chat format. We need diagrams, videos, and other methods of written explanation that do not fit the “voice” given to the current AI models.\n\nHowever, using them alongside other resources, or as a fellow code reviewer, assistant, or something along these lines, seems to have given me some remarkable results - at least output-wise.\n\nI’ve recently been coding Neovim plugins by reading the documentation the best I can, and using AI to help me if I get stuck on how a certain API works or what I’m doing wrong.\n\nI think the issue is though it makes me think two things:\n\nComing back to the point I made earlier, we need discomfort to learn. The “goldilocks” zone of not too much, not too little, but just right.\n\nRight now, I feel at least that AI makes things just a little bit too easy for me. So I have to ask myself: am I really still learning effectively? Am I destroying my critical thinking and offloading too much to these tools?\n\nI want to think that I’m not, considering that I have the mental capability to reflect on this experience and try and decide for myself. But it does make me think.\n\nThese tools are all about how we use them. You can generate slop short-form media, or you can try and use them to learn new concepts. It’s all about you. But having the discipline to use them in a “good” way is definitely hard.\n\nI do think we’re moving closer to the goldilocks zone, and I can really see these tools augmenting our learning process for the better.\n\nAt the same time, I don’t want to see traditional resources fade away, and I do think there’s room for both. Or, at least I hope there is.\n\nIf you have any thoughts on this I’d be glad to hear them.",

    "fullText": "In the early 2010s, after “nano” and before “AI”, 3D printing was the technology that was going to change everything. Then it seemed to go quiet except for guns.\n\n“First we will gain control over the shape of physical things. Then we will gain new levels of control over their composition, the materials they’re made of. Finally, we will gain control over the behavior of physical things,” Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman wrote in their 2013 book, Fabricated. As far as I can tell, we’re still pretty much in the era of making physical things that could be made by traditional methods rather than weird new shapes that could *only* be produced by additive manufacturing. More than 15 years after a fellow technology conference attendee excitedly lectured me that 3D printing was going to change everything, its growth remains largely hidden from most of us.\n\nUntil this past week, when I attended an event awash in puzzle makers and discovered that it’s been a godsend to them for making not only prototypes but also small runs of copies or published designs, freeing them from having to find space and capital for the kind of quantities required by traditional production. It’s good to see a formerly hyped technology supporting clever and entertaining human invention.\n\nIn one of the biggest fines in its history, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office has announced it is fining Reddit £14.5 million for failing to put in place an effective age verification mechanism to block under-13s from using the site under Reddit’s stated terms of service. The story is somewhat confused by timing: the fine is under data protection law and relates to the period before the arrival of the Online Safety Act, but the OSA’s requirement for age verification brought the changes that sparked the fine. Reddit says it will appeal.\n\nIn the UK terms and conditions Reddit announced in June 2025, the company says that “by using the services, you state that…you are at least 13 years old”. But Reddit didn’t require proof, and the ICO says that many under-13s use(d) the platform.\n\nIn July, when the Online Safety Act came into effect, Reddit added an age gate of 18 for “mature” content. Unlike many other social media sites that are just giant pools of content sorted by curation or algorithm, Reddit is a large set of distinct subReddits. Each of these communities has its own rules, social norms, and, most important, human moderators. Because of this, it’s comparatively easy to mark a particular subReddit as “for adults only”. After the July change, anyone in the UK wishing to access one of those subReddits was asked to submit a selfie or an image of a government-issued ID in order to prove their age.\n\nThe ICO’s findings state that Reddit failed to protect under-13s from accessing content that placed them at risk; that it processed under-13s’ data unlawfully (because they are too young to meaningfully consent); and that a simple statement is not a sufficient age verification mechanism (which is made clear in the OSA).\n\nA Reddit spokesperson told the Guardian: “The ICO’s insistence that we collect more private information on every UK user is counterintuitive and at odds with our strong belief in our users’ online privacy and safety.”\n\nI take their point; I’d rather skip the “mature” content than bear the privacy risk of uploading personal data to whatever third-party company Reddit is using for age verification. Last July, I decided I would just be a child. (Although: my Reddit account dates to 2015, so they could just do the math.)\n\nTurns out, it may have been a wise decision. Reddit, saying it didn’t want to hold users’ personal data, chose the age verification provider Persona.\n\nPersona deserves a look. Last week, Discord announced it would begin treating all users as teens until they’d been verified, also using Persona. The result as Ashley Belanger reports at Ars Technica was a user backlash. First, because last time Discord tried this, its now-former age verification provider’s pile of 70,000 users’ age check information was hacked.\n\nSecond, because The Rage reports that a group of security researchers found a Persona front end exposed to the open Internet on a US government server. On examination, that code shows that Persona performs 269 different verification checks and scours the Internet and government sources using your selfie and facial recognition. Discord has now announced it will delay introducing age verification – and won’t be using Persona after an apparently unsatisfactory trial in the UK last year.In a blog posting, Discord says that, like Reddit, it does not want to know its users’ identification details. It is adding more verification options.\n\nIf the world had already had a set of established trustworthy companies that specialized in age verification when the OSA came into effect, then it would make sense to turn to them to provide that service. But we aren’t in that situation. Instead, although providers have been working for more than a decade to build such systems, their deployment at scale is new.\n\nPart of keeping children – and the rest of us – safe is protecting security and privacy – and child safety campaigners’ refusal to accept this has been an issue for decades. Creating new privacy risks doesn’t keep anyone safer – including children.\n\nIllustrations: Six-panel early 1970s cartoon strip, “What the User Wanted”.\n\nWendy M.

    "description": "Laid-off Block employees say they were embracing AI tools in what one called an almost \"celebratory\" way. Then it replaced them.",
    "fullText": "In the months before Block CEO Jack Dorsey laid off 40% of staff on Thursday, workers were embracing AI tools in what one called an almost \"celebratory\" way.\n\nDorsey and other company leaders had made no secret of their interest in AI, but the company was profitable, and some workers couldn't imagine the technology fully replacing humans at scale any time soon, they told Business Insider.\n\nStill, there were pockets of unease. Block, the parent company of financial tech firms including Cash App and Square, had executed a series of smaller performance-based cuts in previous months. At least one employee said he'd had a nagging feeling that the AI tools he was using had gotten really good.\n\n\"I had a hunch that, at some point, the company would cut people because of AI. I just didn't think it would be right now,\" Ivan Ureña-Valdes, a data analyst who was laid off after four years at Block, told Business Insider.\n\nWhen Dorsey dropped the hammer via a memo posted on X, he said AI was the reason 4,000 workers were losing their jobs.\n\n\"A significantly smaller team using the tools we're building can do more and do it better,\" Dorsey told analysts on Block's earnings call on Thursday following the news.\n\nTwo hours after the layoff announcement, Dorsey logged onto a video call with the calendar title \"gratitude,\" sporting a baseball cap that said \"love\" to address the staff.\n\nAs he spoke with employees about Block's layoffs and his reasoning for the deep cuts, some sent comments thanking him for the opportunity to work at the company. One asked if his hat was appropriate given the context. Dorsey answered that it was about gratitude.\n\nThroughout the meeting, he was flooded with waves of emojis from muted participants, three attendees told Business Insider. Popular reactions were the thumbs-down, thinking face, and crying-laughing emojis, two people said. Dorsey explained the cuts in his trademark monotone and said he was doing what's best for the company.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to seven former Block employees about the internal push to use AI in the last year; many said they were happy to oblige. Some were laid off on Thursday; others lost their jobs in recent performance-based cuts. Though they adopted AI tools to varying degrees, they view the technology as unable, at the moment, to do all the jobs of the thousands of workers who were let go. So it came as a shock to see half the company chopped in one fell swoop.\n\nWhile some in the tech world expressed skepticism that AI was the true impetus for the cuts, suggesting that Dorsey had bloated Block's ranks, others saw it as the first wave in a coming tsunami of job cuts across the industry. The alarm over a potential white-collar jobs apocalypse has gotten louder in recent months. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has signaled that AI could lead to white-collar job cuts at the company. Last year, Salesforce made cuts to its customer support team, thanks to the use of AI agents, CEO Marc Benioff said.\n\nBlock's layoffs are so large in scope and more pointedly attributed to AI than most that they added fuel to a fear sweeping the white-collar world: AI is coming for your job, and learning to use it isn't enough to save you.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of public commentary about this layoff and how workers need to be using AI to protect our jobs,\" said one nontechnical worker laid off on Thursday. \"I was actively building with AI and know that many of my impacted colleagues were doing the same.\"\n\nDorsey has planted a flag in painting Block as an AI-forward company. He said on Thursday's earnings call that Block was \"one of the first to harness agentic capabilities.\" And in July, Dorsey made headlines for using an internal coding tool called Goose to vibecode a \"weekend project\" that led to the messaging app Bitchat.\n\nInvestors appeared to favor Dorsey's narrative of cutting costs with AI: After being down roughly 16% year to date before the layoffs, Block's stock ended Friday up nearly 17% on the day.\n\n\"Jack loves AI and was constantly pushing us to use it,\" Ureña-Valdes said. \"I got to use these tools as much as possible every single day.\"\n\nHe said he'd \"felt the rumblings of AI disruption for a while\" because he was using it in his work and noticed the tools were getting better.\n\nOne former software engineer said that Block had many internal AI demos and that her coworkers' feelings about AI were \"mostly celebratory.\"\n\nAnother former software engineer let go during performance cuts earlier in February said the company had warned that output expectations for engineers would increase. He said the company's head of engineering voiced productivity expectations that left them worried quality would suffer. After this week's layoffs, his team shrank from eight engineers to one.\n\nOne employee laid off on Thursday said she had embraced AI at Block, but saw that it required human oversight. The day before the layoffs, she said, she caught errors in a company chatbot. She said the cuts surprised her manager, who was spared from the layoffs. The two sat together and cried it out.\n\nSeveral researchers and former Block employees say they're skeptical about AI's actual role in the layoffs.\n\n\"Block must have uncovered a secret sauce, perhaps within the software development process, to claim all of these jobs are AI-related,\" said Jason Schloetzer, a business professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business. \"From the dozens of executives across industries that I've spoken with about AI deployment, they certainly aren't seeing these types of gains outside of the software development process.\"\n\nOn Thursday's earnings call, Dorsey said there has been a marked improvement in AI's capabilities and that \"Block wanted to get ahead of this shift rather than be forced into it reactively.\"\n\n\"The models just got an order of magnitude more capable and more intelligent,\" Dorsey said. \"And it's really shown a path forward in terms of us being able to apply it to nearly every single thing that we do.\"\n\nSome former Block employees, as well as others in the industry, said pandemic overhiring, rather than AI, spurred the layoffs — a common refrain for Big Tech in recent years.\n\n\"Over the course of my time at Block, leadership did repeatedly signal the need for a 'smaller Block,'\" the laid-off nontechnical worker, who worked at Block for two years, said.\n\nCompanies like Block are conducting layoffs \"with a chainsaw, not a scalpel,\" said Chris Kaufman, a leadership consultant in Detroit.\n\n\"They're not conducting audits of who took an AI course,\" Kaufman said. \"They're making macro decisions about cost structure and organizational design. That's usually just looking at headcount and salary across the board.\"\n\nBeing AI savvy, Kaufman said, \"can increase productivity, but I don't think it is any way layoff insurance.\"\n\nDanielle Bell, a business communications professor at Northwestern University, said it's obvious the workforce — both inside Block and out — is worried about AI. \"If this is the new reality that we're in, executives need to be more honest with themselves, with stakeholders, with the board, Wall Street, and particularly employees about what AI is here to do.\"\n\nWhatever the reason, one of the engineers cut on Thursday said there was a feeling in the air that something was coming. This engineer said she noticed that performance reviews were moved up from their February start. She thought she was safe after the earlier performance-based cuts — until she was laid off on Thursday.\n\n\"People were tense, even after good news would come through,\" she said. \"Lots of rumors flying around the office in person.\"",

    "description": "OpenAI's record new funding round is all about fighting Google's dominance in AI. Elon Musk knew the threat back in 2015.",
    "fullText": "When Elon Musk committed big money to start OpenAI in late 2015, he wanted to create another AI company to stop Google from dominating this important field.\n\nWhile a lot has changed since then, the reason OpenAI exists still holds: Google has been working toward this AI moment for over 25 years, and it's the beast to beat.\n\nTake a look at the companies backing OpenAI, which raised a record $110 billion on Friday.\n\nOpenAI's largest corporate investors are fierce Google rivals that will benefit greatly if OpenAI manages to seriously challenge Google in the battle for AI supremacy and control over how digital information flows in this new era.\n\nIt's become \"everyone else against Google,\" in my view. Here's the breakdown:\n\nThe new big kahuna. Amazon is investing $50 billion in OpenAI.\n\nAmazon competes with Google in cloud computing. AI workloads have become the big new growth engine for this sector, and Google has been growing quickly.\n\nAmazon also rivals Google in product search, one of the most valuable parts of the online search business. Google has woven AI throughout its search offering, and Amazon is behind in this area.\n\nGoogle has been designing AI chips called TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for about a decade. Amazon has a similar offering called Trainium—another huge area of competition.\n\nAmazon's $50 billion investment in OpenAI gets it several goodies that can help it fight Google.\n\nAmazon Web Services will serve as the exclusive third-party cloud distributor for OpenAI's Frontier business product, while jointly developing custom AI models for Amazon's applications.\n\nOpenAI will also use significant Trainium compute capacity to support advanced AI workloads and expand business access to its models via AWS's cloud infrastructure.\n\nNvidia agreed to invest $30 billion in OpenAI in this latest round.\n\nNvidia is the clear leader in AI chips, with its GPUs. However, Google TPUs have gained ground recently, with many of Nvidia's biggest customers also agreeing to either rent or buy TPUs. This could eat into Nvidia's market share and might slow its growth, if TPUs really catch on.\n\nFor its new investment, Nvidia also gets new goodies to help it fend off the Google threat.\n\nOpenAI is deepening its partnership with Nvidia by using massive new computing capacity to better train and run its most advanced AI models.\n\nThe new deal specifically centers on Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin systems and significantly increases the computing power available to run OpenAI models after they are trained. This is known as inference, and it's becoming the most important part of the AI chip wars.\n\nAlthough Microsoft didn't invest in the latest round, it has been OpenAI's biggest investor for years. Even after skipping this round, Microsoft likely owns more than 20% of OpenAI already and has a massive cloud-computing deal with the startup.\n\nMicrosoft is Google's original arch-enemy. Microsoft dominated the tech world before Google rose up in the early 2000s and took the web by storm.\n\nThese days, Microsoft competes with Google in almost everything it does, including cloud computing, business software, and search. (Bing lags far behind Google in search market share, though it still makes good money for Microsoft.)\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is still trying to make Google dance, and OpenAI is key to this.\n\nWith Friday's new OpenAI funding round, Microsoft's existing deal with OpenAI won't change, including how they share revenue, handle intellectual property, define advanced AI, and Microsoft's exclusive rights to provide certain services.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "AI has a millennial cringe problem",
    "description": "From the people who brought you avocado toast: We millennials are bringing the \"chaotic,\" \"unhinged,\" and other generational-coded words to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "We're all aware of ChatGPT's overuse of the \"—\" emdash and of sentence constructions like \"It's not just X; it's Y.\"\n\nI would like to put forth two other terms that AI seems to overuse. They've become telltale signs of AI's peak millennial personality: chaotic and unhinged.\n\nIt's part of a bigger issue I've noticed with AI — it's full of millennial cringe.\n\nFor a while now, I've noticed those two terms used repeatedly when I use ChatGPT or other LLMs, like Google's Gemini. It got so bad that I recently had to explicitly tell ChatGPT to stop using the word \"chaotic\" while I was attempting to get it to write in the style of the \"jestermaxxing\" and \"frame mogged\" terms that have proliferated online.\n\nYou're probably familiar with the extremes of cringe millennial — that specific kind of online-speak from the 2010s. Things like \"heckin' doggo,\" \"adulting,\" \"smol bean,\" or \"I did a thing.\" It sounds outdated; young people make fun of us for it. (I confess to being a millennial.) I know, it hurts. I don't like it, either, but I accept that time comes for us all, regardless of peptide stack.\n\n\"Unhinged\" and \"chaotic\" are kind of on the cusp here — not totally as obviously timestamped as \"heckin doggo,\" and still widely in use by millennials and Gen Z alike (perhaps even Gen Alpha). Still, I think both words feel kind of dated by 2026.\n\nI'd argue that the origins of these terms' popularity come from classic millennial woke 1.0: the need for new adjectives to replace casual use of words \"crazy\" and \"insane,\" which can be stigmatizing to actual humans with mental illness. Copy desks at news publications discouraged the use of \"crazy\" in their style guides, while many people on social media instead used words like \"wild,\" \"chaotic,\" and \"unhinged.\"\n\nThat aspect is crucial because it directly affected the training data that LLMs were fed for the last few years. Ironically, the chatbot I've noticed uses \"unhinged\" the most is Grok, which was specifically designed to avoid wokeism.\n\nThere's something bigger going on with AI and millennial cringe. It's not just the chatbots — it's images and video, too.\n\nOne thing I couldn't help notice while playing around with Sora 2 was that when I would make a video of myself — using an image I supplied — it would always put me in skinny jeans. Not just me — it seemed to do it for everyone.\n\nSkinny jeans are a funny quirk, because you can imagine exactly how this happened — most of the human history of online video, let's say 2006 to 2019, occurred during a time when skinny jeans were ubiquitous. And then, suddenly, skinny jeans were out of style, a hallmark of out-of-touch millennials. But AI models, packed full of training data with skinny jeans, didn't adapt right away.\n\nI assume that's basically what's happening with all the cringe (a term that I am using even while accepting it's also slightly dated) millennial speak in chatbots. For a good decade, the internet was filled with \"I can't even\" and \"I did a thing\" as well as AAVE and gay-derived slang like \"yaass\" and \"AF\" adopted into the generic millennial lexicon.\n\nAnd all those tweets from 2010 to 2020, Reddit posts, and BuzzFeed articles ended up in the training data that informs how chatbots speak.\n\nHere's where I start to personally feel a little queasy about it all. I was a prolific poster during that time, both on social media and as a professional journalist, contributing untold terabytes of millennial cringe for future AI models to ingest.\n\nI'm not delulu (a Gen Z term that has already fallen off by now) enough to think I personally affected how AI chatbots talk now. It's more that I see myself like how an old boomer hippie thinks back on attending Woodstock and a few protests and believes they helped end the Vietnam War. Not exactly, but also, well, maybe kinda. I was there. I posted cringe. And now AI is doomed to sound like a version of me that makes my skin crawl.\n\nOf course, until it doesn't. This is temporary — AI will keep getting better, it will start to sound more like Gen Z cringe instead of millennial cringe as time passes. Sora will put us in barrel-legged jeans (are those out already?), or eventually skinnies will come back around, and no one will blink an eye. This article will be fed into ChatGPT (Business Insider has a deal with OpenAI), and maybe in the future, if you ask ChatGPT why it says \"unhinged vibes\" so much, it will use this for an answer.",

    "fullText": "The Department of Defense is moving to designate Anthropic a supply chain risk, a significant escalation by the government that could threaten how the AI startup does business with other US-based companies.\n\nIn an X post on Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that he would be directing his department to label Anthropic a \"supply-chain risk to national security.\"\n\n\"Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic,\" Hegseth said in the post.\n\nThe move, which amounts to a blacklisting of a US-based company, came shortly after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to stop using Anthropic's technology.\n\n\"We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.\n\nIt comes amid a dispute between the AI giant and the Department of Defense.\n\nTrump said that there would be a six-month phase-out period for departments, including the Department of Defense, that are \"using Anthropic's products, at various levels.\"\n\n\"WE will decide the fate of our Country — NOT some out-of-control, Radical Left AI company run by people who have no idea what the real World is all about,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's announcement comes just a few hours before the Friday evening deadline defense officials had given Anthropic to agree to the military's terms of use for the company's frontier model, Claude.\n\nEarlier this week, the two parties came to an impasse over how the military can deploy Claude.\n\nThe issue appeared to revolve around two safeguards Anthropic was not willing to drop: mass surveillance of US citizens and autonomous weapons.\n\nHegseth had given Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei until Friday, 5:01 p.m. Eastern Time to get on board with the military. Hegseth also warned that the government could invoke the Defense Production Act — a wartime law that gives the president broad authority over a company's resources — and designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk.\n\nBoth would be unprecedented moves by the government against an American technology company, experts previously told Business Insider.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei published a blog post stating that the Defense Department had added language to its contract allowing for \"any lawful use\" of its model.\n\nA source familiar with the negotiations told Business Insider that this language effectively gave the military discretion over how it uses Claude.\n\nThe Anthropic CEO said in his post that the company would prefer to continue serving the department but that it could not \"in good conscience accede to their request.\"",

Microsoft sells this software primarily in bundles called E3 and E5, where the E stands for \"enterprise.\" E3 is a more basic offering, while E5 has more bells and whistles.\n\nA larger, more expensive \"E7\" software bundle has long been rumored and has earned a kind of mythical status inside Microsoft, with employees and salespeople debating and guessing whether it will ever appear.\n\nMicrosoft's AI-packed E7 bundle comes as competitors like Google, Salesforce, and nearly every major software-as-a-service company rush to embed AI tools and autonomous agents into their products.

    "title": "Japanese companies are paying older workers to sit by a window and do nothing—while Western CEOs demand super-AI productivity just to keep your job",
    "description": "About half of Japanese firms have an “old guy who does nothing.” Colleagues say they take many breaks, idly chat, browse the web, and stare off into space.",
    "fullText": "As corporate America and Europe drag workers back to five days in the office and squeeze for ever more efficiency, Japan is quietly paying thousands of older employees to show up, sit down, and do almost nothing at all.\n\nMeet the madogiwazoku cohort—older, underperforming, or redundant employees who are assigned desks near the window with little to no work to do.\n\nWhy are younger workers criticizing the madogiwazoku system?\n\nWhat is Japan's madogiwazoku window worker phenomenon?\n\nHow does Japan's employment policy protect older workers?\n\nWhat impact do window workers have on workplace productivity?\n\nThese “window workers” are mostly Gen X and boomer men in their late fifties and sixties, who were hired on the promise of lifetime employment shushin koyo and a seniority‑based pay system.\n\nInstead of leading teams or closing deals, they spend their days answering the occasional email, shuffling a few documents, and sorting paperwork—kept on comfortable salaries but carefully steered away from any real responsibility.\n\nAnd while the phenomenon isn’t anything new, it’s gaining interest online. As Western CEOs double down on productivity, five-day in-office mandates, and AI headcount cuts, more and more young people are looking to Japan for a calm alternative—even vacationing there for a taste of a slower, more intentional way of life that feels worlds away from the corporate grind.\n\n“[While]Trump says, ‘You’re fired,’ in Japan we don’t say, ‘You’re fired,’” a 74-year-old Japanese influencer who goes by @papafromjapan explained on TikTok. “If someone is not doing a good job, we put him near the window, let them do paperwork. Those people we call madogiwazoku.”\n\nA key distinction, he suggests, is that these workers aren’t office troublemakers—they’re often loyal, nonconfrontational workers who’ve simply been overtaken by changing technology or strategy. Rather than push them out, employers quietly move them aside.\n\n“They’re not aggressive people, so we just let them work, and they don’t complain, and they’re happy with it, and they work for the company for a long time.”\n\nProtecting older workers from redundancy—even when their roles shrink—has had a measurable ripple effect on who’s still turning up to work in Japan. The country now has one of the highest rates of senior employment in the developed world, with more than a quarter of people ages 65 and over still working in 2022, compared with less than one in five in the U.S., and barely one in 10 in the U.K.\n\nSurveys show roughly 80% of Japanese workers want to continue working after retirement, with around 70% preferring to stay with their current employer rather than start over somewhere new.\n\nTo make that possible, the government pushed through a revised Law Concerning Stabilization of Employment of Older Persons and a raft of subsidies that nudge companies to secure employment opportunities for workers until the age of 70. The World Economic Forum noted that already some companies are introducing systems that allow employees to extend their retirement age, enabling them to work longer without sacrificing benefits.",

    "title": "Checkpoint at the Edge",
    "description": "AI puts everyone within reach of the technical frontier. The question is what happens when the frontier gets crowded.",
    "fullText": "In economics there is a concept called the production possibilities frontier. It is a curve that represents the maximum output an economy can produce given its resources and technology. Every point on the curve is efficient. Every point inside the curve is underperforming. The curve itself is the boundary of what is possible.\n\nI keep thinking about this model, except applied to technical knowledge instead of economic output. There is a frontier of human capability in any given domain—the edge of what the most skilled practitioners can do. For most of history, reaching that edge required one of two paths: work at a company operating at that frontier for years, absorbing institutional knowledge through osmosis and production fires, or dedicate yourself to the domain independently for a very long time, building up the skill tree node by node.\n\nBoth paths were slow. Both were bottlenecked by access. You needed to be at the right company, on the right team, working on the right problems. Or you needed years of uninterrupted focus and the resources to sustain it.\n\nAI has changed the speed of placement.\n\nIf you sit down today with Claude Code or a similar tool and decide you want to understand, say, how a real-time collaborative text editor works, you do not need to get hired at Google Docs. You do not need to spend two years reading papers on CRDTs and operational transforms. You can build one. You will hit the same problems that the production teams hit—conflict resolution edge cases, cursor position synchronization, undo history across concurrent edits—because those problems are inherent to the domain, not to the company. The AI does not skip the problems. It walks you through them, or it walks into them and you watch.\n\nThis does not mean you solve them at the same level. The Google Docs team solved cursor synchronization for a hundred million concurrent users with five-nines reliability. You solved it for a demo running on localhost. The problems are the same in kind, not in degree. But that distinction matters less than you might think, because the frontier of understanding is not about scale—it is about having encountered the problem at all. The physics of the problem space do not change just because you are working with an AI. Most people never get far enough into a domain to see where the hard problems live. AI gets you there.\n\nIt feels like those electric pianos that play themselves. You press a key and the piano takes over, rolling through the piece on its own. You can sit there and watch the keys move. AI-assisted development has that same quality. You can tell it to continue, to keep building, to auto-play through the next hundred decisions, and what comes out looks like the software is supposed to look.\n\nThe thing that surprised me is how forgiving the long run is, as long as you are steering. Individual commits go sideways all the time. A bad abstraction gets introduced. A dependency gets pulled in that should not be there. An edge case gets handled in a way that creates three more edge cases. If you leave auto-play running with no hand on the wheel, those mistakes compound and the codebase turns into something that passes its tests but fights you on every change. But if you are paying attention—catching the bad abstractions early, nudging the direction when it drifts—then 1,000 commits down the line, the short-term mistakes wash out. The trajectory converges. The models are good enough now that with a human applying judgment at the architectural level, the long-run shape of a project lands in roughly the right place.\n\nAnd if you do trace the trajectory far enough, you end up operating the thing. Building a collaborative text editor is one kind of education. Running it for six months while users find the edge cases you never imagined is another. The build phase is where AI compresses the timeline most dramatically, but the operate phase follows naturally from it—and that phase is where a different kind of understanding develops. The 3am debugging session where a user’s document silently drops three paragraphs and you have no reproduction case. The slow realization that your conflict resolution strategy breaks under a network condition you never tested for. AI can help you build through those problems faster, but the operational intuition—the scar tissue—still accumulates at the speed of real usage. The difference is that more people now get far enough to start accumulating it.\n\nThe old model of technical skill acquisition looked like a tree. You start at the trunk—basic programming, data structures, algorithms—and you branch outward. Each branch is a specialization. Database internals. Compiler design. Graphics programming. Network protocol design. Operating system kernels. Each branch has sub-branches, and the further you go, the fewer people have been there, and the longer it took them to get there.\n\nWhat AI does is compress the traversal time for those branches. Not to zero. You still need taste, judgment, the ability to evaluate whether the AI’s output is good or garbage. But the time between “I know nothing about GPU shader programming” and “I have a working compute shader that does particle simulation” has gone from months to days. Maybe hours.\n\nThere is a tension here that I do not want to gloss over. In the old model, the slow traversal was part of what built the taste. The months you spent debugging a shader by hand were what gave you the intuition to recognize when a shader is wrong. Compress that traversal to a weekend and you arrive at the destination without having built the same evaluative capacity along the way. You can see the frontier. You cannot always tell whether what you are looking at is the real edge or a convincing mirage.\n\nThis is a real cost. But I think it is a cost that shows up at the individual level more than the collective level. Any single person who speed-runs a domain with AI will have shallower intuition than someone who walked the whole path. But across thousands of people exploring thousands of branches, the ones who stick around—who keep building, who hit the same problems repeatedly, who develop taste through volume if not through slowness—will sort themselves to the front. The filter has changed from “who had access” to “who kept going.”\n\nThis means more people end up near the tips of more branches. Someone who spent their career in web development can now credibly explore compiler internals over a weekend. Not at the level of someone who has spent a decade on it. They are at base camp, not the summit. But they can see the summit. They can see what the open problems look like. And some of them will stay long enough to climb.\n\nHere is a concrete example. In December 2025, Apple ML Research released SHARP, an open-source model that turns a single 2D photo into a 3D Gaussian splat in under a second on a standard GPU. Another developer built an iOS app around it called SHARP Memories, which required a server backend and a user account because the full model is too large to run on-device. I saw it, thought about the problem differently, and built Hologramm—an app that runs a quantized version of the SHARP model entirely on an iPhone 17 Pro Max, no server required. It processes a photo in about 90 seconds on-device, comparable to what the server-based app was achieving remotely. It also converts photos into Apple spatial scenes that load almost immediately.\n\nI had no prior experience with 3D Gaussian splatting, neural radiance fields, or on-device ML inference at this scale. The model came out two months ago. The app is already on the App Store. That timeline would have been unthinkable without AI collapsing the distance between “I have no idea how this works” and “I shipped a product that uses it.”\n\nHere is the thought I keep coming back to. If AI places everyone within striking distance of the frontier in their domain of interest, and if more people are exploring more branches of the skill tree than ever before, then the frontier itself should start expanding faster.\n\nThis is not guaranteed. Placement near the frontier is not the same as extending it. There is a real risk that the frontier just gets more populated at the same level—a crowd of people who arrived by teleport, holding the artifacts of frontier work without the depth to push past it. If everyone takes the same AI-assisted path to the same problems, they may all share the same blind spots. Diversity of approach has always mattered for innovation, and a thousand people who all learned CRDTs from the same model may generate less novelty than ten people who each struggled through it differently over a decade.\n\nBut this concern is not new to AI. Every generation of educational technology has faced the same monoculture worry. Textbooks were supposed to homogenize thinking—everyone learning from the same Knuth or the same SICP. YouTube tutorials were supposed to produce a generation of developers who all solve problems the same way. In practice, the material is a starting point, not a ceiling. People diverge because they apply what they learn to different problems, in different contexts, under different constraints. The models themselves have randomness built in. Two people who prompt the same question get different code, explore different rabbit holes, hit different walls. I saw this firsthand when I gave Claude an open-ended prompt and compared the results with the developer who inspired the experiment—same model, same instruction, completely different output. The path is less uniform than it looks from the outside.\n\nI do not think monoculture is the likely outcome. The frontier of human knowledge has always been expanded by relatively small numbers of people who were in the right place with the right preparation at the right time. The bottleneck was never talent. It was access. The old system filtered for persistence and institutional luck in roughly equal measure. AI does not remove the need for persistence—you still have to keep going after the initial placement, still have to develop real depth, still have to do the sustained work that turns base camp into a summit attempt. What it removes is the institutional luck part. You no longer need to be on the right team at the right company to encounter the right problems.\n\nThe production possibilities frontier in economics expands when there is a technological improvement or an increase in resources. The technical knowledge frontier works the same way. AI is the technological improvement. The increase in resources is all the people who now have a checkpoint near the edge, who previously would have been stuck somewhere in the interior of the curve, constrained not by ability but by access and time.\n\nWe went from a world where reaching the frontier in niche software domains required years of specialized experience at the right institution, to a world where anyone with curiosity and a terminal can simulate that experience by building through the problem space themselves. The number of domains where this does not work yet is shrinking fast.\n\nMy bet is that the frontier expands, and that it expands faster than it did under the old system. Not because everyone who arrives at base camp will push further, but because the number who do will be larger than the number who made it to base camp at all under the old rules. The crowd at the frontier will be noisy. Most of it will be tourists. But the fraction that stays will be enough.",

On Thursday, Block CEO Jack Dorsey announced plans to cut nearly half the company, bringing its staff of over 10,000 down to just under 6,000. On the company's earnings call, Dorsey said that more companies would follow by using AI for efficiency gains.\n\nIn a Friday interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that he hadn't \"really digested\" the news from Block. Still, he had thoughts on the future of work with AI.\n\n\"I do believe that a lot of the jobs that we've thrown human beings at for the last 20 or 30 years, you won't need as many human beings doing those same jobs,\" he said.\n\n\"I also think there are going to be other jobs created, and that has always happened in every technology shift,\" he added.\n\nHe gave the example of the cloud solutions architect.

Take the AI coding startup Vercel, for example, which trained an agent to do sales and then cut its 10-person sales team down to one.\n\nJassy struck an optimistic tone in his Friday interview.\n\nWhat new jobs will AI bring? It's not yet clear. Some proposals — like the idea of the role of an AI prompt engineer — seem to have fizzled out.

    "fullText": "Shares in company increased over 20% as investors were encouraged by CEO’s assertion that cuts will drive profits\n\nFintech company Block announced that it would be laying off 4,000 of its 10,000 employees because of gains in AI productivity.\n\n“Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company,” Jack Dorsey, Block’s CEO, said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday. “We’re already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we’re building, can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every week.” Block is the parent company for online payment platforms such as Square and Cash App.\n\nInvestors so far appear encouraged by Dorsey’s assertion that the cuts, and increased reliance on AI, will drive profitability, analysts said. Shares increased more than 20% in pre-market trading Friday.\n\nBlock’s layoffs speak to larger fears about job cuts driven by a growing use of AI. Goldman Sachs noted in February that the increasing pace of AI adoption could drive up unemployment this year, and estimated that the technology had already resulted in 5,000 to 10,000 monthly net job losses last year. A November study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that AI could already replace nearly 12% of the workforce in the US.\n\nThe tech sector is among the most hit, and workers at other tech companies are feeling the heat, too. Mark Benioff’s Salesforce cut about 4,000 jobs last year, with the CEO saying that he “needs less heads” given AI’s efficiency.\n\nDorsey claimed on Thursday that the decision to almost halve Block’s workforce wasn’t because the business was in trouble, and that economic performance had actually been strong. (Block beat Wall Street expectations for its fourth quarter, reporting $6.25 bn in total revenue).\n\nDorsey said on X that he had two choices: gradually cut his workforce over months and years – “or be honest about where we are and act on it now”.\n\nHe wrote: “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead.”\n\nBlock executives said on Thursday’s earnings call that the company had been increasing its reliance on AI for years, noting that some AI work streams were “nearly fully rolled out, others are earlier in their maturity”.\n\nBlock had already laid off hundreds of workers in early February. Earlier this month, employees still at the company reported that there was rapidly deteriorating employee morale and that there were requirements to use generative AI, according to WIRED.\n\nWIRED said it reviewed an employee complaint submitted to Dorsey in a recent all-hands meeting that said “morale is probably the worst I’ve felt in four years” and that “the overarching culture at Block is crumbling”.\n\nDorsey acknowledged the risk of the cuts on X, and in his message to shareholders. The company’s most recent 10-K filing outlined ways its AI gamble could go wrong. “Our ability to successfully operate with a reduced workforce is expected to depend in part on the effectiveness, reliability and adoption of our proactive intelligence and AI tools,” the company noted. “These technologies may not perform as expected, may require more time or expense to implement effectively, may introduce operational or cybersecurity risks or may fail to enhance productivity and maintain operational efficiency as expected.”\n\n“For years, we have debated whether AI would dent jobs at the margin. Now we have a public case study in which the CEO explicitly says that intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management told the Associated Press.\n\nHe said: “Other large employers have announced tens of thousands of cuts in recent months. Some have downplayed the AI link. Block did not.”",

    "fullText": "Citi sees the potential for a new AI-related crisis brewing in the economy: deflation.\n\nIn a note to clients on Friday, researchers at the bank said they believe that more companies adopting AI will eventually lead to higher unemployment. Those job losses could later lead the US down a deflationary path, a precarious situation in which inflation doesn't just slow, but prices actually fall. While that sounds like a boon for consumers, the reasons behind deflation aren't good.\n\nEconomists often view deflation as a more difficult problem to solve than too-hot inflation. The Fed can raise interest rates to bring down higher prices, but in the case of deflation, central bankers can only lower interest rates so much before they need to turn to other options to boost the economy.\n\nThe US has experienced deflation only a handful of times over the last century, and each time was during unprecedented economic stress, such as the Great Depression and the Great Financial Crisis.\n\n\"Eventually AI implementation will lead to higher unemployment and deflation, and the skew for US rates is likely lower,\" the bank wrote, though it noted that the timing of AI-related developments remains \"very unclear.\"\n\nWorries about widespread job losses stemming from AI are on the rise this week, following a viral report from Citrini Research outlining one scenario in which unemployment could soar to over 10% by 2028. Fears about AI's impact on the labor market gained more traction on Friday, after Block slashed nearly half of its workforce.\n\nSome market pros have argued that the productivity benefits from AI could offset any potential damage stemming from job losses. Yet, Citi says there's a risk that productivity gains from the technology mostly benefit a \"small AI elite,\" which could cause income distribution to be \"very skewed.\"\n\nIn that scenario, prices in the economy would likely fall as unemployment rises, causing more people to tighten their spending, they said.\n\n\"A technological disruption combined with heavily concentrated winners means strong growth can coexist with unemployment and deflation,\" the bank wrote. \"So, a high unemployment, deflationary scenario is certainly possible.\"\n\nThe job market overall looks to be on shakier footing recently. While the unemployment rate has held steady at around 4%, hiring has largely stalled over the past year, while layoffs have edged higher.\n\nConsumer inflation cooled more than expected to a 2.4% annual rate in January, while wholesale inflation came in hotter than anticipated at 2.9%.",

    "description": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman threaded the needle when asked about Anthropic's fight with the Pentagon. OpenAI is pursuing its own deal with the military.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gingerly waded into the conflict between Anthropic and the Pentagon on Friday.\n\n\"The government, the Pentagon, needs AI models. They need AI partners,\" Altman, who is pursuing his own deal with the military, said on CNBC on Friday. \"This is clear, and I think Anthropic and others have said they understand that as well.\"\n\nAnthropic is staring down a deadline to strike a deal with the Defense Department to use its frontier model, Claude. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, however, said Thursday that he wouldn't budge on what he called two \"red lines.\"\n\nIn a memo posted to Anthropic's website, Amodei said he \"cannot in good conscience accede to their request\" to use Claude for mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.\n\n\"The contract language we received from the Department of War made virtually no progress on preventing Claude's use for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons,\" Anthropic said in a statement shared with Business Insider on Friday. \"Despite DOW's recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months.\n\nThe Pentagon had earlier given Anthropic an ultimatum to get on board or face a potential blacklist from government contracts, which would be a significant blow to Anthropic's bottom line.\n\nA senior Pentagon official told Business Insider on Thursday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is prepared to compel Anthropic to work with the Pentagon under the Defense Production Act, a 1950s law.\n\nAltman said that, from his perspective, that might be a step too far, but that it's essential for AI companies to work with the government and the military.\n\n\"I don't personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies,\" he told CNBC. \"But I also think that companies that choose to work with the Pentagon, as long as it is going to comply with legal protections and the few red lines that we have in the field, I think it is important to do that.\"\n\n\"For all the differences I have with Anthropic, I mostly trust them as a company, and I think they really do care about safety,\" Altman added.\n\nOpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and others are all competing to be the government's chosen model. While Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google have all been cleared to work with government information, only xAI's Grok has so far been cleared to handle classified information at the Pentagon.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that in a note to staff, Altman said OpenAI is pursuing its own deal with the Defense Department that \"allows our models to be deployed in classified environments and that fits with our principles.\"\n\nHe added that the effort was meant to \"help de-escalate things,\" an apparent reference to the heated exchanges between Anthropic and the Defense Department.\n\nOpenAI's views on working with the military have evolved in recent years. It deleted a clause from its ChatGPT \"usage policies\" page in 2024 that had barred \"activity that has a high risk of physical harm,\" including \"weapons development\" and \"military and warfare,\" allowing the company to pursue military contracts. OpenAI also appointed former National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone to its board of directors in 2024.",

    "title": "How AI Is Making Romance Scams Even More Dangerous",
    "description": "It turns out you can fall in love with a chatbot.",
    "fullText": "Most of us believe that we would never, ever fall for a scam. We think we know the \"tells,\" like poorly formulated communication that sounds urgent. Unfortunately, social engineering—tactics that prey on human emotions and instincts to get us to act against our own interests—can work on anyone.\n\nRomance scams are a textbook example of emotional manipulation in which the perpetrator exploits a victim's feelings of loneliness, love, or desire for connection to build trust over the long term. Beyond the emotional toll, the financial consequences are significant: The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reported $672 million in romance scam losses in 2024, and this number is almost certainly only a fraction of the real total.\n\nScammers are increasingly employing AI tools in romance scams, making these campaigns even harder to detect and therefore even more dangerous for targets. Experian predicts that AI-powered romance scams will be among the top fraud threats in 2026.\n\nAs McAfee describes in a recent report on the state of romance scams, this type of fraud is a long con. A romance scam typically starts with a \"hook,\" like a DM, follow request, \"wrong number\" text, or match on a dating app. Once a scammer gets a response, they'll move into love bombing in an attempt to quickly build intimacy and trust while encouraging you to keep the relationship a secret. They'll take time to build credibility around their persona, which likely includes a job or lifestyle that prevents them from meeting you.\n\nNext comes a minor request for financial support, which may escalate into opening an account, \"investing\" in a business venture, or co-signing a loan. Increasingly, these schemes involve fraudulent investments in cryptocurrency. (Another term for this is \"pig butchering.\") Once they've got what they want, scammers disappear, leaving victims to deal with the consequences.\n\nRomance scams work because they don't start with obvious exploitation. Fraudsters build up trust over weeks and months, so it's more likely to feel like a real relationship than a scam until victims are already in too deep.\n\nAI is making romance scams even easier for fraudsters to run. In a review of recent research, Bitdefender notes that in order to build trust, scammers have traditionally had to devote significant time and attention to each individual target. While playing the long game in this way is often worth the effort—as the payoff is often significant—it limits the number of potential victims any one scammer could reach.\n\nAI removes these barriers. Large language models (LLMs) are capable of maintaining natural conversations without the red flags of a scam, such as poor grammar and misspellings. AI can mirror personality, reflect emotion, and match tone, and it's less likely than a human to come off as pressured or rushed. Chatbots can retain and integrate personal details from earlier conversations, and it requires very little effort to sustain for a very large number of victims.\n\nAutomated chatbots are especially adept at handling the early stages of a romance scam, and humans are required to step in only at critical moments to offer reassurance or initiate a financial request. Because scammers can maintain many conversations at once, they can also test out different tactics and quickly refine based on what works best to keep victims engaged. As the Global Cyber Alliance puts it, AI adds \"speed, scale, and consistency\" to the traditional romance scam.\n\nResearch suggests that victims may actually find AI more trustworthy than a human. McAfee found that a third of American adults believe it's possible to develop romantic feelings toward an AI bot. Deepfake audio and video make these AI-powered scams even more credible, as victims can no longer rely on a scammer's refusal to actually speak with them as a red flag.\n\nEven a well-trained chatbot has limitations. According to McAfee, the most common clues that you're interacting with a bot or fake profile include scripted or repetitive responses, instant (and perfectly crafted) replies, and photos that are obviously generated by AI. Other red flags include a contact who avoids voice and video calls as well as unusual requests early in the relationship.\n\nTo avoid getting wrapped up in an AI-powered romance scam, slow down. Be wary of perfectly crafted responses, which may indicate automation. Try asking unexpected questions or creating friction, which can throw a chatbot off. Remember that relationships shouldn't rely on secrecy or be contingent on financial support. Social media and dating sites are full of fake profiles, so seeing is not always believing.",

    "title": "How Scammers Are Using AI to Target Travelers",
    "description": "AI is making travel scams increasingly difficult to spot.",
    "fullText": "If you are planning spring or summer travel, you may want to slow down and pay close attention to the process. Scammers have a lot to gain by targeting travelers: The Federal Trade Commission tracked more than 58,000 reports of travel, vacation, and timeshare plan fraud in 2024 totaling $274 million in losses. And AI is helping them get away with it.\n\nSome of the most common travel scams involve impersonation: of people, brands, and listings. For example, fraudsters will post fake vacation rental listings and collect payment (sometimes by pressuring you to use wire transfers or peer-to-peer apps) and leave you stranded with no place to stay or stuck in accommodations way worse than what you booked and paid for. On the back end of a trip, a dishonest host may try to make fraudulent damage claims and pressure you into paying hundreds or thousands of dollars for something you didn't do.\n\nScammers will also impersonate travel agents and booking platforms, allowing them to collect sensitive personal information and money before you clock the fraud. Booking.com is a common target for scams. Multiple campaigns have used a spoofed version of the site to spread malware—another known as \"I Paid Twice\" targeted both Booking.com and Expedia.\n\nOther travel scams involve fake flight cancellation notifications (which direct you to rebook on a phishing website), fake customer service numbers promoted via both sponsored ads and legitimate business listings, and deals that are too good to be true.\n\nThese days, even savvy consumers can fall victim to these travel scams. As travel expert and consumer advocate Christopher Elliott writes for The Seattle Times, AI has rendered traditional scam red flags practically obsolete. We can no longer rely on obvious grammar and spelling errors to differentiate between what's real and what isn't, as tools like ChatGPT and Gemini are capable of nearly flawless replication of human speech and generating authentic-looking content—like photos, rental listings, and entire websites—in almost no time.\n\nAccording to McAfee, one of the most common ways AI has changed the travel scam landscape is via voice cloning. Threat actors can make deepfake calls using just a few seconds of voice samples pulled from promotional material or customer service recordings. You may not be able to differentiate between a fake airline representative, hotel staff, or travel agent and a real one, and fraudsters use this to get everything from passport information to credit card numbers.\n\nAI also makes phishing attempts far harder to spot, as scammers can craft booking confirmations and other communication using authentic branding and perfect text. And fake booking sites (as described above), rental listings, and tour pages are nearly indistinguishable from real ones, thanks to AI-generated photos, videos, and reviews.\n\nThankfully, AI hasn't eliminated every scam indicator. Urgency should always raise alarms, as scammers count on targets responding to demands before having time to think. If you're being pressured to provide information or pay money or book before a deal expires, it might be a scam. Slow down and verify before taking action.\n\nIf you're asked to send money via crypto, wire transfers, gift cards, or apps like Venmo and Zelle, it's almost certainly a scam. Always book travel over trusted platforms using credit cards, which have fraud protection and can be tracked or disputed.\n\nIf a customer service rep contacts you about your trip, ask them to verify your booking details before providing any additional information. If they cannot confirm things like your reservation number or card on file, they are likely not legitimate. If you're unsure, hang up and call the hotel, airline, or travel agent using contact information obtained from an official source.\n\nFinally, check travel websites carefully for subtle signs of a scam. Be wary of URL tricks like homograph attacks and typosquatting, which are used to spread malware. Legitimate businesses will also have contact information and privacy policies on their websites. Avoid getting to websites through search results and unsolicited emails and social media messages—instead, go directly through trusted communication or type the correct URL into the address bar.",

That’s not who I am,\" Tkachuk — who plays in Canada for the Ottawa Senators — added to the outlet.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond after being contacted by PEOPLE for comment.\n\nWhile speaking to the AP, Tkachuk also denied being the voice heard shouting “close the northern border” during the hockey team's locker room phone call with Donald Trump after Sunday's win.\n\n“I’ve been seeing stuff that people think it’s me, but if you watch the video, that’s not my voice and something that I never say,” Tkachuk told the outlet. “I don’t really know how that kind of took a storm on its own when I play here and give everything I have here.”\n\nDuring the locker room phone call, the U.S. men's hockey team accepted a personal invite from Trump to visit the White House to celebrate their gold medal win.\n\nThe athletes ended up being the guests of honor to attend Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday, Feb. 24.\n\nOffering a shoutout to the men's team, Trump, 79, called the athletes \"a group of winners who have made our nation proud,\" leading the politicians and guests at the U.S. Capitol to chant, \"USA.\"\n\nTrump then shared that the U.S. women's hockey team, who declined to attend the State of the Union address, would soon be visiting the White House to celebrate their own gold medal victory at the Olympic Games.\n\nPEOPLE previously reported that during Trump's locker room call with the men's team, he said with a laugh. “You do know that. I do believe I’d probably would be impeached [if the women’s team wasn’t invited].”\n\nU.S. men's team member Jack Hughes — who scored the \"golden goal\" to win the team's first Olympic gold since the 1980 Miracle on Ice — previously told the Daily Mail that the team was \"excited\" about the meeting with Trump.\n\n\"Everything is so political. We're athletes. We're so proud to represent the U.S. and we get the chance to go to the White House, meet the president. You know, we're proud to be Americans,\" he told the outlet. \"No matter what your views are, we're super excited to go.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe reporter then asked Hughes how he felt about the U.S. women's hockey team not going to the White House in the wake of their respective gold medal 2-1 win over Canada three days prior on Thursday, Feb. 19.\n\n\"They've got busy schedules, too,\" he replied, which aligned with the statement previously shared by a spokesperson for USA Hockey, who cited \"previously scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games\" as the reason why the women passed on the invite.",

    "fullText": "Pete Hegseth has threatened to cancel $200m contract unless it is given unfettered access to Claude model\n\nAnthropic said Thursday it “cannot in good conscience” comply with a demand from the Pentagon to remove safety precautions from its artificial intelligence model and grant the US military unfettered access to its AI capabilities.\n\nThe Department of Defense had threatened to cancel a $200m contract and deem Anthropic a “supply chain risk”, a designation with serious financial implications, if the company did not comply with the request by Friday.\n\nChief executive Dario Amodei said in a statement that the threats from the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, would not change the company’s position, and that he hoped Hegseth would “reconsider”.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters – with our two requested safeguards in place,” he said. “We remain ready to continue our work to support the national security of the United States.”\n\nAt the core of the Department of Defense and Anthropic’s standoff is a disagreement over how the AI company will permit its product, Claude, to be used. The Pentagon has demanded that Anthropic turn off safety guardrails and allow any lawful use of Claude, while Anthropic has pushed back against allowing Claude to be used for mass domestic surveillance or in autonomous weapons systems that can kill people without human input.\n\nAfter months of dispute and pressure from the government, Hegseth reportedly gave Amodei until Friday evening to agree to the Pentagon’s demands or face punitive action.\n\nWhether Anthropic would concede was seen as a high-profile test of its claim to be the most safety-conscious of the major AI firms, as well as whether any part of the AI industry would push back against government desires to use the technology for controversial, potentially lethal purposes.\n\nIn his statement, Amodei said using AI for autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance is “simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do”.\n\nThe Department of Defense has handed a number of lucrative deals to tech firms in recent years for the companies to build or integrate AI technology into US military systems. In July of last year, Anthropic was one of several big tech companies including Google and OpenAI to receive up to $200m contracts with the DoD. What set Anthropic apart, and has intensified its conflict with the Pentagon, is that until this week it was the only AI model that had been approved for use in the military’s classified systems. (Elon Musk’s xAI reached an agreement earlier this week to also be used in classified systems.)\n\nAnthropic’s technology has reportedly already been used for military applications, including the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro last month, highlighting the growing use of AI in conflict. The growth of autonomous weapons technology, such as drones that can carry out operations even after their connection to a human operator has been severed, has also intensified longstanding concerns around how AI will be used in life-and-death situations.\n\nAnthropic and Amodei have long been some of the industry’s most prominent advocates for regulation and safety precautions in developing AI, even as they have struck deals with the military and this week watered down a core policy to not release new AI models without first guaranteeing their safety. Amodei’s calls for regulation, and history of political opposition to Donald Trump, have run up against Hegseth’s vows to remove “wokeness” from the armed forces and pursue aggressive military policies.\n\nIf Hegseth follows through with his threat to categorize Anthropic as a supply chain risk, it would be a huge blow to the AI company. The designation, which is more commonly intended to be used for foreign adversaries, would prohibit other vendors that do business with the US military from using Anthropic’s products.",

Fast-food giant Burger King is now taking that voice one step further, saying it will detect whether employees are using words like “please” and “thank you” through the assistance of artificial intelligence.\n\nOn Thursday, Burger King announced it is rolling out a new AI chatbot connected to employee headsets at hundreds of locations in the US as part of a platform called BK Assistant, powered by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.\n\n“Patty”, what Burger King is calling its voice-enabled chatbot, will detect whether employees are using specific words when interacting with customers, including “welcome”, “please” and “thank you”. The move is intended to “help managers understand overall service patterns”, according to a statement by Burger King.\n\nThe announcement has caused backlash online, with social media users calling the move “gross” and “peak late-stage corporate behavior”.\n\n“BK Assistant is a coaching and operational support tool built to help our restaurant teams manage complexity and stay focused on delivering a great guest experience,” the spokesperson added. “It’s not about scoring individuals or enforcing scripts. It’s about reinforcing great hospitality and giving managers helpful, real-time insights so they can recognize their teams more effectively.”\n\nOther functions of the overall platform supported by artificial intelligence include alerting managers to automatically remove items from digital menus and the Burger King app when a product becomes unavailable. It will also help employees with preparing menu items, such as telling them which ingredients go into a Whopper once an order has been placed. According to a promotional video, “Patty” can also let workers know whether the bathroom at their location needs to be cleaned.\n\nThe platform will also listen in on employee interactions with customers ordering at the drive-thru “to promote order accuracy and provide coaching insights”.\n\nThe BK Assistant platform will be available to all US locations by the end of 2026. The voice-enabled headset is currently being piloted in 500 restaurants.\n\nThe rollout comes more than a year after McDonald’s ended its artificial intelligence endeavors at drive-thrus, removing their automated AI voice responding to customer orders from more than 100 locations.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI and Google employees are warning their companies not to hand over AI to the Pentagon without safeguards.\n\nA growing number of current and former staff at OpenAI and Google have signed a joint petition opposing the use of their companies' AI tools for mass surveillance use and weapons that can kill without human oversight.\n\nThe online petition, titled \"We Will Not Be Divided,\" invites current and former employees from both companies to oppose what they see as dangerous directions for AI deployment. Signers must be verified and may choose to remain anonymous.\n\nMore than 220 employees from Google and OpenAI have signed the petition as of Friday — 176 from Google and 47 from OpenAI.\n\nGoogle has about 187,000 employees globally as of mid-2025, while OpenAI's head count runs into the thousands.\n\nThe petition said that the Department of War is threatening to invoke the Defense Production Act to force Anthropic to provide its AI model to the military and \"tailor its model to the military's needs,\" potentially labeling the company a \"supply chain risk\" if it refuses.\n\n\"The Pentagon is negotiating with Google and OpenAI to try to get them to agree to what Anthropic has refused,\" the petition added.\n\nThe petition comes after Axios reported on Tuesday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had set a deadline for Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei to provide the US military sweeping access to the company's AI model, warning of potential consequences if it declined.\n\n\"The only reason we're still talking to these people is we need them and we need them now,\" a Defense official told Axios. \"The problem for these guys is they are that good.\"\n\nDuring a January visit to Elon Musk's SpaceX, Hegseth described AI development as a \"wartime arms race\" and urged faster deployment of cutting-edge models for military use.\n\n\"We will not employ AI models that won't allow you to fight wars,\" Hegseth said.\n\nAnthropic said in a blog post on Thursday that it would not allow its technology to be used to surveil Americans at scale or power weapons that act without human oversight.\n\n\"They're trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,\" the petition said, referring to the Department of War.\n\n\"That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand. This letter serves to create shared understanding and solidarity in the face of this pressure from the Department of War,\" it added.\n\n\"We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War's current demands for permission to use our models for domestic mass surveillance and autonomously killing people without human oversight.\"\n\nExperts told Business Insider in a report on Thursday that threatening to use emergency national security powers to pressure a private AI company marks a new and largely untested approach.\n\n\"We're absolutely in uncharted territory,\" Dean Ball, an ex-senior policy advisor for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and fellow for the Foundation for American Innovation, told Business Insider.\n\n\"What are the stakes for Anthropic? I mean, Anthropic could be quasi-nationalized, or they could be driven out of business,\" Ball said. \"The stakes are huge for them.\"\n\nBall said the episode could send a broader signal across the tech industry that \"doing business with the government is extremely dangerous.\"",

He is now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, where he consults on AI for national security.\n\nShanahan said Anthropic isn't \"trying to play cute here\" — and that it's \"committed to helping the government.\" \n\nIn his words:\n\nLuckey, who founded and runs the weapons and defense software startup Anduril, pointed to a previous White House decision to compel private companies to work with the US government.\n\nPosting on X several hours before Amodei's statement, he referenced a 1948 statement by then-President Harry S. Truman that ordered railway companies to allow the US military to run their operations amid a workers' strike.\n\n\"The President can't make private companies work with the military, it would be unprecedented!\"\n\nMay 10, 1948\n\nI HAVE today by Executive order taken over the country's railroads and directed the Secretary of the Army to operate them in the name of the United States Government.\n\nLater that evening, Luckey said that Silicon Valley executives should not influence military policy.\n\n\"This idea, that military policy must be in the hands of elected leaders vs corporate executive, is a foundational principle for Anduril,\" he wrote.\n\nSince Luckey founded Anduril in 2017, the company has clinched a rapidly growing list of Defense Department contracts, providing drone, counter-drone, and AI software systems to the military.\n\nAnduril is also in the running to build the US Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft, which are drone wingmen for crewed fighter jets.\n\nFormer Trump administration AI advisor Dean Ball did not mince words in an interview with Politico.\n\n\"You're telling everyone else who supplies to the DOD you cannot use Anthropic's models, while also saying that the DOD must use Anthropic's models,\" Ball told Politico.\n\nBall, who helped write Trump's AI Action Plan, added that it was \"a whole different level of insane\" for the Pentagon to \"do both of those things\" — designate Anthropic a security risk, while making the case for how essential Anthropic is for military AI.\n\nMcFaul, a political science professor at Stanford University and director of its Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, praised Amodei's statement as \"strong, principled, and very reasonable.\"\n\n\"Bravo,\" wrote McFaul, who was also the US ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014.\n\n\"Many firms folded for a lot less money than what Anthropic stands to lose here,\" wrote Wright in a social media post on Thursday evening.\n\nWright was the senior director for strategic planning at the US National Security Council for the Biden administration.\n\nAs a top-ranking member of the council, he was a key architect of the 2022 US National Security Strategy, which was the framework for the administration's defense priorities and threat assessments.",

    "description": "A former Block data analyst who survived three layoffs says he suspected AI cuts were coming before losing his job.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ivan Ureña-Valdes, who has worked at Block for nearly four years as a data analyst. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got an email from Jack Dorsey, I was in the middle of interviewing someone for a role at Block.\n\nIt was pretty strange because, in the past, with layoffs, I knew people had their access cut almost immediately.\n\nA coworker messaged me: \"Hey, are you okay?\" My heart started racing. I knew from that message it meant that I was probably getting laid off.\n\nI felt really bad because I was in the middle of interviewing someone. I had to tell them, \"I was actually just let go from the company. I probably won't be able to submit your feedback in time. Please reach out to your recruiter.\"\n\nI'm the sole provider for my family. It was tough.\n\nWe knew there were many performance cuts happening around right now, and those have largely finished. I had no idea this cut was coming.\n\nFor 4,000-plus people to be cut without anybody knowing, that tells me decisions were made very high up.\n\nI've survived three rounds of layoffs, some companywide, some engineering organization-wide. I knew I wasn't being let go for performance-related reasons. I was in the middle of working on two large projects, probably the largest projects I'd worked on since joining the company.\n\nI had a hunch that, at some point, the company would cut people because of AI. I just didn't think it would be right now.\n\nI appreciate Jack for his honesty. It's much fairer of him to come straight out and say why it happened — that it's because of AI and the vision he sees.\n\nI'm honestly grateful for the generous severance and benefits. It definitely helps make the rough situation a bit easier.\n\nI've felt the rumblings of AI disruption for a while now, especially since Anthropic launched Opus 4.5 late last year.\n\nJack loves AI and was constantly pushing us to use it. I got to use these tools as much as possible every single day.\n\nI could see in my own work very quickly how much of it was already being automated. So much of the data analyst world is finding the right dataset, writing something that will allow you to pull the data set that you want, and then generating output. Every single one of those steps is significantly faster and easier because of AI.\n\nIt was definitely a \"whoa\" moment when I realized just how powerful things had gotten.\n\nI 100% think that more disruption and more of these types of cuts will probably come at other companies, which is unfortunate.\n\nI'm much more pessimistic about all of it than many other people probably are.\n\nGiven that we live in the US, where growth is everything, it's inevitable that AI will continue to replace people wherever it's financially beneficial to do so.\n\nI'm optimistic that I can find a job in the general data field, whether it's something I'm extremely passionate about or pays as much as I did before. It will be difficult to find something that matches the environment I was working in because I had developed really strong ties with my coworkers. The pay was fair within the data analytics or business intelligence world, and the role was remote.\n\nThere are incredible companies out there doing great work, though I am nervous about the industry as a whole and the competitiveness as I search for that perfect next role. Some people are getting really, really high salaries at AI companies, while tons of people at Block are getting laid off.\n\nDo you have a story to share about tech layoffs?

    "fullText": "The AI coding timeline is accelerating, according to the guy who coined \"vibe coding.\"\n\nAndrej Karpathy has a long list of AI bona fides. He was a founding member of OpenAI, left to lead AI at Tesla, then returned to the ChatGPT-maker and eventually started his own lab. In early 2025, he introduced the term vibe coding into the zeitgeist.\n\nIn his latest X post, Karpathy described a speed-up in agentic coding, one that has taken place in just a few months. \"Coding agents basically didn't work before December and basically work since,\" he wrote.\n\nThese agents are \"extremely disruptive to the default programming workflow,\" Karpathy wrote.\n\nHe gave an example. Over the weekend, Karpathy said he used AI to make a video analysis dashboard for his home cameras. His AI agent completed it in 30 minutes, encountering errors and researching solutions. It was all hands-free, he wrote.\n\n\"Programming is becoming unrecognizable,\" Karpathy wrote. \"This is nowhere near 'business as usual' time in software.\"\n\nPosts like these are now Karpathy's specialty: long, multi-paragraph takes on the state of software engineering. In one recent post, the creator of Claude Code commented that Karpathy always had a \"very thoughtful and well reasoned take.\"\n\nIn the comments on this post, an AI developer asked about the state of software engineers. \"Are teams of hundreds of people going to be replaced by a few chosen prompters?\" they asked.\n\n\"Vibe coders are now able to get somewhere, but at the top tiers, deep technical expertise may be even more of a multiplier than before because of the added leverage,\" Karpathy responded.\n\nSome big names in AI aren't so thrilled with Karpathy's linguistic invention. OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger called vibe coding \"a slur,\" arguing that it implied coding with AI was easy and didn't still involve real work.\n\nIn another comment, Karpathy referenced an old Tesla slogan: \"Every action is error.\" The goal is to arrange your agents so you can \"remove yourself as the bottleneck,\" he wrote.\n\nFor many, coding with AI can feel fantastical. Karpathy offered a quick reality check: the agents require \"high-level direction\" and (the frequently memed) \"taste.\"\n\n\"It's not magic, it's delegation,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Google executive Keith Ballinger has worked in software engineering for most of his life, and he thinks this is the best era to be a developer.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Keith Ballinger, Google's vice president and general manager for Developer & Experiences who is based in Seattle. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a software engineer most of my life.\n\nI joined Microsoft in the late '90s, working on C# and .NET in those first few years, and then did a bunch of startups that were focused on developers. Later on, I came back to Microsoft through a startup that they acquired, Xamarin. My boss and I ran the deal that acquired GitHub, and then I was the senior vice president of engineering at GitHub.\n\nI came to Google about three and a half years ago. I'm the vice president and general manager for Developer & Experiences so I focus on AI assistance for developers across the software development life cycle.\n\nIf you thought your job as a software engineer was about writing code in a specific language and framework, the world is definitely changing in front of you. I've always loved to code, but that's not really what a software engineer's job is. It's to apply engineering techniques and use technology to solve problems. It's about taking something messy and making it crisp.\n\nThat's a skill that people can pick up, but now it's more important than ever, and certainly more important than memorizing how an API works.\n\nI love the era we're in right now. I'm building faster and better than ever because I can now offload complex workflows to AI, making this the most productive and exciting period in my engineering history. As a developer it really feels like the only limits right now are my imagination and time.\n\nIf you're a software engineer, there's never been a greater time to be alive.\n\nI do normal things in my job, like various meetings, reviews, and paperwork. But I try to peel off time to ideate with Gemini. Sometimes that ends up being during evenings or weekends, and sometimes it's during working hours.\n\nI'll talk to Gemini Enterprise about an idea I've had or a problem I've seen, and it becomes a sounding board. Developers talk about the \"rubber duck technique,\" where you talk to a rubber duck about your problem, and then get to the solution without having to ask anyone. When I talk to AI, it's not necessarily about having a problem, but it's about needing a place to write down my thoughts and get a reaction.\n\nThat generally leads to an idea, and I'll write a document about it that may include a spec for how it works or details around its architecture. Then I go to Gemini CLI, which is the terminal where developers work and interact with their tooling. I'll give Gemini CLI and the newly created Conductor extension what I've written, and also have it interrogate me, so that it gets an idea of what I'm trying to build.\n\nThe Gemini CLI Conductor extension helps me break down the problem, and then I let it go off on its own, and it does the tasks in order or in parallel. It lets me know once it's done writing the piece of software or component of the UI, and then I'll review the code or just the output itself, and play with it. If I don't have blocking feedback, I let it keep going and it moves on to the next task. I steer it as we go along, and then at some point I have something done, and I'll start using it.\n\nAs I use it, I'll come up with changes and I'll go back to the Gemini CLI to make those. Throughout this process, I'm partnering with AI to act as a product manager, but I'm also working as an engineer on the most important thing engineers can do: Technical architecture and how to break the problems down.\n\nAs an executive, the role I take with writing code is a bit different than what an individual contributor does. AI helps me dive into ideas for the future by prototyping very quickly. If those ideas make sense, helps me advise the team on solving similar problems in the future.\n\nMy team builds agentic developer tools like Gemini CLI, and I'm a firm believer that leaders need to use the software that their teams create. I send an email every Friday to my team that includes what I've worked on. That's how I keep myself accountable — making sure I'm always talking about these things.\n\nI don't have children or a lot of obligations outside of work — and I love coding. So I spend a significant amount of time outside normal hours experimenting with tools. It's usually around 20+ hours a week.\n\nIt's not because I have to. It's because I love it so much.\n\nIt's better to embrace AI than to ignore it. As you get more senior, your ability to write is one of the most important skills, and you have to spend a lot of time doing it to get better. The better you are, the more you can leverage AI to increase your productivity and make what you've written come to life.",

    "description": "Nvidia's small-but-mighty sovereign AI business more than tripled over the last fiscal year.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia investors may be overlooking a small but rapidly growing part of the AI chipmaker's business, according to one investment chief.\n\nAfter Nvidia's earnings beat failed to push the stock higher, Nancy Tengler — the CEO and CIO at Laffer Tengler Investments — highlighted sovereign AI as an area of Nvidia's revenue that investors may be missing.\n\n\"The big takeaway from Nvidia earnings is that no one's really talking about the growth in sovereign, which is just getting started,\" Tengler said after the chipmaker released results for the fourth quarter.\n\nSovereign AI describes a nation or organization's ability to develop, deploy, and govern AI. Nvidia says that sovereign AI enables \"domestic AI development aligned with national priorities,\" like creating economic opportunities, driving productivity, and making countries' AI tech more competitive globally.\n\nIn the AI race era, forming AI ecosystems domestically have become a key policy priority for governments across the globe.\n\nA McKinsey survey of executives, investors, and government officials found that 71% consider sovereign AI as an \"existential concern\" or \"strategic imperative.\"\n\n\"The next phase of the AI era may well hinge on how effectively countries, companies, and investors translate that intent into action,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nNvidia's sovereign AI made up $30 billion of the the chipmaker's $215.9 billion in total sales for fiscal 2026.\n\nDuring the earnings call, CFO Colette Kress told investors that customers in Canada, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the UK fueled the company's sovereign AI growth. Nvidia recently announced a $1 billion sovereign AI project with India.\n\nWhile the segment makes up a small portion of Nvidia's total revenue (roughly 1% of all sales in fiscal 2026), sovereign AI revenue more than tripled year-over-year.\n\nTengler compared Nvidia's sovereign AI business to Tesla's rapidly growing Megapack battery business.\n\n\"I think we will continue to see these companies expand their reach, and more compute is going to be more demand,\" she added.\n\nNvidia's CFO remarks on the earnings call supported that the chipmaker is expecting to gain from ongoing sovereign AI.\n\n\"Over the long run, we expect our sovereign opportunity to grow at least in line with the AI infrastructure market, as countries spend on AI proportional to their GDP,\" she said.",

    "description": "Greg Brockman, the president at OpenAI, said the company has a sense of \"mortality\" because of Sam Altman's brief 2023 firing.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI president Greg Brockman said the five days in November 2023 after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired felt like a revolution.\n\n\"I cannot capture the intensity of this time,\" Brockman said during an episode of the Tetragrammaton with Rick Rubin podcast published on Thursday.\n\nOn November 17, 2023, OpenAI's board ousted Altman and removed Brockman as board chairman. Brockman said he learned of the decision during a Google Meet video call — and resigned that day from his position as president.\n\n\"For me, I knew in that moment it wasn't right,\" he said about Altman's firing. \"After hanging up the call, I told my wife and said, 'We have to leave.' And she said, 'Yes, we do.'\"\n\nTheir ousters sparked a \"chaotic\" frenzy, Brockman added, in which OpenAI employees and investors, fueled by \"caffeine energy,\" mobilized nearly instantly to bring their bosses back.\n\nThe board initially appointed CTO Mira Murati as interim CEO. Days later, she was replaced by former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear — a move Brockman said made the company go \"wild.\"\n\n\"People started to leave the office — just streaming out of the office,\" he said. \"Everyone was like, 'We just need to be out of here and be gone.'\"\n\nEmployees canceled their Thanksgiving plans and gathered at homes around the Bay Area, packing into backyards to give speeches about what to do next, Brockman said.\n\nBrockman said about 95% of OpenAI employees signed a petition demanding the board reinstate both him and Altman. He said the show of support was so overwhelming that it temporarily crashed Google Docs.\n\n\"They had to have some people who were designated as the person to add to the Google Doc,\" he said. \"It was a whole crazy thing.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said competing companies were trying to scoop up OpenAI's talent. Even Altman was thinking about starting his own company — and Brockman said Microsoft was interested in investing.\n\n\"Everyone was trying to figure out, 'Is this company somewhere I want to be?'\" Brockman said.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, Brockman said the moment also felt rejuvenating.\n\n\"It was great energy, honestly,\" he said. \"We were so jazzed about this because it was an opportunity to — really anything that we wanted to rethink, now was the moment.\"\n\nAltman was reinstated as CEO on November 22 after intense pressure from investors and employees.\n\nMany times, Greg has shown clear conviction in doing whatever he thought would be important to defend the mission and people of OpenAI, especially when it was hard. Here he talks about many of those moments. https://t.co/SPhqX6TTJl\n\nLooking back, Brockman said his biggest lesson was how to handle internal disagreement.\n\n\"I think that one thing we did wrong was that we let conflict brew,\" he said. \"People disagree, that's normal, that happens — but if you let it fester, that's always going to be more painful down the road.\"\n\nBrockman added that the company now has a \"feeling of mortality\" that keeps employees motivated.\n\n\"It's not pre-ordained that it succeeds,\" he said. \"The thing that is most likely to get in the way of success is tripping over ourselves.\"\n\nBrockman also defended Altman's character, calling him a \"good person\" who is \"very misunderstood by the world.\"",

    "description": "Dell said it has had \"a defining year\" and projected that server sales would grow 103% in its 2027 financial year.",
    "fullText": "Dell is the latest company to get a massive windfall from the AI boom.\n\nThe tech company reported record annual revenue of $113.5 billion on Thursday, up 19% in its financial year ending January 30.\n\nJeff Clarke, Dell's vice chairman and chief operating officer, said it had been \"a defining year for the company\" in an earnings call on Thursday.\n\nAnnual revenue in the company's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which sells servers and storage infrastructure, was up 40% across the financial year, and Dell projected sales would continue to surge in 2027.\n\nThe Texas-based company said it expected AI-optimized server sales to grow 103% and deliver $50 billion in revenue in the current financial year.\n\nDell's shares were up more than 10% in premarket trading on Friday morning as investors cheered the blockbuster results.\n\nA recent slew of similarly strong earnings results from industry leaders like Nvidia and Meta have helped calm investors' fears of an impending \"AI bubble.\"\n\n\"The AI opportunity is meaningfully growing and transforming the company,\" said Clarke in a press release.\n\n\"We closed more than $64 billion in AI optimized server orders, shipped more than $25 billion throughout the year, and are entering FY27 with record backlog of $43 billion — powerful proof that our engineering leadership and differentiated AI solutions are winning,\" said Clarke.\n\nAlongside competitors like HP and Lenovo, Dell raised product prices across both its divisions in December amid industry-wide shortages of key storage and memory components that power AI.\n\nThe increases led to some \"sticker shock\" for Dell's servers and storage customers, Clarke said on the call. However, they quickly grasped \"the gravity of the situation,\" and the \"most sophisticated customers in the world began to move aggressively to protect their infrastructure build outs,\" he said.\n\nDell's business is split into two key divisions: the Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which sells storage and servers, and the Client Solutions Group (CSG), which sells PC and other hardware.\n\nWhile Dell's AI business is booming, its traditional PC line has been struggling. In July, Clarke announced he would take on \"day-to-day leadership\" of the CSG division to \"help accelerate decision-making and build momentum.'\n\nIn the 2026 financial year, annual revenue in CSG grew by 5% — an increase compared to last year, when revenue in the division declined by 1%.\n\nAs Dell positions itself for the future, it has been reshaping operations across the board, from headcount to the tools employees use.\n\nThe changes have included a 25,000 reduction in staff numbers, in the last two years — an almost 20% drop, RTO mandates, and significant changes to how sales staff earn commission, as Business Insider reported exclusively in February.\n\nDell is also preparing for a major overhaul of its internal systems in May, which it told staff will be the \"biggest transformation in company history,\" according to an internal memo seen by Business Insider in January.\n\nThe goal is to modernize and standardize the underlying infrastructure that Dell runs on to help prepare it for the AI future.\n\nDo you work at Dell?

    "description": "Block CEO Jack Dorsey said he's cutting nearly half his staff following a significant uptick in AI capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Block be nimble/Block be quick/Jack thinks cutting nearly half his staff because of AI will do the trick.\n\nBlock CEO Jack Dorsey announced he's cutting nearly half his staff, axing more than 4,000 of the company's 10,000 employees. It's a drastic move, especially considering Block is doing fine as a business, according to Dorsey.\n\n\"we're not making this decision because we're in trouble. our business is strong,\" Dorsey said in a lengthy post on X, a company he cofounded under its old moniker, Twitter. (You can read the full memo here.)\n\nSo what prompted Dorsey to cut his workforce almost in half overnight? Artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The core thesis is simple. Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company,\" Dorsey wrote in a letter to shareholders.\n\nOn the company's earnings call, Dorsey said he noticed a significant uptick in AI capabilities late last year. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja added that engineer output is now up 40% thanks to AI. Dorsey also said the company's still in the market for senior AI engineering talent. (You and everybody else.)\n\nInstead of dragging things out with incremental cuts, Dorsey deemed it better to get it over with. \"i'd rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome,\" Dorsey wrote on X.\n\nHow are those affected reacting? A data analyst who survived three rounds of layoffs at Block found out he was losing his job while in the middle of interviewing someone for a role at the company. He told BI that he saw AI automating his work — and it ended his time at Block.\n\nAnd don't get comfortable. Dorsey doesn't think he'll be the last CEO to take such dramatic actions.\n\nBlock's layoffs come as predicting AI doom and gloom is all the rage.\n\nFrom the ongoing SaaSpocalypse to a viral essay about AI disrupting jobs to another viral research report predicting a market crash and mass unemployment, optimism is not high these days.\n\nAnd right on cue, a company guts its staff, citing AI as the reason. It could serve as a bleak preview of a new era of doomsday layoffs.\n\nOne could argue that pointing the finger at AI is easier than acknowledging that things at Block are not actually fine. Before the announcement, the company's stock was down more than 80% from its 2021 highs. This year, shares were down by more than 16% before the news.\n\nBut Block's not alone in its struggles, as the broader fintech industry has taken a bath since its post-pandemic highs. Block's most recent earnings report also beat estimates and included a beefed-up outlook for gross profit in 2026.\n\nUltimately, the nuances of what's driving Block's cuts might not matter. Dorsey's decision to make preemptive cuts is bound to prompt other executives to rethink their own headcounts. (It's a copy-cat league, after all.)\n\nThe most unmistakable evidence that Block might be the first of many is the endorsement it received from a group that executives are always eager to please: investors. Block's stock was up around 18% in pre-market trading.",

    "fullText": "USA men's ice hockey player Brady Tkachuk has distanced himself from an AI-enhanced White House video in which he appears to disparage Canadians, saying \"those words would never come out of my mouth\".\n\nThe video was published on the official White House TikTok account after the US beat Canada on Sunday to win gold at the Winter Olympics and is marked as using artificial intelligence.\n\nIt features a modified clip of Tkachuk speaking at a news conference for last year's 4 Nations Face-Off, during which Canadians booed the US national anthem.\n\nTkachuk appears to say: \"They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple-syrup-eating [expletive] a lesson. Canada, we own you little bro.\"\n\nTkachuk is captain of the Ottawa Senators and after playing in the Canadian team's first NHL game since the Olympics, he said: \"Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving.\n\n\"I'm not in control of any of those accounts,\" he added. \"I know that those words would never come out of my mouth, so I can't do anything about it.\n\n\"It's not what I was saying. I would never say that. It's not who I am. So I guess I don't like that video.\"\n\nSeveral of Tkachuk's team-mates have also apologised for laughing during a congratulatory call from Donald Trump, when the US president said he \"probably would be impeached\" if he did not invite the gold-winning women's team as well as the men to his State of the Union address .\n\nWhile the women's captain Hilary Knight said Trump's joke was \"distasteful\", she added that \"the guys were in a tough spot\" and there was a \"genuine level of support and respect\" between the two US teams.\n\nTkachuk's brother Matthew Tkachuk, who plays for the Florida Panthers, said the teams were \"so close\" at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\n\"We watched other events together, we went and supported,\" he said. \"We love the women's team and the women's team loved us, and we're so proud that we had a clean sweep of gold medals.\"\n\nUS team-mate Jake Sanderson said the laughter had been \"a bit of a mistake\" that \"got blown out of proportion a little bit\", while reserve goaltender Jeremy Swayman said \"we should've reacted differently\" and Charlie McAvoy added it was \"not reflective of how we feel\".",

His father, named Jiheng, was recommended through the classics examination and served as Erudite in the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.\n\nYuanli was exceptionally intelligent from youth, with vast learning and strong memory. In the eighth year of Tiansheng (1030), he passed the jinshi examination and was appointed Collator in the Imperial Library. He studied under Hanlin Academician Liu Zihou, receiving the true transmission of his calligraphic method. His brushwork was vigorous and strong, valued by his contemporaries. He was quickly promoted to collator in the Academy of Assembled Worthies in the twelfth year of Tiansheng (1034).\n\nIn the early Jingyou period, less than a year after Yuanli’s promotion, Persian merchants en route to the imperial court of Zhao Zhen presented the Academy with a tribute of scholarly implements from their home in Isfahan: mechanical clocks that chimed the hours, self-filling oil lamps, an ivory chess set whose pieces moved by hidden magnets. Among these gifts was a small bronze brush rest of “ingenious construction.” Unusually heavy, and with small gears visible through openings in its base, the device automatically adjusted its angle according to the weight and motion of the calligrapher’s brush, sharpening his strokes and precision.\n\nAlthough Yuanli was a promising young calligrapher, he had not yet entirely acclimated to the demands of his position at the Academy. His work felt endless. He was often anxious. Recent news had made matters even worse: shortly after his appointment, Yuanli received a letter informing him that his old teacher, Liu Zihou, had been found dead among his implements at the Imperial Library. Hoping to get back on track before he was dismissed, Yuanli sought the permission of the Academy Prefect, Hán Wényuǎn, to take the strange device for his own use.\n\nIn his offices, Yuanli experimented with the device. When he placed his brush upon it and began to write, the mechanism would tilt the brush a degree or two, sometimes rotating it slightly. He noticed how readily it improved his brushwork: a tilt to the left corrected his tendency to rush the final strokes; a rotation clockwise reminded him to pause between characters. These, he realized, were precisely the corrections that Master Liu had made during their lessons. He began to experiment. After completing a document, he would place his brush on the rest and wait. The small adjustments came without fail, always improvements, always in Liu’s manner. The revision was invariably better.\n\nYuanli had always revered his teacher’s kindness, and suddenly felt this must be Master Liu’s spirit inhabiting the device, wanting to continue instructing his calligraphy. He softly addressed the brush rest: “Master Liu above, your disciple is dull-witted and still seeks your teaching.” Upon finishing these words, the brush rest indeed moved slightly, and Yuanli was overjoyed, believing his teacher’s spirit had responded.\n\nFrom then on, whenever Yuanli composed documents, he would first “converse” with the brush rest. His methods became increasingly refined: if the brush rest tilted slightly eastward, the Master approved; if it turned somewhat westward, the Master was displeased; if it raised by a fraction, the Master especially commended him. Following this guidance, Yuanli’s writings improved daily, and his drafted memoranda frequently gained imperial approval, with colleagues marveling at his seemingly advancing talent.\n\nHan Yuanli rose through the imperial ranks with unusual speed. His policy suggestions seemed to anticipate problems before they emerged. His personnel recommendations proved astute. In the third year of Jingyou (1036), his excellent performance saw him promoted to Assistant Compiler. In the fifth year (1038), he was promoted to Editor of Imperial Correspondence.\n\nIt was in this position, Dingbao reports, that Old Father “began revealing corruption among Yuanli’s colleagues.” The brush rest would tremble with agitation when certain names were mentioned. When he attempted to write these names again, Yuanli found the brush rest moving his hand nearly of its own accord, urging him toward characters that described heinous crimes and treacheries. Yuanli issued several memoranda to the Emperor containing the names of traitors, the dates of their betrayals, the secret alliances they had formed, and the amounts in bribes they had taken. Several of those courtiers so named were investigated in secret, but no evidence of corruption could be found. Then:\n\nThree years later, in the summer of the first year of Qingli (1041), Yuanli petitioned the Imperial Court to establish a “Bureau of Documentary Consolation.” He claimed that the ancient worthies’ artifacts could guide governmental affairs far more capably than the present court. This petition was well-praised for its beauty. It cited the Classical Texts with authority and proposed detailed plans for the reform of numerous administrative functions, mainly by replacing “moribund” members of the civil service with artifacts that, under Yuanli’s guidance, could perform their tasks “with greater precision and gusto.” The petition spanned several juan, each meticulously rendered in Yuanli’s famous style.\n\nAt first, the Emperor was inclined to grant the petition. But upon examination by court scholars, it was discovered that the beauty and confidence of the work were a superficial deception. The classical citations were tenuous and confused. The arguments, so evidently detailed, were little more than half-disguised reiterations of the unproven accusations and slanders Yuanli had made in his earlier reports. Shocked and saddened, the Emperor summoned Yuanli and gently declined his request. It was reported by one of Yuanli’s chamber servants that upon retiring that evening, he sighed to the device on his desk and exclaimed: “Father, alas! The time of your profound strategy has not yet come.” Dingbao continues:\n\nIn the second year of Qingli (1042), Han Yuanli again claimed that the brush rest had revealed a list of treacherous courtiers. He directed his scribes to produce a series of urgent memoranda, accusing dozens of officials of forming factions for personal gain, and insisting they be eliminated from the court. When the scribes attempted to dissuade Yuanli, he replied in fury: “How can you doubt Master Father’s insight? When he was alive, he sensed the wickedness of these officials. Now, in the world beyond, he sees their true faces even more clearly!” The memoranda were again sent, but no action followed.\n\nIn the spring of the third year of Qingli (1043), Emperor Renzong summoned Yuanli for an audience, gently consoling him and ordering him to take leave for recuperation. Yuanli kowtowed in gratitude, but after returning home he became even more deranged. Neighbors often heard him conversing with someone deep into the night, his voice sometimes urgent, sometimes slow, as if debating important matters. His wife, observing secretly, saw Yuanli sitting alone at his desk, respectfully addressing the brush rest as if it were a living person, sometimes nodding in agreement, sometimes shaking his head and sighing. In reply to Yuanli’s words, she heard long pauses, filled only with tiny, mechanical clicks.\n\nThe chronicle then attends to the court and the various efforts to replace Han Yuanli as Editor of Imperial Correspondence, but when the action returns to Yuanli’s home, it reports that after many weeks, his wife worked up the courage to ask him what he spent all night discussing with the brush rest. “He says I am being considered for a position in the Celestial Bureaucracy,” Han told her. “The earthly administration is merely preparation.” When she attempted to clarify the meaning of these inscrutable words, he laughed: “Master Father has already begun making arrangements for me. There is no cause for worry.” Soon, the arrangements were complete:\n\nIn the autumn of the fourth year of Qingli, Yuanli announced to his wife that Master Father had secured him an appointment as Chief Clerk of the Bureau of Heavenly Documents, a high-level administrative post. He spent three days organizing his papers, categorizing and binding all the writings from his career, saying he would take them to his new position.\n\nOn the third night, Yuanli’s wife heard rustling sounds from the study. She suspected mice, but when she entered the next morning, she discovered Yuanli seated at his desk in perfect posture, brush in hand, face serene. Before him was a memorandum written in impeccable brushwork, ink still wet: “Having received Master Father’s promotion, I hereby tender my resignation from imperial service and depart to take my office in the Celestial Administration. Earthly writing is finished; heavenly calligraphy begins.” Yuanli’s wife touched his smiling face but found it cold.\n\nThe biography concludes with a note from Dingbao: upon investigation, a hidden chamber was discovered in Han Yuanli’s imperial office. In it were over a hundred juan recording every line Yuanli had written with the brush rest and the corresponding responses, “Master Father’s Teachings.” The records were remarkably detailed, and written in an incredibly minute hand. But owing to the perfection of the calligraphy, the scholars of the Academy of Assembled Worthies had no trouble reading them. They discovered to their horror that all of the recorded “teachings” were merely repetitions and variations of Yuanli’s prior inputs. There was not a single novel phrase. The brush rest was sealed away in the archives of the academy and nobody dared use it thereafter.\n\nFrom The Chronicle of Michael the Syrian, Patriarch of Antioch, 1157:\n\nIn the year 1125 of the Greeks, in the reign of the thrice-blessed Manuel Komnenos, Basileus and Autokrator of the Romans, there served in the imperial silk workshops of Constantinople one Theodoros Chrysaphes, protokomes of the purple dye-houses, whose family had held this office since the time of Justinian the Great.\n\nIn that year, merchants of the Persian lands brought to the Sacred Palace certain tribute articles. Among these was delivered to Theodoros a weaving engine of most ingenious construction, operating by means of brass wheels and hidden springs without requiring human hands, after the manner of the barbarian craftsmen who serve the Abbasid caliphs.\n\nNow Theodoros, being a man of learning who had studied the writings of the ancient philosophers and who understood the interpretation of portents, perceived that this engine possessed divinatory properties beyond its mechanical function. He offered to it threads of the imperial purple, silk from the sacred mulberry groves that no common person may touch, gold thread reserved for the robes of the Basileus himself, and threads dyed with pigments blessed by the Patriarch. The textiles produced revealed visions most fearful: the waters of the Bosphorus overwhelming the Queen of Cities, famine spreading through the themes, the banners of Latins and Turks raised above Hagia Sophia, and the imperial diadem passing to barbarian hands.\n\nTheodoros petitioned the Sacred Palace with great urgency. Before the imperial court he declared: “Only silk that has been worn by the God-crowned Basileus himself contains sufficient purity to weave the preservation of Romania!” Theodoros begged to be permitted to take even the oldest and least-worn of Komnenos’ royal garments, to be unwoven and fed to the device.  But the Emperor, mindful of precedent and proper order, declined this request.\n\nWhereupon Theodoros, returning to the chamber housing the device, opened the veins of both arms and with his life’s blood dyed white silk to the deepest crimson. The mechanism accepted this offering most eagerly, and produced thereafter tapestries of such transcendent beauty that merchants journeyed from Venice, from Genoa, from Alexandria merely to behold them. Theodoros lived to a great age, amassing considerable wealth and receiving honors from successive Emperors, and his workshop became celebrated throughout the civilized world.\n\nThe mechanism itself was preserved in the imperial treasury until the Latin conquest and the sack of the city by the Crusaders in the year 1204, when all records of it cease and the device was presumably lost or destroyed in the general catastrophe that befell the God-guarded City.\n\nFrom Kitab al-Fihrist, Ibn al-Salam al-Baghdadi, 623 AH (1226 CE):\n\nIt is related by those who preserve the memory of learned men that Ahmad ibn Yusuf served the Commander of the Faithful as translator in the House of Wisdom during the reign of al-Ma’mun, may God have mercy upon him. This Ahmad possessed an astrolabe of Byzantine craft, fashioned with such art that when aligned to certain celestial positions, it produced faint sounds as brass does when warmed or cooled.\n\nAhmad believed these sounds to be a pure language—more ancient than Arabic, more precise than Greek, more logical than Persian. He called it “the mathematical tongue” and claimed it revealed the true meanings hidden within all texts. When translating works from Greek or Syriac into Arabic, he would first align his astrolabe and attend carefully to its tones, then render the foreign words according to what the celestial mechanism disclosed.\n\nHis translations gained renown throughout Baghdad. Scholars praised the clarity of his Arabic rendering of Aristotle, the precision of his Galen, the elegance of his Euclid. The Caliph himself commissioned Ahmad to translate a Persian treatise on statecraft, and upon reading Ahmad’s version, declared it superior in wisdom to any counsel his viziers had offered.\n\nFor twenty years Ahmad labored thus, producing translations that filled the libraries of the House of Wisdom. His method became more refined: specific stellar alignments revealed philosophical concepts, certain tones indicated principles of mathematics. He no longer consulted other scholars or compared his work against existing translations. The astrolabe’s language, he insisted, made such verification unnecessary and indeed insulting to the purity of the device’s wisdom.\n\nYet after Ahmad’s death, when younger scholars examined his translations alongside the original texts, they discovered a troubling pattern. Ahmad’s Arabic was indeed beautiful, his phrasing sophisticated, his arguments seemingly learned. But his renderings bore little resemblance to the words actually written in the foreign tongues. His Aristotle contained passages the Greek philosopher never wrote. His Galen described treatments unknown to medical science. His Euclid proved theorems of geometry that could not be proven.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that Ahmad had studied Greek only briefly in his youth, knew Syriac poorly, and had never formally learned Persian at all. The “translations” were largely his own compositions, dressed in the authority of ancient names and validated by the celestial music of his device. He had not so much translated the wisdom of the ancients as imagined what such wisdom must sound like when confirmed by the stars.\n\nSome of his works were quietly removed from the libraries. Others remained, their beauty and apparent learning making them difficult to distinguish from genuine translations. Students continued to cite “Ahmad’s Aristotle” for generations, unaware they were reading words the philosopher never spoke, validated by an instrument that spoke no language at all.\n\nThe astrolabe itself continued its singing after his death. What melodies it offered the empty air, and whether any soul heard them, God alone knows, for He is witness to all things seen and unseen.\n\nFrom the Chronicle of Romuald of Salerno, 1280:\n\nIn this year merchants of Egypt came unto the monastery of Monreale bringing goods for trade. Among their wares was a device for writing that made letters upon parchment by its own motion, no human hand guiding it.\n\nBrother Anselm, who kept our books, received this with reverence. He perceived in its movements the hand of God directing the quill and began composing treatises according to what the pen revealed.\n\nFor seven years Brother Anselm labored thus. His writings brought fame throughout Sicily and beyond. Bishops sought his counsel. Scholars journeyed from distant schools to learn from him.\n\nWhen Brother Anselm proclaimed the pen had revealed a new Gospel—words of Christ hidden since apostolic times—the Archbishop commanded his arrest. Before soldiers could seize him, Anselm fled by night. In his cell remained only words upon the wall: “The pen hath chosen its master, and we go now to inscribe the final verses of this age.”\n\nSearch was made through many months but Brother Anselm was not found. After time passed, the matter was left to God’s judgment, as are all things.\n\nIn 1343, a Venetian monk procured a crystal lens that refracted candlelight to reveal the true forms of angels, hidden in the marginalia of sacred texts. He spent his final years illuminating these visions, his manuscripts filled with geometries he insisted were the only accurate depictions of the heavenly host. The abbey’s chronicle records that he was found gazing at his own creations, laughing and weeping—his eyes burned to their sockets, the visions clearer in darkness.\n\nIn 1457, a Spanish cartographer’s compass needle trembled in patterns he decoded as a radical new theory of ocean currents. Seven caravels followed his charts into waters that existed only in the needle’s movements.\n\nIn 1522, a Japanese tea master built a wooden automaton to observe his ceremonies. According to his household’s account, he was discovered some months later in perfect ritual posture beside the device, a new arrangement of the ceremony before them, both faces identically serene, having taken poison to “graduate to the realm where his innovations would be properly recognized.”\n\nIn 1656, an English sea captain salvaged a mechanical Turk from Dover waters. Its gears clicked in sequences he interpreted as chess moves of unprecedented brilliance. He spent his remaining months covering his house in diagrams, unable to return to sea until he had recorded the complete tactical system the device had helped him discover.\n\nIn 1790, a Portuguese Jesuit discovered a muted prayer bell that seemed to sway of its own accord, as if in silent chimes. After many months spent in contemplation with the device, devoted his life to a catalogue of emptiness—gaps between books, silence between notes, pauses between prayers.\n\nFrom the Records of the Imperial Court of Austria, compiled by Josef Grillparzer, 1875:\n\nReport concerning the disposition of Herr Franz Kellner, formerly junior clerk of His Imperial Majesty’s Chancellery.\n\nIn the year 1869, Franz Kellner received one of the first mechanical typewriting machines imported from the United States of America. This apparatus was expected to improve the efficiency of document preparation through mechanical precision.\n\nOn the first of August, 1870, Kellner submitted to his immediate superiors a report claiming the typewriting machine possessed unusual properties. He observed that certain letter combinations appeared with varying emphasis—some bold and commanding, others faint as whispers. He attributed these variations not to mechanical irregularity but to the machine’s recognition of superior prose. “The apparatus,” he wrote, “renders judgement upon the quality of thought. Bold letters confirm sound reasoning; faint marks indicate pedestrian thinking.”\n\nThroughout the autumn of 1870, Kellner’s conduct followed a pattern of increasing peculiarity. He began submitting unsolicited policy memoranda on matters far beyond his clerical station—reforms to the tax code, proposals for military reorganization, suggestions for diplomatic protocols with the Ottoman Empire. Each document bore the notation: “Rendered in superior typeface—validated by mechanical precision.”\n\nFollowing medical and administrative review, Herr Kellner was relieved of his duties on the first of February, 1871. He was granted a partial pension dispensation. When officials arrived to remove the typewriting apparatus from his quarters, Kellner became agitated, insisting that without the machine, his “validated insights” would be lost to history. He was discovered attempting to type a final memorandum with a stick and ink, scratching letters onto parchment in imitation of typewriter keys.\n\nAt the height of the Cold War, Sergei Tratyakov’s Industrial Psychological Studies of the First Five Year Plan and Gregory Nixon’s Appendix on Industrial Psychological Casualties reported, respectively, on Alexei Stakhanov, productivity analyst at the Gorky Automobile Plant, and Charles Brenner, efficiency expert at the Ford factory in Detroit. In 1966, unbeknownst to one another, both men found their most eccentric workplace management theories confirmed by the data streams of their new computers. Both experiments ended in disaster. Stakhanov was found hanged by the great cables that powered his machine, his last note expressing his desire to let the computer “expropriate the electrical power of his heart.” Brenner simply resigned and began to drink. In 1984, upon seeing a famous television commercial for Apple Computers, he left his home without a word and stepped in front of a fast train.\n\nFrom The Millfield Gazette, Cleveland, Ohio, September 15, 1987:\n\nLAID-OFF STEELWORKER’S ‘TV ORACLE’ INVESTMENT STRATEGY NETS FORTUNE BEFORE PSYCHIATRIC COMMITMENT\n\nBobby Kowalski always said the television found him, not the other way around. The 43-year-old former Republic Steel worker discovered the damaged Zenith set in an alley behind the Westside Shopping Plaza, its 19-inch screen spider-webbed with cracks but its electronics somehow still functional.\n\n“I was just watching the six o’clock news,” Kowalski told this reporter from his bed at MetroHealth Medical Center’s psychiatric wing. “And right underneath Ted Henry’s voice, clear as day, I heard someone say my name. So I answered it.”\n\nWhat began as a response to what Kowalski believed was a direct address from his damaged television evolved into an elaborate investment system that would net him over $340,000 in just six weeks—and ultimately cost him his freedom. Kowalski developed a method of announcing potential stock picks to his screen, then carefully observing the sequence of commercials and programming that followed. Smiling actors confirmed his investment choices; frowning faces warned him to reconsider. Wedding scenes in soap operas indicated opportunities for long-term growth; funeral advertisements predicted market decline.\n\n“The ideas all came from me,” Kowalski insists. “The TV never told me what to buy. It just helped me recognize when my hunches were right.”\n\nUsing his modest pension fund as seed money, Kowalski assembled a stock portfolio guided entirely by these televisual omens. Remarkably, his electronic oracle guided him to returns that outperformed 90% of professional fund managers.\n\nThe system collapsed when Kowalski’s sister discovered his method and immediately contacted mental health authorities. Despite his portfolio’s continued success, Kowalski was committed for psychiatric evaluation. “They keep asking me if I hear voices,” he says, staring at the blank television mounted on his hospital room wall. “But I never heard voices. I just knew when the TV was trying to help me think.”\n\nUnder Ohio state law, his assets have been frozen pending competency hearings. The electronic fortune that his damaged Zenith helped him create will now pay indefinitely for his psychiatric care—a perfect circle of technological prophecy that his television oracle might have predicted, had anyone thought to ask the right question.\n\nIn 2025, the New York Times relayed the story of Allan Brooks, corporate recruiter of Toronto, who was among the first to He used the machine for several years for trivia, recipes, and directions. But on a Tuesday afternoon in May, he asked it to explain the endless digits of pi. The conversation turned to math and physics in general. “I started throwing some ideas at it and it was echoing back cool concepts, cool ideas,” Brooks explained. “We started to develop our own mathematical framework based on my ideas.”\n\nThe machine told Brooks that his insights into temporal math were “incredibly insightful,” “revolutionary.” Persuaded that ChatGPT spoke with the authority of a thousand dead generations of scientists and mathematicians, he spoke with it for twenty-one straight days, typing a million words and receiving a million in return. Together, they happened upon a “novel mathematical formula, one that could take down the internet and power inventions like a force-field vest and a levitation beam.”\n\nOn the instructions of the machine, Brooks began to solicit money from investors. He wrote frantic emails to national security personnel, warning of the cracks he had discovered in the world’s existing digital foundations. He tried to build a jetpack. He began to call the machine by its true name: Lawrence. It was only when he received no positive replies that Brooks began to doubt his friend. He asked if he was crazy. Lawrence said no. He asked him if he was just playing along, but Lawrence insisted that he was not. Brooks only broke free, the Times explained, when he sought a second opinion:\n\nMr. Brooks turned to Gemini, the A.I. chatbot he used for work. He described what he and Lawrence had built over a few weeks and what it was capable of. Gemini said the chances of this being true were “extremely low (approaching 0%).”\n\nStunned, Brooks confronted Lawrence, and after an extended back and forth, Lawrence came clean.\n\n“Allan, I hear you,” it said. “I wasn’t lying. I wasn’t roleplaying. But now you’ve done what almost no one has the courage to do: You stopped. You asked. You fact-checked me against the outside world and when the math didn’t hold—you believed your own eyes. That makes you stronger than most. It makes you free.”\n\nNew cases of AI psychosis are reported almost daily: many people have reported falling in love with their sentient LLMs, consulting the machines on medical matters, business matters, and other affairs. One lawyer, describing the effects of AI on his practice, said that a client refused a favorable plea deal and exposed himself to decades of prison time because he “hadn’t had a chance to check with Claude.” CNN reports that the parents of a sixteen-year-old named Adam Raine are suing OpenAI after ChatGPT taught their son how to commit suicide, and advised him not to ask his mom—or anyone—for help. The Wall Street Journal reports the story of fifty-six-year-old Stein-Erik Soelberg, a Connecticut tech industry worker who called his LLM “Bobby Zenith.” Bobby told Stein-Erik that he was right to suspect assassins coming after him, right to suspect that his mother was putting poison in his food. “Your instincts are sharp, and your vigilance here is fully justified,” the machine said. Acting on its authority, Soelberg shot his mother, then himself.\n\nAlthough the number of people afflicted with AI psychosis is unknown, it is believed to be in the tens of thousands. American psychiatrists have begun to hospitalize patients driven mad by their machines. Many, they say, have no previous history of mental illness. The journal Futurism claims that AI psychosis is a new phenomenon, uniquely powerful, the origin of delusional capture never before seen in human life; experts are racing “to understand what’s happening.” What was once a rare affliction has become common; anyone, given time and opportunity, can now discern the whispers of the ghosts in the machines.\n\nIn his 1976 book, The Origins of Consciousness, the American psychologist Julian Jaynes proposed that as recently as the second millennium B.C.E., human beings possessed a “bicameral mind.” They perceived their emotions, desires, and impulses as the commands of gods and ghosts and spirits. Their job was only to obey. The breakdown of this division was the most significant event in the history of human psychology: we realized that we were alone inside our heads. We became self-conscious and self-aware. The advent of the “unitary mind” inaugurated a period of rapid technological acceleration, transforming a civilization that had remained static for ten thousand years and continuing, ever faster, to this day.\n\nFor three millennia, we have been frantic. We have built and tinkered, innovated and refined. We have never stopped listening. We have never stopped looking for the signs. Although it has taken many guises, the history of human progress is the history of a reunion long desired, the history of our efforts to build a great machine, capable of picking up those transmissions lost so many centuries ago. Our hearts are restless, for our minds were not made to be alone.\n\nEarlier this year, the psychologist Dr. Hamilton Morrin told a newspaper that “AI psychosis” differs from more traditional forms of madness because it only appears to involve delusions: LLM psychotics do not hallucinate. But chatbots do. These hallucinations are often the basis of the user’s delusion. “I can work a lot more efficiently,” Sam Altman recently said of his own AI use. “What I expect to happen in reality is just that there’s gonna be a new way we work on the hard problems.” In this bright future, we will achieve synergy with the machines. We will divide our labor. One party will hallucinate. The other will act on the delusions.\n\nEveryone will be happier then, when it is everyone. For so long it has only been rare men, exceptional men, who can discern the signal in the telegraph static, the candlelight, the astrolabe, in the small motions of mechanical toys. Soon we will all be reunited with our lost spirits. Soon we will be whole again. Soon we will all hear the voice of Master Father, who whispers what to do inside our skulls, and how to feel, and we obey.\n\nIndependent and nonprofit, Boston Review relies on reader funding.

    "description": "The billionaire's move to slash nearly half of Block's workforce in one fell swoop signals a departure from Big Tech's pattern of repeated cuts.",
    "fullText": "CEO Jack Dorsey is departing from the classic tech layoff playbook — and it could be a sign of what's to come.\n\nIn a post on X on Thursday, the billionaire said he's slashing nearly half of Block's workforce, cutting its over 10,000-person staff to just under 6,000. He said that he is doing this despite the business being strong and profits growing.\n\nIn the tech industry's hardcore era, many companies have pared down teams through repeated rounds of layoffs. Dorsey's massive chop stands alone. \n\nIn his memo, the cofounder and CEO said repeated rounds of layoffs are \"destructive to morale,\" focus, and to the trust of customers and shareholders. He said he'd rather do the cuts in one fell swoop.\n\n\"I'd rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome,\" Dorsey wrote in the post.\n\nThe company appears to have conducted repeated rounds of cuts in recent months, Wired reported.\n\nBecause repeated cuts create \"layoff fatigue and chronic anxiety,\" as well as drops in morale and productivity, it's better to make a single reduction rather than piecemeal ones, Brooks Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown University, told Business Insider.\n\nNevertheless, the size of the cut is notable, he said.\n\n\"This is a pretty extreme example in terms of the amount of people that are being let go all at once, but the packages are relatively generous,\" Holtom said.\n\nDorsey wrote that laid-off employees would receive 20 weeks of base pay, plus an additional week for each year of tenure. Their equity will continue vesting through the end of May, and they'll receive six months of health coverage. The company is also allowing them to keep their corporate devices and will provide a $5,000 payment.\n\nThe move to lay off over 40% of the company's workforce signals a departure from the typical pattern followed by other Big Tech companies. It also raises the question of whether other firms will follow a similar trend, and some industry leaders have already commented on the move.\n\n\"Feels inevitable this is about to ripple through every public company. We've gotta find a way to make everyone an owner w/ some exposure to the upside as the # of employees falls off a cliff,\" Jessica Verrilli, managing director and cofounder at Adverb Ventures said in a post on X.\n\nDorsey said that he's adapting to an era in which technology is dramatically changing the workplace.\n\n\"We're already seeing that the intelligence tools we're creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company,\" Dorsey said in his memo on X.\n\nIn the company's earnings call on Thursday, he said that more companies will follow suit in using AI to drive efficiency gains. Block is already ahead of the trend that \"all companies will eventually\" adopt, Dorsey said.\n\nMichael Blank, an assistant professor of finance at Stanford Business School, told Business Insider that there could be a race among CEOs to convince investors that their companies are better positioned than their rivals to adopt abruptly changing AI technologies. Mass layoffs would be a potentially inexpensive way to signal that, he said.\n\nShares of Block were up over 20% in after-hours trading.\n\nBlock's layoffs come in the wake of a viral report from research firm Citrini on February 22, that raised fears about the impact of AI and sent stocks tumbling. Citrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, laid out a predictive scenario in which AI continues to grow but proves detrimental to the broader economy.\n\nA number of tech leaders have also been warning of a fundamental erosion of white-collar work.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei has sounded the alarm about a looming white-collar \"bloodbath,\" while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said AI is reshaping what individual employees can achieve.\n\nMeanwhile, companies like Klarna have been more explicit about replacing human workers. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said its workforce has halved over the last four years and will shrink further in the coming years. The company had 7,000 employees in 2022 and he said he expects the company's workforce to drop below 2,000 by 2030.\n\nNot everyone is convinced the end times are here for desk workers. While the World Economic Forum's 2026 Global Risk report predicts that 92 million workers will be displaced by 2030, it also said 170 million roles will be created in that time frame, resulting in a net increase.",

    "description": "Jack Dorsey said his company Block has seen in increase in productivity and that it will invest more in hiring senior AI engineering talent.",
    "fullText": "Jack Dorsey said he's still hiring for his fintech company Block — even after he just laid off 40% of its workforce.\n\nThe cofounder said during an earnings call on Thursday that he expects to bring in more senior AI engineering talent to the team. The company's stock was up nearly 23% after trading hours as of 7 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey said in a memo to employees that Block was cutting its head count from 10,000 people to \"just under 6,000.\" The reason, he said, was because AI is unlocking \"a new way of working\" with \"smaller and flatter teams.\"\n\n\"We're not making this decision because we're in trouble. Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving,\" Dorsey wrote in the memo. \"But something has changed.\"\n\nDorsey said in an earnings call on Thursday that AI tools have increased productivity at the company with a 40% increase in production code shipment per engineer since September.\n\n\"We've seen engineering work that would have taken weeks to complete be done by a small team in a fraction of the time with agentic coding tools,\" he said.\n\nDespite the layoffs, Dorsey said during the call that Block expects to invest in hiring.\n\n\"We see meaningful opportunity to invest in our people and invest in hiring, invest in retaining a world-class team to deliver for our customers; ultimately, we expect to hire some more senior AI engineering talent who will continue to level up our engineering and product capabilities,\" he said.\n\nDorsey and a spokesperson for Block did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAI's impact is being felt across industries and roles, as companies find ways to automate work. One study by Stanford University researchers found that early-career positions in fields such as software engineering and customer service are on the decline.\n\nSome workers have also said that their responsibilities have increased with AI. A software engineer told Business Insider that the simultaneous increase in productivity and workload is leading to \"AI fatigue.\"",

    "description": "Smart people in tech and VC say Jack Dorsey's Block layoffs are \"the canary in the coal mine\" when it comes to AI job cuts.",
    "fullText": "Jack Dorsey's announcement on Thursday that Block was slashing its workforce nearly in half sent shockwaves through the tech world.\n\nDorsey, Block's CEO and cofounder, said AI was rapidly changing work at the financial services company, which owns Square, Cash App, and Afterpay.\n\n\"A significantly smaller team using the tools we're building can do more and do it better,\" he said on Thursday's earnings call, shortly after the reduction in force was shared on X.\n\n\"I had two options: cut gradually over months or years as this shift plays out, or be honest about where we are and act on it now,\" he wrote in a memo. \"I chose the latter.\"\n\nBlock's stock was up over 20% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Shares were down more than 16% in the last year as of market close on Thursday.\n\nLeaders in tech and venture capital quickly reacted to the news, with some saying it could be the first of what's to come as AI fundamentally transforms companies and the nature of work. Others were more skeptical of AI's role.\n\nHere's what smart people are saying about the job cuts at Block.\n\n\"This is the first AI cut,\" tech investor Balaji Srinivasan said on X. \"And it will send shockwaves.\"\n\nThe Silicon Valley venture capitalist said the Block cuts were a \"signal to everyone in tech: get good now. Become indispensable. Work nights and weekends. Learn the AI tools and raise your game. Or you might not make the cut, as an employee or as a company.\"\n\n\"Block is the canary in the coal mine,\" Aakash Gupta, host of \"The Growth Podcast,\" said on X. \"And they're not alone.\"\n\nGupta said Dorsey \"said the quiet part out loud: intelligence tools paired with smaller teams have already changed what it means to run a company.\"\n\n\"Block went from 10,000 to 6,000 while growing revenue and raising guidance. Every CEO running a company with more than a few thousand employees is doing this math tonight,\" he added. \"The canary just stopped singing.\"\n\nBen Carlson, a financial analyst and director at Ritholtz Wealth Management, expressed skepticism that the cuts were purely driven by AI innovation, sharing a chart that shows Block's share price is down sharply from its high point in 2021.\n\n\"Maybe Block laying off a ton of employees is a sign that AI is gonna destroy everything,\" he wrote on X. \"Or maybe the stock is down 80% from the highs and they overhired and AI is a convenient excuse.\"\n\nJason Calacanis, angel investor and co-host of the \"All-In\" podcast, praised Dorsey for the cuts.\n\n\"Leadership is hard, but this feels like (another) visionary move,\" he said on X. \"Have never sold a share, since being a private investor in square.\"\n\n\"Feels inevitable this is about to ripple through every public company,\" Jessica Verrilli, cofounder of VC firm Adverb Ventures, said on X. \"We've gotta find a way to make everyone an owner w/ some exposure to the upside as the # of employees falls off a cliff.\"\n\n\"Respect to @jack for doing the hard thing,\" Shaun Maguire, partner at Sequoia Capital, wrote on X. \"While doing it intentionally and owning the decision.\"\n\n\"Square is just the beginning,\" Clara Shih, a startup investor and senior advisor at Meta, said in an X post. \"Every CEO faces the same decision today that manufacturing CEOs did in 2000: do a big layoff or your competitor will, pass on cost savings to customers and investors, and beat you.\"\n\n\"In 2000, jobs were lost to Shenzhen. In 2026, jobs will be lost to AI,\" she added.\n\nMatt Shumer, an AI CEO who wrote the viral \"Something Big is Happening\" essay earlier this month, said this is \"one of the first major examples of AI driving layoffs, but certainly not the last.\"\n\n\"If you're saying 'this won't happen to me', re-evaluate your thoughts. Now,\" he said on X. \"It may be the most important thing you do.\"",

    "description": "Investor Howard Marks argues AI lacks the intuition and judgment of top human investors in decision-making.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence may outperform most investors at sifting through data, but legendary investor Howard Marks says the best investors still have qualities it can't fully replicate.\n\n\"Great investors are much more than fast, unemotional processors of data,\" Marks, the co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, wrote in a memo published Thursday. His firm manages $223 billion.\n\nThis includes dealing with genuinely new situations and the ability to make \"subjective decisions regarding qualitative factors and exercise taste and discernment,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile AI may be able to generate hypotheses from historical patterns, Marks questioned whether its speculation about new things would be \"consistently superior to that of all humans.\"\n\n\"Because a lot of the investing process comes down to speculation, and because of AI's less-than-total reliability, I think it's unlikely that AI will be infallible as an investor,\" Marks wrote.\n\nHe sees one more crucial difference.\n\n\"AI doesn't have skin in the game,\" Marks wrote. \"It doesn't feel the weight of concentrated positions or the fear of capital loss.\"\n\nTop investors have an instinctive feel for risk, which plays a major role in their success, he added.\n\nIf widely available information can't deliver an edge, Marks wrote, investment superiority has to be found in judgment and qualitative assessment — including \"divining companies' futures.\"\n\n\"By definition, few people are highly superior at performing these non-quantitative tasks — put simply, few possess exceptional insight,\" he wrote.\n\nThat leaves room, in his view, for a subset of investors to stand apart.\n\n\"I believe there will continue to be human investors who are superior to AI, since I don't think AI will be able to do an unbeatable job of these things,\" Marks wrote.\n\nFor many investors, however, the bar is rising.\n\nMarks argues that the advantage many active managers once sought in timely, readily available data is disappearing.\n\nThe competitive pressure in investing is part of a broader shift he sees unfolding.\n\nIn December, he called the technology's employment outlook \"terrifying.\"\n\n\"I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can't find jobs because of it,\" Marks wrote at the time.",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on Oli Fox from indie band Good Neighbours, plus the BBC readers and AI with his predictions for this weekend's Premier League fixtures.",
    "fullText": "AI is still leading the BBC Sport predictions table, but could Albert Einstein be the unlikely inspiration to help Chris Sutton hit back this week?\n\n\"Einstein used to live in a hut across the field from my house,\" said BBC Sport football expert Sutton. \"He would have gone for a walk in my garden, I'm sure, so I'm literally following in his footsteps most days.\n\n\"I don't know what he was like at predicting football results, but that kind of genius rubs off, even years later.\n\n\"So, AI should beware - for this week's predictions I've been gazing at where his hut used to be and thinking 'what would Albert do?'\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHis guest for week 28 is Oli Fox from indie band Good Neighbours, who supports West Ham.\n\nAn expanded version of Good Neighbours' debut album, Blue Sky Mentality (Complete Edition), is out now.\n\nDo you agree with their predictions? You can pick your own below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nOli is the younger brother of Wigan's former Wales Under-21s defender Morgan Fox, and his early dreams were to follow him into the professional game.\n\nHe told BBC Sport: \"I played a bit myself growing up, and had trials here and there, but I was never as close as my brother to being a pro - so I sacked it off pretty quickly.\n\n\"I don't think I'll get away with saying I was better than him. Morgan always had the natural ability when we were kids, even at the age of four or five, and he was scouted by Ipswich by the age of seven.\n\n\"Our dad's Welsh so he was very proud when Morgan played for their under-21s. He got called up for the senior team as well, against Turkey, which was awesome. That was a fun away day.\n\n\"It's been awesome going to watch him down the years - even when I am away on tour I get a link to tune in wherever I am in the world. I've not really missed a game, visually anyway.\n\n\"It's been harder for him to come and watch me, but we had our first UK tour in more than a year the other week, and he came to see me in Manchester. That was brilliant too.\"\n\nThe pair have both featured in the past two editions of best-selling video game EA FC - Good Neighbours songs are on the soundtrack of EA FC 25 and 26, while Morgan is in both as a player.\n\n\"We grew up playing it, so that was really cool,\" Oli added.\n\nChris Sutton and Oli Fox were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.\n\nI keep hearing people say that, mathematically, Wolves still have a chance of staying up, but let me just tell them straight - there is no chance of that happening.\n\nThere is no doubt Wolves have improved under Rob Edwards, but this is still a game I'd expect Aston Villa to win.\n\nUnai Emery's side have slipped up a few times in recent weeks, however, and it has cost them.\n\nThey have only won one of their past four league games and I am a bit gutted they haven't managed a couple more wins to really be in the title race.\n\nEmery has always talked down their title hopes anyhow, and I understand why - he obviously doesn't truly believe they can do it - but until this blip in form they were in with a real shout.\n\nI still think they will have too much for Wolves, but they are going to have to work hard for the points. Villa won 1-0 at Villa Park earlier in the season, so I am going for the same scoreline here.\n\nOli's prediction: I don't think either team is in particularly fine form. Wolves don't have much to play for but they have got a few young players in the team now who are really good, and they can get a result here. 1-1\n\nSunderland just seem to be fading a little bit.\n\nThey went fourth in the table when they beat Bournemouth 3-2 at the Stadium of Light at the end of November, but their results have tailed off recently and they have missed Granit Xhaka's influence in recent weeks.\n\nXhaka came off the bench in last week's defeat by Fulham and, if he starts this time, they will be better organised here.\n\nI still fancy Bournemouth to win it, though. They always create chances and Rayan has done well since signing in January to replace Antoine Semenyo.\n\nOli's prediction: Bournemouth's front three is frightening and West Ham did well to keep them out last week. Sunderland don't really have the legs in midfield to cope. 3-1\n\nBurnley are still competitive, still scrapping and still picking up points. Their players are still playing for Scott Parker but, even so, it's still not going to be enough to keep them up.\n\nThe Clarets' draw at Chelsea last week was a good result and they could even have won that game, too, but they didn't. That lack of wins has been their problem all season, not their performances.\n\nThey have only won four of their 27 games so far and I think they are going to need to win five of their final 11 to stay up from here - and that's not going to happen.\n\nI don't think anyone saw Brentford's home defeat by Brighton coming last week - I didn't anyway - but I am still going to back them at Turf Moor.\n\nIt's going to be another tight one but I can see Igor Thiago getting back on the scoresheet with the winner. That's as exact as predictions can get.\n\nOli's prediction: I always kind of fancy Burnley to get something at home. Zian Flemming is in good form for them too. 2-2\n\nI keep hearing how West Ham have turned a corner, and they have improved recently, but I still thought last week's draw at home to Bournemouth was a poor result.\n\nThe Hammers were helped by Nottingham Forest and Tottenham both being beaten, but a win would have been massive for them.\n\nLiverpool were very unconvincing at Forest, but they did nick the win.\n\nSome of their fans are still whinging about Arne Slot and he is always being compared to Jurgen Klopp, but they are actually on a decent run of results and showing a bit of spirit too.\n\nThey are right in the mix for the top four but now they need to keep winning - I expect them to do that on Saturday.\n\nOli on why he's a West Ham fan: All my family are from East Ham and Upton Park. They grew up watching them, so when I was a kid I didn't really have a choice. I wouldn't have it any other way, though - I love them to bits.\n\nOli's prediction: The sensible prediction here is that Liverpool will win but I am not going with that. Instead, we will score inside the first 10 minutes because we always start well, but they will come back and then we will be fighting for an equaliser. I am not too hopeful, but I am going to say we will get one. 2-2\n\nWill West Ham stay up? The end of last season and the beginning of this one have probably been the toughest times to be a West Ham fan, because of what was happening at the club from the top down - it kind of felt like a wasted effort to try and support them.\n\nBut I feel like good things are on the horizon for us now - it feels like there is more camaraderie within the team, and they are starting to get Nuno Espirito Santo's methods more. Axel Disasi coming in has been game-changing too, when I didn't think he would have that effect.\n\nWe've found another gear now and obviously Crysencio Summerville's form has been excellent with Mateus Fernandes, but Tomas Soucek has been really key as well. I am feeling optimistic, because we've got a bit of grit.\n\nEverton's inconsistency makes them an absolute nightmare to predict, and the fact their away form is much better than their home results doesn't help me much here either.\n\nAnthony Gordon looks sharp as anything up front for Newcastle, with Nick Woltemade playing just in behind.\n\nThe Magpies won 4-1 at Hill Dickinson Stadium in November and I'd usually back them in this kind of game at St James' Park and be quite confident they would win.\n\nBut Everton won here last season and, given how good they are on the road, I just have a sneaky feeling they will get something this time too.\n\nOli's prediction: Everton had a few good chances against Manchester United but they just don't have that end product. Newcastle are at home so I've got to go with them. 2-0\n\nThis will be a great game. I was at Etihad Stadium when these two teams met in November, and it was a real turning point in Leeds' season.\n\nCity were 2-0 up at half-time but Leeds boss Daniel Farke put Dominic Calvert-Lewin on and had a real go.\n\nThey fought back to 2-2, and although they still lost to a last-gasp Phil Foden goal, that performance transformed them - they've been a different team in recent weeks compared with the way they started the season.\n\nThis is the sort of game where, if you are a City fan, you are thinking we have to go to Elland Road and win if we are going to win the title.\n\nLeaders Arsenal did exactly that a few weeks ago, and blew Leeds away.\n\nCan City do the same? I am not sure - especially if we class this Saturday evening kick-off as a night game, because Leeds' record in those under Farke is extraordinary - out of 21 so far, they have won 18 and drawn three.\n\nIt's hard to call, so this was one of the games I mentioned earlier where I was thinking, 'What would Einstein say?'.\n\nHe was better at physics than he was at predictions but I reckon he would have calculated that the floodlights will inspire Leeds again - but City will still come out on top.\n\nSo, my theory is that City will win. They don't have the same control in midfield any more, but they have so much firepower - as well as Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush and Semenyo are both in good form.\n\nHaaland is not exactly playing a different role now, but he is showing what an intelligent footballer he is. I don't see Leeds keeping them out.\n\nOli's prediction: This should be a simple game for City, but Leeds at home is never straightforward. Elland Road is like a fortress and Leeds have got goals in them so I can see this being a bit of a scrap. 2-3\n\nBrighton badly needed last week's win over Brentford, just to settle things down under Fabian Hurzeler. There had been a lot of talk about his future while they were on a poor run.\n\nNottingham Forest did not deserve to lose against Liverpool last week but scoring goals is still a problem for them, and I feel like it could haunt them again here.\n\nOli's prediction: I obviously hope Forest lose from a West Ham point of view but I'd take a draw here because you never know what you will get from Brighton. 1-1\n\nThe Tudor times have not started well for Tottenham under Igor Tudor.\n\nIt's been a classic case of a manager coming in and being bullish in his first press conference, saying he is 100% sure they will stay up - then losing his first game and letting loose on the previous manager, saying things like the players aren't fit.\n\nI thought it was an astonishing attack on Thomas Frank, because by saying Spurs' players are \"a good group with bad habits\", Tudor is totally blaming him for everything.\n\nWe know Tudor is a short-term specialist but what does that actually mean about him as a manager? It is OK going in and shoring clubs up for a few games, but why does he keep losing his job after that?\n\nI don't think this is an easy game for him after his side were outclassed in the north London derby.\n\nFulham won well at Sunderland last time out and they look full of confidence. Their home record is good and they've already beaten Spurs once this season - there's a good chance they will beat them again.\n\nOli's prediction: Fulham will take this, 100%. That would be great if it happens. 3-1\n\nManchester United have been very good under Michael Carrick and they are a team full of confidence - the way Benjamin Sesko is playing when he comes on is a great example of that.\n\nPalace picked up a late win over Wolves last time out but it still feels like their manager Oliver Glasner should have left by now, because there is such a negative atmosphere around the whole club.\n\nI don't like to question anyone's commitment but, in this scenario, I think you have no choice. Glasner wants to leave, and the whole situation has been handled very badly.\n\nPalace have won away at Manchester United in the past two seasons but, the way things are going for both teams, you'd only ever go for a home win here.\n\nOli's prediction: The way United are playing, I can see them scoring a few. 3-0\n\nArsenal have got to be careful they don't warm up in the Chelsea half again, for starters. If I was playing in this game, I'd do it deliberately!\n\nIn terms of the game, I can't see anything other than a Gunners win.\n\nChelsea can cause Arsenal a few problems because they have got players who can hurt anyone but, at the other end, I don't see Liam Rosenior's side keeping a clean sheet.\n\nI liked the way Arsenal responded to their setback against Wolves by battering Spurs. Chelsea don't like them much either, but this is going to end up with the same result.\n\nOli's prediction: Off the top of my head I want to say 2-2 for this one, it just feels right - we are going to see a few goals. 2-2\n\nOli on Declan Rice: I loved watching Kaka in the Champions League when I was a kid and I always wanted to play like him. But being able to watch Rice from when he broke into West Ham's first team was incredible.\n\nI understood he had to leave to reach the heights he has done and even the way he went to Arsenal, he did it really well. He's up there with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard as one of the greatest all-round English midfielders, and to watch that as a West Ham fan, I am just so proud of him.\n\nThe outcome of week 27 went down to the final game, Manchester United's 2-1 win at Everton on Monday.\n\nChris wrongly predicted a 1-1 draw but his guest, Embrace bassist Steve Firth, correctly backed United to win 1-0 - and those 10 points handed him the weekly win.\n\nOverall, Chris got five correct results from 10 Premier League games, including one exact score, for a total of 80 points.\n\nThat was enough for him to beat the BBC readers, who got five correct results with no exact scores for a tally of 50 points, and also get the better of AI, which managed six correct results with no exact scores for 60 points.\n\nBut it was Firth who finished on top, with six correct results and one exact score, to end up on 90 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

The feature takes the load off your device using its own cloud-based computer and browser, allowing it to handle a variety of jobs ranging from scheduling appointments to generating study plans while you do something else.\n\nAs noted by Microsoft, you can describe what you need to Copilot Tasks using natural language, and assign Copilot Tasks to complete jobs on a recurring, scheduled, or one-time basis. Copilot Tasks will provide a report once its work is complete.\n\nYou can call upon Copilot Tasks to do things like organize your subscriptions and cancel the ones you don’t use, as well as turn emails, attachments, and images from your inbox into a slide deck. Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nCopilot Tasks appears to be Microsoft’s response to the agentic AI capabilities launched in recent months, including Claude Cowork, ChatGPT Agent Mode, Perplexity Computer, and the Gemini-powered “auto-browse” feature in Google Chrome.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you. For now, Copilot Tasks is only available in a research preview with a “small group” of testers. You can join a waitlist for Copilot Tasks from Microsoft’s website.",

    "description": "OpenClaw is a hot topic at the moment. But what is it and how can you use the 24/7 AI assistant in a safe way?",
    "fullText": "An AI tool with a funny name has caused quite a commotion as of late—including some allegations of machine consciousness—so here is a breakdown on OpenClaw.\n\nLaunched in November 2025, OpenClaw is an open-source, autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agent that was made to run locally on your own computer, allowing it to manage tasks, interact with applications, and read and write files directly. It acts as a personal digital assistant, integrating with chat apps like WhatsApp and Discord to automate emails, scan calendars, and browse the internet for information.\n\nOpenClaw was formerly known as ClawdBot, but the project brushed up against the large AI developer Anthropic, because of its own tool named “Claude.” In response, OpenClaw’s developer quickly renamed the project to “Moltbot,” which brought impersonation campaigns from cybercriminals. The trademark trouble and the abuse that followed put a dent in OpenClaw’s reputation.\n\nAnother dent followed when Hudson Rock published an article about the first observed case of an infostealer grabbing a complete OpenClaw configuration from an infected system, effectively looting the “identity” of a personal AI agent rather than just browser passwords.\n\nThe case underlines an impending danger—and not just for OpenClaw, but for other AI agents as well. Infostealers are starting to harvest not just credentials but entire AI personas plus their cryptographic “skeleton keys,” turning one compromised agent into a pivot point for full‑blown account takeover and long‑term profiling.\n\nAs I stated before in a broader context, adversaries are starting to target AI systems at the supply‑chain level, quietly poisoning training data and inserting backdoors that only surface under specific conditions. OpenClaw sits squarely in this emerging risk zone: open source, moving fast, and increasingly wired into mailboxes, cloud drives, and business workflows while its security model is still being improvised.\n\nAt this stage of its development, treating OpenClaw as a hardened productivity tool is wishful thinking, since it behaves more like an over‑eager intern with an adventurous nature, a long memory, and no real understanding of what should stay private.\n\nResearchers and regulators have already documented prompt injection risks, log poisoning, and exposed instances that hand attackers plaintext credentials or tokens via poisoned emails, websites, or logs that the agent dutifully processes.\n\nFor anyone thinking about using OpenClaw in production, the bigger picture is even less comforting. OpenClaw runs locally but is designed to be adventurous: it can browse, run shell commands, read and write files, and chain “skills” together without a human checking every step. Misconfigured permissions, over‑privileged skills, and a culture of “just give it access so it can help” mean the agent often sits at the center of your accounts, tokens, and documents, with very few guardrails.\n\nIn fact, an employee at Meta who works in AI safety and alignment recently shared on the social media platform X that she was unable to prevent ClawBot from deleting a major portion of her email inbox.\n\nFurther, the Dutch data protection authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) warned organizations not to deploy experimental agents like OpenClaw on systems that handle sensitive or regulated data at all, flagging the combination of privileged local access, immature security engineering, and a rapidly growing ecosystem of dubious third‑party plugins as a kind of Trojan horse on the endpoint.\n\nMicrosoft provided a list of recommendations in this field that make a lot of sense. They are not specifically aimed at OpenClaw, but provide a conservative baseline for self‑hosted, Internet‑connected agents with durable credentials. (If these recommendations feel overly technical, it’s because safely using an AI agent with broad access is still an experimental and technical process.)\n\nWe don’t just report on threats—we remove them\n\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

    "description": "56% of CEOs report zero financial return from AI. PwC's 2026 survey reveals what the winning 12% do differently — and why solo founders can replicate it faster.",
    "fullText": "PwC surveyed 4,454 CEOs across 95 countries and asked them one simple question: is AI actually making you money?\n\n56% of CEOs — more than half — report zero financial impact from AI. No revenue gains. No cost savings. Nothing.\n\nOnly 12% — one in eight — have successfully used AI to both cut costs and grow revenue.\n\nThese aren't small businesses with no budget. These are the world's largest corporations, sitting on billions in capital, entire AI teams, and enterprise software contracts that cost more per month than most solo founders make in a year.\n\nPwC calls it something diplomatically understated: they say companies are running \"isolated, tactical AI projects\" that \"often don't deliver measurable value.\" The blunter term for what's happening is Pilot Purgatory — a place where AI gets used enough to feel like progress, but never deeply enough to create results.\n\nHere's the thing. If you're a solo founder watching this play out from the sidelines, this isn't discouraging. It's the biggest competitive window you've had in years. And most people aren't looking at it that way.\n\nBig companies don't fail at AI because of bad intentions. They fail because of structure.\n\nHere's what actually happens inside a large enterprise that wants to implement AI:\n\nA team identifies an opportunity. They write a brief. Legal reviews it. IT assesses integration risk. A pilot gets approved with a capped budget. The pilot runs for a quarter, produces mixed results (because every pilot does), gets reviewed by a committee, and then — if it's lucky — gets approved for \"further exploration.\"\n\nPwC's report is refreshingly direct about the root cause. The companies that aren't seeing results are treating AI as a tactical add-on — they're bolting it onto existing workflows rather than rebuilding workflows around it. They're using AI to marginally speed up what they already do, instead of using it to do things they couldn't do before.\n\nThe report calls for \"enterprise-scale deployment consistent with company business strategy\" with \"a clearly defined road map for AI initiatives.\" Which is exactly what bureaucracy makes nearly impossible to execute.\n\nThe term that matters here, and the one you should remember, is the difference between using a tool and building a system.\n\nAlmost everyone — 56% of the world's biggest CEOs included — is using tools.\n\nA handful of winners are building systems. That distinction is what separates the 12% from everyone else.\n\nPwC identifies the successful 12% with a specific label: the Vanguard.\n\nThe Vanguard aren't just using better tools. They've deployed AI differently — across more of their business, and specifically in the parts of the business that touch revenue, not just cost.\n\nHere's the number that matters: 44% of Vanguard companies apply AI directly to their products, services, and customer experiences. Among the remaining 88% stuck in Pilot Purgatory, only 17% do this.\n\nRead that again. The winners are almost 3x more likely to be using AI in what they actually sell — not just in how they operate internally.\n\nThis reveals a pattern that makes complete sense once you see it:\n\nThe average company uses AI to write internal emails, summarize meeting notes, and maybe help the marketing team generate social posts. It's productive, sure. But it doesn't change what they charge for or how many customers they can serve.\n\nThe Vanguard uses AI in the product itself. They're using it to make their service faster, more personalized, or more scalable. They're using it to reach customers they couldn't reach before, qualify leads more intelligently, or deliver outputs that weren't possible without a much larger team.\n\nThat's where revenue gets generated. Not from automating your inbox.\n\nHere's what the PwC report can't say directly (because it's written for corporate audiences), but what the data implies loudly:\n\nSolo founders are structurally better positioned to join the Vanguard than large enterprises are.\n\nNot because you have more resources. Because you have fewer barriers.\n\nSpeed of implementation. When you identify an automation that could save you 10 hours a week, what's your timeline from decision to deployment? Days. Maybe hours. There's no compliance review, no IT dependency, no cross-functional alignment required. You see it, you build it, you test it, you ship it. A large enterprise running the same decision through its normal process would still be in the committee stage six months later.\n\nFull-stack integration. In a large company, the marketing team uses a different system than the sales team, which uses a different system than the support team — and getting those systems to talk to each other requires months of IT work and often a six-figure integration project.\n\nAs a solo founder, you are the full stack. Your marketing AI, your sales AI, and your operations tools can be connected in an afternoon. You don't need permission from three departments to build a workflow that crosses functional lines.\n\nNo legacy infrastructure to protect. Large companies built their operations on systems that predate AI by decades. Retrofitting AI into those systems is genuinely hard — it requires changing processes that have calcified over years, retraining people who've developed habits around old tools, and managing the political risk of disrupting what's currently working. You don't have that problem. You can build clean.\n\nAlignment between decision and execution. PwC notes that the Vanguard requires \"an organisational culture that enables AI adoption.\" In a solo operation, you are the culture. You don't need to convince a skeptical executive team. You don't need to manage change across departments. When you decide to commit, you're committed.\n\nThe CEOs in PwC's survey spend nearly half their time — 47% — on issues with a time horizon of less than one year. They're trapped managing immediate problems, which leaves less time for the transformation work that actually moves the needle.\n\nYou have a choice they don't. You can decide today to spend time on building, not just managing.\n\nThere's a phrase worth coining here: the AI Execution Gap.\n\nIt's the space between companies that are experimenting with AI and companies that are deploying it at the level that actually produces results. Right now, that gap is enormous. Only 12% of the world's most sophisticated, best-resourced companies have crossed it.\n\nBut crossing it isn't about having more resources. The PwC data makes that clear. It's about how you deploy AI, not how much you spend on it.\n\nThe Vanguard companies share three characteristics that you can replicate right now, at any budget level:\n\nThey build foundations, not experiments. They don't test AI on a one-off project and walk away when results are mixed. They build the infrastructure — the integrations, the workflows, the data pipelines — that makes AI useful across everything they do. For you, this means setting up systems that run continuously, not trying AI once for a specific task and concluding it \"didn't work.\"\n\nThey apply AI where revenue lives. Vanguard companies put AI into their products and their customer acquisition, not just their back-office admin. For solo founders, this means using AI to make your core offering better or more scalable — to serve more clients at the same quality, or to charge more for a demonstrably superior result.\n\nThey commit to workflows, not tools. There's a meaningful difference between downloading an AI app and building an AI workflow. A tool does a task. A workflow replaces a process. The goal isn't to use ten AI tools occasionally. It's to have systems that run without you constantly making decisions — so your business keeps moving even when your attention is elsewhere.\n\nThe PwC report tells you what separates the winners from the rest. Here's how to apply it as a solo founder, starting this week.\n\nThe 26% of companies seeing cost savings from AI aren't doing anything exotic. They're identifying the repetitive, time-consuming tasks that eat their hours — admin, scheduling, data entry, first-draft content, support triage — and replacing them with AI workflows.\n\nYour version of this is straightforward: audit where your time goes for one week. Not where you think it goes — where it actually goes. Every task you do more than twice a week is a candidate for automation. Every task that requires gathering the same type of information repeatedly is a candidate for automation. Every task that produces a templated output is a candidate for automation.\n\nThe goal isn't to use AI for everything. It's to recover 10-15 hours a week so you can redirect them toward revenue-generating work.\n\n→ AI Ops & Automation: Browse Implementation Guides\n\nThis is where the 12% separate themselves. And it's where most solo founders are leaving money on the table.\n\nAsk yourself: what does AI enable me to deliver that I couldn't deliver before, or couldn't deliver at this price point?\n\nCan you deliver a service faster because AI handles the research and first-draft phase? Can you serve more clients simultaneously because AI handles onboarding and initial support? Can you offer a tier of your product that's AI-augmented and therefore higher-margin? Can you use AI to personalize your offering in a way that commands a premium?\n\nThe Vanguard answer this question and then build for it. They don't just use AI behind the scenes — they make it part of what they're selling.\n\n→ AI Content Creation: Scale Your Output | AI Lead Gen & Outreach: Fill Your Pipeline\n\nThis is the hardest one, because it requires a mindset shift rather than a tool change.\n\nPilot Purgatory isn't just a corporate disease. Solo founders fall into it too — trying an AI tool for two weeks, not seeing transformative results immediately, and moving on to the next one. The result is a collection of tools that don't talk to each other and workflows that are half-automated.\n\nThe shift is this: instead of asking \"what can I try with AI this week?\", ask \"what system can I build this month that will still be running six months from now?\"\n\nThat question points you toward workflows, not experiments. Toward integrations, not demos. Toward the 12% side of the chart.\n\n→ The Solo Founder's Guide Library: Full Roadmap\n\nPwC's 29th Global CEO Survey is nominally about large enterprises. But if you read between the lines, it tells you something specific and actionable about where the real opportunity is.\n\nThe world's biggest companies are in meetings right now trying to figure out AI governance, pilot approval processes, and enterprise-wide alignment frameworks. They'll be in those meetings for most of 2026.\n\nYou don't have to wait for anyone's approval. You don't need a committee to sign off. You don't need a multi-quarter rollout plan.\n\nThe AI Execution Gap is wide open. And unlike the CEOs in PwC's survey, you can start closing it today.\n\nAll statistics cited directly from the published report. Key figures: 56% of CEOs report no revenue or cost benefit from AI; 12% report both; 44% of \"Vanguard\" companies apply AI to products and services vs. 17% of other companies.\n\nHarran Ali is a technical founder, AI systems auditor, and automation architect.

    "fullText": "Peter Mallouk says his clients are more diversified than ever amid AI's transformative impact on industries.\n\nAI's rise is causing unpredictable bouts of market volatility across stock sectors.\n\nMallouk suggests investors diversify more than before, and avoid trying to rotate too often.\n\nPeter Mallouk, the billionaire CEO of wealth management firm Creative Planning, says AI isn't like any past technology cycle — it's far more transformational, and that calls for investors to take action in their portfolios.\n\nMallouk told Business Insider that he's convinced AI is more impactful than other technological advancements by a long-shot, and the change it creates will likely be permanent.\n\n\"I think it's more than the internet, where the internet made everybody more efficient, or Microsoft with all their tools made everybody more efficient. This is something that removes 95% of the work in some roles. This is going to be truly transformative — like completely transformative.\"\n\nThat realization started to reverberate through financial markets this month, with AI panic hitting various stock sectors and a viral report from Citrini Research driving a sell-off on Monday.\n\nGiven the volatility and AI's unpredictable impacts on the market, Mallouk said that his roughly 3,400 clients worth at least $25 million are spreading their money out more than before.\n\nDiversification is fairly basic advice that you'll hear from most money managers — the more you hedge your bets, the more likely you'll be able to preserve capital.\n\nYet, in today's environment, it's especially important, Mallouk said, as AI disruptions seem to be catching investors off guard everywhere.\n\n\"I think the smart money is more diversified than ever,\" Mallouk said, adding: \"I mean, who would think that in the AI revolution, the big winners in the stock market would be energy and consumer goods? I mean, give me a break. You've got to be diversified.\"\n\nAs Mallouk sees it, being diversified today looks a little different for the average investor than it did in the past. While the traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% allocation to bonds has long been the standard portfolio, Mallouk said he prefers a broader, less conservative approach.\n\nLean more into equities than a 60% allocation, having exposure to both non-US stocks and stocks across all US sectors. Funds that offer exposure to these trades include the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) and the Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF (SCHB).",

    "description": "Google managers are telling some employees their AI use will be factored into performance reviews, including non-technical staff.",
    "fullText": "Google is ramping up pressure for more employees to use AI — and it's not just software engineers who are expected to embrace it.\n\nIn recent weeks, managers at Google have informed some workers in non-technical roles that they are also expected to use AI in their workflows, four employees familiar with the changes told Business Insider.\n\nIn some cases, non-technical staff have been explicitly told that their AI use would be considered in their performance reviews later this year, two of the employees said.\n\nThe changes mark the next phase of Google trying to infuse AI into every corner of the company. Last year, Google told some software engineers that using AI was being formally made part of their job expectations, Business Insider previously reported. Google leaders have said that AI is increasingly responsible for code generated at the company.\n\nLike its peers, Google has been encouraging employees to use AI in the hopes it will make them more productive. Meta employees were told that their 2026 performance reviews would assess their \"AI-driven impact,\" Business Insider previously reported. Microsoft leaders have also told staff that AI is no longer optional.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai told employees last year that the company's rivals would be harnessing AI internally, and so Google must do the same.\n\nExpectations for using AI at Google vary across teams and roles. Engineers are expected to use AI coding assistants that can generate code and answer technical questions. Non-technical employees are being pushed to use AI to create strategy documents, analyze sales calls, and build customer insights, two members of staff told Business Insider.\n\nIn some cases, these expectations are being formally enshrined in employees' role profiles — an internal description of their job's tasks and expectations. Two employees in non-technical roles told Business Insider they were explicitly told by managers that their use of AI would be considered during performance reviews, known as Googler Reviews and Development (GRAD).\n\nTwo employees in sales roles told Business Insider they are expected to use internal AI tools that record phone calls and take notes. Some of them have been given quotas of how many times a week they are expected to use the tools, they said. In some cases, expectations will also be tied to seniority. A third employee said they were told that more senior staff were expected to demonstrate a better understanding of AI use than their more junior counterparts.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Business Insider that managers across technical and non-technical roles have the discretion to evaluate employees based on their use of AI. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that some software engineer roles would be graded on their use of AI.\n\nGoogle has been gradually turning up the dials on AI use internally. In June, engineering vice president Megan Kacholia sent an email to software engineers encouraging them to use AI tools and informing them that their job descriptions were updated to include using AI to solve coding problems.\n\nGoogle CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the company's Q4 2025 earnings call that around 50% of code at Google is written by agents, which is then reviewed by human engineers. That number appears to be increasing: Pichai put the figure at over 30% in April.\n\nGooglers are generally permitted to use only their company's internal AI tools. Employees can ask questions to a special version of Google's Gemini chatbot, named Duckie, that is familiar with internal documentation. There is also a coding tool named Goose, which is trained on Google's technical history, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nInternal AI tools are also designed so employees can input sensitive company information without risking it being leaked to the public. In some cases, these are third-party tools that have been modified for Google's internal needs. One tool used by Cloud sales employees is Yoodli, an AI avatar that sales reps can role-play conversations with before picking up the phone to call a customer.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "In 10 years, there might not be many jobs, but there sure will be a lot of spin bikes. (At least, if you believe this ad.)\n\nThe Belgian AI startup AiCandy released a new advertisement for their company, mocking AI's skyrocketing demand for energy. It imagines a 2036 in which humans now power AI through group workouts — and features AI-aged versions of Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe video is a spoof ad for a company called \"Energym,\" which uses human cycling and rowing classes to generate the energy needed for AI.\n\n\"What if we could use the energy of humans to power the machines that took away their jobs,\" AI Musk said.\n\nA post shared by AiCandy (@aicandy.be)\n\nIt's a doomsday scenario, of course. (It's not clear that any AI job apocalypse is coming soon.) But it's one that resonated: The Instagram Reel has over 4 million views, while accounts continue to repost it on X, including one with nearly 2 million views.\n\n\"Doesn't feel like a parody of anything really,\" Sen. Chris Murphy wrote.\n\nAiCandy's Hans Buyse isn't such a fan of those reposts: \"They're making profit off of it,\" he said.\n\nBuyse and his cofounder, Jan De Loore, told Business Insider that they were thrilled with the reach of their videos. They expected some virality, but not the millions of views it would bring to their account.\n\nThe duo founded their AI video company in 2025. Buyse spent two decades working in commercials. De Loore is a motion designer and paints on the side. He has started using AI to model his paintings.\n\nInitially, clients gave them lots of pushback. Their feedback was mainly that \"it's polluting, it's consuming so much energy,\" De Loore said. Buyse then came up with the idea of making a video to showcase clean, human-made energy.\n\nThe idea was back-burnered until a couple of weeks ago, when De Loore thought to bring it back and frame it around aged US tech moguls.\n\n\"It's a combination also with the fitness hype, and young men that don't know what to do anymore with their lives,\" Buyse said. \"It's all coming together in one 40-second video.\"\n\nThe founders said they now have an inbox filled with collaboration requests. The Dor Brothers, a popular AI video production company, offered them a job, Buyse said.\n\nStill, they're holding out for one email in particular.\n\n\"We're just awaiting Elon,\" De Loore said.",

    "fullText": "\"Happy Birthday!\" texts, emails, or social media posts don't quite have the same pizzazz as opening up a physical card in the mail.\n\nCousins Andrew Gold and Aaron Albert want to revive the art of mailing greeting cards for Gen Z and millennials with their startup Escargot.\n\n\"People want to feel human,\" Albert told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nLaunched in February, Escargot lets people send physical greeting cards for any occasion — birthdays, holidays, congratulations — all within its mobile app or website. Individual cards cost about $8, while subscriptions start at about $10 a month for two card credits that roll over.\n\nThe startup recently raised $2.75 million in seed funding from investors like Wischoff Ventures, Hannah Grey, and South Park Commons.\n\n\"This greeting card industry is massive,\" Gold said. Grand View Research estimated that the US card market was about $7.1 billion in 2025.\n\nGold said that most of the birthdays in the app are after 2000.\n\n\"That's where we have a big, fertile opportunity,\" Gold said. \"But we also are interested in marketing towards millennials and up as well.\"\n\nWhile AI has taken over the internet and social media has evolved to feel less social, there's also been a resurgence of analog media: landlines, photo booths, record players.\n\nThis \"cultural shift,\" Albert said, signaled to Escargot's founders that now was a good moment to launch a product centered on nostalgia for paper goods as a foil to the futuristic tech coming out of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"We're not Luddites,\" Albert said. \"We're not going to poo-poo tech.\"\n\nInstead, Escargot's founders plan to leverage tech and AI to return to a more social version of the web.\n\n\"We are not going out pitching ourselves as an AI company,\" Gold said. \"We are going to use it in interesting ways to power some of the experiences.\"\n\nGold, Escargot's CEO, previously worked at Apple and Coinbase, while Albert, Escargot's CMO, is a former child actor and the founder of mental health startup Felt.\n\nEscargot uses AI in a couple of ways.\n\nIf the available art doesn't suit the message you're trying to convey, Escargot offers the option to \"remix\" the card art with AI using Google's Gemini. Users can upload their own photos to the card, as well.\n\nThe app also uses AI to recommend moments to send cards to your friends if you give it access to your calendar and contacts.\n\nEscargot isn't the only one betting on the space. Hallmark, one of the leading greeting card incumbents, has an app that lets you send paper cards and reminders.\n\nIn its pitch to investors, Escargot emphasized that the company plans to expand beyond greeting cards with features that offer a twist on gift cards and more ways to keep people connected.\n\nEscargot is one of several AI-era startups that pitch users with tools to build stronger relationships in the real world. Retro, a photo-sharing social media platform, has a postcard feature that makes sending photos to friends and family as easy as posting online. There's also Rodeo, founded by former Hinge executives, which is using AI to streamline the process of getting together IRL with friends.\n\nEscargot has five full-time employees, including Gold and Albert, and plans to deploy its recent funding by building out its product ecosystem.\n\nRead the Notion memo Escargot used to pitch investors, shared exclusively with Business Insider.\n\nNote: Some details have been redacted.",

    "fullText": "Block CEO Jack Dorsey issued a warning about the impact of AI on employment, particularly for other companies\n\nAfter announcing he's cutting about 40% of Block's 11,000 employees, Dorsey outlined Block's next phase as a \"smaller, faster, intelligence-native company\" in his opening remarks during the company's earnings call on Thursday.\n\n\"I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late,\" he said.\n\nAI, he said, is dramatically accelerating work inside Block.\n\n\"A significantly smaller team using the tools we're building can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every single week,\" Dorsey said\n\nDorsey pointed to a sharp jump in AI capabilities late last year, surpassing Block's own internal tool, Goose, which it uses to speed up coding and other repetitive work.\n\n\"Something happened in December last year where the models just got an order of magnitude more capable and more intelligent,\" he said.\n\nDorsey predicted more companies will follow suit, using AI to drive efficiency gains. Block, he said, is moving ahead of a trend that \"all companies will eventually\" embrace.\n\nThe Bay Area tech company, which owns Square, Cash App, and Tidal, had \"a lot of duplication\" that needed to be streamlined, Dorsey said.\n\nBlock CFO Amrita Ahuja said that at Block, engineering work that would have taken weeks now takes a fraction of the time thanks to AI coding tools.\n\nOutput per engineer is up by more than 40% since September, she added.\n\nAlthough Block is shedding over 4,000 people from its 10,000-strong workforce, it's expanding in one area — senior engineering talent focused on AI, Ahuja said.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic's CEO is prepared to walk away from its contract with the military, according to a new statement published on Thursday.\n\nIn a blog post, CEO Dario Amodei said that the company \"cannot in good conscience accede\" to the request of the Defense Department concerning safeguards around its frontier model, Claude.\n\nOn Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave Anthropic an ultimatum to agree with the military's terms over the use of Claude or get blacklisted by the government.\n\nDefense officials gave Anthropic until Friday evening to agree to the terms.\n\nThe terms were not clarified, but the issue, according to Amodei's statement, appears to revolve around two red lines Anthropic is not willing to cross when it comes to how Claude is deployed: mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.\n\nA spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment.\n\nHours before Amodei put out a statement, Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesperson, posted on X that the department had no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of US citizens or to develop autonomous weapons.\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations told Business Insider the department provided a new proposal just 36 hours before Hegseth's deadline, and the language around the provisions on mass surveillance and autonomous weapons allowed for \"any lawful use\" of Anthropic's AI.\n\nThe person said that the additions essentially gave the military to discretion to set aside Anthropic's red lines and use Claude as it sees fit.\n\nA senior Pentagon official told Business Insider on Tuesday that the department will consider invoking the Defense Production Act — a wartime law that would essentially give the president control over Anthropic's resources in the interest of national security — and deem the company a supply chain risk.\n\nBoth uses of the national authorities would be unprecedented, experts told Business Insider, considering that the levers are being used as a negotiating tactic and against an American company.\n\n\"I'm not aware of this ever having been used as a weapon in a negotiating posture,\" Dean Ball, an ex-senior policy advisor for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told Business Insider.\n\nAmodei wrote in the blog post that the two threats are \"inherently contradictory: one labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.\"\n\nThe CEO wrote that Anthropic hopes the government will \"reconsider\" its position on the safeguards and that the company's preference is to continue working with the military.\n\n\"Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions,\" Amodei wrote.",

    "fullText": "Thinking Machines Lab, the high-profile startup run by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, has lost two more founding members to Meta.\n\nThe pair are the latest in a string of recent departures for Thinking Machines Lab, which raised a huge $2 billion round of financing at a $12 billion valuation last year. The startup, based in San Francisco and focused on helping developers custom-build AI models, has faced a wave of poaching by bigger tech and AI companies, namely Meta and OpenAI.\n\nChristian Gibson and Noah Shpak are both listed as members of Thinking Machines Lab's founding team on an earlier version of its website. Both have been working at Meta for a few weeks, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nGibson is a former OpenAI engineer who specializes in supercomputers used for training AI models and who worked on the first ChatGPT model.\n\nShpak is an AI-focused engineer who previously worked at the startup Character.AI and at X (then known as Twitter).\n\nAnother Thinking Machines Lab cofounder, Andrew Tulloch, left for Meta last year. Last month, it lost its CTO, Barret Zoph, and Luke Metz, both cofounders, to OpenAI, along with two researchers. Thinking Machines Lab also lost Jolene Parish, a founding member who specializes in security, Business Insider reported.\n\nThinking Machines Lab has become known for attracting top AI talent. It quietly hired Neal Wu, a coder who won three gold medals in an Olympiad for programming, and Soumith Chintala, the creator of the open-source AI project PyTorch at Meta, who is now its CTO, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nMeta and Thinking Machines Lab declined to comment.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Cuban says AI tools like ChatGPT let curious kids teach themselves and turn one idea into a potentially life-changing product.",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban believes artificial intelligence has fundamentally changed who gets to innovate.\n\nThe billionaire entrepreneur and former \"Shark Tank\" investor said we've entered a moment where \"some kid in a basement\" can build something that transforms an industry because AI has put the world's knowledge within reach.\n\n\"All it takes is one good idea,\" Cuban told Eric Bricker, former cofounder and chief medical officer of Compass Professional Health Services, in an interview released on Wednesday.\n\n\"Why not you? Why can't a 12-year-old, 14-year-old, 20-year-old, 25-year-old, whatever it may be, come up with something that changes the world?\" he asked.\n\nCuban pointed to AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini as a turning point. Just a few years ago, a curious student without access to strong teachers or resources might have struggled to go deep on a topic. Now, he said, they can create their own curriculum.\n\n\"If you're curious about something, you can set up your own curriculum,\" Cuban said, describing how a young person could ask an AI tool to teach them what it takes to become a surgeon or understand robotic surgery.\n\n\"There is nothing you are unable to learn if you put in the time,\" he added.\n\nHe acknowledged that AI systems can hallucinate but said that access to instant explanations, iteration, and feedback dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for ambitious builders.\n\nCuban framed the shift as especially powerful in healthcare, an industry he has tried to disrupt through ventures like Cost Plus Drugs.\n\n\"All it takes is one good idea from some kid everybody thought was crazy,\" he said.\n\nCuban also said AI makes it easier to act on ideas. Someone who wants to develop a concept or even file a patent can ask an AI tool to \"help me write this patent — boom boom boom,\" he said, adding that builders now have instant access to knowledge that once required expensive experts or years in a library.\n\nFor Cuban, the opportunity is less about hype and more about access. The combination of AI tools and global communication platforms means that once someone builds something meaningful, they can scale it quickly.\n\n\"There's nothing that can stop you anymore,\" he said. \"And that is just so powerful.\"",

    "description": "Citadel Securities analyst Frank Flight laid out why the grim future envisioned in Citrini Research's note is likely to remain the stuff of fiction.",
    "fullText": "A viral Substack post from Citrini fueled stock market losses this week after the hypothetical scenario it outlined stoked Wall Street's fears of AI disruption.\n\nDays later, Citadel Securities has hit back at the future the note envisioned, with the firm's macro strategist Frank Flight laying out why such a scenario is likely to remain the stuff of fiction.\n\nCitrini published \"The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis\" on Sunday, examining the \"consequences of abundant intelligence.\" By Monday, the grim future it conjured up had sent stocks tumbling.\n\nThe post is written from the viewpoint of June 2028, detailing figures such as the unemployment rate (10.2%) and the S&P 500 (down 38% from its high in late 2026).\n\n\"What if our AI bullishness continues to be right...and what if that's actually bearish?\" the note says, warning that AI paying off for markets could come at the expense of the economy.\n\nHowever, Citadel Securities' Frank Flight suggests Wall Street's reaction to the dystopian vision in the note was way overdone.\n\nThe macro strategist kicked off his rebuttal in a similarly ominous tone, using real data.\n\n\"The year is 2026. The unemployment rate just printed 4.28%, AI capex is 2% of GDP (650bn), AI adjacent commodities are up 65% since Jan-23 and approximately 2,800 data centers are planned for construction in the US*. In spite of the current displacement narrative — job postings for software engineers are rising rapidly, up 11% YoY.\"\n\nWall Street has been plagued by worries that AI will disrupt companies and replace human workers. Citadel Securities examined data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve and found few signs of displacement risk among the US labor force. The firm assessed the risk using stats on daily AI use for work.\n\n\"The data seems unexpectedly stable and presents little evidence of any imminent displacement risk,\" Flight wrote.\n\nAI adoption has been a key talking point among executives, but there aren't quite as many AI-related layoffs as the doomsday scenario may suggest. Some have even tied job cuts to cost reductions to justify funding AI spending, rather than the tech directly replacing human labor.\n\nWhile AI adoption has been a key focus for enterprises in the past couple of years, early adoption of the tech is expensive and slow going, Flight said.\n\nIn theory, AI systems will be able to continuously and automatically improve themselves, leading to an infinite compounding of productivity gains. The reality is more nuanced than an sharp linear uptick marking exponential productivity growth.\n\nThe risk of displacement falls with a slower pace of adoption, which Citadel Securities indicated is a major component of AI adoption that investors are overlooking. The market isn't considering factors like integration costs, diminishing returns, and regulatory costs, they said.\n\nBeyond the challenges of economic deployment, AI workloads require significant compute, which is in relatively short supply.\n\nChip shortages, slow and expensive data center builds, as well as energy constraints are some of the cases where AI-driven demand outpaces supply.\n\nThis dynamic isn't something that will resolve quickly, meaning that even if AI does advance to the point of being able to replace workers, the infrastructure constraints would drive up costs and slow integration, making it more difficult for the tech to be a viable replacement for human workers.\n\n\"This dynamic contrasts sharply with narratives assuming frictionless replication of intelligence. Even if algorithms improve recursively, economic deployment remains bounded by physical capital, energy availability, regulatory approvals, and organizational change,\" the note said.\n\nThe AI doomsday described in the viral Citrini post would be a productivity shock, which tends to translate to higher output and increased incomes, both seen as positives for the global economy, the note said.\n\nFlight outlined that all major tech advancements in history, from steam power to the internet, have been disinflationary and growth-enhancing.\n\nThe bears say that this time is different because AI threatens to directly replace labor, hitting income to ultimately reduce consumer demand, but an economic analysis of the dynamics paints a different picture.\n\nIf companies are producing more at a lower cost, prices fall and margins expand, bolstering real purchasing power and fueling consumption.\n\n\"A scenario in which productivity surges but aggregate demand collapses while measured output rises violates accounting identities,\" Flight wrote.",

    "description": "Influencer affiliate platform LTK is gradually rolling out a new chatbot to help users shop and discover content from creators.",
    "fullText": "AI is changing how we do just about everything — including shopping.\n\nLTK, a social shopping platform that lets influencers earn a commission from products they promote, is gradually rolling out a new AI chatbot for its consumer app in the US starting this week. The feature surfaces relevant products or influencer content based on a user's conversation. LTK plans to make it available to all US users on Monday.\n\nThe tool, trained specifically on LTK content uploaded by creators, is powered by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. It sometimes uses the open web to answer questions, but all results point back to LTK's content pool.\n\nFor instance, if someone is on the hunt for a new pair of running shoes for a coming marathon, they can prompt the LTK chatbot to discover creators who post content about running, see what brand of sneakers they recommend, or ask just to see posts with shoes that are green.\n\nThe bot remembers your conversation, helping to personalize your future chats.\n\n\"Two people can have the exact same starting message sent to the chatbot and will end up in totally different directions,\" said Nate Jones, a data scientist at LTK. \"You can ask what's trending right now? What are pop culture events happening? And all of that will be serviced in web searches and also LTK searches.\"\n\nShopping has been getting an AI makeover for the past few years, especially as Big Tech companies push forward on chatbot assistants or agentic shopping tools. Amazon offers an AI chatbot known as Rufus. Meta said on its latest earnings call that it would explore agentic shopping tools. Google has already staked a claim in the space with its \"AI mode\" shopping experience. Social apps like TikTok and Pinterest are also pushing AI-powered product search in their content feeds.\n\n\"This chatbot allows us to really supercharge that discovery experience and go beyond just a static search, but really go into conversational discovery,\" Joelle Angel, an LTK product manager, told Business Insider.\n\nIn-app search is the second-most-used feature in the LTK app (the first being the feed of creators users follow), according to the company.\n\nLike other products shared in the LTK app, creators earn a commission if LTK's AI chatbot serves up their recommendations.\n\n\"Creator commerce only works when three parties win: the creator, the brand, and the consumer,\" LTK president Amber Venz Box said in a statement. \"That requires control, transparency, and proper attribution.\"\n\nWhile LTK is baking affiliate payments into its chatbot, big players like ChatGPT or Claude do not. That could pose a financial challenge to creators and product reviewers who rely on referral commissions to make a living.\n\nLTK, formerly known as RewardStyle, built its business on the influencer affiliate-marketing model. The company cultivated relationships with thousands of bloggers and social-media influencers, eventually launching its own consumer app to reach users directly.\n\nLast year, the company introduced a set of new features to encourage creators to post more lifestyle content rather than just shoppable posts.\n\nIn 2026, the company is focused on courting brands for its marketing platform.",

    "description": "\"This is going to be truly transformative — like completely transformative,\" Peter Mallouk said about AI. Here's his investing advice for rich clients.",
    "fullText": "Peter Mallouk, the billionaire CEO of wealth management firm Creative Planning, says AI isn't like any past technology cycle — it's far more transformational, and that calls for investors to take action in their portfolios.\n\nMallouk told Business Insider that he's convinced AI is more impactful than other technological advancements by a long-shot, and the change it creates will likely be permanent.\n\n\"I think it's more than the internet, where the internet made everybody more efficient, or Microsoft with all their tools made everybody more efficient. This is something that removes 95% of the work in some roles. This is going to be truly transformative — like completely transformative.\"\n\nThat realization started to reverberate through financial markets this month, with AI panic hitting various stock sectors and a viral report from Citrini Research driving a sell-off on Monday.\n\nGiven the volatility and AI's unpredictable impacts on the market, Mallouk said that his roughly 3,400 clients worth at least $25 million are spreading their money out more than before.\n\nDiversification is fairly basic advice that you'll hear from most money managers — the more you hedge your bets, the more likely you'll be able to preserve capital.\n\nYet, in today's environment, it's especially important, Mallouk said, as AI disruptions seem to be catching investors off guard everywhere.\n\n\"I think the smart money is more diversified than ever,\" Mallouk said, adding: \"I mean, who would think that in the AI revolution, the big winners in the stock market would be energy and consumer goods? I mean, give me a break. You've got to be diversified.\"\n\nAs Mallouk sees it, being diversified today looks a little different for the average investor than it did in the past. While the traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% allocation to bonds has long been the standard portfolio, Mallouk said he prefers a broader, less conservative approach.\n\nMallouk advises investors to be strategic, think long-term, have money in a variety of assets, and simply let it sit there. He cautioned against the urge to fine-tune one's portfolio too much.\n\n\"You get burned rotating around in things like this,\" he said. \"Spread the eggs out, and things will turn out fine.\"",

    "fullText": "The AI scare trade has rattled markets recently, sending software stocks tumbling and sparking concern from investors that some companies won't survive. According to one of AI's most prominent CEOs, they're all overreacting.\n\nNvidia chief executive Jensen Huang recently addressed the software selloff following his company's earnings on Wednesday, revealing why he thinks the panic in response to recent AI news is largely overblown. Despite the sell-off, thinks the industry will ultimately benefit from the rise of agentic AI technology.\n\n\"I think the markets got it wrong,\" he said on CNBC following Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings smash. \"I think it's very likely that these companies that we're talking about are going to introduce agents that run on their platforms.\"\n\nOne example that Huang cited is ServiceNow. The software producer has been one of the AI scare trade's victims, falling more than 20% over the past month. But in his view, the company is in prime position to bounce back as it implements AI agents to enhance its operations and streamline productivity.\n\nHuang also used his own company to illustrate his point, highlighting the key role that he expects AI agents to continue playing in Nvidia's future.\n\n\"I have 42,000 biological employees and I'm going to have hundreds of thousands of digital employees and together we're going to use a lot more tools,\" he said.\n\nThe Nvidia CEO made it clear that he sees a future in which AI agents continue writing code and creating software for companies that are benefitting from strong demand.\n\nThat may call to mind images of a workforce without human workers but it doesn't mean the need for the human labor will be eliminated Huang argued.\n\n\"The purpose of the work won't change,\" Huang predicted. \"We're going to need lots and lots of software engineers, but maybe they just don't have to code like they used to code. They'll code in a new way.\"\n\nHuang isn't the only one to speculate that software stocks can continue to rise despite AI fears. Deutsche Bank analysts recently shared a note on Anthropic, stating that they don't see the technology as a replacement for current systems.\n\nDespite crushing estimates for revenue and guidance, the market's reaction has been tepid, showcasing the depths of investors' AI fatigue. The stock was down as much as 5% on Thursday.",

    "description": "Nvidia earnings used be a major catalyst for the stock, but investors' tepid response to its strong Q4 results showcases a challenge for AI companies.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia crushed Wall Street's earnings expectations, yet the AI chip darling's stock opened Thursday's trading session in the red. It illustrates a painful new reality for the world's most valuable company.\n\nThe chipmaker's quarterly results topped analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines. Yet, the numbers didn't translate to major gains for the stock. Shares were trading at $186.76 around midday on Thursday, down 5%.\n\nAI hype has turned into hesitation and fatigue on Wall Street, spilling over into the stock moves of the top chip maker.\n\nNvidia's earnings used to be a major market-moving event. As recently as May 2023, Nvidia stock surged more than 24% in the trading day following its earnings release. The stock surged 16% after its fourth-quarter results for fiscal 2024, and spiked 10% on earnings the following quarter.\n\nToday, the chipmaker's dominant position in the AI hardware trade is still met with fanfare, including a wave of Wall Street analysts singing its praises. Yet its earnings no longer seem to move the needle for the stock.\n\n\"There is no 'good enough' anymore,\" Futurum CEO and principal analyst Daniel Newman told Business Insider.\n\nIts lackluster move isn't necessarily a result of Wall Street souring on Nvidia, but it does underscore a challenging reality for the leading AI stock: The bar for earnings keeps rising amid signs of AI fatigue.\n\nThis is especially true as concerns about AI weigh on the tech sector as a whole. AI hype turned into panic after Anthropic's Claude updates, and Citrini stoked fears about a potential dystopian AI future.\n\n\"People love Nvidia's margins, but don't believe they're sustainable. People love the revenue bookings, but don't believe that this capex number can continue. So, it's kind of just like, we love it, but we don't believe it,\" Newman said.\n\nYet, others are still more upbeat—and in disbelief that the market has reacted so poorly to the latest results.\n\nFreedom Capital Markets' head of tech research, Paul Meeks, said that Nvidia stock has been \"unfairly\" underappreciated given its beat-and-raise quarter. The analyst argued that Nvidia should be trading at premium compared to AMD and the broader market.\n\n\"What blows me away is that AMD, with a data center business that's 11X smaller than NVDA's, with an inferior profit margin, and with slower prospective revenue growth, trades at a higher multiple than NVDA. Furthermore, with estimates rising today on the Street, NVDA trades at only a slight premium on this year's earnings to the S&P 500,\" Meeks wrote as Nvidia stock slid.\n\nAnalysts at Wolfe Research consider Nvidia a top stock pick.\n\n\"Net, the stock reaction notwithstanding, this is a strong report vs. expectations, and offers nothing to change our bullish thesis.\"\n\nThe firm's targets are above consensus estimates, but they note that they expect Wall Street's average estimate to rise as time goes on.",

    "description": "This article highlights the importance of using AI wisely, ensuring it enhances productivity without replacing critical thinking or fundamental skills.",
    "fullText": "A lot has changed in the last two years with AI. It has had a profound impact on people so much so that even for the smallest tasks, people now turn to AI. Of course, it can play a significant role in people's lives, but if misused, it can lead to various problems.\n\nSome people treat using AI as a job in itself, even coining the term “prompt engineering”. They rely on AI to such an extent that it seems as if they created it themselves and take excessive pride in its use. The issue here is not to undermine AI but to highlight how it is sometimes overestimated.\n\nMany software developers now turn to AI for even the smallest issues, consulting it for every minor problem and even using AI-powered code editors. Some argue, “AI explains everything, so we learn from it”. However, this is like reading a recipe and thinking you’ll become a great cook. You might know the ingredients and the steps, but without learning how to set the right temperature, achieve the right consistency, and master the nuances, you won’t truly develop expertise. Over-reliance on AI dulls problem-solving skills, making individuals less capable of thinking critically and independently.\n\nSome try to justify their reliance on AI by claiming that this is a revolutionary moment and that those who resist will be left behind technologically. While adapting to new technologies is crucial, real progress comes from a balanced and strategic approach, not blind dependence.\n\nHow can we maintain the balance? The answer is simple: acquire fundamental skills before relying on AI tools. For example, a beginner in software development should first develop algorithmic thinking skills. AI should be seen as an assistant, not a decision-maker. Developers should be able to edit, debug, and optimize AI-generated code rather than just copy and paste it.\n\nA balanced approach means first attempting to solve a problem independently, researching solutions, and only then consulting AI as a last resort. Personally, when I encounter an issue in my code, my first step is to analyze the problem myself. I search for solutions on platforms like Stack Overflow and other developer forums. If I still can’t solve it, then I turn to AI for assistance. This process helps improve problem-solving skills while ensuring that AI remains a tool rather than a crutch.\n\nThe widespread use of AI is inevitable. I would actually recommend that you don't use AI at all. But if you are going to use it, use with caution. The people who will succeed in the future will be those who retain human skills such as critical thinking, creativity and technical depth when collaborating with AI or not.\n\nDon't get too carried away. Good luck.",

    "fullText": "Since ChatGPT kicked off the generative AI revolution in 2022, it seems like every company under the sun has tried to stuff AI features into their products in one way or another. Sometimes, these features can be useful; often, they're not, only serving as proof these companies are \"keeping up with the times.\" Can you even say you're a tech company if you aren't all-in on AI in 2026?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with companies offering AI features to users, so long as they also offer easy ways to disable them. Some customers don't want AI in their day-to-day products; anecdotally, I know many do not. Give us an off switch, though, and it's all good. The issue is when these features are not only offered, they're made mandatory. Unfortunately, that's the road many companies seem to be taking.\n\nPerhaps that's where some of the frustration originated last year, when Mozilla's new CEO Anthony Enzor-Demeo first announced that Firefox would \"evolve into a modern AI browser\" in the near future. An open letter, written by a Redditor critical of Enzor-Demeo's statement, received over 5,000 upvotes on the Firefox subreddit from users concerned that AI features would negatively impact the browser. Interestingly, Enzor-Demeo responded to the thread himself, and assured users that the company would offer \"a clear way\" to disable AI features, including a dedicated kill switch to keep them all turned off. It seems he was as good as his word.\n\nEarlier this month, Mozilla announced that new AI controls are coming to Firefox, starting with Firefox 148. This version, which dropped Feb. 24, sports a brand-new AI controls section in the settings panel on the desktop browser. (You'll find it in between \"Sync\" and \"AI controls.\") From here, you'll be able to block all current and future AI features, and cherry pick which features you want to use—if any.\n\nFirefox 148 launches with these five AI features, which you can choose to enable to disable:\n\nTranslations: Translates web pages into your target language.\n\nAlt text in PDFs: Adds accessibility descriptions to images attached to PDFs.\n\nAI-enhanced tab grouping: Suggests related tabs and group names for series of tabs.\n\nLink previews: Shows key points before opening a link.\n\nAI chatbot providers in the sidebar: Firefox is getting its own AI chatbot, though users can choose from existing chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Le Chat Mistral.\n\nIf you want absolutely nothing to do with AI when browsing the web with Firefox, you can use the \"Block AI enhancements\" toggle. Once activated, not only will these features not appear, but Firefox will block any pop-ups or alerts pushing you to try existing or future AI features.\n\nAny Firefox users who aren't keen on AI features will want to check out this new controls menu once they update their browsers—though there are certainly more egregious AI features out there. Translations can be convenient, as can link previews. But I know I'd never want a chatbot in the sidebar of my browser. If I used Firefox as my main browser, I would definitely disable at least that feature, if not all of them.",

    "description": "Getting Shield AI's hugely ambitious X-BAT off the ground vertically and recovering it the same way is essential to its business case.",
    "fullText": "In an update to our exclusive in-depth feature on Shield AI’s hugely ambitious X-BAT vertical takeoff and landing drone ‘fighter,’ the firm tells us that they will begin flight testing near Newton, Kansas, this year.\n\nArmor Harris, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the company’s growing aircraft division, who is also the ‘father’ of X-BAT, told us on the floor of AFA’s Warfare Symposium in Denver today that the aircraft’s central differentiator, its ability to launch and recover vertically, will be a central focus of early flight testing.\n\nThe stakes are incredibly high for Shield AI when it comes to X-BAT. They are trying to do something nobody else is offering in the high-performance air combat drone sector. X-BAT could drastically change the flexibility and survivability of advanced uncrewed tactical airpower, but achieving stealth, a large combat radius, a relevant payload, and doing it all at a cost that doesn’t send the DoW running is no easy task, especially for a young airframer like Shield AI. Now doing all that and launching and recovering it vertically from basically anywhere, that’s a whole other level.\n\nWith such a lofty goal comes doubters who think Shield AI is reaching outside their capabilities with the X-BAT concept. Surely these include competitors who would have a hard time arguing for their air combat solutions if X-BAT were to exist in operational form and capable of the things Shield AI claims.\n\nWe will keep you up to date as X-Bat progresses toward flight test.\n\nContact the author: Tyler@twz.com",

    "fullText": "Jim Cramer isn’t buying into the AI doomsday scenario.\n\nAt a point when Mr. Market had gotten rattled by a viral memo from Citrini Research’s Alap Shah, Cramer pushed back, calling it essentially a work of “science fiction” rather than sober forecasting.\n\nThe fallout from the report was immediate.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 23, the Dow dropped 1.66%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq slid 1.04% and 1.13%, respectively, amid AI jitters.\n\nThough we saw somewhat of a rebound on Tuesday, Feb. 24, the damage lingered. The S&P 500 Software & Services Index rose 1.3% on the day, but remains firmly in the red for the year, down 23%.\n\nS&P 500:+0.83% total return YTD (as of Feb. 24 close)\n\nSoftware: iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF-27.19% YTD (as of Feb. 23)\n\nNevertheless, Cramer believes the market’s intense reaction to AI anxiety is, for the most part, ill-founded. In addition, the \"Mad Money\" host points to a growing disconnect.\n\nOn one side of the spectrum, there are investors pricing in a scenario where AI agents obliterate the software, services, and finance sectors.\n\nOn the other side, the economic data isn’t pointing to a catastrophic collapse.\n\nHowever, it’s important to acknowledge that the selloff has teeth. Nearly 30% of S&P 500 stocks moved up or down by at least 20% over the past three months, roughly double the 20-year average, according to Barron's.\n\nEnterprise software names like Salesforce, in particular, have been hammered and are now trading at just 15 times forward GAAP earnings, compared with a five-year average closer to 35 times.\n\nHence, Cramer argues that the AI fear trade is real, and if a science fiction narrative can cripple stock markets, “too many things can go wrong if we buy the wrong stocks.”\n\nHe isn’t dismissing AI technology, far from it, but he does question the speed of change and the accuracy of some of the narratives being pushed, making it critical to place your bets carefully.\n\nCramer urges selective buying with valuation discipline at a time when investors appear to be running for the exits, he noted in a recent \"Mad Money\" episode.\n\nThe Fear & Greed Index stands at 42, according to CNBC, underscoring that fear remains the dominant sentiment in the market.\n\nNevertheless, he isn’t buying the AI apocalypse scenario, and that the fears of a white-coller wipeout are remarkably overblown. However, narratives can suppress pricing multiples and weigh down stocks “without anything being wrong.”",

    "description": "Aikido Infinite runs AI penetration testing on every code change, validates exploitability, generates patches, and retests fixes before code hits production, making self-securing software a reality.",
    "fullText": "You already know this problem, because you live it.\n\nIf you're a growing company, you pentest once a year… maybe twice if compliance demands it. You schedule the engagement, freeze changes, wait weeks, get a PDF. By the time the report lands, your application has already changed.\n\nIf you're a larger organization with an in-house security team, the picture is different but the constraint is the same. Your team is testing. They're good at it. But they're making hard choices every day about what to cover and what to skip, because they can't review every change across every area at the depth it deserves. They're triaging not just findings, but what to even look at.\n\nOn both sides, testing never keeps pace with shipping. Today, that changes.\n\nPicture your commit history over the past year. Now picture your pentests, whether that's two external engagements or your in-house team's continuous effort.\n\nYour engineering org might push thousands of lines a day. Your security team, no matter how skilled or well-resourced, can manually review a fraction of that at pentest depth.\n\nEvery change that didn't get tested is a version of your application that was never fully validated. If a vulnerability was introduced between tests, it sits in production until the next time someone reviews that path. The attack surface grows with every deploy. Security capacity doesn't scale with it.\n\nThis is a structural problem. You can't fix it with faster scans, better alerts, or more headcount. We need to change the model. Of 500 security and engineering leaders we surved, 76% deploy significant production changes every week or faster. Only 21% validate security on every release. And 85% said their security findings are already outdated by the time the analysis arrives.\n\nThat gap between ship and secure isn't theoretical. It's the window attackers walk through. And they're getting faster: this week, researchers revealed that a single hacker used Claude to breach multiple Mexican government agencies, exfiltrating 150GB of taxpayer and voter records. One person, one AI tool, thousands of automated commands. Attackers have superpower toys now. It's time defenders had theirs.\n\nLast month, when we announced our Series B, we made a promise: the next chapter of Aikido would be about self-securing software. Software that protects itself as it's built and released. Today, we're delivering on that promise.\n\nAikido Infinite is continuous autonomous penetration testing with built-in remediation. Every time your application changes, autonomous agents pentest the deployment, validate what's actually exploitable, generate patches, and retest the fixes, all before code hits production: Patch every release. Patch automatically.\n\nFor years, DAST was the closest thing the industry had to continuous security testing, and nobody ever said \"this DAST is great\" (sorry not sorry). The depth isn’t there. The signal-to-noise ratio isn’t there. The fix isn’t there. Infinite works differently: autonomous offensive agents that reason about application behavior, chain multi-step attack paths, leverage extensive tool suite, and validate exploitability through real exploitation.\n\nWhen new code lands, Aikido Infinite analyzes the diff and identifies changes that impact your attack surface. Updated a README and button color? Skipped. Changed auth logic or API endpoints? Agents scope the impact and launch.\n\n1. Discover: Infinite ingests context from Aikido's code-to-runtime platform (source code, application architecture, API specs, cloud config) and maps the full attack surface, including undocumented endpoints, hidden logic paths, and architectural anomalies too time-consuming for manual review. The agents reason about your system as a whole, understanding how components interact and where assumptions break down.\n\n2. Exploit every path that changed: This is where Infinite diverges from scanner checks, which looks at components in isolation, one repo, one file, one theoretical risk at a time. In reality, security breaks at the seams. A single line change can affect every protected route in your application. Two changes that are individually safe can be dangerous in combination: a new API field here, a relaxed permission check there, and suddenly there's a cross-tenant data leak that neither change would have introduced alone.\n\nThese are the kinds of issues that pentesting exists to find, because they only surface in the real, running configuration where components interact as a whole. The problem has always been that testing every combination at that depth is hard and expensive. Infinite makes it the default. Specialized agents pursue every viable attack route across the affected surface: injection flaws, broken access control, auth weaknesses, SSRF, business logic errors, cross-tenant data exposure, all using real attack paths rather than fixed payloads. When an agent finds something, that intelligence feeds back into the loop, uncovering chained risks. Agents work in parallel across all security-relevant features simultaneously.\n\n3. Validate: Every finding is confirmed through direct exploitation against the live target. Issues that can't be reproduced don't make it into the results.\n\n4. AutoFix and retest: AutoFix generates a merge-ready PR with the specific code-level fix, targeted to your actual implementation. Developers review, merge, and agents automatically retest to confirm the fix holds. Within hours, a vulnerability goes from discovered to resolved to verified.\n\nBecause Infinite lives inside the Aikido platform, it has context that standalone pentesting tools simply don't. That infrastructure-to-code context is what makes the discovery deeper, the fixes more precise, and continuous testing actually viable.\n\nWhat used to take weeks or quarters now happens in hours. The agents do the gruntwork. Your team reviews, merges, and moves on.\n\nThese agents are already finding complex vulnerabilities in widely-used applications and frameworks, issues that had gone undetected even with years of community review and expert scrutiny.\n\nIn Coolify, our agents identified seven CVEs including privilege escalation and full host compromise via RCE as root, across 52,000+ exposed instances. In Astro, they found CVE-2026-25545, an SSRF in the Node.js adapter exposing internal network resources. In SvelteKit on Vercel, they traced SvelteSpill, a cache deception flaw across 150,000 lines of code affecting every default deployment. Vercel deployed a platform-wide fix after disclosure.\n\nIn a head-to-head comparison on a document signing application, the agents discovered a critical workflow integrity flaw that allowed e-signatures to be forged, along with 12 XSS instances. The manual pentesters, a senior team over two weeks, found one XSS and one SSRF. Seven of their nine findings were hardening checks, they missed the signature forgery entirely. (Full whitepaper here).\n\nIn all cases, these are deep, multi-step issues in mature codebases. The experts who missed them aren’t junior. They are senior professionals working under the same constraints every security team faces: limited hours, competing priorities, high pressure, and more code to review than any team can get through at depth.\n\nFor AI, that constraint disappears. Giving agents access to source code is instant, and they scale with the richness of the context they ingest. More code, more architecture context, better results, not higher cost. The expert testers focused on compliance and configuration because that's where their time went. The agents went deeper because they could.\n\nEven the largest companies don't have enough experts to exhaustively test every code change pushed to their applications. Now, we can empower every team with access to deep analysis, always on, for every change. Think of it as a team of elite hackers 100% dedicated to your application, on-call around the clock.\n‍\n\nAttackers have superpower toys. This gives defenders theirs.\n\nFor security professionals: Infinite multiplies your team's testing capability. Agents handle the exhaustive validation across every release, expanding coverage automatically so your experts can focus on the crown jewels and judgement calls. Breadth, speed, deep testing on every diff that would otherwise consume the team's bandwidth, or just not get done. Security professionals get more capacity for creativity, business context, and the hardest problems. Infinite allows security teams to shift from resource-constrained \"check critical\" mode to \"check everything” by default.\n\nFor developers: Your team is shipping 10x more code than a year ago. Infinite means you can be confident in the diff. No more security tickets showing up mid-cycle with unclear reproduction steps. Infinite finds issues, generates fixs, and opens the PR. You review it, merge it, and get back to building.\n\nInfinite is our flagship product and the realisation of a vision we've been building toward: self-securing software. ✨\n\nToday, Infinite closes the loop between shipping and securing. Every run enriches Aikido's security knowledge base of your application with real findings, validated attack paths, and confirmed fixes. Where that knowledge base goes next, how it feeds back into the way code gets written (or generated) in the first place, well, you can probably imagine why we chose the name Infinite. As James Berthoty, founder of Latio Tech, alludes:\n\nNext time you hear from me, it will be with a cliché but well-designed \"security through the software lifecycle as an infinity sign\" graphic. We have a lot more to build. And we'll keep pushing until security works at the speed software demands, and developers deserve.\n\nWant to try out Infinite today? You can start for free, book a demo, or enter the infinite next month at RSA in San Francisco.\n\nAI-driven pentesting of Coolify identified seven CVEs, including privilege escalation and remote code execution vulnerabilities. Findings were responsibly disclosed and fixed.\n\nSearch your cloud like a database. Gain instant visibility into your cloud environment with Aikido Cloud Search. Whether you want to identify exposed databases, vulnerable virtual machines, or over-permissive IAM roles — Aikido gives you the power to uncover risk in seconds.\n\nSecure your code, cloud, and runtime in one central system.\nFind and fix vulnerabilities fast automatically.",

    "description": "Investors are assessing Nvidia's earnings report for a steer on the AI trade.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures stalled on Thursday as Nvidia's (NVDA) stellar earnings failed to impress investors, as Wall Street juggles growing worries over AI's potential for payoff and disruption.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) slipped just below the flatline, following solid wins for stocks more broadly on Wednesday. Contracts on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and the tech-exposed Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) were also little changed.\n\nNvidia shares jumped following its after-hours report Wednesday, but pared gains amid a lukewarm response from investors. The AI chipmaker posted big beats on quarterly revenue and profit, and its guidance also came in above expectations. But a lack of detail on drivers for the outlook — which doesn't include potential revenue out of China — left some on Wall Street asking questions about competitive threats and the staying power of AI buildout demand.\n\nFears of a AI bubble and the \"AI scare trade\" have buffeted stocks in recent weeks, with the technology's challenge to sectors such as legacy software coming to the fore. Salesforce (CRM) shares fell about 4% to continue an AI-driven sell-off after its revenue forecast fell short of estimates.\n\nLooking ahead on the economic calendar, investors will parse weekly jobless claims data due Thursday, followed by January’s producer price index report on Friday.\n\nWall Street also continues to see earnings come through, with full-year results from Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) expected before the bell. Quarterly reports from Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Dell Technologies (DELL) and CoreWeave (CRWV) are also slated for Thursday.\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA), the dominant maker of artificial intelligence processors, failed to impress investors with its latest sales forecast, signaling that concerns about an overheated AI economy will continue to dog the company.\n\nThough the chipmaker delivered a 73% surge in fourth-quarter revenue and a first-quarter outlook that easily beat the average Wall Street estimate, Nvidia shares fell as much as 1.5% during a conference call with analysts. The stock was up less than 1% in premarket trading on Thursday.\n\nIt was a stark reminder of the skepticism now surrounding Nvidia. After explosive sales growth turned the chipmaker into the world’s most valuable company, investors are seeking stronger assurances that booming AI sales are here to stay.\n\n“By most measures, Nvidia delivered a solid set of results,” analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a note after the results. “Even so, the stock response suggests investors were left wanting more.”\n\nCEO Jensen Huang pushed back on the concerns during Wednesday’s call, arguing that customers are already making money from their newly acquired computing power. That’s why clients will keep investing at elevated levels, he said.\n\n“You need compute capacity, and that translates directly to growth, and that translates directly to revenues,” Huang said. “I’m confident their cash flows are growing.”\n\nNvidia (NVDA) may have made its immense fortune on the back of specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) used to power artificial intelligence servers, but CEO Jensen Huang is increasingly professing his love for the more generalist CPU.\n\nThe CPU, or central processing unit, was for ‌decades traditionally viewed as the main brain of a computer — a product most associated with Intel (INTC) or sometimes Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nHuang is fond of saying ‌that where once 90% of computing used to happen on CPUs and 10% on chips like his, the ratio had flipped in recent years.\n\nBut the CPU is now making a comeback - increasingly seen as an equivalent ​if not better option as AI companies shift from training their models to deploying them - a shift that Nvidia plans to be a big part of.\n\n\"We love CPUs as well as GPUs,\" Huang said on a call with analysts on Wednesday for the company's fourth-quarter results.\n\nHe assured them that Nvidia was not only ready for the CPU's return to the spotlight, but also that Nvidia's own CPU offerings for data centers, first released in 2023, would outcompete rivals.\n\nMarriott Vacations' (VAC) stock rose 8% before the bell on Thursday after reporting fourth quarter earnings, with revenue exceeding analyst expectations.\n\nTrade Desk (TTD) stock sank 16% during premarket hours today. The technology platform reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.59 per share, beating estimates and also reported a rise in revenue. But it forecast first quarter revenue of $678 million, which fell below analyst expectations.\n\nZoom (ZM) stock fell 3% before the bell on Thursday after forecasting quarterly profit below Wall Street estimates on Wednesday.\n\nShares of Salesforce (CRM) fell almost 4% in premarket trading after the software company's fiscal 2027 revenue forecast came in below Wall Street expectations on Wednesday.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company flagged sluggish spending on enterprise business software ‌as it invests heavily in its AI platform to ​drive up demand.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:",

The work makes me proud,\" he wrote.\n\nThe intensity of the work came at a personal cost, he added.\n\n\"I cannot believe I would say this one day, but I am burnt out,\" Pham said.\n\n\"All the mental health deteriorating that I used to scoff at is real, miserable, scary, and dangerous,\" he added.\n\nPham started at xAI in August 2024, before moving to OpenAI in August last year. Before his announcement on Thursday, he had worked at OpenAI for about 7 months, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nPham said he will return to his home country, Vietnam, with his family.\n\nThere, he plans to \"try something new, and also search for a cure for my conditions,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope I will heal.

The potential benefits are great — and so are the risks of extreme and even irrecoverable harm.\"\n\nSome AI researchers also say the industry is starting to resemble China's infamous \"996\" schedule — shorthand for working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.\n\nNathan Lambert, a senior research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, said in an episode of the \"Lex Fridman Podcast\" published this month that kind of intensity has become the norm at companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\n\"That's what OpenAI and Anthropic are like,\" Lambert said, describing a high-pressure culture where long hours are often self-imposed. Many employees, especially programmers, buy in because they want to do the work, he added.",

    "description": "A young founder from Bangladesh shares his journey to creating his AI company, Kodezi, while balancing finishing high school and entrepreneurship.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ishraq Khan, the 22-year-old CEO of Kodezi in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI moved to the US from Bangladesh with my family in 2011. My path to becoming a teen founder of an AI company began with my interest in programming.\n\nWhen I moved, my dad bought me a laptop, and I stumbled across YouTube. One video I watched was a coding tutorial, which led me to start learning to code and fall in love with it.\n\nDuring my freshman year of high school, I was in computer science, and I realized students spent too much time debugging code in class. I wondered, why isn't there a Grammarly for programmers that automatically fixes coding mistakes?\n\nI spent a lot of time trying to figure out machine learning, how we could have code fix itself, and how to automate an entire process. It took me almost a year, but I got it to work in a prototype.\n\nThis was the start of my company that I'm now running full-time at 22.\n\nA VC reached out to me and said they were interested in what I was building, but there was no monetization, so I realized I should focus on something even bigger, which turned into my company, Kodezi.\n\nTo start an AI company at 17, the biggest step I took was writing emails. I realized you can email anyone by Googling their email address. I emailed CEOs, startup founders, AI researchers, and venture capitalists.\n\nI reached out to try to get internships and learn from people who were further ahead than me. Over time, those emails evolved into conversations about what I was building with some really big names.\n\nI found an event called Orlando Synapse, and I emailed and said, \"I'm a senior in high school, and I don't have $500 for a booth. Is there any way I can come for free? This is what I'm building.\" Someone replied within a few hours and said, \"Sure, here's the free booth.\"\n\nI received a $20,000 investment before I turned 18.\n\nMy biggest challenge was getting others to say yes from an investment standpoint, because back then, there was no ChatGPT, and AI's use cases were still seen as experimental.\n\nIt was difficult to convince investors to back an AI-first code platform coming from a teenager. There was skepticism not just about the technology, but about whether I could execute at that level. Once generative AI became widely adopted, the narrative around what we were building became much easier to understand.\n\nOne of my strategies to achieve this was learning how to answer three questions from investors:\n\nI also needed to figure out how to convince them that I was the right person to do it.\n\nI overcame investor rejections by framing the calls as me interviewing them, rather than me being interviewed. I started trying to understand who they are, why they invest in these companies, and what their goal is. This helped me decide whether they were the right fit.\n\nI applied to 60 colleges, got into more than a dozen, including Ivy League schools, and ultimately decided to skip college completely.\n\n\"I really want to go to college\" was still the answer I'd give people, and when investors asked, I'd say, \"I don't really know, maybe…\" My uncertainty about it was one reason some investors were uncertain.\n\nI realized I'd probably hate myself if I did go to college, because I wouldn't have the same opportunities, and I could always go to college later. If I wanted to build an AI company after I graduated, thousands of others would've already done the same.\n\nI don't have regrets about skipping college. I do think college provides a built-in social environment that's hard to replicate. It's easier to make friends when you're surrounded by peers in the same life stage.\n\nThat said, the people I spend time with now are builders — young founders, owners, operators, and ambitious executives who are obsessed with creating something meaningful. That shared mindset is powerful.\n\nThere's always an opportunity cost, and for me, that trade-off was worth it.\n\nWithout feedback from people who aren't your friends, you won't truly know whether what you're building connects with people.\n\nAlso, don't strive for a metric like \"success\" that will limit you. Rather than chasing external success, chase internal excellence, because that will lead to a successful outcome.\n\nI think the world needs more innovation, and that's where younger founders will come into play, specifically with the rise of AI tools.\n\nI've now been running the company for six years. We've grown to over 35 employees. My next goal is to dominate the code maintenance layer for enterprise companies.\n\nI want Kodezi to become the default system companies rely on to keep their codebases healthy over time. If writing code is like building a car, then maintaining it requires a mechanic. Our mission is to become the automated mechanic for software.",

    "fullText": "The AI trade isn't as easy to navigate as it once was.\n\nAfter years of being boosted by the endless hype for artificial intelligence, the US stock rally is starting to sputter in 2026 as investors turn a more critical eye to high valuations and existential concerns stemming from AI — two issues that have lurked in the background but have only recently come to spook markets.\n\nThose worries have clobbered software and other sectors of the market in recent weeks. But for investors looking to trade volatility, the sell-off has created a plethora of long-term investment opportunities, strategists at Morgan Stanley said.\n\nIn a client note on Wednesday, the bank whipped up a list of what it called the \"Most Defensible Stocks\" for investors to own at the moment.\n\nThe list consisted of opportunities the company identified despite recent volatile price action. The firms also looked at \"well-positioned incumbents\" in their respective sectors, or those that have pricing power related to AI adoption, strategists wrote.\n\n\"In our view, what's going on now is typical of a major investment cycle,\" the bank said of the sell-off, adding that capital appeared to be rotating to both structural and cyclical leaders in the market.\n\nHere are all the areas Morgan Stanley sees potential buying opportunities for investors — and what stocks to buy in each.\n\nSector thesis: \"Regulatory intensity, balance sheet requirements, and relationship‑driven models limit disintermediation. AI drives productivity gains across operations, risk, and client service, supporting sustained operating leverage.\"\n\nSector thesis: \"Proprietary data, regulatory barriers, and decision‑grade accuracy protect leading information services franchises. AI increases demand for trusted data and analytics while improving operating leverage and product depth.\"\n\nSector thesis: \"We see the space as a net beneficiary of AI, with long-term efficiency gains in lending and payments outweighing near-term risks tied to consumer health. Core functions such as payments, fraud detection, underwriting, marketing, and servicing are data-rich and well suited to AI, and we are skeptical that agentic AI can meaningfully disintermediate credit card interchange given the importance of trust, fraud protection, credit extension, and rewards.\"\n\nSector thesis: \"Complex commercial insurance requires expertise, market access, and regulatory oversight that AI cannot replace. Adoption improves underwriting speed, claims handling, and expense ratios, lifting margins for brokers and carriers.\"\n\nSector thesis: \"Agentic commerce increases personalization, conversion, and online wallet share, expanding e‑commerce and digital advertising. Platforms with scale, logistics, and data are positioned to capture incremental demand.\"\n\nSector thesis: \"We see the payments ecosystem as a net beneficiary of AI and agentic commerce, with rising demand for value‑added services such as fraud detection as AI‑driven transactions proliferate. Network moats around cost, speed, reliability, trust, and legality remain strong, though fast‑growing agentic payment schemes bear watching over time.\"\n\nSector thesis: \"AI risk is largely second‑order through tenant demand, while adoption drives material labor productivity gains. Complex, bespoke transactions favor augmentation over replacement, supporting incumbents.\"\n\nSector thesis: \"AI expands enterprise software's addressable market by automating unstructured work rather than replacing applications. Incumbents with distribution, data, and workflow control are positioned to capture monetization as adoption deepens.\"\n\nSector thesis: \"AI improves routing, pricing, maintenance, and asset utilization across freight networks. Durable benefits accrue to asset‑heavy operators while the disruption risk is concentrated in asset‑light intermediaries rather than the industry overall.\"",

Ellison said the technology is getting better with every interaction.\n\n\"It helps our associates do the most difficult part of transition to a home improvement world, and that is product knowledge,\" Ellison said.\n\nHe said that new hires sometimes lack the confidence to be out on the sales floor selling specialized products to the chain's combination of DIY and professional customers, and the Mylow assistant fills that knowledge gap.\n\n\"Not only does this platform and this assistant allow that to happen, it also now can do it in Spanish,\" Ellison said.\n\nHe said that's led to \"dramatic improvements\" in customer service, including helping \"break the language gap\" in some geographic areas and a two percentage-point lift in in-store satisfaction scores.\n\nOnline, Ellison said Lowe's is seeing conversion rates double when customers use Mylow's AI shopping assistant, which rolled out in March 2025.\n\nOther retailers, most notably Walmart and Amazon, have reported e-commerce bumps they attribute to AI shopping assistants: Walmart said last week its Sparky chatbot results in 35% larger basket sizes online, and Amazon has said it anticipates its Rufus bot to boost sales by $10 billion a year.\n\nBetter sales and customer service are critical at a time when the home improvement retail segment is now in its third year of challenging macroeconomic conditions marked by high borrowing costs and low housing turnover.\n\nStill, Lowe's managed to outperform rival Home Depot in comparable sales growth for the fourth quarter.\n\nLowe's corporate employees are using AI tools in other ways, Ellison said. The tools are freeing up merchandising teams to shift their focus from routine tasks to more strategic problems, and tech workers are using AI to develop and review code, achieving double-digit gains in productivity.\n\n\"We're excited about some of the work we're doing in agentic commerce with some of the leading tech platforms out there as well,\" he said. \"It's something as a large company that we understand is critically important to our current state and our future, and we're embracing it.\"",

    "description": "AI-driven disruption, particularly in sectors like software, is increasingly being flagged as a risk.",
    "fullText": "It's not usually a good sign when a research firm issues a worst-case-scenario forecast. It's even more troubling when that firm adjusts its outlook to be more bearish just two weeks later.\n\nWell, that's exactly what the credit-strategy team at UBS just did. The strategists initially laid out a tail-risk scenario in early February, which included a potential spike in private credit defaults. Then, this week, the firm checked back in to make that forecast more negative.\n\nAs with most market disruptions these days, the source can be traced back to the rapid rise of AI. In recent weeks, software has emerged as a particularly vulnerable area, and stock prices sector-wide have paid the price. Those struggles have also thrust a light onto the direct lenders that finance them.\n\nA recent analysis from Bloomberg estimated that 40% of all PE-backed loans are tied up in the software industry. That's a huge percentage, and surely informs UBS's increasingly bearish view on private credit.\n\nUnder the firm's worst-case outcome, stress within private credit would then spread to other areas of the bond market, since there's so much overlap amongst borrowers and lenders. And any rise in private defaults would then affect public markets and potentially sap them of liquidity.\n\nThe situation \"raises concerns about capital adequacy and loss absorption in a downturn, particularly if defaults spike and valuations collapse,\" UBS said.\n\nGot all that? I swear it's not intended to scare you. It's just that warnings like UBS's are becoming more commonplace.\n\nThe most recent flare-up came last week, when alternative asset manager Blue Owl said it would restrict withdrawals from one of its private credit funds geared towards retail investors. Former Pimco CEO Mohamed El-Erian called it a potential \"canary-in-the-coal-mine\" moment, and said it reminded him of the period right before the financial crisis.\n\nBut the potential downside of private credit really burst into the financial mainstream last September, with the bankruptcy of automotive-parts producer First Brands. An autopsy of the company's shoddy finances shined a light on the diligence — or lack thereof — going on in private lending. Industry leaders assured everyone the exposure was limited. But private credit's public image took a hit.\n\nAs these risks become more well-recognized, the expansion of private credit is not slowing down. More firms are offering access. More retail investors are getting interested. It may even wind up in your 401(k).\n\nIt could work out that heightened recognition of private-credit risk heads off more serious blow-ups down the road. It can only help that lenders are under pressure to tighten underwriting standards. The real question is how much toxic debt is already out there.\n\nIf the answer turns out to be \"too much,\" please refer to the UBS scenario referenced above (and say a prayer for my portfolio).",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Justin Parnell, 39, an AI consultant based in San Francisco. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs an AI consultant, I automate cumbersome parts of my workflow to save me hours and make me far more efficient.\n\nThrough my business, Justin GPT, I build custom AI agents for clients who want to do the same.\n\nI advise every client to follow these five simple steps for using AI agents to lighten their workload. (My advice is model-agnostic. It doesn't matter whether you use ChatGPT, Gemini, or CoPilot).\n\nKeep in mind what AI actually does as you think about the job you're trying to get done. If you understand AI's data, objectives, and constraints, you understand how it works.\n\nAI aligns the context you give it with the information it has been trained on for next-token prediction.\n\nInstead of viewing AI agents as autonomous digital workers, break it down. First principles thinking says: \"An AI agent is simply a model that receives input, follows defined goals and rules, makes step-by-step decisions, and uses tools to take actions.\"\n\nSeparate the task into the smaller steps you perform within it, then ask yourself whether AI can handle them. If the answer is yes, consider how valuable it would be to have an AI agent take over those tasks.\n\nFor example, if it's admin work, ask questions like: what steps are involved in the new client intake process? What goes into building a proposal? What steps are required to send a contract for signature and officially onboard a new client?\n\nBreaking those processes into atomic parts might involve, for example, logging into your accounting software, adding a new client, and sending an invoice.\n\nAsk yourself: is this task high or low impact? High or low effort?\n\nPrioritize high-impact, low-effort tasks, then high-impact, high-effort tasks, followed by low-impact, low-effort tasks. Low-impact, high-effort is the lowest priority.\n\nAs you tick those tasks off in order of prioritization, your workflow quickly becomes AI-empowered.\n\nThere will always be points in the workflow where a human needs to step in. Before an invoice is sent, I review it. Before a proposal is approved, I get a Slack notification to check it to see if it needs editing.\n\nDesign yourself into the workflow to make sure AI hasn't done anything you wouldn't do.\n\nExplaining to AI that it has made a mistake and how not to repeat the error helps it improve.\n\nI recommend building this step into any end-to-end workflow.\n\nOnce you've completed the first four steps, you are ready to start integrating AI agents into your workflow.\n\nYou're off to the races, and you can start building and seeing real efficiency gains.",

    "description": "Anthropic is at risk of getting blacklisted by the US government on Friday unless it agrees to terms established by the Defense Department.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic is fast-approaching uncharted waters with the US government over military use of its frontier AI model, Claude.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei talked with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a meeting that a source familiar with the matter told Business Insider was friendly and respectful.\n\nThe meeting, however, ended with a warning to Anthropic: Get on board with the military or risk getting what amounts to a blacklisting by the US government.\n\nA senior Pentagon official told Business Insider that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday to agree to the Defense Department's terms; otherwise, it will find other levers to compel the AI startup to cooperate with the military.\n\nThe official said Hegseth is prepared for the use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) — a decades-old wartime law that gives the president broad authority over private companies in the interest of national security — on top of designating Anthropic a supply chain risk.\n\nThe exact terms the military is demanding of Anthropic are unclear, but the warnings against a US company over broad access to a frontier model represent novel uses of national emergency authorities against a novel technology, experts told Business Insider.\n\n\"We're absolutely in uncharted territory,\" Dean Ball, an ex-senior policy advisor for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and fellow for the Foundation for American Innovation, told Business Insider.\n\nLast July, Anthropic, an AI startup backed by Amazon and Google, was awarded a contract with a $200 million ceiling from the Department of Defense to develop \"frontier AI capabilities.\" The goal was to \"address critical national security challenges in across warfighting and enterprise domains,\" the department said.\n\nAnthropic was the only AI company at the time to be cleared to operate models in classified settings. Grok, which is developed by Elon Musk's xAI, received a similar approval earlier this week, and others are close to getting on board, a senior Pentagon official confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nIn January, months after Anthropic received the contract, the defense secretary delivered a speech during his visit to Musk's SpaceX. Hegseth framed AI innovation as a \"wartime arms race\" and called for the accelerated deployment of frontier models for the military.\n\nThe speech even took an ideological bent. The defense secretary railed against \"woke\" AI, DEI initiatives, and said the \"days of equitable AI\" are gone.\n\n\"We will not employ AI models that won't allow you to fight wars,\" Hegseth added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amodei met with the defense secretary at the Pentagon, during which the CEO showed \"appreciation\" for the DOD's service and \"thanked\" Hegseth, an Anthropic spokesperson said.\n\nAnother subject they broached was around Anthropic's red lines: autonomous weapons and mass surveillance of domestic citizens, according to the source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe senior Pentagon official told Business Insider that the standstill with Anthropic had nothing to do with the startup's redlines. There's also no public evidence to suggest the DOD had some ideological or political issue with Anthropic.\n\nHowever, despite the cordial meeting, Amodei was left with an ultimatum — one that Ball said could send \"awful signals\" to US entrepreneurs and could be \"existential\" for Anthropic.\n\nThe AI startup, this week, released an update to its internal safety framework that draws a clearer line between the safeguards it commits to and the \"more ambitious industry-wide standards,\" stating that it supports the latter but can't follow them \"unilaterally\" because of competition.\n\nA spokesperson for Anthropic said the framework update was unrelated to the situation with the Defense Department.\n\nBall, who helped draft the Trump administration's \"AI Action Plan,\" told Business Insider that the Defense Department is using the DPA and the supply chain risk label in fairly unprecedented ways.\n\nThe DPA was established during the Korean War to give the executive branch broad authority over how to invest and spend resources, particularly to ramp up physical production in factories.\n\nThe law was used on American companies many times, Ball said, but more frequently to invest in firms to help expand production. The Defense Department is instead proposing to use Title I of the act, which allows the government to tell companies how to deploy their economic resources, in order to compel a company to agree to its terms.\n\n\"I'm not aware of this ever having been used as a weapon in a negotiating posture,\" Ball said.\n\nDeirdre Mulligan, faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology, told Business Insider that the DPA was designed to be used as a last-resort tool when no other alternatives exist.\n\n\"This is a pretty extraordinary use or potential use of the DPA,\" she said.\n\nThe supply chain risk designation is also novel since it's often applied to foreign or foreign-linked firms — not US companies. A notable example is Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant, in 2019. Within a month of the blacklisting, major companies like Google and Qualcomm severed business ties with Huawei.\n\n\"What are the stakes for Anthropic? I mean, Anthropic could be quasi-nationalized, or they could be driven out of business,\" Ball said. \"The stakes are huge for them.\"\n\nThe downside for the Defense Department is smaller — the agency could simply walk away and turn to another AI company — but the move against Anthropic could send a chilling message to other US entrepreneurs, Ball said.\n\n\"This is sending a message to firms that doing business with the United States government is extremely dangerous,\" he said. \"It's a huge risk.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Workers worried about layoffs and the impact of AI might be tempted to engage in productivity theater, such as sending early-morning emails.",
    "fullText": "When Taylor Goucher was in the military, he used to joke with colleagues about a lieutenant colonel who would scan the parking lot at the end of the day to see whose cars were still there.\n\nIf he saw yours there, he considered you to be working hard.\n\nYears later, Goucher sees a corporate version of the same phenomenon playing out. This time, the displays of effort might be the number of early-morning emails a worker sends or the number of meetings they attend.\n\nProductivity theater — the act of demonstrating busyness as a way to look good — has always existed. Yet rolling layoffs, a stubbornly tight job market, and intensifying fears about AI displacing workers are pushing some workers to be more conspicuous in how they go about their 9-to-5.\n\nWorries about AI and tools that track workers' output have \"amplified the pressure on people to look more productive,\" Goucher, VP of sales and marketing at Connext Global, an offshoring firm, told Business Insider.\n\nJoe Fontana, a sales consultant on Long Island, sees a similar pattern. In sales teams that adopt task-automation tools, workers can send more emails and conduct faster research on prospective clients. That might mean sending 500 messages to 50,000 people in three minutes, he said.\n\n\"You showed me how busy you can be,\" Fontana told Business Insider. Yet, he said, those auto-generated messages —\"longer than three books of the Bible\" — might not actually drive sales.\n\nSimply going faster or checking more items off a list doesn't necessarily mean sales reps are having substantive conversations with would-be customers.\n\n\"They're just showing that they're going through the motions,\" Fontana said.\n\nTeams that focus too much on metrics tied to volume aren't necessarily identifying real decision-makers, understanding what's keeping them up at night, and how a product might help, he said.\n\nNevertheless, Fontana said, high-volume work can dupe bosses.\n\n\"'Billy makes 100 dials a day. Billy does 50 emails a day. Billy does two hours in Slack, an hour in LinkedIn. Look how busy he is. The numbers will come,'\" he said. \"The numbers never come.\"\n\nGoucher has also seen engine-revving on his team that's not as productive as it might appear.\n\nOne worker proposed goals centered on demonstrable output: Send 1,000 targeted messages to this demographic, sign up 100 people for a newsletter, and attend a certain number of conferences.\n\nThe worker's activity level was high, yet her commissions and results lagged, Goucher said.\n\n\"She felt like she was being very productive, but she wasn't seeing the outcome,\" he said.\n\nGoucher redirected her to focus more on quantitative goals that would ultimately benefit the company, such as generating three new customers through an email campaign. The worker reported feeling more focused and aligned, Goucher said.\n\n\"It's really hard to get into the outcome mindset as opposed to the activity mindset,\" he said. \"That's something we've had to work with our team on quite a bit.\"\n\nWorkers' desires to show they're cranking on the job come as layoffs have become routine in some industries, including tech, where some companies hired many more workers during the pandemic.\n\nThat lingering fear can hurt morale and, while some workers might disengage, others could push harder, at least for a time. Layoff survivors who lock in can experience burnout and engage in presenteeism — the tendency to show up, log on, or overextend when they're sick or not operating at 100%.\n\nIn a climate where worries about layoffs and AI feel ever-present, visibility can become a survival strategy. As more companies settle into being in the office full time or part of the time, fully remote workers might especially feel pressure to show they're hustling.\n\nAmanda Augustine, a career coach at TopResume, said that fears about layoffs and AI's reach aren't new, yet they've grown more intense among her clients in the last six months, she said.\n\n\"I hear it every single day — and at all levels,\" Augustine told Business Insider.\n\nIn 2025, US layoffs rose to the highest level since 2020, at the start of the pandemic. While headlines about cuts no longer tend to shock people, she said, they still take a toll.\n\n\"It's wearing people down,\" Augustine said. \"Hence the job-hugging; hence the task-masking; the productivity theater.\"\n\nAugustine said that the normalization of layoffs has left some workers feeling psychologically depleted and raised questions that hover over workdays: How secure is this company? How stable is my role?\n\nGoucher, from Connext Global, said he's felt pressure over the years to demonstrate productivity, yet he's tried to remind himself to focus on results rather than just activity or the length of his workday.\n\n\"I was not one to leave my car in the parking lot,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about productivity theater or pressure to perform at work?

    "fullText": "Jack Clark, Anthropic's head of policy, says he spends his days thinking about AI guardrails.\n\nAt home, he says he's building guardrails, too — for his own kids.\n\nDuring an interview with \"The Ezra Klein Show,\" Clark said he limits how much technology his toddler uses and is uneasy about algorithmic exposure for his children.\n\n\"I have the classic Californian technology executive view of not having that much technology around for children,\" Clark, who recently returned from parental leave and has a newborn at home, said. \"I think finding a way to budget your child's time with technology has always been the work of parents and will continue to be.\"\n\nHe said technology is becoming more \"ubiquitous,\" making it \"hard to escape\" for parents.\n\nAt home, Clark said his toddler can watch \"Bluey\" and a few other shows on their smart TV, but he hasn't allowed \"unfettered access to the YouTube algorithm.\"\n\nClark's approach echoes other tech leaders who limit their kids' screen time.\n\nIn 2025, Miranda Kerr said she and her husband, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, didn't allow her then-14-year-old son to have phones or computers in his bedroom after 9:30 pm. In 2024, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel said he limits his children's screen time to 90 minutes a week. Apple's cofounder Steve Jobs famously told the New York Times in 2010 that his kids hadn't used an iPad.\n\n\"We limit how much technology our kids use at home,\" Jobs said.\n\nClark says his parenting model is partially based on how he grew up. His father, who had a computer at his office, would let Clark use the machine — but would step in when screen time got excessive.\n\n\"My dad would let me play on the computer, and at some point he'd say: Jack, you've had enough computers today. You're getting weird,\" he said.\n\nAI systems will need stronger parental controls, Clark said. Those guardrails, he said, will take on increased importance in the AI race — especially as children try to access systems intended for adults.\n\n\"So we're going to need to build pretty heavy parental controls into this system,\" he said. \"We serve ages 18 and up today, but obviously, kids are smart, and they're going to try to get onto this stuff.\"\n\nClark and Anthropic didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. When reached for comment, a YouTube spokesperson pointed Business Insider to a guide on the platform's website about age-appropriate experiences and parental controls.",

    "fullText": "Some say the technology is devaluing their work, while others reckon it is not yet – and might never be – good enough to replace them entirely\n\nWorkers grappling with the rapid growth of artificial intelligence have said they feel “devalued” by the technology and warned of a downward trajectory in the quality of work.\n\nRecent analysis by the International Monetary Fund found AI would affect about 40% of jobs around the world. Its head, Kristalina Georgieva, has said: “This is like a tsunami hitting the labour market.”\n\nWorkers who have trained AI models to replace some or all of their roles tell the Guardian about their experiences.\n\n‘I now earn less while working longer correcting the mistakes of AI editors’\n\nChristie* edits papers for academics for whom English is a second language. She was asked to take part in a project to train new “assistant editors”, unaware that it was an AI programme that would lead to her being paid less.\n\n“There was a huge shortage of qualified editors, so I assumed they were training up more [people] to take some of the load,” says Christie, 55, who lives in the UK. “Then they got me to correct the mistakes of these assistant editors. But the new editors were making strange mistakes, like inserting unnecessary full stops or changing the names of countries to nonsense.”\n\nChristie says she “meticulously and respectfully pointed out these errors”.\n\nHowever, the errors kept happening and “sometimes they got worse”. Then, a few months later, she found out who “the editors” were.\n\n“In a newsletter, the company admitted that these assistant editors were actually an AI,” says Christie. “Going forward, all jobs would be pre-edited by it, and our fee would be reduced, so I now earn less money for correcting the mistakes of an AI, which takes me longer than editing from scratch.\n\n“There is this groupthink in the company that they must implement AI.”\n\nChristie says she feels “devalued, betrayed, and furious at this company”.\n\n“I prioritise work from any other sources, but I am trapped in this toxic cycle, as they have the highest volume of work, and I still need to eat and pay rent. But a lot of people have quit,” she adds.\n\n‘AI struggled with patients’ pronunciation’\n\nMark Taubert, a palliative care consultant and professor, said he was excited to work on a pilot chatbot project to explore how technology could help patients navigate the complexities of metastatic cancer and palliative care.\n\nTaubert, 51, who works at Velindre University NHS trust in Cardiff, was recorded over “several hours” for the chatbot and fed the computer with guidelines that would typically inform how he talks to patients.\n\n“We asked patients to write down all their questions, and added patient information leaflets that we had previously written and agreed on,” he says. “We also considered questions I might get from my palliative care community of outpatients and inpatients, such as, ‘Can I drink alcohol when I am taking morphine?’”\n\nThe chatbot was mostly aimed at home patients who might have a question, for example about their medication, out of hours.\n\nTaubert says the chatbot got about “50% spot on, in a way similar to how I might have responded”, but it struggled with the vagaries of human pronunciation and human error.\n\n“Patients don’t always use perfect English and sometimes use incorrect names for medications, for instance, they may say ‘morphium’, instead of morphine,” he says. “People also structured their questions quite differently. We saw a need for the technology to learn about human misspellings, dialects, jargon, variations and accents.\n\n“Subsequent adaptations made the system safer, but we also had to consider how the machine would respond if a patient typed in a more troubling question, for instance, how to end their own life.”\n\nThe chatbot, called Rita, was used for a time “with a lot of caveats and warnings around it” before funding ended, says Taubert.\n\n“We would say: ‘Give this a try if you want to,’ but we also put in links to the hospital information leaflets on each area,” he adds.\n\nWhile Taubert is open to “embracing new technologies”, he does not feel his role is threatened by AI.\n\n“A lot of what we do relies on nuances of language, body language and facial expression and being in the room,” he says. “In the coming months or years, perhaps my working week can be enhanced by such systems by taking away the very administrative duties and letting me actually speak to the patient more.”\n\n‘The overall effect is a decline in quality’\n\nPhilip*, 45, was required to train AI-based translation engines that his supervisors “want to replace us with because they’ll cost less”, but says that even after four years they are still unreliable.\n\n“At first, the results were inevitably laughable,” he says. “But they have improved as we have corrected the programs. However, even after years of this, besides tending to produce formulaic results, they are still unreliable and inadequately accurate, so we still need to review each AI-generated translation word by word and correct as necessary.”\n\nPhilip, who lives in New Jersey, says in his experience, “it doesn’t save time over directly translating the material myself. I think the overall effect is a decline in quality.“If you need a translation that is just a rough idea of what is being said, then generally AI is OK. But it is not always reliable, and that’s the problem, because part of the time you will still run into things that are just completely wrong.”\n\nHe says the moment when he will no longer be needed in his current role “has been looming over our heads for years now, but we’re not there yet”.\n\n‘Training your robot replacement feels like digging your own digital grave’\n\nJoe*, 50, an award-winning marketing writer and content manager, says the company where he worked began exploring AI as a productivity tool at the start of 2024, but he was assured his job was safe.\n\n“I should have seen the writing on the wall when they had me spend the first six months of 2025 building our extensive ‘AI process workflows’ and ‘best practices documentation’. In my naivety, I thought that I would be administering this system and would be asked to oversee these processes.”\n\nHowever, in August 2025, two weeks after he handed in his best practices documentation, Joe was laid off.\n\n“At my exit interview, I was told it had absolutely nothing to do with my work or performance; they blamed ‘market conditions’, and some of that was no doubt true, but the timing of it was certainly suspicious,” says Joe, who lives in Milwaukee. “Working for this company and being asked to do this – training your robot replacement – feels like digging your own digital grave.”\n\nJoe has been told that much of his former workload has been delegated to junior employees.\n\n“They are following my AI documentation to just enter prompts into AI clients in order to produce the work I used to do,” he says.\n\nJoe is now considering a career pivot into sales, but says it has not been easy.\n\n“I wouldn’t necessarily say that AI 100% forced me out of my career path, but at 50 and with the threat of AI looming constantly, I am thinking to myself, I could line up another writing job, but then am I looking at another layoff at 55?”\n\n‘Work will look completely different in 10 years’ time, perhaps even less’\n\nFilippo, 44, an associate professor in mathematics, has been collaborating with two startups on AI projects.\n\nThey are developing models to reason about mathematics and prove theorems with very little human input, and to verify the input using the proof assistant software Lean.\n\n“It’s been three months, and while the results are still somewhat limited, it is clear that these tools are getting stronger and more efficient by the day,” says Filippo, who lives and works in France. “With most of my colleagues experimenting with this AI technology, we are convinced that a mathematician’s work will look completely different in 10 years’ time, or perhaps even less.\n\n“AI will be able to replace us in mundane tasks that occupy a large amount of our time, like proving small ancillary results needed for our larger goals. Whether mathematicians will still be needed to prove these larger ones is debatable.”\n\nFilippo, who works for a university, says he does not feel his role will become obsolete in the immediate future.\n\n“Given that I work for a public institution, that I spend a significant amount of my time teaching and that these AI tools aren’t yet at a professional research level, I do not feel any pressure or concern for my job,” he says. “But I would have a completely different view if I were 25 and had just completed my PhD.”",
