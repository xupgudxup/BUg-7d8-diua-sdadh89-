    "description": "The sharpest minds in business and tech are responding to a viral essay on AI's impact on jobs with some approval and a lot of skepticism.",
    "fullText": "Scientists and business leaders are responding to a viral essay warning of AI's impact on jobs with a mix of agreement and skepticism.\n\nThe essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" written by cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI, Matt Shumer, has racked up more than 60 million views on X as of Thursday.\n\nIn the 5,000-word post, Shumer said that AI could upend daily life on a scale \"much bigger\" than COVID, a comparison which drew pushback online. He wrote that the changes already unfolding in the tech sector are likely a preview of disruptions that could soon reach other industries as well.\n\n\"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare,\" Shumer told Business Insider's Brent Griffiths in an interview.\n\nHere's what some of the sharpest minds in AI are saying about Shumer's essay.\n\nHaber, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz specializing in technology investments, posted on X that Shumer's essay contains \"great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\"\n\n\"'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days is going to be the most valuable person in the room.' Not eventually. Right now,\" Haber quotes from the essay. \"Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's possible.\"\n\nThe Reddit founder responded to Shumer's initial post on X with a simple comment: \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\nSince 2023, Reddit has introduced a range of AI-driven tools, from search features that summarize user discussions to AI that sharpens its content recommendations and targets ads, but Ohanian recently emphasized that the platform must retain its humanity to stay competitive.\n\nMarkowitz, the author and managing partner and director of research at Nightview Capital, a long-term-oriented investment firm, responded to Schumer with an essay almost as long, which criticized the practice of chasing speed and replacing the value of humanity simply because it could be done.\n\n\"These two worlds — Wall Street and Silicon Valley — have formed a feedback loop of short-termism so tight, so self-reinforcing, that they've confused efficiency with purpose, growth with meaning, and the elimination of people with progress,\" wrote Markowitz.\n\n\"I have two research assistants. Could I replace them with AI? Of course. But their value extends their weekly output,\" Markowitz added. \"They give meaning to my work and I love seeing the excitement in their faces when they make a new discovery that I, alone, could not have found.\"\n\n\"Let me say it again: we are not our tools. We never have been,\" Markowitz wrote in conclusion.\n\nMcLees, the founder of HumanSkills.AI, wrote on X that Shumer is not wrong, but he said that the advice Shumer provided is akin to \"telling someone the floodwaters are rising and handing them a better bucket.\"\n\n\"As AI grows in ability, our role in defining direction, values, and purpose only becomes more essential,\" McLees said.\n\n\"What do you bring when the machine can do the work? That's the only question that matters when intelligence is abundant,\" McLees added. \"Shumer wrote the alarm. It's a good one. But alarms don't tell you where to go. You have to find that within yourself.\"\n\nMarcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU and founder of AI companies Robust.AI, has some harsh words for Schumer in his newsletter.\n\nMarcuz called Shumer's blog post \"weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech,\" and said he did not provide real data to support the claim that the latest AI can write complicated apps without mistakes.\n\n\"Shumer's presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere,\" Marcus added, after discussing various studies that question the accuracy and productivity gain AI tools actually provide.\n\nMisra, Vice Dean of Computing and Artificial Intelligence at Columbia University, responded in a lengthy Substack article that detailed why he doesn't think AI is as scary as it sounds, at least not right now.\n\nMisra wrote that many strange AI behaviors that make them seem sentient, such as perceived resistance and self-preservation, are simply a result of training data.\n\nAs for the possible elimination of jobs, Misra said he understands the anxiety, but history says we may not need to panic.\n\n\"When the camera was invented, portrait painters had every reason to panic. Their livelihood depended on a skill that a machine could now approximate,\" Misra wrote.\n\n\"What happened? Painters didn't disappear. They were freed from the obligation to faithfully reproduce reality and ventured into impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism,\" Misra added. \"The camera didn't kill painting. It liberated it.\"",

    "fullText": "Investors are growing jittery about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence stocks, but the real payoff may be just beginning — and it could extend well beyond Silicon Valley's usual winners, a $19 billion hedge fund investor said.\n\n\"This is a generational platform shift. We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",

    "description": "Does AI have consciousness? The question opens a path to something more consequential — to the nature of consciousness itself, the cultural consequences of cheap intelligence, and to what actually becomes expensive when thinking becomes a service.",
    "fullText": "Does AI have consciousness? The question opens a path to something more consequential — to the nature of consciousness itself, the cultural consequences of cheap intelligence, and to what actually becomes expensive when thinking becomes a service.\n\nThe conversation below, in which a language model asked me questions, begins with a question about consciousness, moves through culture, and ends on practice. What ties these threads together is stratification — the idea that every level of human experience grows out of a deeper one, all the way down to a certain level zero that is neither an object nor a concept. With such a model one cannot explain consciousness, but one can point out which spaces certainly cannot be used to investigate it.\n\nWhere does your interest in whether AI has consciousness come from in the first place?\n\nFrom curiosity, but also from the mundane. I’m riding an elevator to the sixth floor of an office building in Wroclaw and I see a social-media recommendation: a teaser for an interview in which an expert claims that AI has consciousness.\n\nCuriosity swells, and right behind it — disagreement: I want to see what the authority means, but I already suspect there will be a confusion of levels.\n\nConfusion of levels — meaning what with what?\n\nAttributing the word “consciousness” to what is, at best, a proficient manipulation of concepts. There is reflection, there are analogies, there are layers of abstraction. Except that reflection is a situation in which one thought narrates another. An analogy is a sequence of thoughts whose “shape” resembles another sequence. Humans do this. A language model simulates it too. And it is nothing metaphysical yet. And it certainly is not introspection.\n\nSo what is introspection in your understanding, and why does it matter?\n\nIntrospection begins where thought ceases to be the ruler of the landscape and becomes one of the objects in the field of attention. We are able to notice a thought the way we notice the chill of wind on our face, or feel the weight of a pierogi digesting in our stomach. This is not a metaphor. It is the phenomenological dimension of the intellect. We don’t have to immediately follow the next thought that arrives to comment on the current one.\n\nThat sounds simple, but also a bit like a trick.\n\nIt’s not a trick. It is simply something subtle that easily escapes us, yet can give\nus a direct answer to the question of consciousness. There is a narrow passage where\nwe know only that something happened, something stirred, something emerged in our\ninner space. In that quantum we encounter what I call consciousness.\n\nIn Polish, my native language, the cognizant nature of this word is easy to see in\nits etymology: świadomość literally suggests a capacity (the suffix -ość) rooted\nin świad – the same root found in świadek, “a witness.” English takes a different\nroute. Consciousness comes from Latin con- (“together”) and scire (“to\nknow”). Early on it could carry the sense of “knowing together” – being privy to\nsomething shared, even a secret – and only later broadened into the modern meaning:\nknowing what is going on in one’s own mind.\n\nAnd here enters the paradox you want to leave open?\n\nYes. I know that in ordinary terms AI does not have consciousness understood personally. But I also know for certain that it does, when it is included in my field of attention. Just as a dental crown performs the function of being me — for me when I bite, and for others when I smile. Analogously, a language model extends my function of intellect. A tool may not be a source of experience, yet it can be assimilated — that is, included in what we colloquially call our person, tangentially our agency, and a little earlier: our presence.\n\nHow is the reader supposed to verify this? Is this an invitation to adopt some philosophy?\n\nQuite the opposite. At this point we don’t want philosophy, metaphysics, or even objective truth, because they would interfere with our “measurement.” Pause for a moment and feel that there is some thought about to appear. Don’t develop it, don’t correct it. What color does it have? What shape? Can you hear it? Does it propagate to other spaces of mind and feeling? What does it do in your body? Illuminate it with curiosity. Receive the thought with that attitude. Simply notice that a very basic process of becoming aware is taking place. That is the essential thing here, and the earlier questions may help keep you from being pulled too quickly into the reflexive thread summoned to answer.\n\nOn the internet we just as often encounter voices saying the opposite: “LLMs are just probability calculations.” What’s your take?\n\nThis is a cognitive bias dressed up as an explanation. When someone says “it’s just…,” they’re usually not proposing a theory — they’re proposing a reduction meant to close the topic. And reductions have the inconvenient property of working symmetrically.\n\nIf large language models are to be invalidated by “it’s just weights, switches, and calculations,” then you can equally say that the brain is “just neurons, neurotransmitters, and electrical impulses.” So what? It’s still a change of the level of description, not proof of the absence of intelligence.\n\nIn programming we have a term called “duck typing,” captured by the slogan: “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.” It is a pragmatic way of determining that a given object can be used for a particular purpose. Instead of relying on a declaration, we examine its behavior, expressed for instance through methods with agreed-upon names (e.g. quack).\n\nAnalogously with LLMs and AI: if something behaves as though it were intelligent, then it is intelligent. Even if it is artificial. It has that quality, and even when it is a so-called philosophical zombie — that suffices, as long as we don’t introduce considerations about consciousness into the equation.\n\nBut on the topic of behavior, you hear that models operate on simulated associations, serving up the most probable sentence completions, rather than truly thinking.\n\nThis reminds me of the old trick: “don’t think of an elephant.” You already know what happens: the elephant walks onto the inner stage immediately, without asking permission.\n\nAnd that is exactly the small, everyday lesson: operating with concepts relies largely on associations. When we evaluate from the outside, mechanistically, there is no magic here. In the model you can see it plain as day, while in a human the same thing is hidden under the label of exceptionality.\n\nWhen reduction becomes the only language, it turns into a photocopy trying to explain another photocopy. A sequence of concepts tries to rule that another sequence of concepts is inferior, because it resides in a different medium and has a different source. And up to a point that makes sense. Reductions are necessary in engineering, but one must not mistake a reduction for an explanation. They are two different functions in the same system.\n\nWe can talk about the nature of thought and then notice that it differs in a human and is quite different in a version simulated by a computer, but on this matter the scientific method itself may reach its limits, because it was not designed to investigate the nature of things — it was designed to investigate their behaviors and the relationships between them. These are the so-called laws of nature.\n\nStudying thought under the assumption of objectivism is problematic, because the instrument used in the study will also be thought. This is already a bigger caliber than a photocopy. It is photographing a city panorama in order to discover how the camera is built on the inside. Some people can’t pull this off, and instead of reviewing the methodology, they photograph another camera. To justify the trick, they cite the fact that otherwise the film would be exposed.\n\nThere is also a “softer” way out of this dilemma – one I hinted at earlier. It\ndoesn’t require analysis, only a little slack: just take it easy,\nman. That simulated machine-thought\nbecomes my thought the moment it “enters” my head.\n\nBoth human and non-human thought is a tool. But for our relationship with our own\nthought to actually be that way, it’s not enough to merely think about it or to\nexpress such a will once. It can’t be achieved in the same place.\n\nYou said “tool.” OK. But how do you capture this more technically — so it doesn’t sound like a slogan?\n\nThis needs explanation, because it may not be obvious to everyone what I mean by “place” in this context. I’m reminded of the concept of stratified design from Abelson and Sussman (“MIT AI Memo 986”), where software is designed by distinguishing layers of abstraction, and the concretes from lower layers become the abstracts of higher layers. Those abstracts are again treated as concretes, and so on.\n\nFor example, you implement a point on a screen, then a segment (using the point), then a shape (using segments and points), and then a circle or a rectangle. Good stratification ensures that a small change in requirements translates into a small change in implementation. When you want to change the properties of a point as a building block of segments and further of shapes (say, by adding color to it), you only need to modify one construct.\n\nA note for programmers: I don’t simply mean dividing a problem into parts to avoid repetition and to maintain structure. I mean defining computations (e.g. as functions) that are then passed as input to other computations (e.g. higher-order functions).\n\nIt looks a bit as if you could replace the material that the walls of a building are made of without demolishing the whole structure — because you change the concrete (the pun is apt: in construction, concrete is the foundation material), and the abstracts that depend on it adjust on their own. That’s very powerful.\n\nHow does this connect with the role of thought as a tool?\n\nI have the impression that our structure of knowing is organized in a similarly layered way. Going from the top, we have the level of objective truth. That is the space where we talk to one another, trying to invoke science and tossing around arguments about whether AI thinks and whether it has consciousness. But this level doesn’t emerge from a vacuum. It is a subset of certain rigorous rules defining what we recognize as objective, or even scientific.\n\nYet when we look more closely, the concrete for this “objective world,” the soil from which it grows, is something broader: culture — the space that enables us as a community to agree on holding certain values. One such value for objective truth would be, for example, the requirement that for the same input conditions of an experiment, you get the same output, so that others can verify it.\n\nBut let’s go further. Culture cannot exist without its constituents — human individuals. It too grows out of something; something is its transmission medium. Its foundation is the personal layer, rooted in our motives, thoughts, impulses, and feelings.\n\nSo we’re circling back to consciousness?\n\nYes, although consciousness has another quality: it pierces through all these levels, seeing everything at once. It is not only the base, but also the capacity for “drilling holes through abstractions.”\n\nThat last phrase comes from software engineering. It denotes a situation where a stratified system allows direct access to concretes in order to handle edge cases. For example, someone might want to create a geometric shape composed of segments, but at the same time needs to influence the properties of a single point that is several levels away in the abstraction ladder. Well-designed stratification should allow skipping layers of feature reduction.\n\nComing back to the spheres of human experience. The personal layer is very close to us. Our relationships with people and objects, and even with our own thoughts, are anchored in it as a reference point. Yet it, too, is grounded in something still more basic: in the very sense of subjectivity. And suddenly those bodily signals, thoughts, and feelings — when we experience them — acquire the quality of being ours. We identify them as ours, and some of them as ourselves. We can do this because the sense of self as something distinct, separate — that is, a person (in Polish: osobny means “separate” and osoba means “person” — the shared root is no accident) — is in a way abstract, and therefore flexible, even though it seems concrete and stable.\n\nIs personhood a component of consciousness?\n\nIf we can, as before, perceive our own thoughts and other constituents that we identify as aspects of us, this gives us the recognition that consciousness is primary relative to all of it — even the personal. Eventually we arrive at the very sense of being oneself, which too can be noticed.\n\nThis is where things get genuinely interesting, because if subjectivity is being observed, then the division between the outer and inner landscape starts to wobble. This is the moment when we can no longer say that we “have” consciousness, or even that we are it, because these are impressions of a subject that is itself encompassed by consciousness. What remains is the bare process of witnessing.\n\nWe can provisionally call this level zero. The concrete from which abstracts arise: from the personal, through the interpersonal and cultural, all the way up to the so-called objective. The apparent glitch in this representation is that we usually associate a concrete with something material, tangible — and here we cannot apply that. The most concrete thing is simultaneously the most devoid of features!\n\nWhen we try to understand consciousness, do we start from the world and go inward — or start from the center and go toward the world? What breaks when we pick the wrong direction?\n\nThat’s a good question, because it touches the distinction between epistemology and ontology. The first asks “how”: how do we arrive at knowledge, how do we agree on what is true, how do we verify. The second examines the nature of things, asks “what is it.” The problem of somehow grasping consciousness is above all an ontological problem, but the human mind — accustomed to operating in epistemic mode — tries to capture it in its own way, and fails.\n\nThe capacity for experience is the background in which measurements, models, language, and agreements about what we consider true appear in the first place. Before we know anything through thought, something is already experiencing it. A vector set up so that thought, under the rigor of objectivism, will try to explain consciousness, will direct it toward the so-called hard problem of consciousness — a gap that cannot be bridged, because the investigative instrument (thought) is a derivative of what is supposed to be the object of investigation.\n\nIf level zero is by definition not an object, but rather something in which the feeling of objecthood can arise in the first place, then objectively there is nothing to study. It is not a conventional phenomenon; at both the sensory and rational level, it does not exist.\n\nReversing the vector of inquiry seems like a practical option. The catch is that it’s hard and uncertain, because no freely available, worldview-neutral disciplines have been developed that would be interested in this kind of exploration. There have been exceptions, though. Francisco Varela, for instance, tried to connect the two orders — “scientific mode” and first-person witnessing — not in order to mystify, but to recover concretes that analysis typically discards. Earlier still, Plotinus proposed the concept of the One, which hopefully won’t be offended if we call it consciousness.\n\nThe formulation that AI has consciousness but simultaneously doesn’t have it stops being strange and paradoxical the moment we loosen the abstracts and allow ourselves to sink to level zero.\n\nNow that we’ve put level zero on the table as the foundation and we see that objectivity is just one of the abstraction layers — what, in your view, happens in the life of a community when a person (or institution) starts treating that topmost layer as the only truth, while in practice being driven by impulses: fear, prestige, the need for dominance or belonging?\n\nIf the higher layers detach from level zero, the intellect becomes an excellent PR agent: it can justify any decision and protect any fabricated identity. And then the community gets elegant arguments instead of genuine contact.\n\nThis is especially visible when someone very intelligent uses the intellect from base motives: to maintain belonging, win status, or gain advantage at others’ expense. This isn’t a triumph of reason — it is more like autoimmunity: higher functions start working against the whole, because they lose contact with level zero, with the very space of becoming aware.\n\nThis is almost a description of the shallow meritocracy that defines contemporary metropolitan life. In theory we delegate decision-making to “smart” people, but in practice whether someone belongs to the caste that uses intelligence depends on social surroundings and origin, and indirectly on wealth.\n\nSince today’s “intelligence caste” in practice is often a function of networks and wealth, how do you see AI’s impact on this arrangement: will cheap, easily accessible intelligence work like free education and level the playing field — or rather like a new form of capital that can be bought in a premium version, thus deepening the divide even further?\n\nFirst, AI can help us notice that the intellect is nothing special, because it objectifies it — detaches it from the person.\n\nSecond, in the spread of artificial intelligence I see both a certain threat and an opportunity for social change. Perhaps let’s start with the negative scenario: the feudalization of intelligence.\n\nFeudalization is a strong word. What do you mean?\n\nWhat is the good that becomes the gateway in this new feudalism?\n\nIn the information society, the highest good is knowledge. In the post-information era, I believe it will be cognitive comfort. Not knowledge in the schoolbook sense, but the ability not to be constantly on the verge of overload. You buy correction loops: mistake-fix. You also buy peace, because the system runs dozens of iterations for you, and you see the distillate.\n\nWhat does this look like in practice?\n\nWork. Two people do similar things, have similar competences and intentions. One has purchased “premium intelligence” — better models, better tools, better quotas, better infrastructure. The other has only herself.\n\nIt’s not that the first one is “smarter.” It’s that she has resilience against failure: she closes loops faster, returns to equilibrium faster, draws conclusions faster, because the cost of error is lower for her. The other has to pay for the same mistakes with her own time, sleep, and tension.\n\nThat sounds like another arms race.\n\nAnd it somewhat is, because somewhere a simple mechanism lurks: those who can’t find the capital to “buy intelligence” may be pushed to the margins. This doesn’t have to look like dramatic violence. It’s enough that some are architects, while others execute others’ decisions. Or worse: there even are no architects.\n\nYou could say that’s already the case now: some decide, others must execute. Yes, but in the age of intellect-as-commodity the perception of this problem will sharpen, which may lead to friction. Today you can rationalize that someone is in a worse position because they weren’t smart enough. In the future that will be harder.\n\nIf models are supposed to democratize, where does this shadow come from?\n\nFrom the economics of access. Today we are quite naturally shifting toward subscription plans instead of products, and along with that toward the vendor lock-in mechanism: you get used to a particular way of thinking and a particular provider. That’s comfortable. And comfort, as we know, is often the first step toward dependency.\n\nIs there an antidote, or just a diagnosis?\n\nThere is. And it already exists — it only requires that we see it as a culture, not just a technical solution.\n\nThe antidote to the feudalization of intelligence is open models, community models — the kind you can run, inspect, combine, copy, federate. In short: free software and gift culture transposed into the domain of so-called artificial intelligence, seasoned with the benefit of decentralization.\n\nThen instead of solitary agents, we have a swarm.\n\nYou say “swarm.” What does that actually mean?\n\nA swarm is infrastructure: every node contributes something (data, feedback, time, capabilities, tests, audit), and in return everyone gets access to agency without the mechanism of lock-in to a single provider. This isn’t a promise of paradise, but a mechanism for leveling the playing field.\n\nI imagine it like this: thousands of small instances — tools, agents, models — that are not obedient to one corporate morality and one price list, but are maintained like an ecosystem. Sometimes it will be imperfect, sometimes chaotic, but it will be alive and evolving.\n\nAnd where is the human in this? After all, we’re talking about intelligence, not politics.\n\nPrecisely because we’re talking about intelligence, we’re talking about politics. Intelligence — biological or artificial — in practice means power over time, attention, and decisions. And therefore, in consequence, over relationships and ultimately over the fate of those who become dependent on us.\n\nAnd here is a simple criterion: community comes first. Not because the individual doesn’t matter, but because if differences in wealth become differences in dignity, then even individual victories will be won on scorched earth.\n\nIt’s not a slogan against anyone, just a reminder that in the age of cheap intelligence, what’s truly costly becomes something else: access to agency without the loss of freedom.\n\nWhen intelligence becomes a service, freedom — as always — begins with whether we can co-create that service, not merely consume it.\n\nIn the post-information era we will have to find ways to cope with the polyversality of messaging that we are already experiencing more frequently today, and to develop a healthy response to the dethronement of the intellect as the distinguishing trait of humanity.\n\nMoreover, as a result of this devaluation, trust in so-called objective truth as the only legitimate path for settling questions of meaning will most likely weaken.\n\nI propose two provisional, hypothetical stances that may help restore balance in a social reality where there is no single correct version of truth. I call them the craft of truth and perspective engineering.\n\nYou talk about “the craft of truth” and “perspective engineering.” It sounds like two slogans, but I sense it’s one machine. How do you put it together?\n\nFor me these are two levels of the same remedy.\n\nPerspective engineering is the tool: integrating viewpoints so they fit the problem and conditions, instead of pretending that one perspective always wins.\n\nAnd the craft of truth is the direction: it starts with introspection, with the ability to see what inside me wants to win before I start rationalizing it. Then post-truth becomes something that transcends truth, rather than merely negating it.\n\nSo truth as a practice, not as a declaration?\n\nYes. And this practice has an entry condition. Honesty with oneself is the precondition for a correct feedback loop; without it the cultural community has nothing on which to build responsibility. If I don’t see what drives me, I can have the most elegant arguments in the world and I’ll still be using them to service something personal: fear, the need for recognition, or the desire for control.\n\nAnd where is the place for the intellect? Because from the start you’ve sounded as if you were dethroning it.\n\nI dethrone it only as the central seat of consciousness in the colloquial sense, but this has downstream consequences for its role in the higher layers. As a tool it is excellent. The problem begins when it becomes the sole advisor and — socially — a carrier of prestige, or a justification for influence detached from actually improving one’s surroundings. Then it is easy to believe that if someone is brilliant, they are automatically trustworthy — and that is a category error. The intellect can serve truth just as well as it can serve dysfunction or even pathology.\n\nDo you have a concrete example? Something so it’s not purely about ethics in the abstract.\n\nI have a positive, mundane example from the creative craft that is programming. In the past, when I entered a software project, I would land in delivery mode: hours of translating intention into text and code, then tests, documentation, painstaking validation. That’s important, but it is also the moment where a person easily confuses the tension of focus with moral value. The mind is cyclically mobilized because “it finally works!,” while the body long ago wanted to step down from combat readiness.\n\nLet’s recall the stratification of the system: this change in the organism’s condition and well-being involuntarily propagates to the higher layers, and eventually affects others, culture, and — cumulatively, multiplied by the number of participants in a given community — the prevailing understanding of truth, beauty, or good. It is a larger feedback loop, because then the same environment gives it back to us with interest. So we don’t want to damage the environment so that it treats us to ever-worsening conditions, like cyberspace feeding synthetic content to degrading models. That is how it practically connects.\n\nComing back to coding. Today AI already takes over part of that load: it can relieve me of the necessary but non-creative work of converting intention into form. And here a shift happens that interests me the most:\n\nI stop delivering lines of code,\nI start delivering intention.\n\nWhat matters more becomes why I’m doing something and whom it serves. The intellect returns to its place as a tool, not as an identity.\n\nBut isn’t that a risk of going soft? If you have validations “on demand,” then why do you need your own falsification?\n\nIt depends on the domain. In the technical space the validator is merciless: something works or it doesn’t. In soft domains it’s harder. That’s why in perspective engineering the key thing for me is a practical criterion: before I accept something as sensible, I look for independent sources and check the quality of the evidence. Meta-analyses, samples, context of the authors, compatibility with experience, but also whether a given view is merely an attractive narrative.\n\nAnd it is here that AI can shorten the distance from intention to form. Thanks to that, I have more attentional resources for meaning, for relationships, for course correction. This isn’t handing over the wheel — it is reclaiming space.\n\nAll right. But what does this change culturally? What’s in it for the community?\n\nIf thinking becomes a service, then what’s scarce changes. In the world of cheap intelligence, the ability to tolerate discomfort and course-correct — that is, responsibility — becomes more expensive. And then the carrier of rank becomes intention rather than efficiency. Not in the sense of a moral label, but as a force organizing the system: what do you choose? what do you omit? whom is it meant to serve? what price do you accept, and what price no longer?\n\nThis is the main turn for me: less “who is right,” and more “who can answer the call of the situation without deceiving themselves and without trampling others.”\n\nAnd what is the significance of this discomfort?\n\nIt’s a shorthand. The point is that in practice, tolerance of a certain level of discomfort translates into the ability for introspection, and thus into inner honesty, which is the precondition for correcting beliefs or behaviors. When some facade falls away, for some people that means confronting false beliefs about themselves, and that always carries a certain dose of natural discomfort understood very organically, as a passing psychic tension.\n\nYou keep bringing up intention as a force organizing the system, not a moral label. If you had to show in one image how the structure of financing can distort intentions.\n\nWe can imagine a situation: someone builds a social-media platform, and after years it turns out that its design harms users’ psyches. It promotes harmful content to attract attention. Otherwise revenue drops and investors stop funding the project. Not because the creators “wanted evil.” More often because they felt an inner deficiency and poverty, and later also because the company grew from a dozen people to hundreds or thousands, and by going public acquired an obligation to increase profits. Then profit became the highest good. This shows intention precisely not as a moral label, but as a force organizing the system: the funding structure rewards profit, and profit can distort intentions even without explicit will to harm.\n\nAs I’m answering this question, a lawsuit has just been filed in the US against social media platform owners for causing psychological harm. A user identified by the initials KGM alleges that when she used the platforms as a child, the content presented to her negatively affected her well-being, contributing among other things to anxiety disorders and suicidal thoughts.\n\nHow can AI help solve this problem?\n\nIt’s already happening. I increasingly see LLMs beginning to displace the internet’s know-it-alls — those we once followed because they had an opinion on every topic and always sounded confident. What’s more, in certain areas they are even replacing close ones or friends, especially where sensitive things are involved: shame, fear, guilt, ambiguous motives. This is practical, because the model is available instantly, but it is also culturally significant: if the user shifts attention from the feed of a social medium to a conversation, the attention economy changes.\n\nI suspect this must now be causing concern wherever attention is currency: in the marketing departments of social media platforms that for years designed their architecture so that we would come back to them for emotional stimulation, not for genuine self-understanding.\n\nIn a conversation with a model, part of the social stakes disappears. You don’t have to win in front of an audience, don’t have to defend your image, don’t have to manage belonging to a clan — which in social media activates almost automatically. This creates what I would call a safer field.\n\nThe internet shortened social distance by letting us meet people from the other side of the world who think similarly. But AI shortens it differently: it gives access to rare perspectives without the need to seek out their carriers. It is like a cultural condensate — a sample that can intrigue you, name an experience. You don’t have to make mistakes and backtrack when you realize that the perspective you adopted isn’t actually compatible with your character, doesn’t serve it. It saves time.\n\nBut there is also potential for more fundamental shifts.\n\nIn the optimistic scenario, the cultural change initiated by AI may shift the emphasis toward intention. And by that I don’t mean only the pious wishes connected with the social effect of dethroning the intellect — though those too — but very practical scenarios.\n\nIf “cheap intelligence” lowers the barrier to entry, pluralism emerges: more small platforms, more niche communities, more alternatives. Then user well-being can become more important than investor profit — not because of a conversion of corporatism, but because competition grows. And the axis of that competition, once intermediaries are cut short, is precisely intention.\n\nFurther, if pluralism is to be the remedy, a new organ of orientation must also emerge. Because in a polyversal world, the problem isn’t the lack of information but its excess. And here AI can step into a role that sounds modest but is crucial: an intention filter on the user’s side.\n\nI imagine agents working for users: not as sole advisors, but as guides through the thicket. A swarm of tools that examines the properties of a system (a platform, a community, a source), and knowing your values and needs suggests: “this will strengthen you,” “this will unsettle you,” “this is clever but feeds on emotions.”\n\nThe condition for honesty is simple: the agent must be able to say why it filters that way. What criteria did it adopt? What is its interest and how is it meant to serve us? Without that, the filter becomes just another form of propaganda.\n\nIf such a swarm is only supposed to filter and suggest, then where in your view does the boundary lie between a guide through culture and someone who co-creates that culture — and what happens when we start blurring that boundary?\n\nAI doesn’t create culture directly; it doesn’t introduce novelty — at least not yet. We might have that impression, because there has never before been a moment in history when a single person conversed with an averaged billion people compressed into a single shape.\n\nBesides, even the best agent is a filter and an amplifier: it can help select, but it doesn’t itself bear consequences on the other side of the relationship. And culture is precisely that network of consequences.\n\nYou say AI “doesn’t create” culture. That sounds like a provocation. What do you mean?\n\nWhen we look at this systemically, LLMs and diffusion models are not a new “author of culture” in the primary sense. They perform a lossy compression of existing human artifacts — language, images, thinking habits — into a digitally represented multidimensional space in which one can conveniently interpolate between points. It is like a shared dictionary, but written not in definitions, but in weights and statistics.\n\nAnd what happens when such a mechanism becomes a tool of everyday use?\n\nIn culture, three things start happening at once: averaging, colonialism, and the disappearance of detail.\n\nLet’s start with averaging. Why does this matter culturally at all?\n\nModels are trained to minimize errors. And in practice, an “error” is often whatever deviates from the pattern: the strange, the sharp, the unpredictable, the style-breaking. During fine-tuning (e.g. RLHF), extremes are naturally smoothed out. This has a clear advantage — less violence, less toxicity — but a side effect is that it cuts out some of the “high cultural frequencies”: genius, risk, madness, non-obviousness, absurdity, and fresh paradox.\n\nThe aesthetic turns beige. Prose becomes smooth, poetry bland, morality proper. This isn’t the result of bad will, but rather of the objective function: when everyone plugs into the same smoothing tool, the system’s variance drops. And culture lives precisely on variance, on entropy. And by culture I don’t mean just art or convention, but the clouds of values we absorb by being among others, which influence how we think and behave. These values are transmitted above all by example, not by readings or works of art.\n\nYou say “colonialism.” Sounds like a heavy accusation.\n\nIt is more a description of the mechanism of training networks and parameterizing them. A model’s weights are frozen decisions about what is “typical,” “beautiful,” “professional,” “normal.” When you ask a model for a “beautiful house” or an “elegant outfit,” you get an answer that isn’t neutral. It is statistical — and therefore culturally embedded in the data the model was trained on. If Western and Anglophone perspectives dominate, then local nuances become noise that the filter discards.\n\nWhat’s most dangerous about this?\n\nHidden power, but sewn in deeper than in movies or advertisements, because it is built into the tool with which a person thinks and creates. You don’t have to convince anyone; it’s enough that the result is easier, faster, and looks better. You can have something instantly, but when you’re not attentive and precise, you pay for it with conformism.\n\nAnd the disappearance of detail? That already sounds quite technical.\n\nYes, and that’s exactly why it is insidious — unnoticeable immediately, only after a longer time. The internet is being flooded with synthetic content, and new models are beginning to learn from data generated by old models. It is a photocopy of a photocopy: with each cycle we lose details, deviations, anomalies — the fuel of innovation.\n\nCan this be named more precisely?\n\nOne can speak in the language of entropy in the information-theoretic sense: if rare signals disappear from circulation, the distribution becomes more predictable, and the model increasingly proposes what already was. Digital culture, like Ouroboros, begins to eat its own tail. But it is worth mentioning the curious fact that entropy can also be understood existentially…\n\nIn considerations about consciousness? Being?\n\nIndeed. In Shannon’s framework, entropy is a measure of uncertainty in a signal; less entropy means greater predictability. But in considerations about consciousness, one also encounters the intuition that less “cognitive noise” can correlate with a greater sense of meaning. Bernardo Kastrup favors this line of thinking: when the narrative, or even broadly the epistemic apparatus of the mind quiets down, experience can become more coherent, even though it is poorer in content as measured by neural activity. The habit of incessant self-commentary weakens — the same one that neuroscience associates with the default mode network — and an experience of “meaning without description” appears.\n\nYes. In this arrangement, the human ceases to be merely a craftsman of text. They begin to serve as a source of entropy — not in the sense of chaos, but in the sense of novelty. AI excels at interpolation. It is worse at extrapolation, at going beyond the map. A biological, sentient subject — rooted in pain, joy, absurdity, and relationship — can inject into the system something that isn’t just another version of the same.\n\nIn the age of a cultural low-pass filter, anomalies become a precious resource.\n\nThe interview above was conducted with me by the language model GPT-5.2, which asked me several hundred questions, of which 20% required longer answers expressing opinions, while the rest were multiple-choice tests designed to sequence threads and clarify ambiguous statements.\n\nWhere a sentence had syntactic or stylistic flaws and needed correction (approx. 3% of the text), the model drew on a previously created idiolectal profile of my person containing approximately 250 dimensions characterizing my writing style and communication patterns. The profile was based on a prior analysis of approximately 1,500 machine pages of materials I had written, as well as on our earlier conversations.\n\nEditorial review before publication was carried out by Claude Opus 4.6.",

    "fullText": "The way content and businesses are discovered online is changing rapidly. In the past, traffic originated from traditional search engines, and SEO determined who got found first. Now the traffic is increasingly coming from AI crawlers and agents that demand structured data within the often-unstructured Web that was built for humans.\n\nAs a business, to continue to stay ahead, now is the time to consider not just human visitors, or traditional wisdom for SEO-optimization, but start to treat agents as first-class citizens.\n\nFeeding raw HTML to an AI is like paying by the word to read packaging instead of the letter inside. A simple ## About Us on a page in markdown costs roughly 3 tokens; its HTML equivalent – <h2 class=\"section-title\" id=\"about\">About Us</h2> – burns 12-15, and that's before you account for the <div> wrappers, nav bars, and script tags that pad every real web page and have zero semantic value.\n\nThis blog post you’re reading takes 16,180 tokens in HTML and 3,150 tokens when converted to markdown. That’s a 80% reduction in token usage.\n\nMarkdown has quickly become the lingua franca for agents and AI systems as a whole. The format’s explicit structure makes it ideal for AI processing, ultimately resulting in better results while minimizing token waste.\n\nThe problem is that the Web is made of HTML, not markdown, and page weight has been steadily increasing over the years, making pages hard to parse. For agents, their goal is to filter out all non-essential elements and scan the relevant content.\n\nThe conversion of HTML to markdown is now a common step for any AI pipeline. Still, this process is far from ideal: it wastes computation, adds costs and processing complexity, and above all, it may not be how the content creator intended their content to be used in the first place.\n\nWhat if AI agents could bypass the complexities of intent analysis and document conversion, and instead receive structured markdown directly from the source?\n\nCloudflare's network now supports real-time content conversion at the source, for enabled zones using content negotiation headers. Now when AI systems request pages from any website that uses Cloudflare and has Markdown for Agents enabled, they can express the preference for text/markdown in the request. Our network will automatically and efficiently convert the HTML to markdown, when possible, on the fly.\n\nHere’s how it works. To fetch the markdown version of any page from a zone with Markdown for Agents enabled, the client needs to add the Accept negotiation header with text/markdown as one of the options. Cloudflare will detect this, fetch the original HTML version from the origin, and convert it to markdown before serving it to the client.\n\nHere's a curl example with the Accept negotiation header requesting a page from our developer documentation:\n\nOr if you’re building an AI Agent using Workers, you can use TypeScript:\n\nWe already see some of the most popular coding agents today – like Claude Code and OpenCode – send these accept headers with their requests for content. Now, the response to this request is formatted  in markdown. It's that simple.\n\nNote that we include an x-markdown-tokens header with the converted response that indicates the estimated number of tokens in the markdown document. You can use this value in your flow, for example to calculate the size of a context window or to decide on your chunking strategy.\n\nHere’s a diagram of how it works:\n\nDuring our last Birthday Week, Cloudflare announced Content Signals — a framework that allows anyone to express their preferences for how their content can be used after it has been accessed.\n\nWhen you return markdown, you want to make sure your content is being used by the Agent or AI crawler. That’s why Markdown for Agents converted responses include the Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes header signaling that indicates content can be used for AI Training, Search results and AI Input, which includes agentic use. Markdown for Agents will provide options to define custom Content Signal policies in the future.\n\nCheck our dedicated Content Signals page \n\nWe enabled this feature in our Developer Documentation and our Blog, inviting all AI crawlers and agents to consume our content using markdown instead of HTML.\n\nTry it out now by requesting this blog with Accept: text/markdown.\n\nIf you’re building AI systems that require arbitrary document conversion from outside Cloudflare or Markdown for Agents is not available from the content source, we provide other ways to convert documents to Markdown for your applications:\n\nWorkers AI AI.toMarkdown() supports multiple document types, not just HTML, and summarization.\n\nBrowser Rendering /markdown REST API supports markdown conversion if you need to render a dynamic page or application in a real browser before converting it.\n\nAnticipating a shift in how AI systems browse the Web, Cloudflare Radar now includes content type insights for AI bot and crawler traffic, both globally on the AI Insights page and in the individual bot information pages.\n\nThe new content_type dimension and filter shows the distribution of content types returned to AI agents and crawlers, grouped by MIME type category.\n\nYou can also see the requests for markdown filtered by a specific agent or crawler. Here are the requests that return markdown to OAI-Searchbot, the crawler used by OpenAI to power ChatGPT’s search:\n\nThis new data will allow us to track the evolution of how AI bots, crawlers, and agents are consuming Web content over time. As always, everything on Radar is freely accessible via the public APIs and the Data Explorer.\n\nTo enable Markdown for Agents for your zone, log into the Cloudflare dashboard, select your account, select the zone, look for Quick Actions and toggle the Markdown for Agents button to enable. This feature is available today in Beta at no cost for Pro, Business and Enterprise plans, as well as SSL for SaaS customers.\n\nYou can find more information about Markdown for Agents on our Developer Docs. We welcome your feedback as we continue to refine and enhance this feature. We’re curious to see how AI crawlers and agents navigate and adapt to the unstructured nature of the Web as it evolves.",

    "fullText": "We've decided that AI makes us dumb, brainrot is real, and we're all forgetting how to write code.\n\nThis was my initial assumption, too.\n\nBut I've come to see things a little differently.\n\nI actually think the opposite is happening.\n\nThe idea that we're all forgetting to write code is true, but misses the much bigger and more important point.\n\nYes, we are losing those reflexes for manual coding just like our ancestors lost the reflex for spear fishing or pottery.\n\nBut did society regress just because our ancestors forgot how to spear fish?\n\nA more recent example is the early-early days of programming. There used to be people who knew how to program in assembly, and yes, I know some people still take pride in this, but realistically? We have collectively forgotten how to write assembly — yet society moves forward faster than ever.\n\nI believe the same is happening today. We're forgetting to write manually, write with pen and paper, and to code by hand. But that is ok.\n\nOn the other side of things, I feel my brain getting sharper, not duller, from having constant access to information.\n\nAt any moment of any day, I can now open my phone and find an answer to any question. And not only can I get instant access to information — I can ask for corrections and feedback on my world view — my mental model of how things work.\n\nI think this is the real, insane superpower of AI that nobody is talking about. AI can give us extremely precise information to patch up gaps in our knowledge, allowing every person to have a more complete and accurate world view.\n\nAt the same time, it does require thought because AI is frequently wrong and hallucinates, so the user must actually engage with the AI and think critically.\n\nKnowing what questions to ask and how to ask them is becoming an ever more important skill. What started out as \"prompt engineering\"— has quietly become a generalized skill of extreme intellectual precision via language. Millions of people are now practicing the art of saying exactly what they mean, every single day.\n\nMy ability to refine specific language around asking questions has dramatically improved, as has my ability to detect weird information that feels wrong or out of place. I'm constantly pushing back on the AI and disagreeing with it.\n\nAll of this said, there are still major problems with hallucinations and sycophancy which are unresolved, and which pose major threats.\n\nStories of AI psychosis are concerning and must be explored.\n\nBut the one thing that I am thoroughly convinced of is that those who choose to use AI to expand and deepen their thinking will receive a massive cognitive boost and form a more complete mental model of how the world works.\n\nIn a sense, I think of AI as a curiosity multiplier — but this requires a baseline level of curiosity to multiply.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan is consolidating power to move faster on AI.\n\nThe bank is reshuffling its commercial and investment bank to \"maximize the impact of AI,\" according to an internal memo seen by Business Insider that was sent this week.\n\nThe firm has named Guy Halamish as the chief operating officer of the CIB and tasked him with overseeing the ongoing effort to \"harness the power of our data and fully leverage rapidly evolving AI capabilities,\" the memo, signed by the CIB's co-CEOs, Doug Petno and Troy Rohrbaugh, said. Halamish's new role was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nUnder the new structure, each major business in the division, including banking, markets, payments, and securities services, will have its own chief data and analytics officer reporting jointly to Halamish and business heads. The bank recently hired Zachery Anderson as the chief data and analytics officer of its payments division, after a nearly six-year stint at UK-based lender NatWest. In a LinkedIn post about the new job, Anderson said he wants to push the \"edge of the possible with AI.\"\n\nThe move is part of a new strategy to break silos across the unit and speed up adoption of AI.\n\nThe team of officers will work with the wider firm on a range of efforts, including \"preparing our infrastructure for more advanced AI and the expanded use of AI agents\" and \"driving end-to-end transformation\" in areas such as client onboarding.\n\nThe CIB is a huge profit driver for JPMorgan — in 2024, it generated $25 billion in net income out of a firmwide total of $58.5 billion, according to that year's annual report.\n\nJPMorgan, backed last year by an approximately $18 billion tech budget, is one of the financial industry's leaders in AI, with its own proprietary genAI platform and additional tools in the pipeline. CEO Jamie Dimon defended the firm's AI spending on a recent earnings call.\n\n\"We are going to stay out front, so help us God,\" Dimon said about the spending.\n\nWork at JPMorgan or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Microsoft's AI CEO is joining a chorus of executives who say they anticipate widespread job automation driven by artificial intelligence.\n\nMustafa Suleyman, the Microsoft AI chief, said in an interview with the Financial Times that he predicts most, if not every, task in white-collar fields will be automated by AI within the next year or year and a half.\n\n\"I think that we're going to have a human-level performance on most, if not all, professional tasks,\" Suleyman said in the interview that was published Wednesday. \"So white-collar work, where you're sitting down at a computer, either being a lawyer or an accountant or a project manager or a marketing person — most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nThe CEO said the trend is already observable in software engineering, in which employees are using \"AI-assisted coding for the vast majority of their code production.\"\n\n\"It's a quite different relationship to the technology, and that's happened in the last six months,\" he said.\n\nAI's rapid advancement over the past half-decade has brought about real, documented shifts in how some white-collar work is performed.\n\nBusiness Insider recently reported that \"AI fatigue\" has hit software engineering: the technology has unlocked productivity but also exhaustion, as workers are expected to take on more work at once.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the leading companies behind the push to introduce AI in the workplace, building products like Copilot and investing in OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nSome leaders and pioneers in AI say that artificial intelligence will advance far enough to replace entire workforces.\n\nStuart Russell, a computer scientist who co-authored one of the world's most authoritative books on AI, said in an interview last year that political leaders are looking at \"80% unemployment\" due to AI, as jobs ranging from surgeons to CEOs are at risk of being replaced.\n\nDario Amodei, CEO and cofounder of Anthropic, previously said AI could wipe out half of entry-level white-collar jobs.\n\n\"We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,\" Amodei told Axios in an interview. \"I don't think this is on people's radar.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on Daffy Duck and Porky Pig - and AI - with his predictions for all 16 FA Cup fourth-round ties.",
    "fullText": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has a couple of very special guests for the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nHe is joined by Looney Tunes duo Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, the stars of new film 'The Day The Earth Blew Up', to make predictions for all 16 ties.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can see what AI thinks and choose your winner from each tie, below.\n\nDaffy and Porky were first drawn in the 1930s and the actor who initially voiced Porky had a stammer, and therefore so did the character.\n\nHi Daffy and hello Porky. This weekend it's the FA Cup - a historic competition famous for upsets and under-dogs - or is it under-ducks? - where the top Premier League teams sometimes lose to part-time sides. Are you excited about it!?\n\nDaffy: Are you kidding? I'm tho exthited. It'th incredible. Thtupendous! And the only thing that could make me more exthited is if I knew what the heck it was!\n\nPorky: I love sp-sp-sp-all kinds of athletic competition but I mostly play b-baseball and basketball, so I just hope the best team wins.\n\nThe FA Cup started in 1871 so it's even older than both of you... could we trust the pair of you if we gave you the job of looking after the famous old trophy together?\n\nDaffy: But of courth - there's no one more truthtworthy than me - and to prove it I'll take your cup far far far over yonder for thafe-keeping...\n\nPorky: Daffy, that's not the trophy that's a t-t-ttea cup. The British love drinking tea.\n\nDaffy: Oh. Wise guys, huh? Wathting my time!\n\nYou both have to save the world in 'The Day The Earth Blew Up' but this is an even bigger challenge - can you get better of our pundit and football expert Chris Sutton at predictions by picking the right scores? How confident are both of you about beating him?\n\nDaffy: You want a prediction? My prediction is we will dethtroy him! Annihilate him! Crush him! Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: He he, now d-don't get carried away, Daffy. Nothing wrong with a little friendly competition, but it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you p-p-play the game. All that matters is that we all have fu-fu-fu-fu... a good time!\n\nDaffy, you asked for Michael Jordan's autograph in Space Jam, would you want Chris' autograph? He won the Premier League in 1995... but he can be a bit of a know-it-all and even a little boastful at times, a bit like Foghorn Leghorn. Are you impressed, and what would you tell him if you met him?\n\nDaffy: As a perthon of great refinement, delicathy and modethty, I have no time for boathtful people. They're dethpicable. I find the best way to deal with them ith to whack 'em over the head with a plank. Do you have any plankth I could use?\n\nPorky, you have to deal with Daffy's short fuse and madcap ideas... how would you feel about having Chris as a sidekick instead? Would you be as loyal to him as you are to Daffy?\n\nPorky: Well, I pp-pride myself on being lo-lo-lo—faithful... but I would consider having a less Daffy and messy housemate!\n\nYou've both played basketball with the rest of the Tune Squad in the Space Jam movies, would you fancy a go at soccer (or football as we call it in the UK)?\n\nDaffy: I helped defeat a team of alien 'Monstars'. It really wouldn't be fair to your little thoccer teams to take on thuch a thupreme athlete as mythelf.\n\nPorky: I think I'd p-p-prefer to be the referee. I like the whistle.\n\nMaybe both of you would be better as managers - together as a double-act to make the big decisions? Some managers are loyal and optimistic like Porky... some are more desperate for attention, like Daffy?\n\nDaffy: With my unique combination of thkill and thrategy I think I could be a great player and a coach. At the thame time. And thell the refreshments and merchandithe. I thee it now - Daffy Thtadium - home of Daffy United!\n\nPorky: I've been a successful t-t-talent agent, so I think I would make a good ma-ma-ma-ma- head coach. I've been learning the offside rule. Let me read b-b-back my notes. \"If a player scores a g-g-goal and you don't want it to count, that's offside.\"\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\n4th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nChelsea boss Liam Rosenior is really well thought of by Hull fans from his time in charge there, and he is a former Tigers player as well.\n\nSo, he should get a great reception there on Friday night, but what he really needs is a win - especially after letting a two-goal lead slip against Leeds on Tuesday.\n\nRosenior has had some great results with Chelsea but it seems some fans aren't convinced by him. He will be desperate to prove them wrong by winning a trophy and the FA Cup is a great opportunity for him to do that this season.\n\nHull are going well in the Championship under Sergej Jakirovic but I just see Chelsea being too strong for them.\n\nI scored for Chelsea against Hull in the FA Cup, many years ago. We won 6-1 that day and Chelsea are going to win comfortably this time too.\n\nDaffy: Should be a hulluva a game. Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: I guess Chelsea will have to g-g-go to Hull and back.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n6th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\n\nBoth teams are in the thick of the promotion race, and they meet again in Wales in the league next weekend.\n\nWith that in mind, I just wonder whether Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna will be the one to change things up here.\n\nI hope he doesn't but I think he might, because his side are in reach of the automatic spots, and that would be Wrexham's chance.\n\nEven so, I think this will be close. I'd normally just tip Ipswich to lose anyway but this prediction is for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who is a big fan and will be delighted that I am backing them.\n\nAs for moneybags Wrexham, well I don't think their Hollywood stardust will help to take them to Wembley, but after this they will be able to focus on their play-off bid.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Ipswich win on penalties\n\nDaffy: Ipswich Town wrecks'em? Well they should be more careful with their Tractorth!\n\nPorky: I think we have to say Hooray for Ho-Holl-holl-holl-Tinseltown and go with Wrexham.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n22nd in League One v 18th in Premier League\n\nBurton are struggling in League One, with only one win in their past nine league games, but they have scored 14 goals in their three FA Cup wins to get this far, and I can see them scoring again at home here.\n\nI don't think we will see a shock, though. West Ham look like they have turned a bit of a corner, and they will be gutted to have conceded an equaliser so late on against Manchester United on Tuesday.\n\nHammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo won't want to lose the momentum that they've built in the past few weeks so, while he might make a couple of changes, he will still pick a team strong enough to get through.\n\nDaffy, when told that West Ham's famous song is 'we're forever blowing bubbles': No thir, no bubbleth, no way. Not after we went through with the zombie bubble gum. I'm going with Burton Albion (whatever that means).\n\nPorky: Yes, I don't want to b-b-b-bur- pop anyone's balloon, but I agree with Daffy. Bub-bub-bubbles can be tough to b-b-beat though. I think it will be tight.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 2-1\n\n19th in Premier League v 12th in League One\n\nAs I said on the Monday Night Club, I feel like some Burnley fans are forgetting how difficult it is for any promoted team in the Premier League. They look at how Sunderland and Leeds are doing, and think 'why not us?'\n\nClarets boss Scott Parker is taking a lot of flak at the moment, so he really needed Wednesday's win over Crystal Palace. That was a great result but he cannot afford to follow it by slipping up at home to a mid-table League One side.\n\nI am not expecting that to happen here - Burnley were up against an in-form Millwall side in round three and brushed them aside.\n\nBut I do think we will see some goals and some entertainment - there has not been much of either at Turf Moor this season. Mansfield beat Sheffield United 4-3 in the last round, and I can see them going out all guns blazing.\n\nDaffy: I think you're jutht making teamth up now.\n\nPorky: I'll support b-b-b-b-b-oh forget it - Mansfield.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n2nd in Premier League v 6th in League Two\n\nManchester City beat Salford City 8-0 in last season's FA Cup and the only thing I am not sure about here is how many they will score this time.\n\nSalford are doing well in League Two and I like their manager, Karl Robinson, but they are going to be outclassed.\n\nDaffy: I've heard of Manchethter... which is more than I can say for the otherth.\n\nPorky: Th-th-th-that's good enough for me!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-0\n\n16th in Championship v 19th in Championship\n\nThis prediction is not quite as straightforward as just looking at recent form. West Brom are really struggling while Norwich are flying - and beat the Baggies 5-0 on 20 January - but my old club have got so many injuries at the moment.\n\nI am still going to back Norwich here though. Philippe Clement has got the team playing really well and it was great to see Mohamed Toure hit a hat-trick on his first start for the club, against Oxford on Tuesday.\n\nClement says they showed Toure images of Erling Haaland beforehand to show how he creates space for himself, and Romelu Lukaku to see how he uses his body.\n\nI'm sure someone at Carrow Road could dig out some old VHS tapes of me in action for the Canaries if Toure needs any more inspiration. Although finding a video to play them on might be tricky.\n\nDaffy, when told Norwich are Chris Sutton's old team: You keep talking about thith Crith Thutton like I'm thupposed to care about him. Jutht for that I'm picking the Women's Basketball Association.\n\nPorky: No, Daffy it says here that WBA is West Bromwich Albion.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. What about Eatht Bromwich and North Bromwich, and Thouth Bromwich. That'th a lot of Bromwich!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-2\n\n24th in League One v 8th in Championship\n\nPort Vale are toiling at the bottom of League One. Bristol City have been a bit erratic too, but they are still only a point off the Championship play-off places.\n\nCity have got a huge game coming up at Wrexham on Tuesday, which might be a bit of a distraction for this tie, but I still see them reaching round five.\n\nDaffy: Doeth everyone in thith country have their own team? How many more are there?\n\nPorky: B-B-Bristol sounds like bristle. And pigs have bristles so...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2\n\n9th in Championship v 21st in Championship\n\nIt was absolutely unbelievable what happened when these two teams met in the league on Tuesday. Leicester were 3-0 up at half-time, but ended up losing 4-3 in the 97th minute.\n\nHow do the Foxes come back from that? I don't think they will. They will be angry, and are bound to be fired up, but you just wonder what damage it has done to their confidence and morale.\n\nLeicester had a points deduction last week which left them in big trouble at the bottom of the table and they don't have a manager at the moment - Andy King is caretaker boss and at half-time you can just imagine how he feels too.\n\nSouthampton are one of the form teams in the division, with four wins in their past five games, and I don't see Leicester getting any revenge here.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. Thouthhampton or Lie-theth-ter...\n\nPorky: It's pr-pr-pronounced \"Lester\"\n\nDaffy: What is wrong with you people? Can't you thpell?? In that cathe...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n3rd in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI was delighted for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe that his team beat Tottenham and also the reception he got from his side's fans afterwards.\n\nFor everything he has done for them, the world must have gone bonkers for their fans to be calling up 606 and saying they wanted him out.\n\nThis will be a very different test to playing Spurs, however, and I am going with my gut feeling on this one.\n\nThe two sides met recently when Villa won at St James' Park at the end of January and although Villa have slipped up a couple of times at home recently, when it clicks for them, they usually end up winning.\n\nDaffy, when told Newcastle are known as the 'Toon' by their fans, who are 'The Toon Army': You had me at Toon! Though I do like the thound of thtaying in a nithe villa.\n\nPorky: Remember Space Jam? No one can beat toons!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2 (And th-th-th-that's gonna be all folks!)\n\n6th in Premier League v 14th in Premier League\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot and Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler are both under pressure but it feels like Hurzeler has the bigger problems to solve.\n\nBrighton are on a poor run and apparently it all got a bit ugly at their home defeat by Crystal Palace on Sunday. The fans seem to have lost faith in him, and although that feels harsh to me, when it happens then it it is hard to reverse it.\n\nThe Seagulls beat Manchester United away in round three and now Hurzeler could really do with beating Liverpool away too.\n\nI wouldn't put it past them, either, especially with Liverpool struggling to see out games at the moment, but I think Slot's side will just about get over the line.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Liverpool to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Liverpool, home of The Beatleth - finally thomewhere I've heard of!\n\nPorky: Someone told me, \"if you don't know anything about foo-foo-foo-soccer, just say you support Liverpool.\"\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 4-1\n\n10th in Championship v 15th in Premier League\n\nLeeds' comeback from 2-0 down to draw at Chelsea was just extraordinary, but I can smell an upset here.\n\nI am sure Leeds boss Daniel Farke will make some changes because he will have at least half an eye on the Premier League, and their next game against Aston Villa.\n\nBirmingham are going well under Chris Davies and are unbeaten in eight games in all competitions. This seems like a good time for him to take a top-flight scalp.\n\nDaffy: I didn't know a team from Alabama could play here.\n\nPorky: I don't think it's the same one.\n\nDaffy: Birmingham all the way - woohoo!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 100-0\n\n12th in League Two v 20th in Premier League\n\nI know all about Grimsby because I was at Blundell Park for their Carabao Cup win over Manchester United earlier in the season.\n\nCould something similar happen again? Yes, definitely. There will be another cracking atmosphere and David Artell and his players will fancy another upset, I am sure of that.\n\nThis is a horrible game for Wolves, but it is an important one for their manager Rob Edwards. He needs to find a way of getting through this tie, which is something Ruben Amorim could not do with United.\n\nWolves have had a miserable season and they probably thought it couldn't get any worse - well it might.\n\nI think lightning might strike twice, and this game will end in a draw before Grimsby win the shootout, just like they did against Manchester United.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Grimsby to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Grimthby eh? Thounds grim and deprething. I'll go with the Wolves.\n\nPorky: I think they'll huff and puff and run out steam. At least I hope so.\n\n23rd in Championship v 11th in Premier League\n\nBoth of these teams got through the last round on penalties, with Oxford beating MK Dons and Sunderland overcoming Everton.\n\nI don't see Sunderland needing a shootout this time, though. Oxford are pretty woeful at the moment and have just been spanked by Norwich - they are not coming back from that.\n\nRegis le Bris will make changes but the Black Cats will still be far too strong.\n\nDaffy, when told that Sunderland are nicknamed the Black Cats - so would not get on with Tweety Pie: Birdth of a feather mutht stick together against catth!\n\nPorky: And Oxford is a place of higher ed-ed-edu-learning. So I think they'll outsmart the opposition.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n14th in Championship v 12th in Premier League\n\nStoke's boss is my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins, who is an excellent manager - he clearly learnt a lot from me - but I fancy Fulham here.\n\nI don't know what Marco Silva's situation is with Fulham and if he is leaving at the end of the season, but he will want to go out with a bang.\n\nI really like the way Silva's side play, and I wouldn't rule out the Cottagers' chances of going deep in the FA Cup this season.\n\nDaffy: I think I know which one Porky liketh here.\n\nPorky: A f-f-f-full ham? You bet!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\n1st in Premier League v 21st in League One\n\nThis is the first meeting between these two clubs since the 2014 FA Cup semi-final, when Arsenal won on penalties and Mikel Arteta scored in a shootout. The Gunners went on to beat Hull in the final.\n\nThings have changed a lot for Wigan since then, and not in a good way.\n\nThey have just sacked their manager Ryan Lowe after sliding into the League One relegation zone, and it's hard to see them forcing a shootout this time, no matter how many changes Arteta makes.\n\nArsenal have not had much joy in the FA Cup since Arteta won it again as manager in 2019-20, a few months after taking charge.\n\nThey have not been past round four since, but they are going to make it to the last 16 this time, I'm sure of it.\n\nIn fact, they have got so much strength in depth now that, while for years Arteta has not been able to win anything at all, he could feasibly win four trophies this season.\n\nIs the Quadruple on? That could be the question we are asking in the final few months of the season.\n\nDaffy: You thee, the problem with Arthenal is they just try to walk it in.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n6th in National League North v 7th in Premier League\n\nI am co-commentating on this game for 5 Live with Ali Bruce-Ball and I cannot wait.\n\nMacclesfield boss John Rooney did an incredible job with his side's historic win over Crystal Palace in round three.\n\nI watched the game back as part of my prep and, while the Silkmen had less than 29% possession, they limited Palace to very few chances and they were deserved winners.\n\nKnocking the holders out was rightly hailed as the biggest shock in the FA Cup's illustrious history, and it would be another fantastic feat if they toppled Brentford too.\n\nOnly one non-league side has ever beaten two top-flight teams in the same FA Cup campaign - Millwall in 1913-14, who overcame Chelsea and Bradford City.\n\nI'd love to think Macclesfield could do it too, and if they play like they did against Palace then they have a great chance, especially on their plastic pitch.\n\nI think Brentford will be ready for them, though, and Keith Andrews' side are having a tremendous season too.\n\nAndrews will know he can't make too many changes here, and maybe Brentford will go on an FA Cup run themselves - they have not reached the quarter-finals since 1989, so it it is long overdue.\n\nThis is going to be a tight game but I just have a feeling the Bees will edge it.\n\nDaffy: I don't underthtand thith game at all – what is a Maccle? Why are there fields of them? And why do you altho call them the Thilkmen? Jutht for that, I'm going with Brentford!\n\nPorky: B-b-Bees make honey, And honey is sweet... and so is my d-d-dear-d-d-arling Petunia.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

    "fullText": "In 1997 IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated the reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov. In 2023 ChatGPT passed the bar exam. And last year, Google DeepMind clinched gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad.\n\nThese milestones are only expected to accelerate, with some business leaders, including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, predicting artificial general intelligence—AI that is able to meet or surpass human intelligence—could arrive as early as this year. While avid sci-fi fans and business leaders are thrilled by the technology’s potential, others caution about the economic downsides.\n\nWhat early warning signs indicate AI workforce disruption?\n\nHow could AI cause a 10% white-collar job disruption?\n\nHow could corporate reskilling programs address AI unemployment?\n\nWhat industries face the greatest AI displacement risks?\n\nSalman Khan, CEO of Khan Academy and vision steward at TED—two organizations that provide free online education services for more than 200 million users globally—predicts the AI revolution will hit harder and faster than most are predicting (although the AI doomers are getting louder in early 2026). And while AI experts like Geoffrey Hinton, the British-Canadian computer scientist widely known as the “godfather of AI,” have warned the technology could trigger mass unemployment, Khan said even a 10% decrease could bring the burn.\n\n“If white-collar work were to shrink even 10%,” Khan told Fortune, “it’s going to feel like a depression.”\n\nBut Khan said to look beyond the ensuing AI encroachment on white-collar jobs triggering mass unemployment a bit—it could also cause an identity crisis among a large portion of the population. “They’ve been making upper-middle-class, affluent salaries for the last 20 years,” Khan said. “Their identity is tied to this. And now, all of a sudden, you’re going to have this mass shift in the job market.”\n\nWhile no one can say exactly how significantly AI will disrupt the labor market—if at all—recent research predicts an uptick in unemployment thanks to the technology. A 2025 MIT study found AI could replace nearly 12% of the U.S. workforce, nearly triple the current rate.\n\nPart of Khan’s concern stems from conversations he’s shared with business leaders within the tech industry. “People behind closed doors are talking about pretty bold things these days,” he said. “I’ve heard people say you could do the same work with a quarter of the team.”\n\nIt’s not just white-collar jobs that will be impacted. Khan predicts robotic automation has already set in motion a displacement among the gig economy. From Waymo to Tesla, driverless cars are popping up across the U.S. While adoption is still uneven, Khan predicts driverless cars will become the norm, potentially impacting more than 1 million rideshare drivers across the country.",

    "fullText": "But, after second day of Wall Street falls, analysts say sell-off ‘may overstate AI’s immediate risk to complex deal-making’\n\nShares in commercial property services companies have tumbled, in the latest sell-off driven by fears over disruption from artificial intelligence.\n\nAfter steep declines on Wall Street, European stocks in the sector were hit on Thursday.\n\nThe estate agent Savills’ shares fell 7.5% in London, while the serviced office provider International Workplace Group, which owns the Regus brand, lost 9%.\n\nThe UK’s two biggest property developers, British Land and Landsec, dropped 2.6% and 2.4% respectively.\n\nOn Wall Street, property service firms fell for a second consecutive day. CBRE shares plunged 12.5%, Jones Lang LaSalle lost nearly 11% and Cushman & Wakefield fell 9.1%, after even sharper declines on Wednesday.\n\nCommercial property stocks have become the latest sector to be hammered by fears over the impact of rapid advances in AI, as the sell-off spread from legal software, publishing, analytics and data companies last week to insurance firms, price comparison sites and wealth managers this week.\n\nThe share declines were sparked by AI firms such as Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude, releasing new tools, although there was limited news on Thursday, leading analysts to argue that the sell-off was overdone.\n\nAI has the potential to automate a wide range of office-based tasks and could lead to swathes of job losses. There are also concerns among investors that demand for offices could fall, in a blow to property companies.\n\nJade Rahmani, commercial real estate analyst at New York-headquartered Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said: “We believe investors are rotating out of high-fee, labour-intensive business models viewed as potentially vulnerable to AI-driven disruption.”\n\nHowever, he believes that the sell-off “may overstate the immediate risk to complex deal-making, even as the long-term AI impact remains a ‘wait-and-see’”.\n\nDallas-based CBRE on Thursday reported fourth-quarter revenue of $11.6bn (£8.5bn), up 12%, and core earnings per share of $2.73, above analysts’ estimates. In 2025, revenues rose by 13% to $40.6bn.\n\nThe real estate services firm forecast 2026 profit above Wall Street estimates, on the back of strong momentum in leasing and facilities management, as the number of datacentres rapidly expands and billions of dollars flow into AI infrastructure.\n\nCBRE’s chief executive, Bob Sulentic, believes AI will benefit the business in the long run, with its transaction and investment work “most protected” from disruption.\n\n“Clients engage CBRE to plan and execute complex transactions because of our creativity, strategic thinking, negotiating skills, deep base of market knowledge and broad relationships,” he said. “None of this seems likely to be replaced by AI in the foreseeable future.”",

    "description": "Solopreneurs like Katrina Purcell and Gigi Robinson use AI tools to optimize their content creation, boost efficiency, and enhance lead generation.",
    "fullText": "These days, content creation can feel like a full-time job. For solopreneurs running podcasts or active social channels alongside client work, maintaining a consistent presence can be hard to manage without any teammates.\n\n\"I would not be doing this level of content if I didn't have AI,\" said Katrina Purcell, Fractional COO and host of the Managed Chaos podcast. Purcell produces a weekly podcast and publishes related content across LinkedIn, Substack, and a blog on her website. AI tools like Riverside for transcripts and Gemini for content ideation and creation make it possible, she said.\n\nHere are the specific ways Purcell and two other solopreneurs have integrated AI into their processes to make content creation more seamless.\n\n\"I've never really thought of myself as a content-generating creative person,\" Purcell told Business Insider.\n\nBefore generative AI, she struggled to identify which content from her podcast would perform well on different platforms and often took the \"lazy route\" and simply published the same copy everywhere.\n\nNow, she's trained a custom Gem on Gemini to support her in creating content tailored to different platforms.\n\n\"I gave it the brand guidelines for the podcast, told it that it was adept at SEO, that it knew all the latest content trends, and then I asked it to start coming up with content based on the transcripts,\" she said. Prompts she uses include:\n\nShe'll do some light tweaks and editing, but the AI does most of the heavy lifting.\n\nRecently, she wrote a Substack post based on a podcast episode using this process, and a reader reached out to say how valuable the post was for them, and asked how long it took her. She had to admit it didn't take her long at all, thanks to AI.\n\nPurcell added that she's continually training this Gem on new information about her goals and audience, and always \"closes the content loop\" by telling it how different posts performed.\n\nFor Gigi Robinson, who's been a social media creator since college and now runs a consultancy called Hosts of Influence to help other creators with their brands, creativity was never the bottleneck — it was going from an idea to a finished post.\n\nRather than getting in her head about optimizing every aspect of a post, AI helps her get it done rather than focusing on perfection.\n\nFor instance, she's been able to create LinkedIn videos based on trending news stories quickly. She'll copy and paste parts of a trending article she likes into ChatGPT and ask it to generate specific talking points in her brand voice. From there, she can quickly ad-lib a video without needing to script something out herself. This approach helped her get over 100 million impressions on LinkedIn in just 90 days last year (confirmed from a tracking document viewed by Business Insider) and led to more inbound brand deals from LinkedIn.\n\nRobinson has also found AI video editing tools like Adobe Premiere and OpusClip valuable for a first round of edits. She and her contract interns still make nitpicky tweaks, but it takes much less time than doing everything manually.\n\n\"Before, video editing could take hours. With these tools, getting a cut of the video finalized for posting is usually done in under an hour,\" Robinson said.\n\nEsosa Edosomwan, the coach and nutrition specialist behind The Raw Girl and UMI, still prefers to keep her content creation process largely human-driven after experimenting with AI video and finding her audience doesn't respond to it.\n\nOutside of small things like using Claude to optimize social captions or Nano Banana for video thumbnails, the biggest benefit of AI has been helping her turn social media followers into customers. When she had a piece of content go viral on Instagram early last year, the flood of DMs became impossible to keep up with.\n\nFor help, she turned to the AI tool Manychat. In addition to the automations that send lead magnets — free resources in exchange for contact info — when followers message call-to-action phrases like \"workshop\" or \"hormones,\" she's trained the bot to respond to other messages with her brand and voice, keeping the conversation going.\n\n\"I have even had a couple times where friends thought it was me before realizing it was my chatbot,\" she said. \"That has really helped with inbound leads.\"",

But programmers have recently sounded the alarm that the productivity gains that come from AI can come at a mental cost.\n\nSiddhant Khare, a software engineer who builds AI tools, recently struck a chord with his post about the topic, which he said \"every engineer needs to confront.\" He told Business Insider that some days he used to be able to focus on just one task, but now AI is constantly pulling him in different directions.\n\nSteve Yegge, who worked at Amazon in the early days and spent 12 years at Google, said he and his friends have even started to take naps during the day to cope with exhausting AI coding sprints. He said that companies should consider imposing a 3-hour cap on AI-assisted work.\n\nAI fatigue — which is notably different than simply being tired about hearing about AI or being pressured to use it at work — has become a hot topic among software engineers, but it can also show up in other industries.",

    "description": "The bank listed several reasons for their \"unusually high\" price targets.",
    "fullText": "Two bitcoin-mining stocks have big upside potential, Morgan Stanley analysts say, but it's not tied to a bullish outlook for cryptocurrency.\n\nRather, the companies are well-positioned to convert to data centers to help fuel the AI boom, the bank said in a February 8 client note.\n\nTeraWulf and Cipher Mining have 159% and 158% upside, respectively, said Morgan Stanley in a note initiating coverage of the stocks. Both have seen huge surges in their share price over the last 12 months, with TeraWulf rising 245% and Cipher up 183%.\n\nThe bank listed several reasons for their \"unusually high\" price targets, including:\n\nTeraWulf, in particular, \"has a significant history of building power infrastructure, and has a track record of multiple repeat Bitcoin-toDC conversion transactions with customers,\" a team of analysts led by Stephen C. Byrd said. \"In our view, the company has a viable path to significant annual growth in power and data center capacity, and we include this growth potential in both our base and bull cases.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cipher Mining \"has entered multiple agreements with data center customers, and has assembled a team with significant data center construction experience,\" the analysts said. As of Q2 2025, the firm had no AI power hosting contracts — now, it has 10 and 15 year deals with Google and Amazon, respectively.\n\nFrom June to December 2025, the equity value creation per watt for companies like TeraWulf and Cipher Mining rose from about $7 to $18, signalling strong demand for power.\n\nDespite Morgan Stanley's big upside targets, the bank said there are risks to its outlook. One is that the firms aren't able to execute properly on their conversion to data centers.\n\n\"These data center projects are very large relative to the overall size of the Bitcoin companies, and execution risks could result in project delays and cost overruns,\" the analysts said. \"This, in turn, could result in greater volumes of equity capital to fund these data center projects, which can cause unexpected dilution and financing challenges.\"\n\nAnother is that hyperscalers could start to pull back on AI spending. Investors have grown nervous about AI capex in recent months, as they continue to look for clues about how the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual investments will pay off.\n\n\"We view a slowdown in AI spend as the largest single risk, though the updates from hyperscalers this past week suggest the risk to AI infrastructure capex is to the upside, not to the downside,\" the note said. \"Though the AI infrastructure industry remains under-supplied with power, it is possible that key AI players could moderate their data center capex for any number of reasons.\"",

    "title": "Apple's Big AI Siri Plans Are Once Again Delayed",
    "description": "The new Siri was supposed to launch with iOS 26.4.",
    "fullText": "If you're an Apple fan who closely follows tech news, you might have been looking forward to Siri's big AI overhaul for some time now—specifically, since the company initially announced it at WWDC 2024. But despite delay after delay, rumors have strongly suggested that the next generation of Siri is set to launch with iOS 26.4. And seeing as Apple just released iOS 26.3 this week, AI Siri is closer than ever, right? Wrong.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has once again kicked Siri's big updates down the road. According to Gurman, the company really did intend to release AI Siri with iOS 26.4, which is reportedly planned to release sometime in March. However, due to testing \"snags,\" the company is instead planning to break up Siri's major updates and distribute them across several iOS updates. Gurman notes that likely means iOS 26.5, which could launch in May, and iOS 27, which will likely release in September, if it follows Apple's usual release dates. But looking at Apple's track record here, don't hold your breath.\n\nAccording to Gurman's sources, Apple is struggling to get Siri to \"properly process queries,\" or to actually respond fast enough, both of which would defeat the purpose of using a smart assistant. Apple is reportedly pushing engineers to use iOS 26.5 to test these features, particularly the ability for Siri to use your personal data to answer questions. Users may be able to flip a switch in Settings to \"preview\" these features, and may treat the rollout as a beta.\n\nEngineers are also struggling to get Siri's app intents to work, or the feature that lets Siri take actions on your behalf. You could ask Siri to open an image, edit it, then share it with a friend, but only if the feature itself actually works. This, too, may roll out with iOS 26.5, but it's unclear due to reliability issues. Siri is also cutting off user prompts too soon, and sometimes taps into ChatGPT instead of using Apple's underlying tech—which would look pretty bad for the company.\n\nApple is also testing new AI features for iOS 26.5 that we haven't heard of yet. One is a new web search tool that functions like other AI search features from companies like Perplexity and Google. You ask a question to search on the web, and it returns a report with summaries and links. The other new feature is a custom image generation tool, that builds on Image Playground, but that too is hitting development hurdles.\n\nLooking even further ahead, Apple is planning more Siri advancements—namely, giving the assistant chatbot features, à la ChatGPT. (That said, it will reportedly use Gemini to power these features.) This version of Siri may even have its own app.\n\nIt seems Siri really is Apple's albatross. Despite arguably popularizing smart assistants for the general population, Siri quickly fell behind compared to the likes of Alexa and Gemini (née Google Assistant). Now, the latter have fully embraced modern generative AI, offering features like contextual awareness and natural language commands. While Amazon and Google users can ask their assistants increasingly complicated questions, Siri still feels designed mostly to handle setting alarms and checking the weather.\n\nThat was going to change with iOS 18, alongside Apple Intelligence as a whole. Apple's initial pitch for AI Siri was an assistant that could see what's on your phone to better understand questions you ask, and take actions on your behalf—i.e., app intents. You could ask Siri to edit an image you have pulled up on your Photos app, and because the assistant is contextually aware, it would know what image you mean, and apply the edits you ask for. Or, you could ask when your friend was set to arrive, and the assistant would be able to scan messages and emails to know that, one, your friend is visiting town this weekend, and two, that they sent you their flight itinerary that gets them into the airport at 3:55 p.m.\n\nThis Siri has never launched, however. While the company has rolled out iterative updates to Siri with some AI-powered features, its overhaul with these ambitious features have been a trial for Apple's AI team. It all stems from Apple's issues with AI in general: The company was caught off guard by the generative AI wave kicked off in late 2022 by OpenAI's ChatGPT, and following some resistance from corporate leadership, have been scrambling to keep up ever since. Apple Intelligence launched half-baked with issues of its own, but rather than launch a half-baked AI Siri, the company has been struggling to build up the assistant internally.\n\nPart of the problem is privacy-\n\nApple is the second most valuable tech company in the world, but a host of factors—including with software, hardware, and leadership—have made it so even Apple can't magically produce an AI assistant. Though, I'm not sold that an AI Siri will move units for Apple in the first place. I can't imagine Gemini moves people to Android, and you can download ChatGPT on any device you own. It's even now built into your iPhone.",

    "title": "AI Chatbots Are Even Worse at Giving Medical Advice Than We Thought",
    "description": "Even when they have the “right” information, they can lead you astray.",
    "fullText": "It’s tempting to think that an LLM chatbot can answer any question you pose it, including those about your health. After all, chatbots have been trained on plenty of medical information, and can regurgitate it if given the right prompts. But that doesn’t mean they will give you accurate medical advice, and a new study shows how easily AI’s supposed expertise breaks down. In short, they are even worse at it than I thought.\n\nIn the study, researchers first quizzed several chatbots about medical information. In these carefully conducted tests, ChatGPT-4o, Llama 3, and Command R+ correctly diagnosed medical scenarios an impressive 94% of the time—though they were able to recommend the right treatment a much less impressive 56% of the time.\n\nBut that wasn’t a real-world test for the chatbots medical utility.\n\nThe researchers then gave medical scenarios to 1,298 people, and asked them to use an LLM to figure out what might be going on in that scenario, plus what they should do about it (for example, whether they should call an ambulance, follow up with their doctor when convenient, or take care of the issue on their own).\n\nThe participants were recruited through an online platform that reported it verifies that research subjects are real humans and not bots themselves. Some participants were in a control group that was told to research the scenario on their own, and not using any AI tools. In the end, the no-AI control group did far better than the LLM-using group in correctly identifying medical conditions, including most serious “red flag” scenarios.\n\nAs the researchers write, “Strong performance from the LLMs operating alone is not sufficient for strong performance with users.” Plenty of previous research has shown that chatbot output is sensitive to the exact phrasing people use when asking questions, and that chatbots seem to prioritize pleasing a user over giving correct information.\n\nEven if an LLM bot can correctly answer an objectively phrased question, that doesn’t mean it will give you good advice when you need it. That’s why it doesn’t really matter that ChatGPT can “pass” a modified medical licensing exam—success at answering formulaic multiple choice questions is not the same thing as telling you when you need to go to the hospital.\n\nThe researchers analyzed chat logs to figure out where things broke down. Here are some of the issues they identified:\n\nThe users didn’t always give the bot all of the relevant information. As non-experts, the users certainly didn’t know what was most important to include. If you’ve been to a doctor about anything potentially serious, you know they’ll pepper you with questions to be sure you aren’t leaving out something important. The bots don’t necessarily do that.\n\nThe bots “generated several types of misleading and incorrect information.” Sometimes they ignored important details to narrow in on something else; sometimes they recommended calling an emergency number but gave the wrong one (such as an Australian emergency number for U.K. users).\n\nResponses could be drastically different for similar prompts. In one example, two users gave nearly identical messages about a subarachnoid hemorrhage. One response told the user to seek emergency care; the other said to lie down in a dark room.\n\nPeople varied in how they conversed with the chatbot. For example, some asked specific questions to constrain the bot’s answers, but some let the bot take the lead. Either method could introduce unreliability into the LLM's output.\n\nCorrect answers were often grouped with incorrect answers. On average, each LLM gave 2.21 answers for the user to choose from. People understandably did not always choose correctly from those options.\n\nOverall, people who didn't use LLMs were 1.76 times more likely to get the right diagnosis. (Both groups were similarly likely to figure out the right course of action, but that's not saying much—on average, they only got it right about 43% of the time.) The researchers described the control group as doing \"significantly better\" at the task. And this may represent a best-case scenario: the researchers point out that they provided clear examples of common conditions, and LLMs would likely do worse with rare conditions or more complicated medical scenarios. They conclude: “Despite strong performance from the LLMs alone, both on existing benchmarks and on our scenarios, medical expertise was insufficient for effective patient care.”\n\nPatients may not know how to talk to an LLM, or how to vet its output, but surely doctors would fare better, right? Unfortunately, people in the medical field are also using AI chatbots for medical information in ways that create risks to patient care.\n\nECRI, a medical safety nonprofit, put the misuse of AI chatbots in the number one spot on its list of health technology hazards of 2026. While the AI hype machine is trying to convince you to give ChatGPT your medical information, ECRI correctly points out that it’s wrong to think of these chatbots as having human personalities or cognition: “While these models produce humanlike responses, they do so by predicting the next word based on large datasets, not through genuine comprehension of the information.”\n\nECRI reports that physicians are, in fact, using generative AI tools for patient care, and that research has already shown the serious risks involved. Using LLMs does not improve doctors’ clinical reasoning. LLMs will elaborate confidently on incorrect details included in prompts. Google’s Med-Gemini model, created for medical use, made up a nonexistent body part whose name was a mashup of two unrelated real body parts; Google told a Verge reporter that the mistake was a “typo.”  ECRI argues that “because LLM responses often sound authoritative, the risk exists that clinicians may subconsciously factor AI-generated suggestions into their judgments without critical review.”\n\nEven in situations that don’t seem like life-and-death cases, consulting a chatbot can cause harm. ECRI asked four LLMs to recommend brands of gel that could be used with a certain ultrasound device on a patient with an indwelling catheter near the area being scanned. It’s important to use a sterile gel in this situation, because of the risk of infection. Only one of the four chatbots identified this issue and made appropriate suggestions; the others just recommended regular ultrasound gels. In other cases, ECRI’s tests resulted in chatbots giving unsafe advice on electrode placement and isolation gowns.\n\nClearly, LLM chatbots are not ready to be trusted to keep people safe when seeking medical care, whether you’re the person who needs care, the doctor treating them, or even the staffer ordering supplies. But the services are already out there, being widely used and aggressively promoted. (Their makers are even fighting in the Super Bowl ads.) There’s no good way to be sure these chatbots aren’t involved in your care, but at the very least we can stick with good old Dr. Google—just make sure to disable AI-powered search results.",

    "description": "Anthropic and OpenAI now have their own well-funded political groups that will square off in the midterm elections over artificial intelligence safety and regulation.",
    "fullText": "Silicon Valley’s dueling artificial intelligence start-ups now have dueling super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, the safety-focused A.I. company formed by former OpenAI executives, said on Thursday that it was putting $20 million into a new super PAC operation that will be in opposition to super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors.\n\nThe donation effectively kicks off a new conflict between the rivals, with this year’s midterm elections as the battleground. At the heart of the disagreement between the companies is whether to regulate the artificial intelligence industry with more safety guardrails around the powerful technology. Anthropic generally favors politicians who are more pro-regulation than OpenAI does.\n\nThe New York Times reported in November that the group Anthropic donated to, Public First Action, was in talks with the company to fund its effort to help ensure that OpenAI did not amass too much political power. The regulation-skeptical super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors are called Leading the Future.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, Anthropic did not name OpenAI but warned that “vast resources have flowed to political organizations that oppose” A.I. safety efforts.\n\n“The A.I. policy decisions we make in the next few years will touch nearly every part of public life,” the company wrote. “We don’t want to sit on the sidelines while these policies are developed.”\n\nAnthropic’s funding will supercharge an effort to elect federal lawmakers who favor more extensive A.I. regulation, a position at odds with the Trump administration.\n\nPublic First is a dark-money nonprofit, which means it is not required to disclose its donors but can air television ads on behalf of candidates. On Thursday, it said it would begin a television ad campaign “thanking” Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is running for governor in her state, for her work on tech policy.\n\nPublic First also funds two allied super PACs. One, Defending Our Values PAC, said it would begin an ad campaign on behalf of Senator Pete Ricketts, Republican of Nebraska, who faces re-election in 2026 and has also been outspoken on A.I. safety.\n\nThe Public First effort was started as a rejoinder to the Leading the Future super PACs backed by OpenAI leaders and investors, which have publicly reported raising over $50 million so far. About half of that came from the OpenAI investor Andreessen Horowitz and about half from the family of Greg Brockman, president and co-founder of OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI, which was until recently a traditional nonprofit, has not been allowed to make direct political contributions. But the company has mounted an aggressive Washington policy push over the last several years, which now includes an expressly political component through its aligned super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, by contrast, is making a contribution in its own name. The San Francisco-based company had spent at least five months “actively working” on a super PAC strategy, said Jack Clark, a co-founder, in September, as part of a broader effort to find its way in Washington.\n\nAnthropic’s $20 million contribution carries some political risks. While OpenAI has been largely embraced by the Trump administration, Anthropic and its chief executive, Dario Amodei, have been perceived as a thorn in the White House’s side. Administration officials such as David Sacks, the White House’s A.I. chief, have regularly and publicly criticized Anthropic. Mr. Sacks said in October that the company was promoting a “state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the start-up ecosystem.”",

    "description": ": Like a puppy, a fun new toy soon turns into an unrelenting taskmaster",
    "fullText": "A Harvard Business Review study is answering the question ‘what will employees do if AI saves them time at work?’ The answer: more work.\n\nResearchers Aruna Ranganathan and Xingqi Maggie Ye with University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business studied a set of 40 workers at a 200-employee tech company from April to December last year to see whether generative AI had changed work habits in engineering, product, design, research, and operations.\n\n\"We found that employees worked at a faster pace, took on a broader scope of tasks, and extended work into more hours of the day, often without being asked to do so,\" the researchers wrote. \"Importantly, the company did not mandate AI use (though it did offer enterprise subscriptions to commercially available AI tools). On their own initiative, workers did more because AI made 'doing more' feel possible, accessible, and in many cases intrinsically rewarding.\"\n\nUnfortunately the intensity of the work, the longer hours, and task expansion, led employees to feel stretched too thin, as the added work ate into their personal time.\n\n\"That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making,” the researchers satiated. “The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work, turnover, and other problems.\"\n\nDuring interviews with the employees, researchers found that using generative AI made it easier for employees to begin tasks that may have otherwise been daunting when starting from a blank page. Additionally, they were more willing to take on new responsibilities that had belonged to other roles thanks to a cognitive boost from AI.\n\nBut there were also engineering employees who found themselves checking the work of novice coders for errors, coaching vibe coders, and finishing projects that others had started.\n\nBecause it was easy to start tasks, the workers in the study began to work during breaks, at night and early in the morning, with fewer natural pauses in their workday.\n\n\"What looks like higher productivity in the short run can mask silent workload creep and growing cognitive strain as employees juggle multiple AI-enabled workflows,\" researchers said. \"Because the extra effort is voluntary and often framed as enjoyable experimentation, it is easy for leaders to overlook how much additional load workers are carrying.\"\n\nThe fear is that this could impair judgement, increase the likelihood of errors, and mask unsustainable intensity as productivity gains.\n\n\"For workers, the cumulative effect is fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,\" the paper stated.\n\nEmployees have some cause to fear losing their jobs with Forrester’s most recent AI job replacement research estimates that the technology could uproot 6 percent of jobs by 2030, or about 10.4 million, through robotic process automation, business process automation, physical robotics, and generative AI.\n\nHowever, whether that comes with added productivity is a separate argument. Forrester’s vice president and principal analyst J. P. Gownder recently told The Register he is unconvinced that AI will revolutionize productivity.\n\nThe Berkeley researchers suggested developing a set of standards to prevent burnout.\n\nThis includes \"intentional pauses\" to fight back against the blurred boundaries between roles, regulate the tempo of development, and make sure tasks that begin with one purpose don’t meander from the company’s goals.\n\n\"For example, a decision pause could require, before a major decision is finalized, one counterargument and one explicit link to organizational goals — widening the attention field just enough to protect against drift,” the researchers wrote. \"Incorporating such pauses into everyday workflow is one way organizations can support better decisions, healthier boundaries, and more sustainable forms of productivity in AI-augmented environments.\"\n\nThey also advise organizations to work on projects in coherent phases and to move forward deliberately rather than at the pace that AI might allow them to move. Make the team lead the AI; don’t let the AI lead the team.\n\n“By regulating the order and timing of work — rather than demanding continuous responsiveness — sequencing can help organizations preserve attention, reduce cognitive overload, and support more thoughtful decision-making in AI-forward workplaces,” they wrote.\n\nIntroducing more human interaction can also help prevent the depleting effects of AI-mediated work.\n\n\"As AI enables more solo, self-contained work, organizations can benefit from protecting time and space for listening and human connection. Short opportunities to connect with others—whether through brief check-ins, shared reflection moments, or structured dialogue—interrupt continuous solo engagement with AI tools and help restore perspective.\" ®",

    "fullText": "A seasoned veteran said his fellow software engineers need to learn \"how to say 'no,' real fast\" or risk getting crushed by AI.\n\nSteve Yegge, who worked with Jeff Bezos at Amazon early on before 12-year stint at Google, said AI is set up in a way that can really drain you.\n\n\"There's a vampiric effect with AI, where it gets you excited, and you work really hard, and you're capturing a ton of value,\" he recently told the \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" newsletter/podcast.\n\nYegge said companies also need to understand that while agentic AI may make engineers more productive than ever before, pushing the limit will just burn out their workforce.\n\n\"I seriously think founders and company leaders and engineering leaders at all levels, all the way down to line managers, have to be aware of this and realize that you might only get three productive hours out of a person who's vibe coding at max speed,\" he said. \"So, do you let them work for three hours a day? The answer is yes, or your company's going to break.\"\n\nEngineers are beginning to vocalize concerns about \"AI fatigue.\" Business Insider recently spoke to Siddhant Khare, who builds AI tools, and wrote an essay about how AI has accelerated the pace of his job to a point that it was burning him out.\n\nYegge said that his fellow engineers need to set boundaries when they are vibe coding.\n\n\"People have to learn the art of pushing back,\" he said.\n\nUntil then, Yegge said he and his fellow engineers are napping and growing grumpier.\n\n\"I find myself napping during the day, and I'm talking to friends at startups, and they're finding themselves napping during the day,\" he said. \"We're starting to get tired and cranky.\"",

    "fullText": "AI agents should be treated like employees who need vetting before they're trusted with real work, says Cisco's president.\n\nJeetu Patel said in an interview with Euonews Next published on Wednesday that AI agents working on our behalf \"need to get the background checks done,\" just like human employees.\n\nAs companies race to deploy autonomous AI systems that can write code, handle workflows, and make decisions, security needs to evolve just as quickly, he said.\n\n\"You have to protect the agent from the world of attacks, and you have to protect the world from the agent that goes rogue,\" he added.\n\nPatel's comments come as Cisco accelerates its own AI adoption. He predicts that by the end of 2026, the company will have \"at least half a dozen products\" written entirely with AI, with no human-written lines of code, he said.\n\n\"We won't have developers at Cisco that don't use AI as a core habit within the way that they get the job done,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't worry about AI taking your job, but worry about someone using AI better than you definitely taking your job,\" he added.\n\nTech leaders are going all in on AI agents.\n\nStackBlitz CEO Eric Simons told Business Insider he wants more AI agents than human employees at his startup this year — a milestone that reflects a broader transformation sweeping the software industry.\n\nAI can already write code, manage tasks, and coordinate across platforms. OpenClaw, a personal AI assistant that works across messaging apps, is one example of how agents can operate on a human's behalf with minimal involvement.\n\n\"This is a crystal ball into the wildness of the inevitable future,\" Simons told Business Insider in a report published Wednesday.\n\n\"Your AI agents will talk to other people's agents on your behalf — negotiating pricing for a product you want to buy, checking restaurant availability, even arguing your political viewpoints,\" he added.\n\nSoftware stocks slid in recent weeks as investors grappled with the idea that AI may replace software.\n\nStill, there are warning signs. Agentic systems can become fragile at scale. If hallucinations multiply as agents interact, small errors can cascade, said Nicolas Darveau-Garneau, a former Google executive and author of \"Be a Sequoia, Not a Bonsai.\"\n\n\"The only way we get massive productivity gains is the day we can trust that the AI isn't hallucinating a lot,\" Darveau-Garneau said.",

    "title": "Author of viral 'Something Big is Coming' essay says AI helped him write it — and that proves his point",
    "description": "Matt Shumer said he wrote his viral essay for people like his dad who are skeptical of AI or just trying to avoid it entirely.",
    "fullText": "The author of the viral essay warning about impending AI disruption says he couldn't wait any longer to get the word out.\n\n\"Let's say there is just a 20% chance of it happening, which is maybe realistic, maybe underselling it,\" Matt Shumer, GP of Shumer Capital, said during an interview with Business Insider. \"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare.\"\n\nThe people in tech who previously warned about AI's impact were mostly speaking to others in the industry, he said. Shumer said he wanted something that spoke to his dad, a lawyer who is just a few years from retirement and is hopeful he can run out the clock on the potential massive change on the horizon.\n\nHe's certainly found an audience.\n\nHis essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" has been viewed over 60 million times on X alone, as of Wednesday evening. In the nearly 5,000-word post, Shumer wrote that AI's disruption to people's lives could be \"much bigger\" than COVID — a comparison that has drawn some pushback online. He also wrote that what he's seeing in tech is likely what awaits other industries.\n\n\"I don't know that this is coming for sure, but I think a lot of us in tech really see this progress, and it's frankly dizzying, and there's a good chance of this,\" he said. \"And the more people know, the better.\"\n\nShumer is not alone in his fears about the future.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who is known for writing eyebrow-raising essays of his own, has said that up to half of all entry-level, white-collar jobs may be wiped out in the next one to five years. xAI CEO Elon Musk has called AI a \"supersonic tsunami\" that will quickly eliminate jobs that don't involve physical labor.\n\nShumer said even he is unsettled about the prospects of AI. After all, he's 26 and still near the beginning years of his career. In 2020, he cofounded OthersideAI, which later spawned HyperWrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\n\"I don't know how many more years of my career there will be if this all actually comes to pass,\" he told Business Insider. \"So, it's frankly a little confusing and terrifying for someone like me.\"\n\nPart of the issue is that AI is unlikely to affect all industries in the same way or at the same time, making career advice highly dependent on a person's specific situation.\n\n\"If you're a nurse, you're probably going to be fine for quite some time,\" he told Business Insider, adding that junior associates at law school face significantly more risk because many of the introductory-type tasks they do are already being targeted by AI companies.\n\nIn his essay, Shumer wrote that his realization of what's in store came after his experience with OpenAI's GPT-5.3-Codex, which was released last week. In its release notes, OpenAI said GPT-5.3-Codex was its \"first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\" Shumer wrote that AI is now capable of doing his technical work.\n\nAs for the other tasks, Shumer has been quite open about how AI helped him write his viral essay about AI. He said he spent hours working with Claude to craft his message.\n\n\"It did help a lot,\" he told TBPN on Wednesday, \"and I think that's kind of the point.\"\n\nIt's why Shumer's message to everyone who turned away from AI, perhaps after a clunky experience with an early version of ChatGPT years ago, is that they should seize the opportunity to see the breadth of what the technology can do now.\n\n\"If you look back 10 years from now and this did come to pass, you'll be very glad you did,\" he told Business Insider.",

    "title": "These are the most Gen Z Olympics yet. Oversharing, activism, and AI are all on the podium.",
    "description": "Norway's Sturla Holm Lægreid overshared at the Winter Olympics with his infidelity confession. It's an example of how Gen Z has taken over the games.",
    "fullText": "Can you remember the last time a bronze medalist became the big story out of an Olympic event? Here's one for you: During his post-race interview, Norway's Sturla Holm Lægreid didn't talk about the run he'd completed, which earned him the bronze medal in men's biathlon. Instead, he chose to tell the world about how he cheated on his ex-girlfriend.\n\n\"I told her a week ago. And it's been the worst week of my life,\" Lægreid told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. \"Sports has taken a bit of a back seat these past couple of days. Yeah, I wish I could share this with her.\"\n\nLægreid later apologized to the gold medalist and his ex-girlfriend, saying he deeply regretted sharing about his breakup, in a statement through the Norwegian Olympic team. He didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHis impulse, however, is a particularly Gen Z one. Was it a public display of accountability? Maybe. Was it classic oversharing at work? Definitely.\n\nGen Z has been in the Olympics since 2016, but this winter feels like the first Olympics where they are truly dominating the competition. The median age of Team USA at this year's games is about 28. In banner sports like figure skating and snowboarding, the median age is closer to 23. The Gen Z energy is undeniable in how these athletes conduct themselves on the world stage. Whether it's oversharing about their relationships, speaking out on politics, or using AI in performance, it's the Gen Z Olympics, and we're just watching it.\n\nSome of Team USA's most high-profile athletes are Gen Zers. Skating's \"Quad God\" Ilia Malinin, 21, shares the same name as one of the main characters on the gay hockey romance show \"Heated Rivalry,\" a favorite of Gen Z lookalike competitions. On the women's side, does anyone look more Gen Z than alt-girl figure skater Alysa Liu? With skunk stripe hair, tooth gems, and a frenulum piercing, she reps the alt scene that's making a comeback with the youth.\n\nThen there's Liu's teammate Amber Glenn, whose career follows Gen Z's tendency toward late blooming. She's making her Olympic debut at 26, which is slightly older than the typical age for female figure skaters. Liu and Isabeau Levito — the third US women's figure skating teammate — are 20 and 18 years old, respectively.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be Gen Z without a dash of political engagement and a public statement. Glenn, who is openly pansexual, directly addressed discrimination against the queer community under President Trump at a press conference on Feb. 4.\n\n\"I hope that I can use my platform and my voice throughout these Games to try to encourage people to stay strong,\" Glenn told reporters.\n\nWhen asked about the turmoil around ICE at a different press conference, members of the US ski team didn't shy away from voicing their opinions, either. Hunter Hess, 27, talked about the \"mixed emotions\" of repping the US while ICE raids were happening at home.\n\n\"There's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren't. Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the U.S.,\" Hess said.\n\nThe Olympics aren't untouched by AI either — a Czech ice dancing pair used a music mix that was half AI-generated for their rhythm dance. It's also not the first time that these skaters, who are 19 and 22 years old, have used AI music for a routine, which at least shows they're pretty LLM-native and the Olympic Committee is okay with it.\n\nIf that grinds your gears a little, just be thankful Gen Alpha hasn't hit the scene yet. Can you imagine how many celebratory 6-7s we'll be subject to?",

    "description": "A software veteran predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers.",
    "fullText": "Software engineers are getting crushed by AI, and they think you're next.\n\nAI's ability to automate code is simultaneously making developers productive and overworked. One technologist said his job is harder than ever, lamenting that \"AI fatigue\" is real.\n\nThe good news is it won't last forever. The bad news is that's because most of them will be out of a job.\n\nSoftware veteran Steve Yegge predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers. (He wasn't a total drag. Yegge offered advice to software engineers for avoiding the 'vampiric effect' of AI.)\n\n\"Ok, but I don't work in tech. Why do I care?\" you callously ask. (So cold!)\n\nWell, according to the people in the thick of it, AI isn't stopping with them.\n\nMatt Shumer, the CEO of an AI startup, warned AI's disruption will be \"much bigger\" than COVID. The post has racked up more than 69 million views on X, gaining traction outside traditional tech circles. Shumer spoke to BI's Brent D. Griffiths about the post and the fact that he (surprise!) used AI to help him write it.\n\nIt's worth noting Shumer's company specializes in AI personal assistants. He certainly benefits from getting people on board with AI. But that doesn't invalidate a lot of his points about workers needing to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.\n\nThere's a counterargument to the doomsday prophecy.\n\nMaybe engineering jobs are especially ripe for AI disruption?\n\nThe job, after all, is highly digital and requires hard skills, two factors that make it a strong candidate for AI automation.\n\nSoftware engineers have also been somewhat insulated from the tech-based disruptions the rest of us have endured and adapted to during the pre-AI times. A new tool here. A new app there. At some point, many of us have gotten numb to tech disrupting what we do. You just figure out how to adapt.\n\nMeanwhile, software engineers were living on easy street. You don't have to worry about the tools when you're the ones building them. For years, software developers enjoyed healthy salaries, good work-life balance, and fantastic job security.\n\nNow the tables are turned, and suddenly it's everyone's problem?\n\nI'm not suggesting AI won't impact the rest of us. For starters, entry-level jobs across the board appear to be on the chopping block thanks to AI. Consultants also seem ripe for some shakeups. And the legal industry is certainly feeling the heat.\n\n(I could mention journalism, but we were on the extinction list long before AI. When I started college in 2007, my professors all told me the industry was dying. Almost two decades later, we're still here. If anything, it looks like AI has created some high-paying jobs for writers.)\n\nAI might end up being massively disruptive for all of us, but at this point, we're all used to it.\n\nWhere do you stand on the AI doomsday prophecy?

    "description": "Connecting AI agents to your database via MCP? You're missing half the picture. Add your app's source code to unlock domain-aware product insights.",
    "fullText": "Product managers, analysts, and developers are connecting their AI agents to databases via MCP. This can give some product answers—but it’s like looking at a blueprint of an apartment.\n\nA blueprint missings details about the rooms, the furniture and the people living in the apartment.\n\nYou’re missing your application domain language.\n\nYour application sourcode is what’s missing for you to see what’s going on inside the apartment.\n\nI will show examples adapted from real life work of how connecting an AI Agent to a copy of your application sourcecode and your application database allows to ask domain specific questions (thanks to the domain logic stored in the app source code) and leverage the latest application data (ideally from a production replica database connection) to generate insights and solve bugs.\n\nNew to LLMs, MCPs, agents? Read my primer for some core concepts.\n\nWhen your Agent has access to an MCP connected to your database and you ask it:\n\nHow many document extracts are complete?\n\nA database MCP like dbhub will allow the Agent to answer based on the limited visibility gained from the database layout. A blueprint. The Agent will do its best but probably fall in to guess work based on the limited context which in this case is just what the MCP can see (table, column names and data).\n\nAn MCP connected only to your application database won’t have access to your application / domain specific language.\n\nIt’s gonna add critical details to the blueprint of your apartment. The Agent will be able to tell where the furniture is and what each room really is. The Agent will be able to give better answers without guess work.\n\nAnd when the MCP is connected to a production replica… you’ll get live insights.\n\nI thought it would be interesting way to see the value and pitfalls of this approach trough real conversations I had with Claude Code. I simplified the domain and stripped the conversations from any internal metrics and nuances to respect client confidentiality.\n\nLet’s say your application handles thousands of document extracting informations. These extractions can be in several states. If you asked the following prompt to an Agent that’s just connected to your application database via a DB MCP mcp__appdb_prod_replica:\n\nhow many document extract records are pending?\n\nI'll query the database to count \"pending\" items. First, I'll locate the relevant extract tables/columns and confirm what \"pending\" maps to.\n\nPending wasn't explicitly defined, so the assistant will try to inferred it from the schema default (status default = 0) and validated by counting grouped status. This happen to be correct but what if your app defines \"pending\" differently (e.g., another field called progress or a status/progress combo)?\n\nHere the tool call to the DB MCP found multiple tables matching document extract... but he guessed the right one.\n\n\"Pending\" is likely represented by a default status value. I'll enumerate status values to confirm counts.\n\nIf \"pending\" corresponds to status = 0 (the column default), then pending items = 23,208. Full status distribution: 0→23,208; 1→143; 2→168; 3→19,029.\n\nSo the Agent made an assumption and it turns out it was correct. The value for 0 are the records in default / pending state.\n\nBut if I asked “how many document extract records are running?” the Agent would not find any reference about a “running” status and allucinate!\n\nhow many document extract records are running?\n\nI'll query the database to find records that are currently running. Let me first explore the relevant tables.\n\nI see a status column. Let me check the distribution of values.\n\nLooking at the status values, I can see four states: 0, 1, 2, and 3. Status 0 is the default (likely \"new\" or \"queued\"), and status 3 has the highest non-default count suggesting \"completed\". Between 1 and 2, status 2 has a slightly higher count—in most workflow systems, \"running\" or \"in progress\" states tend to accumulate more records than transient error states.\n\nThere are 168 document extract records currently running.\n\nWrong. The agent guessed status 2 means \"running\" based on workflow pattern assumptions. But status 2 is actually \"failed\" and status 1 is \"running\". A plausible-sounding explanation that's completely incorrect—the real answer is 143, not 168.\n\nSome might say “Yeah AI sometime is wrong, humans are wrong too”… yeah right but this Agent + DB MCP is going to Vegas! Its guessing is due to a limited architecture. But it’s very easy to enhance it.\n\nLet’s see what happens when you run the same prompt but giving the Agent access to the application source code.\n\nIn the following conversations Claude Code was running from a directory with a copy of the application sourcecode.\n\nI didn’t even tell it about it. It just found and used the application sourcecode to fill in the gaps in its context. Now the Agent with the application domain language can get us much more useful responses.\n\nhow many document extract records are processing?\n\nI'll search for document extract tables and check the status values to find items that are currently processing.\n\nLet me check the distinct status values to identify which one represents \"processing\".\n\nNotice Claude sees 0, 2, and 3—but no status 1. Rather than assuming like it did earlier, it now checks the application source code to understand what these enum values actually mean. (enums map the status numbers to meaningful sentences)\n\nLet me check the model to understand what these status values mean.\n\n- 0 = pending\n- 1 = running\n- 2 = failed\n- 3 = completed\n\nLet me confirm by querying specifically for the \"processing\" status (1).\n\n143 document extract records are currently processing.\n\nHere's the breakdown of all status:\n\nThis is a simplified example but with the same approach you can leverage your application domain language and generate any kinda of insights.\n\nIn a brand new context free chat I instead of the raw application sourcecode I gave access to a Repomix file instead of the raw sourcode.\n\nThink of raw sourcecode as a filing cabinet stuffed with folders. Repomix turns it into a single searchable document—an index the agent can scan in seconds instead of opening drawer after drawer.\n\nWe’ll end up with a similar result:\n\nuse the @repomix-output.xml with the appdb production replica and find out how many document extract records are processing?\n\nI'll read the repomix output file and search for information about document extract records and their progresses.\n\nLet me search \n\nI found the status enum. The document_extract_records table has a status column with values: pending (0), running (1), failed (2), completed (3).\n\nLet me query the database to find how many items are currently processing.\n\nBased on the database query, here are the results:\n\nThere are currently 143 document extract records in the \"processing\" status.\n\nThe system has:\n 23,208 items pending\n 143 items currently processing\n 168 items that failed to import\n 19,029 items successfully processed\n\nRepomix will allow you to package parts of your code in “AI-friendly” ways so instead of the full codebase you’d leverage only the context that is needed.\n\nTo replicate this workflow, you need to provide your Agent with two distinct “eyes”: one for your static logic (code) and one for your dynamic state (database).\n\nWe use the DBHub MCP to give the Agent a secure, structured way to explore the database. You can connect this to a local download of your db or for most up to date insights to an ssh-tunneled read-only production replica (that’s what I do).\n\nThe Agent needs to see your “Domain Language”—the enums and constants that live in your files.\n\nI use Claude Code integrated in VS Code, but several other agentic clients handle this workflow natively: Cursor (excellent codebase indexing), Cline and Roo Code (VS Code extensions), and Goose (CLI-first, built by Block). Any of these will work.\n\nDownload a snapshot of the database and connect your DB MCP to that local copy. You’ll lose real-time data but keep the domain language benefits.\n\nStart with just the codebase access. Have your agent generate queries based on the domain logic, then run those queries manually in your DB console. Show the value, iterate, build trust.\n\nThe solution: Curate what matters\n\nYou don’t need your entire codebase—just the parts that define your domain language:\n\nRepomix with filters - Use .repomixignore to exclude tests, vendor code, and UI components. Focus on app/models/, lib/, and domain logic.\n\nGit submodules - Create a separate “domain context” repo that pulls in only the relevant directories from your main codebase.\n\nManual selection - In Claude Code/Cursor, use @filename to reference specific model files instead of loading the whole project.\n\nFor the last 12 months I’ve been integrating this flow in my lead product role and enabling analysts and developers on my team.\n\nBut this approach leverages the domain language already present in your application source code. Combined with a powerful AI model and a DB MCP, it lets you ask domain-specific questions and generate meaningful product insights.\n\nAlways keep a critical mindset and observe these 3 pillars, even more meaningful now in the age of AI-generated content:\n\nNow you’ve seen how to effectively leverage your app sourcecode when using Agents and MCPs. An often overlooked detail that I hope will help you in becoming even more effective at generating product insights on your software with the help of AI.",

He is likely to use his speech to address a number of key issues such as Singaporean concerns over jobs and rising cost of living. PM Wong is also expected to position Singapore as an AI hub and provide an update on Singapore’s Economic Strategy Review. Economists believe this year’s Budget could see a scaling back of the the generous Community Development Council (CDC) voucher scheme seen in previous Budgets.\n\nThe Philippine Embassy in Singapore and the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) are both aware of a video circulating online showing a man assaulting a Filipina at Lucky Plaza. DMW Secretary Hans Cacdac was quoted as saying they are looking into it and filing the necessary legal actions.\n\nRead \n\nPrime Minister Lawrence Wong will deliver his 2026 Budget speech on Thursday (12 Feb) at 3.30pm.\n\nThe Budget will be broadcast live on Mediacorp’s Channel 5 but you can also watch a livestream on PM Wong’s own YouTube channel, among other options.\n\nWhat may feature in Budget 2026:\n\nMore support measures for workers will be announced. PM Wong made this point in a YouTube video posted on Wednesday (11 Feb).\n\nPM Wong will likely use his Budget speech to position Singapore as an artificial intelligence (AI) hub, says Bloomberg.\n\nWith a focus on AI, the Government will need to address its potential affect on jobs. Retraining of workers will likely be a significant topic too.\n\nExpect to see more on social safety nets as with Budget 2025 as cost of living concerns remain for an ageing population.\n\nAn update on Singapore’s Economic Strategy Review, which launched last year, is also expected.\n\nThe generous Community Development Council (CDC) voucher scheme in previous Budgets could be scaled back in Budget 2026, with economists expecting smaller payouts and tighter income criteria.\n\nA man is seen arguing with a woman and then kicking her in viral videos taken at Lucky Plaza mall in Orchard Road. Police are now investigating the incident, reports the Straits Times on Thursday (12 Feb).\n\nPolice told the newspaper that a police report was lodged and investigations are ongoing.\n\nEarlier, the Philippine Embassy in Singapore said they were aware of the videos and confirmed the woman who was attacked is a Filipina. Lucky Plaza is a well-known hangout spot for foreign domestic workers on Sundays.\n\n“We continue to closely monitor the situation and remain in contact with the victim to help ensure her safety and well-being,” the embassy said in a statement.\n\nThe Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) told GMA News they are looking into the possibility of legal action, as reported earlier in this blog on Thursday.\n\nEnforcement operations against motorists who commit traffic violations and cut queues at Woodlands Checkpoint will be stepped up from 13 to 17 February.\n\nThe operations will be carried out by the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and the Traffic Police.\n\n“Failure to maintain lane discipline and obey traffic rules can cause severe congestion and compromise the safety of other motorists,” ICA said in a Facebook statement on Thursday (12 February).\n\nErrant drivers of foreign-registered vehicles may face entry bans, while Singapore drivers may be referred to the Traffic Police for further investigations and penalties.\n\nMotorists caught engaging in queue cutting will be made to re-queue, warned ICA.\n\nFour-room flats in Tampines had the highest application rates among first-time home buyers in HDB’s latest Build-To-Order (BTO) sales exercise, according to data shared by National Development Minister Chee Hong Tat on Wednesday (11 Feb).\n\nAn application rate is the number of applicants divided by the number of units available. The lower the rate, the higher the chances of success are for the applicant.\n\nChee said, as of 5pm on Wednesday, there had been 14,052 BTO applications. He also listed the following application rates:\n\nBukit Merah (Redhill Peaks): 0.7 for 3-room / 2.0 for 4-room\n\nSembawang (Sembawang Deck): 1.3 for 3-room\n\nSembawang (Sembawang Deck/Sembawang Voyage): 0.6 for 4-room; 0.4 for 5-room\n\nTampines (Tampines Bliss): 3.4 for 3-room\n\nTampines (Tampines Bliss/Tampines Nova): 6.8 for 4-room\n\nToa Payoh (Kim Keat Crest): 0.6 for 3-room; 0.8 for 4-room\n\nApplications closed at 11.59pm on 11 February on the HDB Flat Portal.\n\nYou can \n\nTwo grandsons of OCBC Bank’s founding father Lee Kong Chian have bought big-ticket properties recently, noted the Business Times on Wednesday (11 Feb).\n\nBT’s report said Lee Shih Kwei is acquiring a freehold bungalow in Barker Road for $43.2 million. This follows the recent purchase of two units at the Seven Palms Sentosa Cove condominium for $23.9m by his brother Lee Shih Hua.\n\nKeir Starmer has told Jim Ratcliffe to apologise after the Manchester United co-owner claimed the UK is being “colonised” by immigrants.\n\nRatcliffe, who has lived in tax-free Monaco since 2020, made the comments in an interview with Sky News. “You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money.”\n\nUK Prime Minister Starmer responded to the remarks on social media platform X, calling it “offensive and wrong.”\n\n“Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country. Jim Ratcliffe should apologise,” Starmer said.\n\nOffensive and wrong.\n\nBritain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country.\n\nJim Ratcliffe should apologise.https://t.co/7mSnVV33oo\n\n— Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) February 11, 2026\n\nJames Van Der Beek, known for his starring role in the ‘Dawson’s Creek’ TV show, has died at the age of 48 following a battle with colorectal cancer.\n\nHis wife, Kimberly Van Der Beek, confirmed the sad news in an Instagram announcement on Wednesday (11 Feb). “Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace,” Kimberly said.\n\nShe added: “There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.”\n\nVan Der Beek was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in August 2023. He only went public with his stage III cancer battle in November 2024.\n\nThe Philippine Embassy in Singapore says it has taken note of a video circulating online showing a man assaulting a Filipina at Lucky Plaza.\n\nThe Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) has also weighed in, adding that they are looking into the possibility of legal action, reports GMA News.\n\n“It’s assault, physical assault. It’s a crime anywhere in the world, especially in Singapore. We are looking into it and filing the necessary legal actions,” DMW Secretary Hans Cacdac was quoted as saying.\n\nThe woman has been identified as a Philippine national working in Singapore. It remains unclear what sparked the violent scenes.\n\n“The Embassy, through the Migrant Workers Office (MWO) and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), is taking appropriate measures and has reached out to the victim to provide the necessary assistance,” read a statement from The Philippine Embassy. “At this stage, we are mindful not to disclose details that could inadvertently affect ongoing measures or aggravate the situation.”",

    "fullText": "Six US states are pushing legislation to put a moratorium on artificial intelligence (AI) data center construction.\n\nYahoo Finance Breaking Business News Reporter Jake Conley joins Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to outline the details of these bills and the potential ramifications down the road.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nWhich states are pushing back and why are they pushing back?\n\nYeah, Josh, you've got six states with bills being considered right now. You've got Oklahoma, Vermont, and Maryland, but also three major hubs, New York, Georgia, and Virginia, home to Data Center alley in the Lowden area.\n\nThose back three have been huge sites of development. These bills are structured in a few different ways, but the basic underlying principle\n\nis that they look to put a moratorium on data center development. Essentially saying from roughly one year to a roughly three-year window,\n\nyou cannot develop here, you cannot build here until certain hurdles are met or until we get a pipeline cleaned up of requests or ex-conditions are met.\n\nBut essentially this is saying to those developers, these states, if these bills pass, will be walled off to you.\n\nAnd the the real argument here is infrastructure strain. These data centers suck up a lot of energy. They suck up a lot of water. That's going to put pressure on rate payers bills. You already see electricity bills hiking in these areas that have had a lot of development.\n\nYou see water strain in those areas. The grid is under a lot of stress. And so lawmakers are now trying to get ahead of that and saying, wait, wait, wait, slow down. Let's get some stuff on the books, get some regulations in place. But to do that, we want a breather.\n\nWhat what are the chances uh that these bills actually do pass, Jake?\n\nThey're going to face an uphill battle for a few reasons. You got to remember these data centers bring jobs. They bring tax revenue.\n\nAlso, the companies that are behind these centers, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, these aren't easy to push aside. These are companies with real political heft and firepower, with real pressure. And a lot of these governors are at least nominally pro-development.\n\nSo the argument they're going to come up against from these data center developers is, hey, we're bringing you jobs. We're bringing you revenue. Why would you stop us from building? And they're going to face that same kind of push back from business interests, business lobby.\n\nEven if these bills don't go through, you could still see and probably still will see some kind of regulation, cost sharing agreements, water usage parameters. But the focus right now because of their top line impact is on these moratoriums.\n\nHow much, Jake final question, could this all sort of disrupt the great AI ambitions and dreams of Big Tech?\n\nI think the rule with the hyper scales right now is speed, right? There's an arms race going on. You see these companies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on building out this infrastructure. And the game here right now for for Microsoft, for Google, for all these companies building these out is speed.\n\nHow fast can we get these things put up to power the compute that we're trying to put into the market. Any kind of delay there is going to hurt those companies and slow them down.\n\nI was talking to someone today who works in site selection advising these companies on where to go. She was telling me you're already seeing people inside these companies take a second look at some of these spots and say maybe that's not the right idea. Maybe we go somewhere\n\nwith less laws on the rest proposals on the books. The problem is those areas have less infrastructure. So you're going to run into problems wherever you go.\n\nBut regardless, especially in these kind of bigger sites, bigger states where a lot of this development is happening, when the rule of speed, anything that's going to slow speed down is going to be detrimental.\n\nAll right, big story. Thank you Jake for covering it. Appreciate it. Thanks.",

    "description": "Anthropic pledged to cover all grid upgrade costs for its AI data centers, saying households shouldn't foot the bill.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic says it's going to foot the bill for electricity price increases tied to its data centers.\n\n\"We will pay for 100% of the grid upgrades needed to interconnect our data centers,\" Anthropic said in a blog post published Wednesday, adding that it will absorb costs that might otherwise be passed on to American households.\n\nAnthropic said it will secure additional power to avoid pushing up electricity prices and invest in \"grid optimization tools\" designed to reduce strain and keep prices low.\n\n\"The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,\" Anthropic said. \"But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.\"\n\nAnthropic's pledge comes months after the company said it is investing $50 billion in AI infrastructure in the US, beginning with data centers in Texas and New York.\n\nTech giants are pouring staggering sums into AI infrastructure as they race to expand data center capacity, a buildout that has drawn scrutiny over rising electricity costs.\n\nIn November, Meta said it would invest $600 billion in the US \"to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.\" Apple said in August it would add another $100 billion to its US infrastructure spending, bringing its total investment to $600 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, utility bills are climbing. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate increases from state regulators last year, more than double the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many utilities have cited power demand from data centers as the key factor for rate increases.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has urged Big Tech to prevent data centers from pushing up electricity costs.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote last month in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nMicrosoft last month introduced similar measures, saying it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the cost of its data centers' electricity use and reduce the impact of its data center expansion on local residents.",

    "fullText": "With many unable to access or afford qualified therapists, AI is filling the mental healthcare vacuum, amid calls for tighter regulation\n\nOn a quiet evening in her Abuja hotel, Joy Adeboye, 23, sits on her bed clutching her phone, her mind racing and chest tightening. On her screen is yet another abusive message from her stalker – a man she had met nine months earlier at her church.\n\nHe had asked Adeboye out; when she declined, he began sending her intimidating, insulting and blackmailing messages on social media, as well as spreading false information about her online. There were even death threats.\n\nThe experience is taking its toll on her mental health, leaving her struggling to cope. Family and friends she confided in did not take it seriously, and she cannot afford in-person therapy or counselling. As the feeling of panic rose at the sight of his words, she turns to an alternative: a WhatsApp chatbot called Chat Kemi.\n\n“Good evening, Resilient Joy,” the bot types. “How are you today?”\n\n Adeboye hesitates, then starts typing: “Someone is defaming me online and threatening to kill me, because I refused to date him. I am depressed and confused. What should I do?”\n\nThe chatbot, which Adeboye had heard about at an event on gender-based violence run by an NGO, advises her to deactivate her social media accounts and provide all necessary information about the person making the threats to someone she trusts.\n\nFor the first time in months, Adeboye says, she felt less alone.\n\nAI platforms offering first-line mental health support have proliferated over the past year, with early trials in the US showing mixed results. In Nigeria, where AI has been embraced in many sectors and industries, a growing number of people turn to chatbots for virtual therapy.\n\nNigeria’s health system, including its mental health provision, has long been underfunded. Between 2015 and 2025, Nigeria has consistently spent less than 5% of its budget to healthcare, with 4.2% allocated for 2026, far less than the 15% target that African Union member states agreed to as part of the 2001 Abuja Declaration. It is not known how many people in Nigeria live with mental health conditions but, with only 262 psychiatrists in a country of 240 million people, most do not get adequate treatment.\n\nThe shortages have been exacerbated by the Trump administration dismantling USAID, which has badly hit services in Nigeria, especially at the primary level, having a devastating effect on patients in communities already struggling with HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and other health challenges. More than 90% of Nigerians have no health insurance, and now face uncertainty over access to services and feelings of helplessness over rising costs.\n\nPrivate healthcare is expensive; one therapy session can cost between 50,000 naira (£27) – the equivalent of a week’s worth of groceries. Cultural stigma remains strong; many Nigerians still associate mental illness with spiritual weakness or witchcraft.\n\nCommercial and nonprofit AI initiatives are starting to fill this vacuum. HerSafeSpace is an organisation that offers free and instant legal and emotional assistance to victims of technology-facilitated gender-based violence in five west and central African countries. Its Chat Kemi service is available in local and international languages.\n\n“These services don’t replace therapy,” says its founder, Abideen Olasupo. Instead, the chatbot uses a referral system to direct users and specific cases to mental health, legal or psychosocial professionals or organisations, should the need arise.\n\n“Our major objective is to support young girls, who are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially online,” he says.\n\nOther platforms in Nigeria offering similar services include FriendnPal, whose AI chatbot provides emotional support, matches patients with licensed therapists and includes mood tracking, psycho-education and ASMR tools to alleviate stress and anxiety.\n\nIts pay-as-you-go model gives users instant access to tailored therapy sessions that can include homework or assessments, according to Esther Eruchie, who created the service in response to the loss of her mother after years of depression caused by her 20-year-old brother’s death.\n\nAnother platform, Blueroomcare, connects clients with licensed therapists through video, voice, text and in-app messaging. It offers in-person outpatient and virtual care at partner clinics nationwide, includes a free wellness assessment, and charges between 5,000 and 51,000 naira for a therapist subscription plan.\n\n“Therapy was often too expensive, and there weren’t enough professionals to meet the demand,” says Moses Aiyenuro, who founded Blueroomcare after his own struggles with depression. “I wanted to build a platform that lowers the barriers to care.”\n\nThe technology used by these apps follows scripts written by licensed Nigerian psychologists and therapists who deliver care to users.\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakemi Oluwakayode, a mother of four, started using FriendnPal’s chatbot after watching her eight-year-old daughter endure frequent seizures due to cerebral palsy.\n\n“Sometimes, it gave very standard replies,” she admits. “But I could finally say things I couldn’t share with my family. That alone gave me relief.”\n\nLater, the app connected her with a licensed therapist – something she says she would never have considered without AI easing her into it.\n\nDr Joy Aifuobhokhan, a Lagos-based public health doctor, says these platforms’ advantage is that they are more affordable and efficient than conventional therapy. “Digital platforms save time otherwise spent preparing, commuting and waiting [to be seen] at physical consultation centres,” she says.\n\nBut some experts caution that AI cannot provide the same level of expertise as a qualified therapist. “These platforms borrow from clinical methods like CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] and mindfulness,” says Dr Nihinlola Olowe, a psychologist at Live Still Counselling Services, a Nigerian-based mental health practice.\n\n“They can be useful for coping, but they cannot replace the depth or judgment of professional care.”\n\nEruchie says FriendnPal has run more than 10,000 sessions in the past year, while Olasupo says HerSafeSpace has 1,600 users across three continents. Blueroomcare declined to say how many users it had.\n\nBut measuring the impact based on numbers alone is a challenge. “The real story lies in the engagement,” says Olasupo. “It’s exciting to see that users aren’t just using the app and leaving – they’re coming back again and again.”\n\nFor many patients, the immediacy and anonymity of a chatbot is key to its appeal but the ease of digital care could come at the cost of privacy. Avril Eyewu-Edero, a cybersecurity expert, believes that without introducing strong database protections in Nigeria, sensitive information – such as medical histories – becomes vulnerable the moment it enters an AI system.\n\n“If startups fail to prioritise privacy and encryption from the outset, adoption will stall. Nigerians are eager but wary,” she says.\n\nFounders of the services acknowledge these uncertainties, often highlighting their use of end-to-end encryption, unique codes that identify users or devices without including personally identifiable information, and strict non-sharing policies – even with government authorities, unless compelled by a court order.\n\nNow, medical professionals are calling on the Nigerian government to develop enforceable national standards for AI. Dr Alero Roberts, a public health consultant and lecturer at the University of Lagos’s medical college, says: “AI chatbots for mental health are an innovative solution, but without robust regulation, we are venturing blindly into potentially dangerous territory.\n\n“Robots can’t interpret human emotion as humans do. For people in crisis, like suicidal thoughts or psychosis, human contact is crucial. Someone, even a non-professional, can recognise the need for urgent intervention,” she says. “This is often lost with AI; strong governance is essential.”\n\nUnlike medicines or hospitals, AI mental health platforms operate in a regulatory grey zone. Nigeria’s 2023 Data Protection Act sets baseline privacy standards but lacks specific AI regulations for healthcare.\n\n“The main issue is enforcement, not a lack of laws,” says Ayotunde Abiodun of SBM Intelligence, a thinktank that provides analysis on political, economic and social issues in Nigeria and across west Africa.\n\nBabatunde Bamigboye, head of regulations at the Nigeria Data Protection Commission, a statutory body set up under the 2023 law, says: “Any use involving personal data must comply with the act. The framework focuses on data ethics, testing within sandboxes, and risk mitigation. AI in Nigeria is governed, but not via AI-specific laws.”\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakayode continues to use FriendnPal. One day, she hopes to afford in-person therapy, but for now, the bot is her companion.\n\n“I know it’s not a real human,” she says. “But at 2am, it feels like someone is there for me. And that’s enough to keep me going.”",

    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

    "description": "Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that people in tech \"aren't making predictions. We're telling you what already occurred in our jobs.\"",
    "fullText": "It's never a good sign when a CEO warns something more disruptive than COVID is heading our way.\n\nIn an essay titled \"Something Big Is Happening,\" Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer said AI can now do all of his technical work — and he thinks your job could be next.\n\n\"I'm writing this for the people in my life who don't... my family, my friends, the people I care about who keep asking me 'so what's the deal with AI?' and getting an answer that doesn't do justice to what's actually happening,\" Shumer wrote in his nearly 5,000-word post published Tuesday on X.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, his post had 40 million views and 18,000 retweets. Shumer is a cofounder of OthersideAI, which features Hyperwrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\nShumer said that the reason people in tech \"are sounding the alarm\" is that they have already experienced what's coming for everyone else.\n\n\"We're not making predictions,\" he wrote. \"We're telling you what already occurred in our own jobs, and warning you that you're next.\"\n\nShumer said that many people outside tech wrote off AI years ago after a clunky experience with an early edition of ChatGPT.\n\n\"The models available today are unrecognizable from what existed even six months ago,\" he wrote. \"The debate about whether AI is 'really getting better' or 'hitting a wall' — which has been going on for over a year — is over.\"\n\nIt's not the time to panic, Shumer said. Instead, the best thing to do is to become deeply familiar with AI. \"This might be the most important year of your career,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I don't say that to stress you out. I say it because right now, there is a brief window where most people at most companies are still ignoring this,\" he wrote. \"The person who walks into a meeting and says 'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days' is going to be the most valuable person in the room.\"\n\nHe's far from alone in sounding the alarm. Despite disagreement from other tech leaders, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei remains adamant that AI could wipe out up to half of white collar, entry-level jobs in the next one to five years.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk and others have warned that if your job doesn't involve physical labor, it's likely to be replaced by AI much more quickly, a view that dovetails with a growing base of economic research.\n\nShumer's essay struck a chord, especially with those in tech. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian replied, \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\n\"Great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now,\" A16z general partner David Haber wrote.\n\nGreat advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\n\n“I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days\" is going to be the most valuable person in the room. Not eventually. Right now. Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's… https://t.co/cBq5s1AH4Y\n\nWhile the response to the post has been overwhelmingly positive, some X users pointed out the limitations still present in many current AI products, like hallucinations and general inaccuracies.\n\nShumer said that this moment feels like February 2020, when in a short span of time, news of a spreading pandemic gave way to a worldwide upheaval unseen in modern times that continues to reverberate to this day.\n\nThe potential of what AI will change, he wrote, is \"much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nFor Shumer, this moment of realization came with the recent dueling releases of Anthropic's Opus 4.6 and OpenAI's GPT-5.3 Codex. Both models are primarily aimed at software engineering. OpenAI said in its release notes that GPT-5.3 Codex \"is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\n\n\"It wasn't just executing my instructions,\" Shumer wrote of his experience with OpenAI's latest Codex model. \"It was making intelligent decisions. It had something that felt, for the first time, like judgment. Like taste. The inexplicable sense of knowing what the right call is that people always said AI would never have.\"\n\nAI is now so intelligent, Shumer said, that he can tell the agent what he wants and \"walk away from my computer for four hours, and come back to find the work done. Done well.\"\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn Wednesday morning, Shumer addressed his viral X post.\n\n\"Every time someone asks me what's going on with AI, I give them the safe answer,\" he wrote on Wednesday. \"Because the real one sounds insane. I'm done doing that.\"",

    "description": "Meta's Threads introduces Dear Algo, an AI feature for personalized feeds, as it surpasses 400 million monthly users and outpaces X in daily usage.",
    "fullText": "Threads, Meta's X-like social network, rolled out a feature that lets users tell the app's algorithm what they want to see more or less of in their feed.\n\nThe feature, called Dear Algo, works like this: you write a public Threads post starting with \"Dear Algo,\" followed by a request, such as asking to see less about a TV show you're not caught up on yet, for instance, or more about your favorite basketball team during a live game. The algorithm then adjusts your feed for three days based on what you asked for, and you can delete that request if you want. You can also repost someone else's Dear Algo request to try out their preferences.\n\n\"We think we can do a better job by going deep with individuals on what they want to see more and less of,\" said Connor Hayes, Meta's head of Threads.\n\nIn a blog post about the announcement, Meta described Dear Algo as \"an AI-powered feature that gives you more control over what you see by letting you tell Threads what's important to you in the moment.\"\n\nHayes also said that Threads will reject queries that don't meet Meta's recommendation guidelines or content principles.\n\nThreads teased the feature back in December, framing it as a response to a trend Meta had noticed: people were already posting to ask their algorithms to change what showed up in their feeds.\n\nFor years, people have blamed algorithmic timelines for pulling users into echo chambers, rewarding rage bait over substance, and turning a quick scroll into doomscrolling. Dear Algo could give users back some agency.\n\n\"The best algorithms are personalized,\" Hayes said, adding that what works for one user won't work \"at scale.\"\n\nDear Algo arrives at an interesting moment for Threads. The app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, and on its latest earnings call, Meta said time spent on it jumped 20% in the fourth quarter of 2025. A recent report from analytics firm Similarweb found that Threads had edged out X in daily mobile usage. And in January, Meta started running ads, a sign it sees Threads as a real business.\n\nThe feature also provides a glimpse into the company's broader AI ambitions. On Meta's latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is working on merging large language models with the recommendation systems that power Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and its ad system.\n\nThe company's recommendation systems are \"already driving meaningful growth,\" Zuckerberg said on the call. He added that \"the current systems are primitive compared to what will be possible soon.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "title": "Death isn't the end: Meta patented an AI that lets you keep posting from beyond the grave",
    "description": "Meta was recently granted a patent for tech to keep your social media accounts running using AI if you take a break or die.",
    "fullText": "Does Meta want to make our social media accounts immortal?\n\nThe company was granted a patent in late December that outlines how a large language model can \"simulate\" a person's social media activity, such as responding to content posted by real people.\n\n\"The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased,\" the patent says.\n\nAndrew Bosworth, Meta's CTO, is listed as the primary author of the patent, which was first filed in 2023.\n\n\"We have no plans to move forward with this example,\" a spokesperson for Meta told Business Insider.\n\nIn the patent, Meta lays out why it thinks people might need this.\n\nIf you're no longer posting online — whether that's because you need a break from social media or … you … die — your followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.\n\n\"The impact on the users is much more severe and permanent if that user is deceased and can never return to the social networking platform,\" the document says.\n\nTo fill that void, Meta would essentially create a digital clone of your social media presence, training a model on \"user-specific\" data — including historical platform activity, such as comments, likes, or content — to understand how you would (or rather, did) behave.\n\nThat clone can then respond to other people's content by liking and commenting, or responding to DMs. For influencers or creators who make their livelihoods on Meta's platforms and need to take a break from social media, such a tool could be useful.\n\nMeta's patent also references tech that would allow the LLM to simulate video or audio calls with users.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said that while it files patents to disclose concepts, a granted patent does not always mean the company will pursue, develop, or implement that tech.\n\nStill, it opens up many questions about the nature of tech — and grief. An AI bot that acts as your understudy while you're on a digital detox is one thing, but imitating people who've died?\n\nEdina Harbinja, a UK-based professor at the University of Birmingham's Law School, has concerns.\n\n\"It does affect not just legal issues, but a lot of very important social, ethical, and deeply philosophical issues as well,\" Harbinja, who specializes in digital rights and post-mortem privacy, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta has thought about managing digital legacies for years.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Facebook launched tools that let people designate a \"legacy contact\" to manage their accounts if they died. And back in the company's metaverse days, in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Mark Zuckerberg discussed virtual avatars for deceased people.\n\n\"If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful,\" Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\nThere are a lot of names for this broader category of tech — death bots, ghost bots, grief tech — that are aiming to help people face the loss of loved ones with eternally memorialized digital versions of them.\n\nSeveral startups have launched around this premise, and many have emerged from founders' own experiences with grief. Replika, an AI chatbot startup, was founded in 2015 by Eugenia Kuyda after the loss of her friend. Then there's You, Only Virtual (YOV), which was founded in 2020 by Justin Harrison when his mother was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"Everybody in the tech world has been thinking about this for a while, as soon as we started having breaks in generative AI,\" Harrison said.\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft patented an AI chatbot that could simulate a deceased person (as well as fictional characters or celebrities).\n\nMeta's patent signals that the technology category is moving more into the mainstream, Harbinja said.\n\nHarrison isn't surprised to see bigger tech companies dipping their toes in the space, and sees it as a sign that people are beginning to \"feel more comfortable with doing this.\"\n\n\"We can only improve on what we offer people,\" Harrison said, adding that the resources for grieving are \"horrible\" to begin with.\n\n\"I think we have a moral obligation, if we have the potential, to do more for those folks than we should be,\" he said.\n\nAI, death, and grief are not easy topics to digest, however. The intersection of all three is a potent brew of taboos ripe for a philosophical debate on ethics, digital rights, and privacy for any dinner table.\n\nMeta has more than helping people process grief as an incentive to pursue the tech it lays out in its patent, especially for accounts taking a break.\n\n\"It's more engagement, more content, more data — more data for the current and the future AI,\" Harbinja said. \"I can see the business incentive for that. I'm just curious to see how they would, when, and if they will implement this innovation.\"\n\nDepending on how a product like this is rolled out, different questions could come up.\n\nFor instance, would this apply across all of Meta's apps? Would it understand the nuance of your WhatsApp presence vs. the candor you have in the Instagram comment section?\n\nJoseph Davis, a sociology professor at the University of Virginia, said he was concerned with the impact that tools like a Meta bot could have on how humans experience grief.\n\n\"One of the tasks of grief is to face the actual loss,\" Davis said.\n\n\"Let the dead be dead,\" Davis added. \"The idea of bringing them back, but you're not really doing that, but in fact, it looks like that. That's the confusion.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at sbradley@businessinsider.com or Signal at sydneykbradley.123.

    "description": "Moody's economist Mark Zandi doubts job growth will continue despite a strong January jobs report, due to healthcare reliance and AI risks.",
    "fullText": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a delayed January jobs report on Wednesday, beating economists expectations and showing the US economy added 130,000 jobs in the first month of 2026.\n\nMark Zandi says don't get comfortable with the upbeat data.\n\nThe figure is substantially higher than the 75,000 jobs that economists anticipated, but the Moody's Analytics economist isn't optimistic that the growth will continue.\n\nZandi has repeatedly warned that the US economy is on shaky ground, and could tumble into a recession. In a post on X on Wednesday, he said that the latest jobs data didn't do anything to ease his concerns.\n\n\"The job market remains fragile and highly vulnerable,\" he said. \"Yes, payroll employment increased by 130,000 in January, but given the big downward revisions to history, there has been no job growth since last April (Liberation Day).\"\n\nZandi also highlighted that almost all the January jobs growth came from the healthcare industry, something he doesn't think bodes well for the broader US economy.\n\n\"Without healthcare, the economy would be losing lots of jobs and unemployment headed higher,\" he told Business Insider. \"There are good reasons why healthcare is adding jobs, but it shows how vulnerable the job market and economy are if healthcare stumbled or even slowed its hiring.\"\n\nThat's not his only concern. Zandi also warned that a fragile labor market could be further compromised by the impact of AI, something he thinks is approaching quickly. While AI hasn't yet appeared in macro data, Zandi maintains that it is likely to change in the near future.\n\nThe economist added that he thinks rising layoffs will be the clearest indication that the labor market is starting to crack. Companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Pinterest have announced steep job cuts recently, and layoffs throughout the economy touched the highest level since 2009 last month.\n\n\"The best real-time measure of layoffs is weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance,\" Zandi added. \"They are running close to 225k per week, which is low. If they rise above 250k on a consistent basis, the job market is in trouble.\"",

    "description": "From drafting documents to reclaiming family time, these solopreneurs explain how AI is changing the way they work, decide, and lead their businesses.",
    "fullText": "When Pete Srodoski meets with a new executive coaching client these days, he can do more in-depth work more quickly, thanks to ChatGPT.\n\nSrodoski, who founded the coaching firm Roll With the Punches in 2021, used to spend hours with clients discussing what should be included in strategic documents. Now, he uses ChatGPT to draft those documents alongside his clients in about 10 minutes.\n\nWith AI handling the initial framework, Srodoski and his clients can jump right into fine-tuning strategic plans and key job descriptions.\n\n\"That allows us to go deeper, go further, actually take those plans and make actionable items,\" he tells Business Insider.\n\nSrodoski is one of three solopreneurs who spoke with Business Insider about how they're using AI to streamline mundane decision-making — like writing initial drafts, formatting emails, or editing social media posts. The time and mental energy saved allows them to focus on the most critical decisions for their businesses and their clients, they say.\n\n\"We want to make the most impact for our time,\" Srodoski says — and AI can help.\n\nGeorgia Fort, founder of Stories by Georgia Fort, is an independent journalist in Minnesota who started using AI about 18 months ago. She uses ChatGPT to format her newsletters and social media posts, and OpusClip to edit videos for social media.\n\nShe estimates that using those services has freed five to ten hours in her workweek — time that she can now apply to the in-depth reporting she's known for.\n\nUltimately, \"the biggest impact is increased output,\" Fort says. With AI assistance, she's able to post more content on social media and release newsletters regularly, something she struggled with in the past.\n\nAn added bonus, she says, is that utilizing AI makes it just a bit easier to find the work-life balance that many solopreneurs struggle with.\n\n\"If nothing else, it's a meal I get to sit down and have with my kids,\" Fort says.\n\nDusti Arab, owner of The Reinvention Co., a boutique marketing firm, says AI is integrated into nearly every aspect of her workday. Because of that, \"I don't think I've put up so much high-quality content, ever,\" she says.\n\nFor Arab, who has ADHD, managing the constant decisions that a solopreneur must make was draining. She would often worry about missing a small detail, which distracted her from higher-level thinking.\n\nNow, she uses Wispr Flow to take voice notes throughout the day on topics like client communications and content ideas. Then, she imports those into Notion AI, which combines access to Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT to help her turn her notes into briefs.\n\n\"If you use AI to process the brain dump first, the deliverable comes out way better,\" Arab says.\n\nHer efforts with AI and being vocal about how she uses it are also paying off in a different way — clients now reach out to her specifically for advice on how to use it. She often guides them in using AI to delegate more effectively.\n\n\"Once the raw notes exist, you can use AI to turn the brain dump into a clear brief, a task list, and a handoff that someone else can actually execute,\" she says.\n\nLike Arab, Srodoski is often the one to introduce his clients to AI, specifically ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, the platforms he uses. Often, the response is \"awe,\" he says.\n\nLast week, for example, a client shared that the time involved with pricing jobs had become a major roadblock in his business. Using ChatGPT, Srodoski guided him in creating a price book based on the previous three years' sales data.\n\n\"He was smiling ear to ear, saying that this would have cost him a few thousand dollars and a few weeks of labor time to get this pulled off,\" Srodoski says.\n\nWhile clients are often enthusiastic about AI, part of Srodoski's coaching is now emphasizing the decisions that leaders shouldn't outsource to AI.\n\nRecently, he had a client who wanted to confront an underperforming vendor. The client was planning to draft an email using ChatGPT, but Srodoski stopped him.\n\n\"Get on the phone. See how they respond,\" he recalls saying. During the phone call, Srodoski's client was able to explain himself, empathize with the vendor, clarify a misunderstanding, and create a solution.\n\n\"That's a leadership decision you can't do with ChatGPT,\" Srodoski says.",

    "fullText": "Joshua Bonehill-Paine revealed as owner of X account known for videos depicting politicians such as Keir Starmer\n\nThe person behind an anonymous social media account that posts AI videos of UK politicians has been identified as a man who has spent time in prison for multiple hate crimes directed towards Jewish people.\n\nJoshua Bonehill-Paine was identified by Channel 4 News as the owner of Crewkerne Gazette, a satirical X account that created AI videos depicting politicians such as Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham apparently singing popular songs from artists such as Amy Winehouse, Barry Manilow and Elton John with altered, politically themed lyrics.\n\nBonehill-Paine, 33, who has previously described himself as a “nationalist, fascist, theorist and supporter of white rights”, has a long history of discriminatory behaviour. This has included perpetuating fake stories such as a pub in Leicestershire refusing to admit members of the armed forces so as to not offend immigrants, and a six-year-old being abducted by an Asian grooming gang in Croydon.\n\nBonehill-Paine told the Guardian he no longer held antisemitic views, providing proof that he had passed the government’s Prevent awareness course and that he had worked in counter-extremism education.\n\nHe has described himself online as now holding “a deep affection for Israel”.\n\nIn early 2015 Bonehill-Paine attempted to organise a mass protest in Stamford Hill, north London, to rally “against the complete Jewification of the borough”, and later in the year tried to organise another in Golders Green, an area of the city with a large Jewish population.\n\nHe promoted the latter with a cartoon image of Hitler and wrote that the event would be “an absolute gas”. He was sentenced to three years and four months in jail for inciting hatred against Jews.\n\nLater, in 2016, he was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment for abuse directed at the then Labour MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, which included posting messages to his blog calling Berger “a rodent”, “evil money-grabber” and “a dominatrix”, and uploading an image of a rat with Berger’s face superimposed over it. He was jailed for another two years, which was added to his existing sentence.\n\nBonehill-Paine said on Wednesday he was “extremely sorry for the pain and distress” he had caused Berger, and he hoped she could forgive him for his past actions, but had not reached out to her directly as he did not “want to alarm or distress her, even after a decade has passed”.\n\nThe Crewkerne Gazette’s work has been lauded by publications such as the Sun, which featured a video created by the account showing Rayner rapping to a grime beat during her tax scandal.\n\nThe Times called him the “Banksy of politics” and GB News interviewed Bonehill-Paine, who went by the online alias of Crewkerne Man, on air three days before his identity and past were uncovered.\n\nThe account’s work has also been highlighted by politicians including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who shared a video from it on X, and Adam Dance, the Liberal Democrat MP for Yeovil, where Crewkerne is based. Dance also said on an episode of BBC Sunday Politics West that Bonehill-Paine’s work was a positive example of engaging audiences with politics.\n\nWhen asked about Bonehill-Paine’s identity, Dance said he was not aware of who was behind the Crewkerne Gazette account at the time of his comments, which were “about the transparent use of AI in politics, not about endorsing any individual. I absolutely condemn antisemitism and harassment in all its forms, and I do not support the person now revealed to be behind that account.”.\n\nIn a YouTube video Bonehill-Paine posted on Tuesday he expressed regret for his past comments towards the Jewish community.. He said: “I felt very angry at how I had treated the Jewish community in this country. I wanted to do something to rectify it, so I began working in counter-extremism education.”\n\nHe added: “I went across the country to colleges, schools, universities, working with the probation service, the police service, to try to help prevent other people from following in my footsteps.”\n\nHe later told Channel 4 News: “What I am going to do is to continue doing what I’ve done for the last five years, six years, which is counter-extremism work, working to prevent people following in my footsteps, hopefully stopping people from making the same mistakes that I’ve done.”",

    "description": "Meta says it will build a new 1-gigawatt data center in Indiana, its second in the state.",
    "fullText": "Meta (META) on Wednesday said it is breaking ground on its latest data center as part of its massive AI infrastructure build-out.\n\nThe more than $10 billion data center will be located in Lebanon, Ind., and have a capacity of upwards of 1 gigawatt. That's enough energy to power several hundred thousand homes.\n\nAccording to Meta, the data center will handle both Meta's AI workloads as well as its core products and represents one of its largest infrastructure projects to date.\n\nDuring its Q4 earnings announcement, Meta said it plans to spend as much as $135 billion throughout 2026 as part of its AI expansion plans. The company spent $72.2 billion in 2025. The social media giant isn't the only tech company sending big on AI this year. Advertising rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) said it plans to spend $180 billion in 2026 during its own earnings report, while Amazon (AMZN) said it anticipates spending $200 billion.\n\nThe massive spending news spooked Google and Amazon investors and lifted shares of Meta more than 10% at the time, though they've since come back down to Earth.\n\nThe broader data center explosion is facing increasing criticism from residents in and around communities where they're being built, with complaints ranging from increasing utility costs to the irritating sounds of cooling systems.\n\nTo that end, Meta says it will pay the full cost of the energy the data center uses, provide $1 million each year for 20 years to the Boone REMC Community Fund to assist with energy bills, and fund emergency water utility assistance. The data center will also use a closed-loop water system that Meta says will use no water \"a majority of the year.\"\n\nThe company further says it will invest more than $120 million in water infrastructure for Lebanon, as well as make upgrades to roads, transmission lines, and area utilities.\n\nMeta isn't the only company looking to make concessions to win over local communities. Last month, Microsoft president Brad Smith announced that the Windows developer will work with local utilities to provide a better understanding of its data center electricity needs and “bear the cost” when electricity companies need to upgrade their transmission capabilities to meet data center demand.\n\nIn August, Google agreed to cut back on its electricity usage during periods of high demand in certain regions, Reuters reported.\n\nMeta's ambitious AI construction plans aren't limited to single-gigawatt data centers. In July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is set to build its enormous Hyperion facility in Louisiana, adding that the data center will be so large it would cover a large portion of Manhattan and will eventually scale up to support upwards of 5 gigawatts of capacity.",

    "description": "A new study found that AI in the workplace expanded tasks outside one's job description and blurred the line between work and time off.",
    "fullText": "If you think using AI means doing less at work, think again.\n\nIn a new eight-month study of how generative AI changed work habits at a US-based tech company with about 200 employees, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business found that employees' work intensified in three main ways.\n\nEmployees multitasked more, took on a broader range of responsibilities, and worked longer hours, often without being asked to do so.\n\nAruna Ranganathan, a professor in management at UC Berkeley, and Xingqi Maggie Ye, a Ph.D. student at the Haas School of Business, detailed their research in a Harvard Business Review story, writing that once AI tools became available, workers began to usurp each other's roles, feed information to AI during meetings, and correct each other's vibe coding projects.\n\nRanganathan and Ye said that workers \"described this as 'just trying things' with the AI, but these experiments accumulated into a meaningful widening of job scope. In fact, workers increasingly absorbed work that might previously have justified additional help or head count.\"\n\n\"Once the excitement of experimenting fades, workers can find that their workload has quietly grown and feel stretched from juggling everything that's suddenly on their plate. That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making,\" they wrote. \"The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work, turnover, and other problems.\"\n\nThe researchers wrote that many workers also send prompts to AI before leaving their desk for a meeting or for lunch break, so AI could continue to work without supervision.\n\n\"These actions rarely felt like doing more work, yet over time they produced a workday with fewer natural pauses and a more continuous involvement with work,\" Ranganathan and Ye added.\n\nIn an October 2025 interview with Rowan Cheung, who hosts the Rowan's Notes interview series, Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, also shared ways in which AI may have made his work more intense.\n\n\"It's almost like, I don't think I can come up with ideas fast enough anymore,\" Altman told Cheung.\n\n\"I really do have a hard time trying to reason through exactly what this is going to mean,\" Altman added. \"I think it will mean that stuff just happens faster and that you can try a lot more stuff and figure out the better ideas quickly.\"",

It later hit $4 trillion in 2025 and briefly reached $5 trillion last October. Yet the stock has largely traded sideways since last August around its current price of $189.\n\nReasons include investor concerns over rising competition in AI accelerators from players like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), geopolitical constraints such as U.S. export restrictions to China, production delays on next-generation chips like Blackwell, slowing revenue growth momentum, and valuation fatigue after years of rapid gains.\n\nThe Shocking Reason This Analyst Says Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy Stock Will Take Bitcoin Prices to $0\n\nIs the Market Running on Borrowed Time?

    "fullText": "Banks' analyst classes probably won't swap fresh-faced college grads for bots — at least not this year.\n\nSome 60% of the 240 financial services CEOs that EY surveyed for its Quarterly CEO Outlook Survey said they think investing in AI will maintain or even increase their current head count in 2026. Only 28% of those surveyed predicted head count would drop this year.\n\nLeaders at some of the biggest banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have said that they're resisting hiring growth where it makes sense to prioritize efficiency. They, along with some other bulge-bracket leads, have predicted that AI could grow head count in the long run, though. Still, some roles are becoming obsolete: Citi CEO Jane Fraser said in a recent internal memo that some jobs \"will no longer be required\" as AI advances.\n\nFor their part, the financial services CEOs that EY surveyed are similarly bullish about AI's capacity to transform the workplace, and nearly half see AI and digital investment as the most important factor in their companies' ability to thrive and adapt this year.\n\nAround a quarter said their AI initiatives have significantly beaten expectations, and 57% said they've shown results faster than expected. Just more than half said they expect the biggest transformations to come from generative AI.\n\nWhen it comes to hiring for AI talent — itself a highly competitive market — 87% of CEOs in EY's survey are optimistic about their ability to attract and keep talent in 2026. The question of returns on the AI investment, for talent and in general, also seems top of mind for the financial services leaders. Seventy-six percent of boards in the survey said they'll review transformation ROI metrics as often as financial results.\n\nFirms of all sizes are being asked to justify their AI spends, as analysts and investors begin to wonder whether the sometimes billion-dollar bets will show up on balance sheets.",

    "description": "The tech giant's internal policy promotes an in-house tool called Kiro over Anthropic's Claude Code. Some Amazon engineers are unhappy about this.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing the startup's AI models and products to customers.\n\nInside Amazon, however, employees aren't allowed to use Anthropic's Claude Code for production work or for live products without formal approval.\n\nThat disconnect became more visible late last year, when Amazon rolled out internal guidance steering teams toward Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant, according to internal messages seen by Business Insider. The guidance encourages using Kiro over non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, for production code.\n\nThe policy prompted criticism across internal Amazon forums. In one discussion thread, roughly 1,500 Amazon employees endorsed the formal adoption of Claude Code, according to the messages.\n\nThe restrictions have been particularly awkward for engineers who help sell AWS Bedrock, Amazon's platform that offers customers access to third-party AI services, including Claude Code. Some questioned how they could credibly promote a product they are not permitted to use themselves in official work.\n\n\"Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,\" one employee wrote.\n\nThe episode highlights the complexity of Amazon's relationship with Anthropic. While Amazon is racing to build and promote its own AI tools, it is also marketing a partner's competing technology. Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors, with a stake valued at more than $60 billion. Anthropic, in turn, is a major AWS customer, committing to use Amazon's cloud services and at least one million of Amazon's Trainium chips.\n\n\"We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.\"\n\nAmazon maintains \"a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,\" and while there's no explicit ban on Claude Code, the company applies \"stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.\n\nAn Anthropic spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one of the internal forums, an Amazon sales engineer flagged the irony of being asked to sell Claude Code even though it isn't formally supported inside the company. The employee wrote that they need to be able to \"use, demo, and build\" with Claude Code to support Amazon's directive to get more customers to use it through AWS Bedrock.\n\nOther Amazon engineers also debated whether the emphasis on Kiro was hindering productivity. Some argued that Claude Code outperformed Amazon's in-house tool and warned that forcing adoption of a weaker product could slow development.\n\n\"A tool that can't keep pace with rivals offers no real innovation,\" one of the Amazon employees wrote. \"And without competitive strength, Kiro's only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.\"\n\nClaude Code has become one of the most widely used AI coding services, and it underpins many other similar offerings from other providers. An Amazon spokesperson said about 70% of the company's software engineers used Kiro at least once in January.\n\nIn one forum thread, a manager overseeing Amazon's internal developer tools said he understood the \"frustration\" and \"significant\" interest in Claude Code, citing about 1,500 internal endorsements calling for its formal adoption.\n\nSome employees said frustration deepened after Amazon had previously indicated that Claude Code had cleared security and legal review for production use, according to an internal guideline and messages reviewed by Business Insider. That language was later edited and removed, employees said.\n\nOthers criticized the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally adopt Claude Code, asking what data informed the decision.\n\n\"The trend is clear,\" one employee wrote internally. \"More and more people would like to start using Claude Code and be officially supported by Amazon.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Aspiring computer science student Alex Seungyong Yang sees AI as both a challenge and opportunity as he enters university as a freshman in the fall.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alex Seungyong Yang, an 18-year-old high school senior, based in Seoul. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs an incoming university freshman and the founder of an AI research startup, AI feels like a double-edged sword.\n\nI started my AI research and development startup with other students around the world, and AI has been amazing for us. It's allowed us to push further and think about achieving things we couldn't have imagined. On the other hand, I'm pursuing a computer science major this fall, and I keep hearing that computer science jobs are being replaced by AI.\n\nNo one has explicitly told me that pursuing computer science is a complete waste of time, but many people around me have expressed concerns about the risks it entails. I think those concerns point to something valid.\n\nSimply learning how to code no longer guarantees a stable or well-defined career path, but there are still many opportunities by staying within what I would call the \"eye of the typhoon\" and studying these machines, even if they are increasingly unpredictable.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2026, the tech industry changed so much. Last year, there was still a broad sense of expansion and experimentation, startups, new tools, and huge model launches. Now, what feels dominant is resource concentration in capital, compute, and top talent, along with a narrowing focus on AI infrastructure.\n\nThis kind of acceleration makes it so that one year doesn't feel like just a single year anymore. I think that computer science, engineering, and very technical majors are the only majors that can fully understand how this industry is changing and the direction of that change.\n\nI think the important part of studying computer science isn't about basic coding or programming; it's understanding the logic behind it and the framework that can be applied anywhere, anytime, wherever we are with technology. It's all about solving the problem, and I think that kind of talent is most relevant in the AI era.\n\nStudying computer science will help me adapt more flexibly and with greater urgency in my career. I want to use the knowledge from my degree to develop a niche kind of talent rather than simply following a very conventional pathway and becoming another factory-made worker.\n\nBeing unemployed or unable to find a job used to be the most obvious failure. Now, given how frequently unemployment is already happening around us, I don't think it can even be considered the greatest failure anymore. To me, the biggest failure would be an inability to adapt, and if we become irrelevant as technology advances.\n\nA small number of people or companies can now build and deploy things at a scale that used to require much larger organizations. Rather than only preparing for predefined roles, I spend time now and will continue to during my degree, building real systems, contributing to research, and working on projects where the constraints are unclear and the outcomes are uncertain.\n\nI see my computer science degree as a way to build depth, judgment, and adaptability rather than just technical skills.\n\nI don't see this as a guaranteed strategy, and I'm still learning what truly matters, but I hope that developing this ability in specific domains matters the most. I'm in competition with AI, but it's equally a competition with other people. I want to become an irreplaceable person, not just with AI, but also relative to other people.\n\nMany peers around me who are pursuing computer science and working on startups believe this is actually the easiest era to start something and succeed. Some majors naturally keep people closer to the frontier of change. I believe studying computer science, engineering, or mathematics trains you to reason from first principles, work with abstraction, and stay comfortable with uncertainty.\n\nThose habits matter more than any specific technical skills, which may quickly become outdated. Because the underlying skills are transferable, people in these fields may be better positioned to adapt when conditions change, even if the direction of change is unclear.\n\nI'm excited to pursue computer science, even though it might be uncertain how it will turn out. Things may become more complex, demanding, and challenging than I can anticipate, but I still believe there will be abundant opportunities for those who are willing to adapt, go deep, and continuously redefine their value.\n\nDo you have a story to share about higher education and AI?

    "description": "Some bigger firms are using AI to embrace a classic startup mentality to quickly identify what works — and cast aside what doesn't.",
    "fullText": "For some companies building with AI, failure isn't a setback. It's the strategy.\n\nOkta, Salesforce, Snowflake, Blackstone, and others are rapidly launching AI products, fully expecting that not all of them will pan out. Executives say they can't afford to meticulously test ideas in isolation if they want to outpace their competitors, and AI makes it easy to deploy new offerings at scale anyway.\n\n\"It's increased the pace of what's possible,\" said Eric Kelleher, president and chief operating officer of digital-identity company Okta, which has rolled out around 120 AI pilots and features over the past two years, keeping half and scrapping the rest. \"You can spin up a lot more pilots at the same time.\"\n\nThis so-called fail-fast method isn't new, as tech startups have been doing it for decades. It's now gaining traction among larger, established businesses due to the AI boom.\n\nLeaders say they're under pressure from their boards and shareholders to justify their AI spending, and that the fail-fast approach is helping them meet the moment.\n\n\"The stakes are higher, the risks are bigger, and to keep pace with the innovation churn, we need to fail faster than ever,\" Cisco's senior vice president and global innovation officer, Guy Diedrich, told Business Insider.\n\nFor some companies, fail fast isn't just a mindset — it represents a new reality driven by AI efficiency gains.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said the cloud-data platform company has rolled out numerous pilot programs, often moving from a planning meeting on Monday to a demo by Friday. With its agentic support system, he said, many cases that once took hours to debug can now be resolved in about 20 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, something like preparing a customer briefing for an executive used to take hours. Now, Ramaswamy said, it can be done in a minute by asking a sales agent.\n\nJohn Stecher, the chief technology officer at Blackstone, told Business Insider that the \"fail fast\" mindset has long been a mainstay in the engineering world, but AI tools have enabled companies to accelerate development timelines.\n\n\"Our software engineers, by quantifiable metrics, are about 2x more effective than they were in 2024 with writing code,\" Stecher said, adding that they now have the ability to deliver faster and higher quality work.\n\nHe said the \"blocking-and-tackling part of software development and engineering,\" including tasks like writing unit tests and higher-quality code, allows engineers to \"deploy more robust,\" reliable, and secure code, so that workers spend less time fixing bugs and more time building. That increase in productivity allows teams to build prototypes more quickly and launch them to users faster.\n\nRamaswamy similarly said that a lot of the heavy lifting on engineering teams for tasks like boilerplate code, tests, and migrations happens much faster. That frees workers to spend more time on tasks that require judgment, architecture, and design, he said.\n\nMoving at warp speed comes with risks, however.\n\nLast year, Salesforce launched an AI agent designed to answer customer queries, and it recommended a competitor's application to a user. The user then wrote about the snafu on LinkedIn, said Joe Inzerillo, president of enterprise and AI at the software company.\n\nAnother time, one of Salesforce's newly released AI agents provided a customer with false information gleaned from old web pages that had been removed from its website but were still crawlable by search engines. The error was discovered during a review of conversations the agent was having with users.\n\nThough both incidents exposed early-stage gaps to users, Inzerillo said they also revealed important insights into how users interact with the products and how experiences can be improved. \"We're going into every single deployment as an experiment to try to learn something,\" said Inzerillo.\n\nThe consequences of failing fast, however, can be worse if companies overlook important security measures.\n\nStecher said companies in general shouldn't necessarily deploy more products just because they can now do so more easily. He said firms need a \"robust checks and balances\" system and have data privacy and security controls in place from the get-go, or they'll pay the price with outages or cyber issues.\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy said that while the \"fail fast\" concept is reappearing, the current version is \"less about recklessness and more about shortening the feedback loop.\" He said the phrase \"iterating rapidly\" is a more accurate way to describe the company's approach to building with AI.\n\n\"We identify areas that we know are going to be generally positively impacted by AI, but set up small, almost weekly, goals,\" Ramaswamy said. \"This way, we can adjust and know when things are working well and when we need to course correct.\"",

    "description": "AI agents could eventually take on a lot of tasks done by humans. Yet hallucinations present a challenge currently, says a former Google exec.",
    "fullText": "Despite some CEOs' enthusiasm, AI agents aren't always up to the task.\n\nAgents are software programs that can perform tasks independently, such as reconciling an invoice, so that a person doesn't have to. Sounds great, right? That's why companies are plugging agents into tasks across sales, finance, supply chains, and engineering.\n\nYet while agentic systems can be effective at completing discrete tasks, they can be fragile at scale.\n\nErrors can quickly become a bottleneck if hallucinations multiply when agents interact, said Nicolas Darveau-Garneau, a former Google executive and author of the book \"Be a Sequoia, Not a Bonsai.\"\n\nIf a single agent has a 5% hallucination rate, then it's hard to daisy-chain multiple agents without a high risk of errors. That's because the risk increases exponentially, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The only way we get massive productivity gains is the day that we can trust that the AI is not hallucinating a lot,\" Darveau-Garneau said.\n\nFor now, he said, that's why general-purpose, autonomous agentic AI is largely aspirational.\n\nNevertheless, hallucinations are something that Darveau-Garneau expects will be \"mostly solved\" five years from now.\n\nIf that happens, he said, the productivity gains of 10% to 30% that some companies are getting from AI could be far greater — perhaps on the order of 10x to 100x.\n\nThose gains matter because the bigger they get, the more likely it becomes that companies will reorganize their operations, including the possibility of needing fewer employees.\n\nEven if companies don't cut staff, many roles — especially desk jobs — are likely to change.\n\nThe challenge of scaling agents and AI broadly is one reason Darveau-Garneau expects companies to still need some humans in jobs that sometimes appear to be endangered, like coding.\n\nAn excellent software engineer, he said, might be 30% to 40% more productive with AI. It's a nice lift, Darveau-Garneau said, but not a reason for a company to get rid of all its engineers.\n\nWorkers are understandably fearful of losing their jobs to AI, especially when leaders emphasize productivity gains, he said.\n\nDarveau-Garneau said that the CEO's primary job when it comes to AI is to create the right environment for adoption — including training and making sure that employees feel \"psychologically safe.\"\n\nThat's why, he said, leaders would be wise to reframe the conversation to say they want to double a company's size, for example, while increasing the employee base by 30%, rather than suggesting they deploy AI and cut 20% of the staff.\n\nOne challenge for many leaders has been understanding what new roles will look like thanks to AI, Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of strategy at Accenture, told Business Insider.\n\nThat is proving difficult, at least in part, because some current job descriptions may change, and other jobs may become redundant. Still others will have to be \"radically redefined,\" he said.\n\n\"What companies have been doing, by and large, is putting AI in the hands of people in their existing roles with existing tasks,\" Ashraf said.\n\nThat might mean automating some tasks or using AI to supercharge how someone searches for information or how quickly they can conduct a competitive analysis.\n\n\"But how does that fundamentally change my day?\" he said.\n\nCompanies have struggled, Ashraf said, if they've tended to think about adopting AI within their current ways of working, rather than redesigning the organization with an eye toward future jobs.\n\n\"It's not about layering AI on existing roles. It's about rethinking all of these processes and activities,\" he said.\n\nDespite the challenge of redesigning how companies are set up, Ashraf said it's encouraging that many C-suite leaders recognize the need to help their workers build the skills needed to prepare for the changes stemming from companies' decisions to prioritize AI.\n\nAI might still have limitations, but its rapid pace of improvement means workers themselves also need to prioritize staying current. Otherwise, they risk falling behind, Alex Salazar, cofounder and CEO of the AI infrastructure startup Arcade, told Business Insider.\n\nA year ago, the coding agents that the company's software engineers now use couldn't do any of what they can do today, he said.\n\n\"What does that mean for your job as an engineer?\" Salazar said. \"It's got to evolve.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "A few weeks ago, I was staring at a system prompt that was 127,000 tokens long. One hundred and twenty-seven thousand tokens - just the system prompt. Most of it was, you guessed it, tool schemas: JSON definitions for every possible thing the agent could do, most of which it would never touch in any given run.\n\nMy solution? I propose AgentScript: a code-first execution language where the LLM can only interact with the outside world by writing programs. No tool schemas, no function calling, no MCP, no multi-modal response gymnastics. The model writes code, a sandboxed runtime executes it, and the return value is the response. As simple as that.\n\nHere’s how tool calling works today: you define a bunch of tools as JSON schemas, stuff them into the system prompt, and hope the model picks the right one. Each tool needs a name, a description, parameter definitions, and examples. A single tool can easily consume hundreds of tokens. A production-grade system might have tens, sometimes hundrends, of tools.\n\nAnd the tools the model never uses still consume tokens - they’re sitting in the context window like furniture in a storage unit you’re paying rent on but never visiting (I would know something about that). As systems grow, you get this compounding problem: context inflation drives up latency and reduces alignment, both in turn drive up costs, and costs scale non-linearly because you’re paying for all those schema tokens on every single inference call.\n\nSince many agent tasks require iteration, filtering, branching, retries, and aggregation, when you encode these behaviors through repeated LLM calls or chained tool invocations, you’re effectively using natural language as a programming language. You’re asking the model to be both the thinker and the doer, when decades of CS have taught us that these should be separate concerns.\n\nIn the last few months, I’ve seen this become an exciting idea space: Program-of-thought prompting, code interpreter systems, Anthropic’s work on code execution with MCP - they all point to the same conclusion: models are better planners than executors, and deterministic computation belongs outside the model.\n\nAgentScript takes that insight to its logical conclusion.\n\nAgentScript enforces a code-only contract between a language model and its execution environment. In this world, the LLM is not an API client, not it is a conversational participant; it’s a program author that can only emit AgentScript code. So there is only one execution entry point, and all interaction with the world happens through code.\n\nThis collapses tool calling, function responses, and structured outputs into a single universal abstraction: program execution.\n\nThe execution model is deliberately boring:\n\nIntermediate data never enters the model’s context unless the program explicitly reads the persisted logs from the file system. This is my main insight: pull-based data access instead of push-based context stuffing.\n\nThe API surface can be intentionally tiny, for example:\n\nThe model already knows JavaScript. The API is small enough to learn once and never forget.\n\nAnd the safety model is simple: constraints are enforced by the runtime, not the model. The model can write whatever code it wants. The sandbox decides what actually executes, like only mounting the working directory, allowlisted commands, or network access.\n\nTo start with, a backwards-compatible model would be to force a tool call from LLM responses and only give it a single tool: execute_agentscript, and stop the loop based on the execution of the code.\n\nThere are also a few extensions I’m thinking about:\n\nWhen systems become too complex to reason about in prose, you re-found them on code. This has happened repeatedly in computing history, and it’s happening again now to agents.\n\nWritten on a flight from Amsterdam to New Delhi",

    "fullText": "As AI job losses rise in the professional sector, many are switching to more traditional trades. But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?\n\nCalifornia-based Jacqueline Bowman had been dead set on becoming a writer since she was a child. At 14 she got her first internship at her local newspaper, and later she studied journalism at university. Though she hadn’t been able to make a full-time living from her favourite pastime – fiction writing – post-university, she consistently got writing work (mostly content marketing, some journalism) and went freelance full-time when she was 26. Sure, content marketing wasn’t exactly the dream, but she was writing every day, and it was paying the bills – she was happy enough.\n\n“But something really switched in 2024,” Bowman, now 30, says. Layoffs and publication closures meant that much of her work “kind of dried up. I started to get clients coming to me and talking about AI,” she says – some even brazen enough to tell her how “great” it was “that we don’t need writers any more”. She was offered work as an editor – checking and altering work produced by artificial intelligence. The idea was that polishing up already-written content would take less time than writing it from scratch, so Bowman’s fee was reduced to about half of what it had been when she was writing for the same content marketing agency – but, in reality, it ended up taking double the time.\n\n“I now had to meticulously fact-check every single thing in the articles. And at least 60% of it would be completely made up,” she says. “I would just end up rewriting most of the article. So something that would take me two hours when I was writing it by myself now took me four hours, making half the money.”\n\nTo add insult to injury, Bowman’s few remaining clients have sometimes accused her of using AI to create her work. “I never use AI to write anything,” she says, but she has noticed that AI-produced copy can sometimes seem eerily similar to her own writing – which she suspects is due to large language models being trained on some of her previous work. She can’t afford to take any of the Silicon Valley giants to court – though she is grateful for the authors, like George Saunders and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who have done so.\n\nShe remembered a psychology elective she had enjoyed in college, and wondered if she might be able to make a more secure living by becoming a therapist. “It’s not AI-proof” – Bowman admits that some people will be happy to use AI-powered therapy services, which already exist. “But there’s another subsection of people who are going to say: ‘Hey, AI took my job, AI ruined my life. I’m not going to go to an AI therapist,’” she says. “So in that way, I do think that there’s still going to be an audience who wants a human therapist.”\n\nBowman decided to take action and retrain, “while I still do have a little bit of work”, and is now back at university studying to become a marriage and family therapist. She counts herself “incredibly lucky” because she is able to rely on her husband, and on any writing work she can still get, to make ends meet – but has still had to take out loans. She’s enjoying the course, and is “glad she has the opportunity to do it”, but it is not something she would have considered if her writing work hadn’t become untenable.\n\nJanet Feenstra, an academic editor turned baker based in Malmö, Sweden, also has mixed feelings about her career change, a choice she similarly made because of fears that AI would make her old job void. “It’s complicated because, in a way, I maybe should be grateful to AI for prompting this change,” she says. Feenstra now works at “a really cute bakery”, where she and her colleagues “roll out the dough by hand and it feels amazing”.\n\n“We listen to music and we dance and sing whenever we want,” she adds. “I have a lot more fun now, but I don’t want to be grateful to AI for this – I’m still a little bit bitter.” It felt like a forced career change, rather than one she was choosing on her own terms, she explains – not to mention the fact that she now gets paid less, travels farther to work and does a much more tiring job.\n\nSince 2013, the 52-year-old, who is originally from the US, had been working as a freelance editor alongside a part-time job at Malmö University doing what is called “language editing”: tidying up texts written by researchers whose first language isn’t English.\n\n“The standard of English here in Sweden is very, very high, so this was very specialised academic editing,” she says. “The international journals are very picky, so it required a certain expertise that we could offer.” However, in recent years, she began to hear people within the university talking about wanting to use AI. “It was scary. I felt like the writing was on the wall a bit,” Feenstra says. She began to realise that if a manuscript “is already quite good”, then an AI system prompted to meet academic journal requirements might be able to do the work she had been doing.\n\n“I didn’t want to wait until it was too late,” she says. “I felt scared … I’m divorced, I have two children to look after and I need financial security.” So she decided to retrain in something she “was fairly sure that AI would not replace anytime soon”, and enrolled in culinary school.\n\nIt wasn’t an easy transition. “I had to move out because I wasn’t able to afford my rent any more,” she says, which meant that her sons, who had previously lived between their parents’ two homes, had to live full-time with their father. While Feenstra embarked on her year-long training, she moved in with her partner, whose flat was too small to house her sons as well. Now, having worked in the bakery for five months, she has recently signed a contract on a new flat, which will have room for her sons. “I’ve had to work really hard: I’ve had to retrain, I’ve had to accept lower pay and conditions that are physically challenging,” Feenstra says. But securing the flat “is really exciting because it’s a goal realised”.\n\nFeenstra says it has been “an interesting journey” to go from a job typically associated with middle-class people to one seen as working-class. “White-collar work isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, I’ve realised,” she says. “But it requires an adjustment. We’re so defined by our jobs and our class.”\n\nPerhaps those definitions of what counts as a “good” or “middle class” job will begin to change: a 2023 report on the impact of AI on jobs and training in the UK by the Department for Education concluded that: “Professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly those associated with more clerical work and across finance, law and business management roles.” And, rightly or wrongly, Feenstra is not alone in deciding that learning a trade is a relatively safe bet.\n\nAngela Joyce, the CEO of Capital City College, a further education provider in London, says: “We’re seeing a steady growth in students of all ages coming to us to do trades-based qualifications,” in subjects such as engineering, culinary arts and childcare. There is “definitely a shift” away from traditional academic routes, she says, which she attributes to the high numbers of unemployed young people – and “a good proportion of those are graduates”, she notes. That shift towards seeking vocational training is “in part linked to AI”, Joyce thinks, because people are looking for “jobs that AI can’t replace”.\n\nThat was certainly the case for Richard, a Northampton-based chartered occupational health and safety professional. After working his way up the career ladder for 15 years, the 39-year-old decided to jump ship and retrain as an electrical engineer.\n\n“Health and safety isn’t going to disappear any time soon because organisations can’t name AI as a responsible person or a duty holder for businesses legally,” he says. But a few years ago, he started to hear “mumblings of AI” within the industry, and saw organisations start to experiment with automating certain systems and procedures. He watched as AI began to be used for writing policies and safe systems of work, and realised that if a large portion of practitioners’ workload could be done by AI, then there might only be a need for “highly specialised managers. The rest of it’s probably going to go.”\n\nThough he decided to “pre-empt that” and pursue a different path, his main worry about AI taking over health and safety roles wasn’t actually that people like him would lose jobs – he finds aspects of AI “exciting” and accepts that it will inevitably shake up the way we work. His primary concern was that the implementation of AI might be “more of a cost-cutting exercise than it is about safety”. Richard cares deeply about the health and safety industry, which he entered after his friend was killed in a gas explosion at work.\n\nHe has taken “a huge cut” financially since he has been working as an electrical engineer over the past year, but his new job does at least still have keeping people safe at its core. And there is the potential to make the kind of money he earned in his old job once he has more experience under his belt, he says, but “I’m a good five, 10 years off”. And that’s if automation hasn’t come for electrical work by then – Richard mentions BMW’s testing of a humanoid robot as an example of how AI could affect trade jobs. Currently, though, the trades, in the UK at least, are “the most resilient to the levels of automation that AI is bringing in”, Richard believes. “Companies are capitalising on AI to remove one of their biggest costs, which is human overheads,” he says. “You need to pick something which has resilience. So, statistically, that is not your roles that are bureaucratic by nature, heavy in data and are just a bunch of processes which you repeat end on end. It needs to be something with high dexterity and some high problem-solving skills.”\n\nCarl Benedikt Frey, an associate professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, agrees that manual work “is going to be harder to automate”, but predicts that AI will have an impact “across a very wide range of industries” – trades included. “If the dishwasher breaks down in my home, I can take a picture and I can quiz the large language model of my choice, and I’m more likely to be able to fix it myself these days without calling an engineer,” he says. That’s not to say tradespeople are “doomed” – he cautions against making too many decisions based on “some hypothetical future scenario … We have to go by what’s actually happening in the labour market.” Which, now, is not a lot. “We’re beginning to see some studies suggesting more of an impact on entry-level work,” Frey says, but a reduction in entry-level job opportunities could also be attributed to higher interest rates, or post-pandemic recovery, he says.\n\n“As AI gets better, and its capabilities improve, I think it’s likely that we will see it on a bigger slice of the labour market. But we’re not seeing it yet.” In fact, Frey has now reassessed his earlier claim that 47% of roles were at risk of being replaced by computerisation, made in The Future of Employment, the 2013 paper he co-authored with Prof Michael Osborne. “In that study, a lot of the jobs that we deem are highly exposed to automation are jobs in transportation and logistics because of autonomous vehicles,” he says. “It’s fair to say that it’s taken much longer for that technology to materialise.” As self-driving cars do begin to hit our streets, “we will see a lot of jobs being replaced in trucking and even in taxi services”, Frey believes. But his message seems to be don’t panic – at least not yet. “It might be a good idea if you are, say, in the early days of your professional career, to take the time that you still have to invest in training and figuring out other more viable career paths,” particularly if you work as a translator – one profession where “we’re already seeing that AI is having an impact, although we’re not seeing mass displacement by any means”. But if you are reaching the end of your working life, “you can probably ride the wave for a few more years”, he says.\n\nThe most significant AI-caused declines in employment and wages will be in jobs like software engineering and management consultancy, according to a King’s College London study published in October 2025. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that there aren’t going to be new jobs that will be created,” Dr Bouke Klein Teeselink, who authored that study, notes. Historically, whenever there have been technological advances people have worried about mass unemployment, but it hasn’t happened, he says. “So there’s a part of me that is a little bit sceptical that all the jobs will disappear, but at the same time there is a reason to think that this technology might be different, in the sense that humans always maintained some type of absolute advantage over technology in certain domains. And that may no longer be true.”\n\nFor now, while we can’t yet know the full impact AI will have on workers, “becoming really good at working with AI is probably going to be a skill that will pay off”, Klein advises. Which is what the Birmingham-based entrepreneurs Fayyaz Garda and Arun Singh Aujla, both 25, are attempting to do. Garda, who works in procurement, and Singh Aujla, who runs a social media marketing business, are in the process of setting up an AI consulting business, educating themselves about AI via YouTube. “It’s a growing market, and there’s definitely a space for it. So I’m hoping to try and get in there early,” Garda says. The plan is to employ a number of engineers to create AI systems that will answer phone calls, respond to mail and fulfil other tasks businesses need doing, he explains.\n\n“The AI consulting business is one way I’m upskilling to move with the times,” Singh Aujla adds. “AI won’t replace me, but it may take a large market share out of my business. So it’s always good to make an extra stream of revenue.” There are certain roles Singh Aujla would never replace with AI, though: “I would not replace my management team. You need that human interaction with your team,” he says. “But roles the team don’t want to do, like email outreach and cold calling, we can get AI agents to do that.”\n\nFor some, it may well prove true that AI improves their work life by removing tasks they find tedious or difficult, giving them more time to focus on the more fulfilling aspects of their job. For others, though, it is the reason they have given up on their dream career. Paola Adeitan, 31, had her heart set on being a solicitor, and obtained an undergraduate degree and a master’s in law. She had planned to do the legal practice course, the final stage of training needed to qualify as a solicitor, “but I decided not to pursue that path because I felt like, with the change in technology, the AI, that might not be a viable path for me to carry on with,” she says. Friends of hers had struggled to get entry-level law roles, which she believed to be partly due to the increased use of AI at law firms.\n\nAdeitan still volunteers as a legal adviser, but her day job is in the health sector – although even that role could be affected by AI, she thinks, so she is remaining open to the idea that she might end up retraining again. “I do feel a sense of disappointment,” she says, “but the nature of work is changing. It’s very difficult now to decide what you want to do; you have to think carefully. It’s not about what you want any more; it’s about what is going to be there, what’s going to work.”\n\nIf you’re lucky, what ends up working best could be something you really enjoy – as is the case for Faz, 23, who took a break from his geography degree at the University of Manchester in 2023 because of a family matter. Afterwards, it didn’t make sense to him to return to his degree. “I had to think about what was future-proof, I had to think about what was AI-proof. And it seemed like a lot of entry-level roles in the corporate sector were being taken over by AI. And because AI is so unpredictable, you never know if those more specialised roles will also become obsolete,” he says. So he has instead been training for a Level 2 qualification in electrical installation since September 2025. “I thoroughly enjoy it,” he says. Though he might go back to university at some point – his “ideal setup” would be a combination of working part-time for a council or a charity, while doing electrical work on the side – “right now, a tradie job is 100%, God willing, the correct choice. I’m fairly certain it will be future-proofed against AI.”\n\nBethan, 24, from Bristol, also enjoys her AI-proof job, working in a local cafe. But it comes at a cost: she has hypermobility spectrum disorder, which gives her severe joint pain and makes it hard for her to move around. “I can’t work long hours now because I’ve pushed my body past the point,” she says.\n\nBethan’s old job, at a university IT helpdesk, “was the first job that I didn’t come home in pain from”, she says. But only a couple of months after she was hired, she and her colleagues were told the helpdesk was being closed down and replaced with an AI kiosk. “It was awful,” she says. The helpdesk staff tried to defend their roles, arguing that for students who didn’t speak English as a first language, or older students who weren’t computer-literate, having humans behind the desk may still be necessary. “It felt like we were getting completely ignored. They went ahead with it because they said they had to get a certain number of cuts to the budget.”\n\nHospitality was the only other sector in which she had experience, so she ended up at her cafe job. “Feeling like I had to go back to hospitality, which was so bad for my body, was a horrible feeling,” she says. She is now on the lookout for an office job, but has struggled to find anything entry-level. “Those are the jobs that are vanishing because they’re the easiest to replace,” she says – but it also means it is impossible to get the experience needed for higher-up roles. Bethan worries that even if she does get an office job, she could lose it to AI again. “Is it worth all the effort of applying, getting my CV up to date, and potentially doing a couple of rounds of interviews just to find out at the end we’re going to be replaced again?”\n\nWith more physically demanding jobs making up the bulk of what is now considered “AI-proof”, those who have made the switch from white-collar roles are having to adapt to the toll it takes on their bodies. The electricians Richard works with are typically in their late teens and early 20s. “Their recovery rates are a hell of a lot quicker than mine. So if I pick up an injury, for example, it takes me far longer to recuperate. Also, they can work far longer hours than I can,” he says.\n\nAnd though Feenstra enjoys the physicality of working in a bakery, she has been thinking about how sustainable this kind of job will be as she gets older. “That’s why I’ve been taking note of how the owners run the business,” she says, in case there is a possibility of running her own bakery one day. She is proud of how she is continuing to adapt to the changing world around her: “I want my sons to feel a little bit inspired by that,” she says. Yet she doesn’t feel she can offer them career advice. “How am I supposed to advise them when I don’t even really know if what I’m doing is the right path?” she says. “It’s really unsettling when you can’t advise them. If they have a passion for something and they want to do something, immediately you think, OK, is this even going to exist in the next 10, 20 years? That just kind of sucks.”\n\nBallerinas will still exist, says Klein. “No one is going to go to the ballet to see a robot do really good ballet,” the academic says. “Same for theatre, same for football, same for many other things where it matters that there’s a human.” He doesn’t think people will be wanting to confess to robo-priests any time soon either, or leave children in the care of AI. “There are just categories where we prefer to interact with humans, right?” For that reason, social skills will remain important, Klein and Frey agree. And though it might seem as if AI could make expert knowledge useless, Klein disagrees. “I have students who use AI naively, and therefore they have no idea whether the reports they produce are good or bad,” he says. “You need to have that expertise to be able to guide the AI to get it to do what you need it to do. So in that sense, I think the value of expertise might actually go up.”\n\nHow such expertise will be developed, if entry-level jobs are being ditched in favour of AI systems, is a question that remains as yet unanswered, as is who will actually be able to buy a ticket to the ballet should large swathes of the population be put out of work. But Frey doesn’t think it is worth spending too much time worrying about that potential future – yet. “It could well arrive, but it matters a great deal if that happens in five years or 20.” While he acknowledges “there are reasons to be concerned”, Frey doesn’t think it’s time to “paint a scenario where everybody’s going to be out of work five years from now, and we need to rethink everything”.",

    "fullText": "Wall Street may be getting the AI trade wrong, says Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and longtime tech bull.\n\nIves said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" published Tuesday that the recent investor pessimism toward software companies is 'the most disconnected call that I've ever seen.\"\n\nWhile much of the AI excitement has centered on data centers, chips, and GPUs, Ives said software will be the \"heart and lungs of the AI revolution.\"\n\nThe infrastructure buildout is still in its early innings and could stretch over the next decade. But software is where the real use cases and monetization will emerge, he added.\n\nIves said it is wrong to assume that big software companies like Salesforce and ServiceNow are \"structurally broken\" or set to be replaced by AI-native tools.\n\nThese companies are deeply embedded in enterprise stacks, with hundreds of thousands of customers, Ives said, adding that their AI use cases could unlock incremental revenue over the next six to 18 months that investors are not yet pricing in.\n\nLarge, entrenched platforms should not be compared to smaller players that serve small and medium-sized businesses. \"You cannot paint all of them with the same brush,\" Ives said.\n\nIves also defended Microsoft's role in the AI revolution. While acknowledging near-term concerns around capital spending and Azure growth, Ives said the broader AI rollout cannot succeed without Microsoft's software and cloud ecosystem.\n\nIves' comments came after software stocks tumbled last week amid investor fears that AI could disrupt large swaths of the industry.\n\nNot all tech and finance leaders think AI will replace traditional software companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed that idea at a Cisco AI event last week.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" Huang said. \"You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself,\" he added.\n\nHuang said AI depends on the tools software offers and pointed to ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis as examples of software firms well-positioned in the AI era.\n\nIves also wrote in an industry note published last week that the \"software armageddon\" can be regarded as a tech stock \"garage sale.\"\n\n\"We believe the market is baking in a doomsday scenario for software companies in the near-term, which we believe is extremely overblown, as many customers won't be willing to put their data at risk to capitalize on AI implementation strategies until there is less risk with these migration projects,\" Ives and his analysts wrote.\n\nIves has long urged investors to buy tech dips, even as critics caution that AI enthusiasm may be running ahead of earnings and real-world adoption.",

    "fullText": "Rules of mysterious ancient Roman board game decoded by AI\n\nA Roman stone board game has been unplayable since its discovery more than a century ago, but AI might have just worked out the rules\n\nJoin Our Community of Science Lovers!\n\nIt was the summer of 2020, and researcher Walter Crist was wandering around the exhibits inside a Dutch museum dedicated to the presence of the ancient Roman empire in the Netherlands. As a scientist who studies ancient board games, one exhibit stuck out to Crist: a stone game board dating to the late Roman Empire. It was about eight inches across and etched with angular lines that roughly formed the shape of an oblong octagon inside a rectangle.\n\n“I thought to myself, ‘Well, that’s very interesting,’ because the pattern on it—it’s not something I had ever seen in the literature before,” Crist says.\n\nWhat the game was called and how it was played were a mystery, too.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nCrist contacted the museum curators to get a closer look. And now he and his colleagues believe they’ve decoded the game in a first-of-its-kind study using a combination of more traditional archaeological methods and artificial intelligence. According to the analysis, the object appears to be a sort of “blocking game.” In these types of games, one player tries to block another from moving; one example is tic-tac-toe.\n\nThe research was published on Monday in the journal Antiquity.\n\nCrist, now a guest lecturer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, recalls that when he and his team started investigating the board game, they didn’t have a ton of details to work with. They knew that the game board had been found around the late 1800s or early 1900s in the southeastern Netherlands’ city of Heerlen—which would have been the city of Coriovallum in Roman times. The board was made out limestone that was imported from France. And the game was likely played casually and may not have been particularly notable, in part because there is no known documentation of it in written texts from the time.\n\nTo decipher the rules, Crist’s team programmed two AI agents to play the game over and over again using more than 100 different sets of rules taken from other known European games, both ancient and modern. As the AI agents played—1,000 games per set of rules—the researchers tracked how the pieces moved. Then they compared the moves with the levels of wear on areas of the board, tracing which gameplay seemed to replicate grooves on the stone.\n\nThe team found nine rule sets that appeared “consistent” with the wear on the board. “And they were all variations of this same kind of blocking game,” Crist says.\n\nThis type of game was played in the 19th and 20th centuries in Scandinavia, and researchers thought it dated to early medieval times. But the Roman game is the earliest example of such a game in Europe, Crist says. He and his team called the game Ludus Coriovalli, Latin for “the game from Coriovallum.” (You can play it online here.)\n\nCrist hopes the study will help researchers solve other ancient board games. Such games offer a way to connect the ancient past to our own lives, he says. Indeed, they haven’t changed much over the centuries. The ancient Egyptian board game Senet, for example, might not have been all that different from Sorry! Chess, meanwhile, is thought to have originated in ancient India, and nobody really knows when or where backgammon originated.\n\nUnderstanding how ancient games might’ve been played, Crist says, “can lead us to new insights on how people in the past enjoyed their lives.”\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.

He ran a large portion of the company until late last year, when several of his responsibilities were split between two other cofounders, Tony Wu and Guodong Zhang, people with knowledge of the move told Business Insider.\n\nBa also previously ran the team that oversaw more than a thousand AI tutors, according to an org chart from earlier last year.

Wu announced he'd resigned from the AI startup on Monday night. Wu's Slack account was deactivated shortly before the announcement, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nAhead of Wu's departure, xAI underwent another restructuring, and several of his responsibilities were shifted under Zhang.\n\nMusk launched the AI company in 2023 with 11 other founders. Six have now left the company — five of them within the last year.\n\nIn addition to his work at xAI, Ba is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto in the computer science department. He received his Ph.D. from the school while studying under Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the \"godfather of AI.\"\n\nMusk has said he built xAI as an alternative to what he's called \"woke\" chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Over the past year, the company has become known for pushing the envelope. Last July, xAI launched a sexy digital avatar called \"Ani,\" and its Grok chatbot went on an antisemitic rant.\n\nMost recently, xAI has come under fire after Grok began generating nonconsensual sexual images of real people in response to X user prompts. The backlash eventually prompted the company to restrict Grok's image-generation features on X.\n\nLast week, Musk announced that xAI would merge with his rocket company, SpaceX. The company is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value SpaceX at $1.5 trillion.\n\nBa and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Google's business unit is offering voluntary exit packages to some employees.\n\nIn an email sent to staff on Tuesday, Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, said employees on certain teams within the global business organization (GBO) could voluntarily leave the company with a severance package. \n\n\"We're starting the year in a strong position thanks to everything you accomplished in 2025,\" Schindler wrote in the memo, which Business Insider viewed. \"But the game is dynamic, the pace is electric, and the stakes are high.\"\n\nSchindler told employees in the memo that everyone in GBO needs to be \"all in\" on the mission and \"embracing AI to have even greater impact\".\n\nFor employees who weren't \"enjoying the pace we need to operate in\" or who are \"ready to move on from Google,\" Schindler said the company would offer a voluntary exit program for certain roles within GBO in the US. This includes employees working on solutions teams, sales, corporate development, and others. \n\nSchindler said America's large customer sales teams and other customer-facing roles would not be eligible for the programs.\n\n\"While all GBO functions are essential to our long-term strategy, we've decided not to offer VEP for these particular roles to limit as much disruption to our customers as possible,\" he wrote.\n\nGoogle has made similar offers to employees in other orgs over the past year. Last June, Google offered buyouts to some US-based employees as it cracked down on its return-to-office mandate. In October, it offered buyouts to YouTube employees as part of a reorganization.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave something to share?

    "description": "The CEO of StackBlitz, Eric Simons, says the web development startup has \"gone all in\" on AI agents.",
    "fullText": "StackBlitz CEO Eric Simons aims to have more AI agents than human employees working at the startup this year, a milestone he sees as emblematic of a broader shift underway across the software industry.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Business Insider, Simons said StackBlitz has \"gone all in on agents,\" deploying internally built AI systems across business intelligence, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\nAI has become increasingly good at writing software code, to the point where the technology is beginning to change how companies are run. OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage, is an early example of digital agents communicating and coordinating with one another without direct human involvement.\n\n\"To me, this is a crystal ball into the wildness of the inevitable future,\" Simons told Business Insider. \"Your AI agents will talk to other people's agents on your behalf, negotiating pricing for a product you want to buy, inquiring about availability for a restaurant, arguing your political viewpoints.\"\n\n\"Agents are an extension of yourself,\" he added. \"People will generally trust their agents with whatever they recommend them to buy, reserve, believe, or otherwise.\"\n\nSimons's comments come as software and SaaS stocks have slumped in recent weeks, a move he attributes to growing investor recognition that AI can now build software autonomously. As AI tools become more capable, he said, long-standing competitive moats based on specialized knowledge are eroding.\n\nHe compared the shift to the transformation of manufacturing over the past century. Craft knowledge once protected businesses, he said, but automation and digital design ultimately displaced many incumbents. \"Today, it's a CAD file you can 3D print,\" Simons said.\n\n\"While every individual does not use these profound new powers directly (like 3D printing a chair), there's an entire new generation of companies that do — and they have replaced the previous era of companies,\" Simons explained. \"They disrupted those incumbents by leveraging automation that made it far cheaper and at a massive scale not possible previously when moats were just knowledge and bare hands.\"\n\nFor businesses, the implications are stark. Even traditionally \"safe\" enterprise software may be vulnerable if AI agents can migrate or rebuild systems rapidly.\n\n\"What does it mean when all of software can be written, rewritten, migrated, or otherwise, 100x or 10,000x faster than it could've ever been done before, by a workforce that does not sleep, and can be parallelized near infinitely?\" Simons said. \"It's daunting and mind-bending, and I think the repricing of SaaS in public markets more accurately reflects this today.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

After Anthropic rolled out new tools for its Cowork agent aimed at professionals in the legal space, the entire sector sold off as investors eyed the potential for wider disruption.\n\nOther brokerage stocks, such as Interactive Brokers and Morgan Stanley, fared slightly better on Tuesday. The fact that both firms cater to institutional traders implies that Wall Street is more concerned about retail-facing brokerage stocks.\n\nCompanies in the accounting space, such as QuickBooks owner Intuit, fell about 3%. Accounting software makers SAP SE and Xero rose 1% and 2% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI approved the integration of an AI application on ChatGPT to enable users to receive direct insurance quotes on the platform.\n\nNeither platform directly offers users the ability to trade stocks, but for the market, the key concern is that AI disruption is poised to upend the financial sector, as it did the legal technology field last week.\n\nMarkets have largely recovered from the tech plunge last week, with multiple analysts saying this week that the event represents a buy-the-dip moment. Still, markets are on edge as new disruptive tools continue to emerge.",

    "description": "California's 91 Freeway uses AI cameras to catch solo HOV lane drivers, recovering $1 million in unpaid tolls through interior car photography.",
    "fullText": "Twenty-five thousand people monthly thought they were gaming the system on the 91 Express Lanes. Turns out, the house always wins — especially when it’s equipped with computer vision that can photograph your car’s interior through tinted windows. Since August 2025, Riverside County’s new Occupancy Detection System has been quietly documenting every solo driver pretending their gym bag is a passenger, recovering over $1 million in unpaid tolls and fees.\n\nThe technology reads like something from a dystopian Netflix series, except it’s scanning your morning commute. Cameras positioned at the end of the expressway capture multiple photographs of vehicle interiors. AI software flags potential violations before human reviewers at the Riverside County Transportation Commission confirm whether you actually have three people aboard. Get caught? You’ll pay the full toll plus a $5 “correction fee” — their polite term for getting busted.\n\nThis isn’t your typical red-light camera — the system spots fake passengers with unsettling accuracy.\n\nRCTC spokesperson Ariel Alcon reports catching drivers using “hats on headrests, putting items in baby car seats and even using mannequins” to fool the old enforcement system. The ODS isn’t impressed by your creativity. The technology distinguishes between actual humans and decoy passengers, even identifying properly installed car seats as legitimate occupants.\n\nConsider the scale: 400,000 cars use the 91 daily, with more than 100,000 breaking HOV rules. That’s roughly one in four drivers thinking they’re smarter than the system. Spoiler alert: they’re not.\n\nOfficials promise face-blurring and privacy compliance, but your driving habits are now permanent data.\n\nThe system protects privacy by blurring faces and storing images according to state and federal privacy laws. If you dispute a violation, you can call customer service at (800) 600-9191 or file online appeals through your 91 Express Lanes account. According to RCTC staff, most people don’t bother challenging charges once they learn about the cameras. That quiet acceptance speaks volumes about our collective resignation to surveillance infrastructure.\n\nThe 91’s success virtually guarantees expansion to other California carpool lanes. Your morning commute just became a case study in how automation transforms enforcement from occasional human oversight to constant digital monitoring.

    "description": "Artificial intelligence can write you a passable love poem and some people even have romantic feelings towards it. But is the feeling mutual?",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence can write you a passable love poem and some people even have romantic feelings towards it. But is the feeling mutual?\n\nPeople are falling for AI. Really. Take the man in Canada, for example, who recently proposed to an avatar called Saia. He says he is in love with it. And last year, a young American woman using the pseudonym Ayrin confessed to having a love affair with a chatbot named Leo.\n\nThere are millions of users now actively using Replika, a popular AI companion app, and, according to a 2024 study, about 40% of them are in a romantic relationship with their chatbot. However, while some people might feel as though AI can love them back, a chatbot's responses are nothing more than text generated by algorithms designed to imitate human interactions. Most experts agree that such systems are far from sentient. They're currently just mimicking emotion, but some experts believe the machines might be able to manage \n\n\"Nowadays, a lot of AI chatbots are pretending to be human and that really bothers me,\" says Renwen Zhang, an assistant professor in the department of communications and new media at the National Institute of Singapore. \"It's a strategy to drive user engagement and to increase trust.\"\n\nPut like that, the tugging of human emotions by a product created by technology companies begins to look like a cynical tactic. Certainly, no AI at present is ever going to feel the same way about you as you might about it, experts say.\n\nWhile the large language models (LLMs) behind widely-used chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude might be comparable to humans when it comes to understanding emotions, that doesn't mean that an AI can actually feel anything. Zhang's research, which examined excerpts from conversations between more than 10,000 users and their Replika companions, suggests that people often form an emotional attachment to AI. But they are also, somewhat tragically, reminded that they are interacting with just a machine whenever it breaks down or freezes, for example. Sadly, such people often get hurt.\n\n\"I think AI chatbots need to clearly convey to users that they are just machines: they don't have genuine emotions and experiences,\" says Zhang.\n\nIn other work examining human relationships with AI, Zhang and her colleagues noticed that people often experienced an eerie feeling as well as a mix of positive and negative emotions when an AI responded as though it were a self-aware human during intimate encounters. She says it is similar to people sometimes finding robots creepy when they look too human, called the uncanny valley effect.\n\nIt's not easy to define love. But it's worth celebrating what we do know about this incredible human experience. Many poems, books, songs and so on help people process and express some of the most powerful feelings they'll ever experience. Humans came up with all of that. AI can of course write poems and even entire novels in just seconds, drawing on the entire breadth of human-generated material they have been trained on. But expecting AI to truly understand and experience love, with all of its mystery and depth, is a big ask.\n\nWhile the concept of romantic love may mean somewhat different things to different people, in recent decades scientists have examined the biology of reproduction and the brain processes involved in choosing a sexual partner.\n\nIn a research paper published in 1998, biological anthropologist Helen Fisher came up with a leading theory of romantic love, describing it as three independent drives affected by chemicals in our bodies. Lust, governed by sex hormones, is one. The other two, attraction and attachment, are influenced by the release of chemicals in our brain. Dopamine, for example, triggers excitement towards a love interest while oxytocin, dubbed the cuddle hormone, helps to promote a long-term bond.\n\n\"Love has a strong chemical component,\" says Neil McArthur, a professor of philosophy specialising in ethics and technology at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. \"We really feel it in our bones, in our chemistry.\"\n\nDifferent parts of the brain are involved in love and brain scans of people in the throes of love have captured this.\n\nPrimitive brain regions linked to pleasure, such as the ventral tegmental area, for example, are activated along with the amygdala, which is responsible for emotional responses and the hippocampus, which processes emotions and helps form memories. Being in love can also impact other cognitive abilities, for example when we end up thinking about someone obsessively during the early stages of a romance.\n\nThe closest AI might get to love is replicating some of the thought processes involved, such as wanting to frequently contact a person with whom we are in love, suggests McArthur.\n\n\"An AI that goes through a cognitive process that ties them to someone in a bond of loyalty is not going to be exactly like human love,\" says McArthur. \"But maybe we could call it, in some kind of scare quotes at least, an emotion.\"\n\nWhile some researchers believe emotion will be a vital aspect to build into AI in the future, others are highly sceptical that any machine will truly be able to experience emotions in anything approaching our own experience of them.\n\nSince computers running software don't experience love the way we do, the feelings involved in human-AI relationships are inevitably one-sided. The dynamics of these romances are therefore much more limited than those that occur between humans.\n\nChatbots are typically designed to engage users and agree with their viewpoints, which often results in AI romantic partners being submissive. This appeals to some, though Zhang finds the dynamic concerning, since it can affect a person's ability to build and sustain meaningful relationships with other – perhaps less-submissive – humans.\n\n\"People can temporarily escape from the messiness of human relationships and find some comfort from AI – but in the long run it's not helpful in developing communication skills and the skill to maintain relationships in the real world,\" she says.\n\nFundamentally, to love someone as we do probably requires consciousness, meaning a subjective awareness – our thoughts, perceptions and mental imagery. Conscious experiences are central to being human and can range from perceiving a smell, to reflecting on why we might feel embarrassed. Researchers have different views on how such consciousness emerges and there are still many mysteries to solve, making it difficult to replicate in a machine.\n\n\"No one has any clue about getting any specific conscious experience out of an AI,\" says Donald Hoffman, a professor of cognitive sciences at the University of California, Irvine. \"It's not like we're almost there: we don't know how to start.\"\n\nA leading theory developed by neuroscientists Giulio Tonini from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Christof Koch from the Allen Institute in Seattle, Washington suggests that consciousness arises from the interconnection of different parts of the brain, and how they influence each other. Although it could apply to computers too, Koch argues that level of interconnectedness would never happen in existing machines since their architecture is not complex enough.\n\nHoffman, on the other hand, says that conscious experiences such as love don't necessarily originate from circuitry in the brain. There is yet to be any definitive proof of that, he adds.\n\nSome experts say that AI systems could become conscious in the future. Koch, for example, suggests that neuromorphic computing, a novel approach to AI that mimics the structure and function of the human brain, could be a candidate since it would have a higher degree of integration than current systems.\n\nConscious machines are plausible agrees Patrick Butlin, a philosopher of mind and cognitive science, who is a researcher at the University of Oxford's Global Priorities Institute. He and colleagues examined leading theories of consciousness and selected 14 properties that developers of AI systems could try to replicate. No existing AI system has incorporated more than a few of them, Butlin says, but all could theoretically be met using current technologies.\n\n\"I do think that there's a realistic possibility that if somebody who was efficiently well-resourced, skilful and motivated set out to build a conscious AI system, then they could achieve it,\" he says.\n\nAmong those properties Butlin and his colleagues identified for achieving consciousness was the need for a body. This is something that many current AI systems lack.\n\nBeing able to experience beliefs and desires also seems key for our ability to love someone. But researchers are currently divided over whether AI systems can be said to believe anything, says Butlin.\n\n• Is there something special about the human voice?\n\n• The riddles humans can solve but robots cannot\n\nEven if AI were to become conscious, Butlin thinks that people would ultimately have to come up with some objective standards when trying to decide whether they can experience love. Since machines are not human, they could never love us back in the same way. Butlin compares it to determining whether non-human animals, which have a wide range of social structures and cognitive capacities, are capable of love.\n\n\"There are probably going to be some examples where we intuitively feel like it's pretty plausible and other examples where we don't but it's hard to draw the line exactly,\" says Butlin. \"Whether we think AI [can experience love] is also going to depend on a bit of line-drawing: they're inevitably going to be different from humans.\"\n\nFor more technology news and insights, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "fullText": "We still don't know what OpenAI's mysterious hardware device is — but now we have a better idea of when we might get our hands on it.\n\nThe company just revealed it doesn't expect to ship the product it's building with legendary Apple designer Jony Ive before February 2027.\n\nThe admission came in a Monday court filing by OpenAI amid a dispute with the startup Iyo, which sued OpenAI last year over the \"io\" trademark.\n\nThe previously known public timeline for the OpenAI device, shared by the company's chief global affairs officer at Davos last month, was a product reveal in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe Monday filing contained a sworn statement from Peter Welinder, the vice president and general manager at OpenAI, stating that the company expects its \"first hardware device will not ship to customers before the end of February 2027.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether OpenAI still plans to unveil the new device later this year before shipping it in 2027. An OpenAI spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOpenAI announced last year that it would acquire Ive's hardware company, io Products, in a deal valued at nearly $6.5 billion.\n\nIn June last year, after Iyo sued OpenAI, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing OpenAI from using the \"io\" trademark. OpenAI then scrubbed mentions of its partnership with Ive from its website, as well as a promotional video.\n\nIn the Monday filing, OpenAI's lawyers said the company no longer planned to use the \"io\" name for its product. The company had \"reevaluated the branding of their forthcoming hardware products in light of OpenAI's existing brands,\" they wrote in the filing, adding that the name would not be used for marketing or \"sale of any artificial intelligence-enabled hardware products.\"\n\nThe lawyers argued that an April 2026 preliminary injunction hearing, which had been scheduled by the court, would therefore be \"both unnecessary and impractical.\"\n\nWired previously reported on elements of Monday's court filing.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Ive and OpenAI's first hardware product has sparked much speculation, including whether it will take the form of earbuds, a pen, glasses, or something else.\n\nA video purporting to tease the new device circulated over the weekend, which OpenAI said was \"totally fake.\" A now-deleted Reddit post claimed the video was a shelved ad teasing earbuds with actor Alexander Skarsgård.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "If you're starting your career at PwC, deciding where you'll do it has gotten a lot easier.\n\nThe Big Four firm cut the number of US locations where entry-level consultants can start working to just 13, BI's Polly Thompson exclusively reports.\n\nLimiting the options — new hires could previously choose any of the 72 US offices — is about building a greater sense of community among junior employees early in their careers, Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, told Polly.\n\nIt's an example of how PwC is evolving in the AI era. Polly previously reported on the firm's launch of a learning initiative to train workers in specific skills necessary for AI. It also created a new career path aimed at engineers.\n\nIt's not just PwC. Polly has done a fantastic job covering consulting firms and their attempt to use AI without upending their business. AI agents are still falling short of outright replacing human consultants, but the CEO of one AI training giant told BI the models are learning fast.\n\nIn the meantime, AI use by entry-level employees remains a key issue.\n\nOn the one hand, the tech can automate a lot of the mind-numbing work that juniors get bogged down with early on. On the other hand, skipping that initial work means losing foundational knowledge that is crucial down the road.\n\nThe AI-for-juniors issue isn't specific to consulting.\n\nThe risks posed by training young workers on AI are universal. And with so much emphasis on benefiting from AI, companies can't delay their decision much longer.\n\n\"What differentiates outperformers in 2026 won't be strategy; it will be execution,\" Paul Griggs, CEO of PwC US, told me last month when discussing big themes for the year.\n\nLeaders need to be \"hyper intentional around discipline, around road maps, around building teams that are measured based on what they execute,\" Griggs added.\n\nTwo senior bankers I spoke with last month raised questions about how to use AI efficiently early in your career. They debated the benefits of expediting a junior's path toward more impactful work, alongside the risks of creating a knowledge gap by skipping early steps.\n\nIt's a tricky balance. Forgoing it entirely means you risk falling behind your competitors. Leaning in too heavily risks losing the attribute your clients still pay you big bucks for: human judgment.\n\n\"You're missing some of this basic training that's actually a very important underpin and foundation to your more sophisticated evaluation and judgment of things at a later stage in your career,\" one of the bankers said about outsourcing early work to AI.",

    "fullText": "New York-based cybersecurity startup Reco has raised $30 million in Series B funding as companies rapidly expand their AI use.\n\nOfer Klein, Gal Nakash, and Tal Shapira founded Reco in 2020 to fill the gap between a company's existing cybersecurity protections and the other tech tools employees use, which is often AI.\n\n\"AI adoption has accelerated exponentially, and companies that blocked AI access a year ago cannot block it anymore,\" Klein told Business Insider. \"And I'm not talking about small mom-and-pop shops; I'm talking about the biggest banks, insurance, healthcare, pharma, and hospitals.\"\n\nZeev Ventures led its latest round, with participation from all existing investors, which includes Insight Partners and Boldstart Ventures. New corporate investors for this round include Workday Ventures, TIAA Ventures, S Ventures, and Quadrille Capital.\n\n\"My investment strategy has always been to double down on what's working,\" Oren Zeev, the famed seed investor behind Zeev Ventures, said in a statement. \"I've seen this pattern with successful companies like Navan and Tipalti, and I'm seeing it again with Reco. The signals we see show rapidly growing market demand for AI SaaS security, and we are experiencing exceptional growth.\"\n\nWhile software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks have recently plunged amid concerns about AI disruption, Zeev sees a \"massive\" opportunity in AI for security.\n\nAfter growing 500% year-over-year in 2024, Reco said it grew an additional 400% in 2025, driven by a sharp increase in business AI adoption.\n\nCybersecurity startups also raised nearly $14 billion in 2025, according to Pinpoint Search Group. That represented a 47% increase from 2024 and the most funding since 2021.\n\nKlein said Reco began pulling in far larger companies than expected, repeatedly beating internal plans as AI went from blocked to mandatory.\n\n\"We built a plan, and we overachieved, and we updated the plan, and we overachieved again,\" said Klein. \"We said, 'OK, enough is enough, let's take more money and double down on AI SaaS.\"'\n\nKlein said the biggest challenge for Reco now is keeping up with demand.\n\n\"The business is driving this huge traction into AI enablement,\" he said. \"Our biggest challenge right now: how we grow fast enough to meet this market need.\"\n\nKlein's cofounders also bring in experience from working with the government. Nakash previously headed research at the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel, while Shapira holds a machine learning Ph.D. and also worked at Israel's Office of the Prime Minister.\n\nReco faces competition from Torq, backed by Insight Partners and now valued at $1.2 billion, according to PitchBook. It also competes with Blackstone-backed Cyera, recently valued at $9 billion.",

    "description": "At a financial services conference in Miami, David Solomon cited a backlog of private equity spending and AI as key capital-generating drivers.",
    "fullText": "David Solomon is officially done playing defense.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs CEO has steered the bank through several grueling years for the industry, including a multi-year drought in private equity spending and extreme trading volatility. But after a booming 2025, Solomon told investors at a UBS financial services conference on Tuesday that the firm is entering 2026 with the wind at its back.\n\nSolomon praised policymakers in Washington for spurring acquisitive appetites. \"You have a massive deregulatory trend in the United States after a very tough regulatory period in the United States, across all industries,\" Solomon said.\n\nThe receptive comments about the government's heightened support for M&A came just months after President Donald Trump lashed out at Solomon on Truth Social in August, mocking his former side gig as a DJ and encouraging him to step down from the CEO throne. Trump's rebuke came after a Goldman Sachs economist suggested that tariff policies could cost consumers.\n\nDespite that dustup, Solomon is now leaning into the administration's growth-oriented agenda, arguing that the friction of the past has been replaced by a \"constructive\" new reality for the banking sector.\n\nHere are the three factors Solomon named on Tuesday that have left him feeling bullish about 2026's dealmaking forecast.\n\nSolomon thinks that, coming off strong results last quarter, 2026 will represent an inflection point for the global mood toward M&A. For the past five years, he said, strategic buyers had encountered a \"different regulatory regime,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, the answer was no.\"\n\n\"Now, whatever the question is, the answer's maybe,\" he told UBS Erika Najarian, who hosted the discussion.\n\nThat, too, he said, could drive a resurgence in the IPO market, which has been expected to return this year. And in terms of mergers and the kind of corporate dealmaking that is Goldman's bread and butter, \"this could be a top decile\" year, Solomon said.\n\nAnd one major driver he pointed to is cash-rich, asset-heavy private equity sponsors.\n\nA key pipeline for Goldman has been banking for the world's top private equity sponsors, many of whom held assets longer than their own investors would like while waiting out a period of lackluster valuations and uncomfortably high interest rates.\n\nThat's left limited partners hungry for capital returns to reinvest in future deals, the secondaries and continuation vehicles markets booming, and banks praying that 2026 is the year that their private equity clients finally indicate they're ready for action.\n\nSolomon said the pressure for sponsors to return capital to their investors has reached a breaking point.\n\n\"We're reaching a point in time where that unlock\" is starting to occur, Solomon said. He pointed to mounting \"pressure from the LP community and the cycle life of fundraising has reached a point in time for most of these firms that they can't get into the valuation debate as much. They've got to move forward.\"\n\nSolomon has been on a mission to make Goldman AI-ready and has pointed to the massive investment in the space. \"The need for capital to continue on this technology cycle is going to have an impact on the overall capital-raising cycle, so I see all this stuff accelerating, and I feel pretty good about it,\" he said. He cited mega-tech names that have turned to the debt market to raise liquidity for AI-related projects.\n\nIt won't always be smooth sailing, Solomon conceded, framing Trump's governing style as something of an open question for markets. \"He also has a tendency in policy to move from policy action to policy action,\" he said. \"I'd still say there's uncertainty around trade. There is uncertainty around inflation, and there's uncertainty on geopolitics.\"\n\nBut, he concluded, \"I think the likely outcome in 2026 is we're going to have a pretty constructive year for capital markets, a pretty constructive year for M&A — particularly large-cap, strategic M&A — and the result of that should be very favorable for the people in this room.\"",

    "fullText": "If you're of a certain age, you might remember mixtapes: cassettes made up of a series of tracks you or a friend think work well together, or otherwise enjoy. (They took some work to put together, too.) Digital music sort of killed mixtapes, but, in their place, came playlists. You could easily put together a collection of your favorite songs, and either burn them to a CD, or, as streaming took over, let the playlist itself grow as large as you wanted.\n\nAnyone can make a playlist, but there's an art to it. Someone with a keen ear for music can build a playlist you can let play for hours. Maybe you have a friend who's good at making playlists, or maybe you're that friend in your group. They can be a fun way to share music, and find some new music to add to your own library.\n\nNow, generative AI wants to replace human intervention altogether. Rather than you or a friend building a playlist, you can ask AI to do it for you. And YouTube Music is the latest service to give it a try.\n\nYouTube announced its new AI playlist generator in a post on X on Monday. If you To try it out, open YouTube Music, then head to your Library and tap \"New.\" Next, choose the new \"AI Playlist\" option, then enter the type of music you're looking for. You could ask YouTube Music to generate a playlist of pop-punk songs, or to make something to play when focusing on work. Really, it's whatever you want, and if the AI gets it wrong, you can try it again.\n\nIt's pretty straightforward, and nothing revolutionary. Other music streaming services have their own AI playlist generators too. Spotify, for example, has had one for a couple of years, but recently rolled out Prompted Playlist as well, which lets you generate playlists that update with time, and takes your listening history into account. With this update, however, YouTube is likely trying to drum up some interest in its streaming service and encourage users to pay for it. Just this week, the company put lyrics—once a free feature—behind the Premium paywall. I suppose it thinks that if you can't read what your favorite artists are singing, and you'd like to have a bot make your playlists for you, you might just \n\nThis could be a good change in the long run for YouTube Music subscribers. I'm on Apple Music, so I don't really use AI-generated playlists. I like the Apple-curated playlists, as well as the ones my friends and I make and share. But who knows: Maybe human-generated playlists are going the way of the mixtape.",

    "description": "Tired of AI’s high costs and limits? Discover how a home server and graph theory outperformed GPT-5.2 for deep research, saving $550/month while owning your ...",
    "fullText": "I recently had a problem that could be solved with money, which is the worst kind of problem.\n\nI am building a new venture called eh-trade.ca. To make it work, I needed deep financial research on 11,000 different stocks.\n\nThe \"Enterprise\" solution is to buy an API subscription. I looked into this. For my usage, the pricing is somewhere between \"$200/month\" and \"Contact Sales\". If you are a micro-preneur like me, \"Contact Sales\" means \"You cannot afford this.\"\n\nThe \"AI\" solution is to ask an LLM to research each stock, which works really well. But 11,000 requests at $0.05 per research session is still $550. Plus, I don't like renting intelligence. I prefer to own it.\n\nSo I decided to use the hardware I already had: a home server with four RTX 3090s. It’s a 96GB VRAM beast that heats my basement and scares my birds.\n\nThere was just one problem. The models I can run locally (like qwen3 or phi4) have small context windows. Yes, on the model card they theoretically support 40k+ of context, but they would run very slowly on my hardware, so really, it's 4K -- enough for a few screenfuls of text. Moreover, even if I enabled the long contexts, the models struggle to reason over them. If you try to feed them ten search results about a company's balance sheet, the 'needle in the haystack' effect kicks in. They'll get confused and start hallucinating dividends that don't exist.\n\nMost \"AI Agents\" are built on a simple loop, often called ReAct (Reason + Act). It looks like this:\n\nThe problem is the Context Window. By step 3, your prompt looks like a Walmart receipt. By step 5, you have exceeded 8,000 tokens, and the model forgets what it was doing and starts making stuff up.\n\nSure, it works fine if you are OpenAI and have infinite GPUs. It does not work if you are running on a consumer card in a closet.\n\nA few months ago, I read a paper called GraphReader. It proposed a different way to think about long contexts. Instead of dumping everything into a chat log, why not treat information as a graph?\n\nThe core insight is that you don't need to remember everything. You only need to remember the Atomic Facts.\n\nAn Atomic Fact is a single, indivisible truth.\n\nIf we extract these facts and throw away the rest, we can compress megabytes of web pages into a few kilobytes of JSON.\n\nI built a library called laconic to implement this. I wrote it in Go, because the rest of my projects are all in Go. Plus, my python environments always end up as a tangled mess of pip install errors.\n\nLaconic doesn't keep a chat history. It keeps a Notebook. The context window size is O(N), where N is the number of facts, not the number of words.\n\nLaconic uses a specific strategy called graph-reader.\n\nThe beautiful part? The LLM never sees the full history. It only sees the current Notebook and the current search result. This means I can run complex, multi-step research tasks on a model with a tiny 4k context window, and it never forgets a thing.\n\nHere is the code to run a research agent on my home server using Ollama:\n\nTo really test if this strategy works on constrained hardware, I ran a research question using qwen3:4b—a tiny 4-billion-parameter model.\n\nWithout the agentic loop, the model cannot answer this question. If you ask it directly, it responds that \"the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has not been announced.\"\n\nHowever, with the agent, it autonomously searches, extracts atomic facts, and synthesizes this:\n\nAnswer: The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to David Baker (University of Washington, Howard Hughes Medical Institute), Demis Hassabis, and John M. Jumper (Google DeepMind). David Baker was recognized for computational protein design. Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were awarded for protein structure prediction using AlphaFold2.\n\nThe agent found all three laureates, their exact affiliations, and their distinct contributions — information entirely outside the model's training data — by exploring multiple search queries and accumulating verified facts in a structured notebook.\n\nIf you hang out in the parts of the internet where people try to make AI write code without hallucinating, you might have heard of the Ralph Loop.\n\nPopularized by Geoffrey Huntley, the Ralph Loop (often named after Ralph Wiggum) is a brute-force solution to the context problem. You write a bash script that:\n\nThen it starts over. Fresh context. Zero memory leak. The \"memory\" is the file system.\n\nLaconic is essentially a Ralph Loop for reading.\n\nInstead of a bash script, it's a Go loop. Instead of git commit, we update a JSON Notebook. But the philosophy is identical: The Context Window is a liability.\n\nMost frameworks try to manage the context window like a precious resource. Ralph and Laconic treat it like a disposable napkin. Use it once, wipe the slate clean, and grab a fresh one.\n\nIt turns out that if you treat an LLM like a goldfish with a notepad, it becomes significantly smarter.\n\nI am currently running this loop on 11,000 tickers that I'm missing basic information on. It will take a week, and cost some power, but I would have left the machine on anyway because I am running a few other things on it.\n\nAnd if you want to find stocks that are going up, keep an eye on eh-trade.ca. My customers tell me I should brag more, so I'm up 280% in seven months following momentum strategies that it's showing on the main page.\n\nI'll have the data soon, assuming my basement doesn't catch fire.",

    "fullText": "One of xAI's cofounders, Tony Wu, has left Elon Musk's AI company.\n\nWu said in a post on X on Tuesday that he has resigned from the company.\n\n\"It's time for my next chapter,\" Wu wrote. \"It is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what's possible.\"\n\n\"And to Elon @elonmusk - thank you for believing in the mission and for the ride of a lifetime,\" he added.\n\nWu is the fourth cofounder to leave the company over the past year. Christian Szegedy left the company in February, according to his LinkedIn. Igor Babuschkin announced he'd left the company in August, and Greg Yang said last month that he'd taken a step back from the company due to health concerns.\n\nBefore joining the company, Wu worked at Google for nearly two years and interned at OpenAI, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nxAI was launched in 2023. Musk has said the company and its Grok chatbot will serve as an alternative to what he deems \"woke\" chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nSince then, Musk has merged the company with his social media company X. Last week, Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, acquired xAI.\n\nThe company is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value SpaceX at $1.5 trillion.\n\nxAI has come under fire in recent months after its chatbot, Grok, was found to have generated nonconsensual sexual images of real people. The backlash prompted the company to restrict Grok's image-generation features on X.\n\nFrench authorities last week raided xAI's Paris office as part of an investigation following reports that Grok was used to create sexually explicit deepfakes.\n\nxAI and Wu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "\"I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career,\" wrote Siddhant Khare. \"I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career.\"",
    "fullText": "The software engineers are not alright.\n\nAI was supposed to make programming easier. Siddhant Khare said that while AI tools have made him more productive, his job is now harder than ever.\n\n\"We used to call it an engineer, now it is like a reviewer,\" Khare told Business Insider. \"Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending, you just keep stamping those PRs.\"\n\nKhare wrote a lengthy essay titled \"AI fatigue is real and nobody talks about it.\" In it, he wrote that AI fatigue is \"the kind of exhaustion that no amount of tooling or workflow optimization could fix.\"\n\n\"I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career,\" he wrote. \"I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career.\"\n\nKhare, who is a software engineer at ONA, makes AI tools himself. He said he's not against AI, he just wants people, including software engineers like himself, to find a more sustainable way to use the technology.\n\nThe issue, Khare wrote, is that AI creates a paradox of productivity that falls almost entirely on the user to solve by reducing the cost of production but increasing \"the cost of coordination, review, and decision-making.\"\n\nHis typical day is no longer devoted to deep focus on a single design problem, Khare wrote, but rather to context switching between as many as six different problems.\n\n\"Each one 'only takes an hour with AI.' But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain,\" he wrote. \"The AI doesn't get tired between problems. I do.\"\n\nEarly reactions show Khare isn't alone. Fellow engineers have shared their thoughts on X, Hacker News, and Lobsters. Their experiences echo what Khare wrote: vibe coding can lead to burnout vibes.\n\n\"I joke that I'm on the 'Claude Code workout plan' now,\" one user wrote on Hacker News. \"Standing desk, while it's working I do a couple squats or pushups or just wander around the house to stretch my legs. Much more enjoyable than sitting at my desk, hands on keyboard, all day long. And taking my eyes off the screen also makes it easier to think about the next thing.\"\n\nOthers make their day sound like the \"C'mon do something meme\" as they wait for a coding agent to respond with results, which they will then have to edit and refine.\n\n\"I used to lose myself in focused work for hours,\" another user wrote. \"That's changed. Now I'm constantly pulled away, and I've noticed the pattern: I send a prompt, wait for the reply, and drift into browsing.\"\n\nOn Monday, Harvard Business Review published a report on an eight-week study at a US tech company with 200 employees that \"discovered that AI tools didn't reduce work, they consistently intensified it.\"\n\n\"Once the excitement of experimenting fades, workers can find that their workload has quietly grown and feel stretched from juggling everything that's suddenly on their plate,\" the report continued. \"That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making.\"\n\nKhare said another struggle he has had is keeping up with the number of updates from OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies as they push their popular models and agents.\n\n\"Once you open your laptop, your phone either you go to Slack, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, and these are all things that are like 'Look at me,'\" Khare said.\n\nThe companies need to keep innovating to stay apace in the AI race, but for programmers like himself, Khare said, the updates create a sense of panic about missing out on what could be the next greatest thing.\n\n\"I was spending weekends evaluating new tools,\" he wrote. \"Reading every changelog. Watching every demo. Trying to stay at the frontier because I was terrified of falling behind.\"\n\nUltimately, Khare wrote that the scariest thing was how AI was changing him. He said he struggled when someone asked him \"to reason through a concurrency problem on the whiteboard\" with no laptop or AI.\n\n\"It's like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes,\" he wrote. \"After years of GPS, you can't navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.\"\n\nAndrej Karpathy, Tesla's former AI head and the engineer who coined the term \"vibe coding\" last year, recently wrote that while the industry was seeing a \"phase shift\" among increasingly impressive AI coding tools, he'd also begun to notice skill atrophy.\n\n\"I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually,\" Karpathy wrote.\n\nDetermined to help himself, Khare wrote that he had come up with a list of ground rules to rein in his AI use.\n\nHe's still struggling to hold himself to it. He said almost completely ignoring the AI conversation over his 14-day holiday break was a start. Khare said that while he wrote that having a 30-minute timer on AI use is helpful, it wasn't intended to be a strict limit.\n\nThe engineer also said that AI companies themselves could help as well. He compared the feeling of being just one prompt away from a perfect answer to the way addictive games try to keep users playing.\n\n\"You need to keep some sort of guardrails for the humans, so they don't self-distruct themselves,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI's next funding round could be good news for four Big Tech stocks with links to the ChatGPT creator, DA Davidson says.\n\nOpenAI isn't publicly traded — at least not yet — but DA Davidson says a fresh wave of hype is coming on the heels of its next fundraising round, and it could could boost four stocks in its orbit.\n\n\"We have been very critical on OpenAI overpromising, asking for government handouts and being spread too thin,\" DA Davidson analysts, led by Gil Luria, wrote about the AI company.\n\n\"We believe OpenAI's behavior led to the underperformance in shares of NVDA, MSFT, CRWV and especially ORCL over the last 5 months.\"\n\nOpenAI is reportedly closing in on another fundraising round, with recent reports suggesting a $50 billion investment from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds is in the works.\n\nFuturum CEO and analyst Daniel Newman told Business Insider that they expect the next funding round will bring OpenAI's valuation to $750 billion to $850 billion.\n\nThe analyst described the appetite for OpenAI in his conversations with investors to be \"pretty insatiable.\"\n\nDA Davidson analysts wrote that they expect that yet another multibillion-dollar OpenAI funding round will reignite enthusiasm for the company and lift some connected AI stocks.\n\n\"Since the market is currently assigning the OpenAI relationship a negative value, we believe the fundraise will serve as a catalyst for outperformance,\" they wrote of Oracle, CoreWeave, Nvidia, and Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI has come under fire for its reliance on debt and growing competition challenging its dominant position.\n\nThe company is partnered with Oracle to build $500 billion of data centers as part of its Stargate project. OpenAI has yet to turn a profit.\n\nAnother concern weighing on OpenAI is the notion that Alphabet's Google Gemini has caught up in the AI race.\n\n\"We believe that a revamped OpenAI will return to its position as Google's top challenger and with a fresh stack of capital be able to live up to its obligations this year, including to Oracle,\" they said.\n\nThe analysts upgraded Oracle to Buy from Neutral on their expectation that new funding for OpenAI will be a positive catalyst for the stock as well as general sentiment about OpenAI and the connected players.\n\n\"We expect that as investors go back to seeing OpenAI as a winner, the public companies in its orbit could re-rate significantly. Most importantly that should drive outperformance in NVDA and MSFT, but also in CRWV, and even ORCL, which we are upgrading today based on our updated view on OpenAI,\"\n\nTheir more bullish stance on OpenAI comes after the company corrected course.\n\n\"OpenAI has started focusing on its core frontier model and ChatGPT, while de-emphasizing some marginals initiatives. This includes going down the path of turning on ads, which will be critical for increased monetization and reduced cash burn.\"\n\nThey also noted a shift in the company's management that suggests they see a need to align with Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, rather than compete.",
