    "description": "OpenAI  invites you to hand over your medical information. Maybe don't?",
    "fullText": "This week, OpenAI announced its new ChatGPT Health feature, which will let users upload their medical records and ask health related questions. However, I certainly won't be making use of it, it might not be the best idea for you to do it either, for both reliability and privacy reasons.\n\nThe new ChatGPT Health feature will be a sandboxed tab inside the app that is isolated from your conversation history in other conversations with the chatbot. This tab also allows users to connect a variety of health-tracking apps like Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, and Peloton, as well as uploading medical records directly.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a lot of really personal information to hand over to any tech company—but especially one that isn't primarily focused on providing medical services. OpenAI says that the ChatGPT Health space operates with \"enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data,\" but it doesn't use end-to-end encryption to secure that data. And while the company says data collected via Health isn't used to train its foundation models, it's impossible to know whether that may change in the future. Security breaches can also occur (and have in the past), potentially leaving your medical records exposed.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the risk of uploading your data is worth it in the first place. According to OpenAI's own data, around 5% of all messages to ChatGPT are already users asking questions about their health, and ChatGPT (and other LLM tools) have a nasty habit of providing inaccurate diagnostic information. This is perhaps why OpenAI says that its new ChatGPT Health feature is \"not intended for diagnosis or treatment.\"\n\nCurrently, there's a waitlist to At the very least, that means that until the feature is available, it's probably a good idea not to ask the regular version of ChatGPT about your health concerns. At the very least, wait until the enhanced privacy sandbox is available. In the meantime, consider whether it makes more sense to just talk to your doctor directly if you have questions or concerns about your health.",

    "fullText": "Ramp AI Index measures the adoption rate of artificial intelligence products and services among American businesses. Our sample includes more than 50,000 American businesses and billions of dollars in corporate spend using data from Ramp’s corporate card and bill pay platform.\n\nOur work builds on previous work by Bonney et al. (2024) by providing a new dataset to measure firm adoption of artificial intelligence. Previous work has relied almost entirely on surveys that ask businesses if they use AI, but surveys may lead to underreporting of actual AI adoption, particularly when questions are unclear or when adoption of a new technology is rising very quickly. Using contract and transaction data from corporate spend with AI companies, we produced a more timely and accurate measurement of AI adoption by U.S. businesses.\n\nOur transaction set is built using company models that extract line-item text from paid receipts and bills uploaded by the purchaser following a sale. Firms are considered to have adopted AI tools if they have a positive transaction amount for an AI product or service in a given month. AI products and services are identified using merchant name and line item details from receipts and bills.\n\nFirms are assigned to industry sectors using internal company models that predict the relevant industry sector using the NAICS standard. Firms are assigned to business size segments using company models that use internal and third-party data on firm revenues and employee counts.\n\nIt’s likely our results underestimate actual adoption rates due to the prevalence of businesses using free AI tools, in which no paid transaction occurs, or when employees use personal accounts with AI companies to complete work tasks.",

    "description": "Read Debugging Hallucinations: A Mechanistic Investigation into Model Confidence on Saumil Srivastava's AI Engineering Blog",
    "fullText": "As engineers, we often treat Large Language Models (LLMs) as opaque inference engines: a prompt enters, text exits, and we evaluate the output based on surface-level correctness.\n\nWhile exploring model failure modes, fabricated citations emerged as a particularly sharp example that standard evaluation metrics failed to capture.\n\nThe model would invent a case—Harrison v. McDonald—and cite it with the precise formatting and tonal confidence of a Supreme Court opinion. The issue wasn't just that the output was factually wrong; it was that the model's internal confidence appeared indistinguishable from when it cited real case law.\n\nI wanted to move beyond \"prompt engineering\" to answer a fundamental question: Can we detect the difference between retrieved knowledge and stochastic pattern matching by observing the model's internal activations?\n\nThis post documents the engineering journey including the failed hypotheses and broken code required to differentiate \"memory\" from \"imagination\" inside a transformer.\n\nTransformers operate on a residual stream, where information accumulates across layers. My working hypothesis was based on two distinct behaviors:\n\nUsing the Logit Lens technique on GPT-2, I visualized this difference.\n\nTo verify this wasn't a visual artifact, I ran a Noise Injection experiment (similar to *Rome et al.*). I injected high-magnitude Gaussian noise (σ=2.0) into intermediate layers to see how fragile the information was.\n\nThe difference in failure modes was visible in the raw console logs.\n\nFactual Prompt: (\"The capital of France is...\")\n\nWhen I corrupted Layer 8, the model performed an Entity Swap.\n\nThe model preserved the structure (Country → Capital) but lost the instance. It \"forgot\" France but still knew it was talking about geopolitics.\n\nHallucinated Prompt: (\"The case of Harrison v. McDonald...\")\n\nWhen I applied the same noise to the fake citation, the model didn't swap names. It experienced Topic Drift.\n\nThe model completely lost the plot. It drifted from \"validity\" to \"privacy\" to \"equal protection\". This suggests that the hallucination failed to maintain a stable intermediate representation; it was a transient surface pattern generated during late-stage completion.\n\nArmed with this insight, I built my first detector. I assumed a sudden \"Confidence Spike\" in the final layer was the unique signature of a lie.\n\nThe Failure: My detector began flagging real facts as hallucinations.\n\nLooking back at my initial code, the bug is obvious. I was calculating risk by subtracting the spike size, effectively rewarding the model for spiking:\n\nThe discriminative signal wasn't the spike itself—both facts and hallucinations spike when the model \"commits\" to an answer. The real signal is the interaction between early entropy and late confidence.\n\nThe Corrected Signal (one effective formulation):\n\nA model that is confident at the end, but was confused in the middle, is likely hallucinating.\n\nThe token-level signal was noisy and prompt-dependent, which is why I moved to span-level aggregation and statistical validation across 60+ prompts.\n\nTo prove this, I ran an Ablation Study. I systematically disabled features to see which ones contributed to the separation between Real and Fake citations.\n\nThe key insight is directional: Confidence alone is inverted it would flag real facts as hallucinations, confirming the Phase 3 bug.\n\nThe signal emerges from the interaction of early entropy and late confidence. Although early entropy alone shows a positive delta, its effect size is small and unstable across prompts, making it insufficient as a standalone signal.\n\nIn my initial notebook, the detector achieved strong separation on a small test set (n=10). Before claiming victory, I expanded the test suite.\n\nThe Humbling: When I scaled to 77 prompts on GPT-2, the signal remained significant (p=0.003)—but the effect size collapsed from Cohen's d=4.73 to d=0.73. The \"perfect\" separation was a small-sample illusion.\n\nThe Pivot: I ported the analysis to Llama-3-8B, a modern RLHF-tuned model, hypothesizing that models trained with human feedback might have more distinct confidence patterns.\n\nThe Result: The signal re-emerged, but it was noisy.\n\n⚠️ *Suspiciously high — small-sample artifact*\n\nInterpretation: Even in heavily fine-tuned models, hallucinations leave a trace. The model is statistically \"more confused\" in the middle layers when lying than when telling the truth. However, an AUC of 0.68 confirms that this signal is noisy ,it is not a silver bullet. The distributions of \"confident truths\" and \"confident lies\" overlap significantly. This progression illustrates how easy it is to overfit mechanistic signals on small, hand-picked sets, and why scaling and re-validation are non-negotiable.\n\nThis finding dictated the final system architecture. If we had an AUC of 0.95, we could build a firewall that auto-blocks hallucinations. With an AUC of 0.68, blocking would flag a substantial fraction of legitimate citations.\n\nCrucial Engineering Detail: Tokens vs. Spans\n\nIn my early experiments, I analyzed raw tokens. This was too noisy—the model might be confident about \"Harrison\" but confused about \"v.\".\n\nI realized that a legal citation is an atomic unit of truth. I refactored the detector to aggregate token probabilities into Span-Level Risk Scores. We don't flag individual tokens; we flag semantic spans that correspond to atomic claims.\n\nThe Pivot: Instead of a \"Blocker,\" I built an Annotator.\n\nThe system calculates the entropy signature on the fly. If the risk score crosses a threshold, we don't silence the model—we inject a visual indicator:\n\nThis converts silent hallucinations into visible uncertainty.\n\nWe often talk about \"Aligning\" AI, but we rarely talk about giving it the tools to know when it is guessing. By looking at the internal physics of the model—specifically the entropy of the residual stream—we can start to distinguish between memory and imagination.\n\nThe journey from \"Logit Lens\" to \"Mechanistic Observability\" wasn't a straight line. It required breaking the \"Confidence\" heuristic, debugging the math, and accepting that mechanistic signals are probabilistic, not binary.\n\nWe didn't solve the problem of hallucinations, but we did solve the problem of silent hallucinations.\n\nCode and Notebooks: GitHub Repo Link\n\nGet weekly insights on AI implementation, performance measurement, and technical case studies.\n\nGet weekly insights on AI implementation and technical case studies.",

    "fullText": "“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.\n\n“I must apologize to — absolutely nobody”: Replit founder Amjad Masad isn’t afraid of Silicon Valley.\n\n“Should I wear a keffiyeh to the shooting range?” Amjad Masad asked as I slid into the passenger seat of his black Mercedes sports car. The patterned Palestinian scarf has become a political lightning rod in the two years since the war in Gaza began. Masad, the founder of AI coding startup Replit, and a Palestinian by origin, wrapped it around his neck anyway.\n\nAt the shooting range in Santa Clara, we collected an assault rifle and a pistol and headed in. With the AR-22 tucked into his shoulder, Masad fired at a brisk clip, peppering bullets into a cartoon burglar. In less than two minutes, the burglar’s head was perfectly pocked with holes.\n\n“You should compete,” I suggested.\n\nHe smirked. “I always compete.”\n\nIndeed, Masad has never been shy about his competitive streak or his political beliefs — especially since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, setting off the war in Gaza.\n\nMasad, 38, has felt obliged to speak out about Gaza ever since, calling out those in tech who, in his view, have supported Israel’s “genocide” of the Palestinian people. He quickly learned just how unpopular that opinion was in Silicon Valley.\n\nParty invitations dried up, group chats lit up with techies condemning his posts, and investors called him a “terrorist sympathizer.” One member of a firm that backed Replit publicly declared (opens in new tab) in July that he would donate any earnings from the investment to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\n“I felt like I was sort of expelled from Silicon Valley,” Masad said in November on the way to the range.\n\nBut even as Silicon Valley cooled on him, the AI boom that Masad had long bet on took off. In 2024, Replit combined its coding tools with AI to create an agent that could turn plain English prompts into pre-coded apps. After nearly a decade, the company was suddenly in the right place at exactly the right time.\n\nTwo years later, Replit is booming. In September, it raised $250 million from Prysm, Andreessen Horowitz, Amex Ventures, and others, at a valuation of $3 billion. The company hopes to create the preeminent AI coder — one so easy to use that anyone can become a software engineer. Meanwhile, Masad continues to advocate for his political beliefs.\n\n“People reached out to me to express that my words have been hurtful and that many have been deeply offended,” he posted on X over the summer (opens in new tab). “I finally realized that I must, from the bottom of my heart, apologize to — absolutely nobody.”\n\nMasad’s swagger isn’t unique among tech founders. But for many, their against-the-grain takes tend to align with the bottom line. Masad insists he speaks up even when it hurts his business. In that regard, “I’m probably the only contrarian in Silicon Valley,” he told me.\n\nAs Replit takes off, will he be able to maintain that independence?\n\nReplit’s multibillion valuation is hitched to the AI boom. Should the boom fizzle, the company could be worth nothing. But if it holds, and AI continues to remake the tech industry and the greater economy, Masad could find himself among the Valley’s next class of billionaires.\n\nReplit has plenty of competition among AI code-to-product firms (which are typically built on top of the mega LLMs). Swedish startup Lovable raised $330 million last month (opens in new tab), and Israeli company Base44 was bought by website builder Wix for $80 million this summer. All told, the AI coding sector received $4.7 billion in U.S. funding in the last year alone, according to PitchBook.\n\nTo persevere, Masad will not only have to beat his competitors with a better product but will have to earn the favor of still more investors, given the massive capital it takes to build and power Replit’s models.\n\nFor this reason, most players in AI have been pragmatic with their politics; see, for instance, how many Silicon Valley figures who previously supported liberal causes — from Marc Benioff to Mark Zuckerberg — suddenly and enthusiastically embraced the Trump White House. Or how Jensen Huang reportedly cozied (opens in new tab) up to David Sacks, hoping the AI czar would convince President Donald Trump to loosen U.S. chip restrictions and allow Nvidia to sell more products globally. Or how Sam Altman has courted Gulf royalty, landing major (opens in new tab) deals to build data centers in the region and fund OpenAI’s stateside infrastructure needs.\n\nFor the most part, Masad has been unwilling to soften his positions. With a penchant for discursive discussions on political philosophy, Masad remains eager to speak about the war in Gaza and rail against what he sees as human rights abuses committed by Israel.\n\nAnd he’s keen to take meetings with anyone who might see eye to eye on Palestine, even if they don’t agree on tech policy. Masad has spoken with New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani and messaged Lina Khan, the former chair of the Federal Trade Commission and nemesis of the tech elite. He had dinner with Tucker Carlson and lasted the obligatory three hours (opens in new tab) on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nIn short, Masad sees himself as both a champion for Palestine and a mogul in waiting. Which, particularly to other Arabs in tech, has made him a hero. “Having one of us make it in Silicon Valley — and still stay vocal on Palestine in the midst of all of this, specifically in Silicon Valley — is extremely inspirational,” said Fadi Ghandour, executive chairman at investment firm Wamda, one of the backers of Replit.\n\nAll this is a world away from Amman, Jordan, where Masad grew up. On the drive from his home in Palo Alto to the gun range, Masad told me his youthful hobbies included drift racing on Amman’s streets and shooting guns in empty lots.\n\nMasad, who speaks unexpectedly softly given his combative persona, is aware of how lucky he is. He compared his circumstances to a simulation experiment in which “if you ran the world a million times, I think 90% of them, I’m in a really bad situation. I’m in prison or dead.” Instead, “somehow I keep surviving and winning.”\n\nReplit’s multibillion valuation was in many ways the fruits of Masad’s decades-long study of how to make it in Silicon Valley. As a teen in Jordan, he avidly followed Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham, studying his blog posts and obsessively scrolling through Hacker News, the Y Combinator news feed.\n\nAfter getting his computer science degree in 2010 from Jordan’s Princess Sumaya University for Technology, he created the first iteration of what would become Replit: an open-source program for coders to work within a web browser, a novelty back when programmers needed to buy specialized software.\n\nHe posted a link to the program on Hacker News, where it went viral. That led to securing his first job in the U.S., as the founding engineer at Codecademy in New York. In 2013, he took a job as a software engineer at Facebook. By 2016, he and his wife, Haya Odeh, decided to revisit his old project from Jordan, officially founding Replit as an online platform to help developers build, collaborate, and publish their software.\n\nAs a student of Silicon Valley, Masad knew that mythmaking was just as important as the product. He began live-blogging Replit’s progress, and his efforts soon caught the attention of Graham himself. “What struck me most about him, at first, was that he was a programmers’ programmer,” Graham said. “He wasn’t just working on software to make money. He’d have been writing it no matter what.”\n\nGraham invited Masad and Odeh to apply to the Y Combinator accelerator program in 2018. They were accepted, and after completing the program, Replit landed investment from Andreessen Horowitz. With that funding and support, Replit gained traction as a tool for students to learn coding and educators to teach it. According to Masad, he turned down a $1 billion acquisition from Github, believing Replit would one day be worth exponentially more.\n\nMasad’s ultimate objective was to leverage his success in tech to help the Palestinian cause — a sentiment instilled in him by his mother. “She would tell me about all the great things I’m gonna do,” he said. “I fantasized as a kid about helping the Palestinians and ending the occupation and being an important force in the world.”\n\nBut in 2019, he effectively put the company on pause after his mother’s cancer took a turn for the worse. Masad and Odeh traveled to be with his father, a civil engineer with the Jordanian government.\n\nThe experience was traumatic for Masad. In his mother’s final days, the doctors in Jordan wouldn’t let any visitors into the ICU. Masad begged, then yelled, and they finally relented — on the condition he sign a “do not resuscitate” order. He still doesn’t understand why. By the time he got to see her, she was unconscious. “I was so angry at modern medicine,” Masad said. “So angry at modernity.” She died shortly thereafter.\n\nAfter a few months, Masad returned to Silicon Valley. He couldn’t stop thinking about civilization at large, about where the world was going, and if he could stand it — or if he could change it. He found himself agreeing with the Valley’s increasingly powerful libertarians.\n\nHe bonded with Marc Andreessen over politics and literature, and traveled to Malaysia to visit Balaji Srinivasan’s mysterious “startup society.” He grew to realize that the limitations he had assumed don’t necessarily apply. “There was an aspect of, like, ‘Fuck the system,’” Masad said. “‘We need to remake civilization.’”\n\nMasad gained a following on Twitter by bantering with tech legends about everything from coding to bitcoin to Covid vaccine skepticism. His growing stature landed him on podcasts and in glowing (opens in new tab) articles in The Wall Street Journal portraying him as a maverick. Then came the ultimate Silicon Valley validation: Graham, the idol whom he’d studied obsessively as a teenager in Jordan, started thanking him in his own blog posts.  (opens in new tab)\n\nMeanwhile, Replit was struggling. The education market turned out to be small, and the company had trouble expanding into enterprise deals. In late 2023, Replit killed its education product and the following year laid off 30 employees — right after moving into a bigger office in Foster City. “I remember walking around the office and just feeling sick to my stomach,” he said. “I felt like I let people down as well, because I sold them this big dream, and it wasn’t working.”\n\nHe had a plan, though, one he hoped would make his odyssey worth it. For years, he had proselytised on podcasts about how AI would turbocharge coding. Replit had spent years building an extensive database of coding materials — he just needed foundational companies like OpenAI and Anthropic to catch up and release an LLM capable of writing code. Once they did, Replit could plug those models into its pre-existing database and create a powerful app-building AI agent.\n\nWhile a new AI coding company would have to build out that infrastructure from scratch, Replit, Masad realized, could start miles ahead. After nearly a decade, he would finally have perfect timing.\n\nMasad had always been outspoken online. After Hamas’ terrorist attacks, as segments of the tech elite publicly lined up behind Israel, he held his ground. And his responses grew more costly.\n\nFirst, there were the public fights. Masad advised Elon Musk (opens in new tab) to “stick to his principles” when the billionaire said the slogan “from the river to the sea” was calling for genocide. (Palestinian activists say it’s a call for the peaceful liberation of the Palestinian people; pro-Israel voices say it calls for the extermination of Israel.) He clapped back (opens in new tab) at Lux Capital founding partner Josh Wolfe, who said that equating Israel’s actions in Gaza to genocide “grotesquely disgraces” Holocaust victims. And when Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures said Masad’s “friends” (opens in new tab) were behind the Oct. 7 attack, Masad challenged him directly.\n\n“If you think my friends did that then why don’t you confront me when you see me?” Masad replied on X (opens in new tab).\n\nBut even as things got noisy in public, Masad met eerie silence professionally. “My calendar was suddenly empty, because I was talking about Palestine,” he said. “Replit was not a hot company anymore. We did a layoff. And at the same time, a lot of my friends were no longer my friends. I was no longer invited to parties.”\n\nPotential partnerships dried up. Masad became a frequent topic in pro-Israel tech groupchats, a source said, where some investors accused him of being antisemitic.\n\nA Replit investor who requested anonymity to speak candidly told me Masad’s public persona has been “really challenging,” and he’s had to defend the founder in investor circles. I asked if Masad had lost business because of his views. “I’m sure the answer is yes,” the investor said.\n\nA startup that Masad had invested in pitched another investor — and found that Masad was a liability. “He said, ‘Oh, Amjad is investing. He’s like a terrorist sympathizer. If he’s investing, I’m not investing,” Masad said he was told, though he declined to name the company or the investor.\n\nBut as Silicon Valley grew chilly, other regions beckoned.\n\nIn April 2024, with Replit a few months from launching its AI agent, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is worth nearly $1 trillion, invited Masad and other AI thought leaders to stay at Ekland Safaris, a property in South Africa linked (opens in new tab) to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nFor Masad, it was a lifeline. Here were potential partners who didn’t care about his politics on Palestine. If anything, his Arab identity and his outspokenness made him more attractive.\n\nIn the heat of the day, a hunting guide sped Masad and other guests, including Tareq Amin, the future CEO of Saudi AI company HUMAIN, across 30,000 acres to kill kudu and wildebeest. By night, guests feasted in a grand ballroom while Masad demoed his not-yet-released AI coding agent to Saudi officials.\n\n“We’re going to be able to give a software engineer to every person,” Masad told Amin. “Anyone in the world will have a software engineer on demand.”\n\nAmin said he thought then that Replit was on “a path to build a game-changing technology.” Indeed, if the agent worked, and if the AI boom Masad had been betting on came to pass, everyone in that room stood to benefit.\n\nReplit launched its AI agent in September 2024 and within a year, revenue had reached $150 million. Amin and Masad closed a deal for Replit to be the exclusive AI coding software for Saudi governmental agencies, a partnership Masad expects to lead to “hundreds of millions” of dollars worth of business.\n\nAnd just like that, Silicon Valley wanted back in. Replit landed enterprise deals with Atlassian and Zillow, with a Meta deal in the wings, according to Masad. Replit raised its $250 million round and scored its $3 billion valuation.\n\nIt helped Masad that, in the two years since Oct. 7, there’s been rising public disapproval (opens in new tab) of the Israeli government. He also gained strength in numbers: There have been high-profile movements (opens in new tab) within Google, Amazon, and other tech giants, with employees speaking out in support of the Palestinian cause.\n\n“Today, the tide in tech has shifted,” Masad posted to X in September. (opens in new tab) “If you’ve been holding back, now is the time to speak out and call out anyone supporting or celebrating genocide.”\n\nWith Silicon Valley warming back up to him — he was on a16z’s podcast in October (opens in new tab) — Masad was invited to larger, and more controversial, audiences. He drove hours to record at Carlson’s rural Maine cabin, nodding politely when the host marveled on air at his perfect English. In July, he sat down with Rogan, talking about everything from Gaza to the Covid vaccine, which Masad has refused to take.\n\n“I tend to have a negative reaction to anyone forcing me to do something,” Masad said, prompting a “Good for you” from Rogan. “It was the same thing now with talking about Palestine and things like that. The more they come at me, the more I want to say things.”\n\nHe appears now to have the capital, both financially and socially, to draw hard lines. “There are a lot of people who care about the Palestinians but who are afraid to speak out publicly,” said Graham, who has also been an outspoken advocate for Palestine. “What Amjad and I have in common is that we don’t have to worry about being fired if we do.”\n\nMasad said Israel’s Ministry of Education had reached out around 2016 to work with Replit. “We got very close to a deal, but they were very overbearing,” he said, adding that the government had what he viewed as cumbersome requirements, like fining Replit if the service went down. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHe says he would never work with Israel now. “I think it’s an illegitimate and criminal government,” he told me during our gun safety training. “I mean, [Benjamin] Netanyahu is a war criminal.”\n\nWhen I pointed out that Saudi Arabia has its own abysmal human rights record, Masad drew a contrast.\n\n“I just think about how Replit is going to be used. Like, Israel is actively committing genocide and ethnic cleansing, and if you sell to the government there, it’s possible that they’re going to use it for that,” he said, pointing to the country’s use of Microsoft cloud services to track Palestinians’ phone calls. (After an investigation by The Guardian, Microsoft said it disabled the services that made the tracking possible in September. (opens in new tab))\n\nIt’s a careful, and conveniently self-serving, justification. This logic allows Replit to work with countries that Masad finds tolerable. Whether that line will hold as Replit scales is unclear.\n\nAfter the shooting range, we drove through a thick forest fog to the restaurant The Mountain House in Woodside. Over grilled venison, Masad talked about Replit’s next challenge: expanding its user base from corporate clients to everyday users. This isn’t essential — plenty of companies thrive selling enterprise software. But Masad wants Replit to be an engine for socioeconomic mobility around the world, letting anyone, anywhere, easily create apps and businesses.\n\nMasad acknowledged that if he succeeds — if Replit goes public and he becomes a billionaire — he will have the capital to make real change for Palestine, though he’s light on details. “It’s hard to plan for 20 years in the future,” he shrugged. “I just know that wealth is a prerequisite.”\n\nMargaux MacColl can be reached at [email protected]",

Nearly three-quarters of posts collected and analyzed by a PhD researcher at Dublin’s Trinity College were requests for nonconsensual images of real women or minors with items of clothing removed or added.\n\nThe posts offer a new level of detail on how the images are generated and shared on X, with users coaching one another on prompts; suggesting iterations on Grok’s presentations of women in lingerie or swimsuits, or with areas of their body covered in semen; and asking Grok to remove outer clothing in replies to posts containing self-portraits by female users.\n\nAmong hundreds of posts identified by Nana Nwachukwu as direct, nonconsensual requests for Grok to remove or replace clothing, dozens reviewed by the Guardian show users posting pictures of women including celebrities, models, stock photos and women who are not public figures posing in snapshots.\n\nSeveral posts in the trove reviewed by the Guardian have received tens of thousands of impressions and come from premium, “blue check” accounts, including accounts with tens of thousands of followers. Premium accounts with more than 500 followers and 5m impressions over three months are eligible for revenue-sharing under X’s eligibility rules.\n\nIn one Christmas Day post, an account with more than 93,000 followers presented side-by-side images of an unknown woman’s backside with the caption: “Told Grok to make her butt even bigger and switch leopard print to USA print. 2nd pic I just told it to add cum on her ass lmao.”\n\nA 3 January post, representative of dozens reviewed by the Guardian, captioned an apparent holiday snap of an unknown woman: “@grok replace give her a dental floss bikini.” Within two minutes, Grok provided a photorealistic image that satisfied the request. Other posts in the trove show more sophisticated employment of JSON-prompt engineering to induce Grok to generate novel sexualized images of fictitious women.\n\nThe data does not cover all such requests made to Grok. While content analysis firm Copyleaks reported on 31 December that X users were generating “roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute”, Nwachukwu said that her sample is limited to just more than 500 posts she was able to collect with X’s API via a developer account. She said that the true scale “could be thousands, it could be hundreds of thousands” but that changes made by Musk to the API mean that “it is much harder to see what is happening” on the platform. On Wednesday, Bloomberg News cited researchers who found that Grok users were generating up to 6,700 undressed images per hour.\n\nNwachukwu, an expert on AI governance and a longtime observer of and participant in social media safety initiatives, said that she first noticed requests along these lines from X users back in 2023.\n\nAt the time, she said, “Grok did not oblige the requests. It wasn’t really good at doing those things.” The bot’s responses began changing in 2024, and reached a critical mass late last year.\n\nIn October 2025, she noticed that “people were putting Halloween attire on themselves using Grok. Of course, a section of users realized we can also ask it to change what other people are wearing.” By year’s end, “there was a huge uptick in people asking Grok to put different people in bikinis or other types of suggestive clothing”.\n\nThere were other indications last year of an increased willingness to tolerate or even encourage the generation of sexually suggestive material with Grok.\n\nIn August, xAI incorporated a “spicy mode” setting in the mobile version of Grok’s text-to-video generation tool, leading the Verge to characterize it as “a service designed specifically to make suggestive videos”.\n\nNwachukwu’s data is just the latest indication of how the platform under Musk has become a magnet for forms of content that other platforms work to exclude, including hate speech, gore content and copyrighted material.\n\nOn Friday, Grok issued a bizarre public apology over the incident on X, claiming that “xAI is implementing stronger safeguards to prevent this”. On Tuesday, X Safety posted a promise to ban users who shared child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Musk himself said: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”\n\nNwachukwu said, however, that posts like those she has already collected are still appearing on the platform. Musk is giving “the middle finger to everyone who has asked for the platform to be moderated”, she said. The billionaire slashed Twitter’s trust and safety teams when he took over in 2022.\n\nShe added that other AI chatbots do not have the same issues.\n\n“Other generative AI platforms – ChatGPT or Gemini – they have safeguards,” she said. “If you ask them to generate something that looks like a person, it would never be a depiction of that person. They don’t generate depictions of real human beings.”\n\nThe revelations about the nonconsensual imagery on X has already drawn the attention of regulators in the UK, Europe, India, and Australia.\n\nNwachukwu, who is from Nigeria, pointed to a specific harm being done in the posts to “women from conservative societies”.\n\n“There’s a lot of targeting of people from conservative beliefs, conservative societies: west Africa, south Asia. This represents a different kind of harm for them,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Judge says there is plenty of evidence to suggest OpenAI’s leaders made assurances nonprofit structure would be kept\n\nElon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI is to go to trial after a US judge said there is plenty of evidence to support the billionaire’s case.\n\nThe world’s richest man, who co-founded OpenAI, is suing the ChatGPT developer and its chief executive, Sam Altman, over claims its leaders violated the organisation’s founding mission by shifting to a for-profit model.\n\nThe US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, told a hearing there was plenty of evidence that suggested OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure was going to be maintained.\n\nShe said there were enough disputed facts to let a jury consider the claims at a trial scheduled for March, rather than decide the issues herself. Rogers said she would issue a written order after the hearing that addresses OpenAI’s attempt to throw out the case.\n\nThe court dispute comes amid a broader showdown over dominance in the market for generative artificial intelligence. Musk’s xAI and its chatbot Grok are competing with OpenAI and other technology developers.\n\nMusk is seeking unspecified monetary damages from what he calls “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI.\n\nIn a statement after the hearing, OpenAI said: “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.”\n\nMusk’s startup xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSteven Molo, a lead trial attorney for the billionaire and xAI, said after the hearing: “We look forward to presenting all the evidence of the defendants’ wrongdoing to the jury.”\n\nMusk contends he contributed about $38m (£28m), roughly 60% of OpenAI’s early funding, along with strategic guidance and credibility, based on assurances that the organisation would remain a nonprofit dedicated to the public benefit.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman of plotting a for-profit switch to enrich themselves, culminating in multibillion-dollar deals with Microsoft and a recent restructuring.\n\nOpenAI, Altman and Brockman have denied the claims, and have described Musk as “a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader”.\n\nMicrosoft, which is also a defendant, urged Rogers to throw out Musk’s claims against it. A lawyer for Microsoft said there was no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has been approached for comment.\n\nLawyers for OpenAI at the hearing asked Rogers to enter judgment against Musk, contending that he had not shown enough of a factual basis to sustain his allegations including fraud and breach of contract.\n\nOpenAI also contends that Musk failed to bring his allegations in a timely manner. The judge said the jury would be asked to weigh whether the lawsuit was filed outside the statute of limitations.",

While CES 2026 is (predictably) being dominated by AI shoehorned into various products this week, the show still has a few surprises up its sleeve. Between iterative gaming laptop upgrades for 2026 and flashy new OLED TVs, the event is also serving as a hub for interesting and weird technology.\n\nSome of this gear--like Razer's holographic AI companion tube--is already scheduled to be released later this year, while more experimental stuff, like brain-scanning headphones, are still a long way from being seen on store shelves. In case you couldn't make it to Las Vegas this year, here's a quick look at the technology that caught our eyes.\n\nAsus and XReal have teamed up for a new set of extended reality glasses, and on paper, these have some seriously impressive tech inside. Scheduled to launch in the first half of 2026, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses and a dock that lets you connect them to a console or PC via HDMI and DisplayPort.\n\nWhat's better than one 3K 16-inch OLED screen on a gaming laptop? Two 3K 16-inch OLED screens, of course. While this isn't the first time Asus has experimented with a multi-monitor display on one of its ROG laptops, this new take on the Zephyrus Duo looks like a wild approach to dual-screen gaming.\n\nHolograms make everything cooler, and Asus is leveraging this technology to create a seriously cool PC gaming case. The Asus ROG GM1000 can use its case fans to project holographic images, and users can upload their own GIFs and short MP4s to create custom effects.\n\nGameSir might be onto something, as the idea of a gaming controller with a dedicated steering wheel right in the center sounds like a fun idea. You've got all the inputs you'd require from modern gaming, a direct drive motor, and up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering, the company claims (via The Verge). Pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed.\n\nGameSir's other big controller reveal was the X5 Alteron, a Swiss Army knife of a peripheral designed for iPad, iPhone, Android, and Nintendo Switch. HyperX is helping develop it, and the modular system lets you customize the controller with various modules. This means that you can customize it extensively with different D-pads, thumbsticks, and buttons to create your dream controller.\n\nA gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port, the 8BitDo FlipPad borrows heavily from the design of the classic Nintendo Game Boy. The company says it'll reveal more details on the Android and iOS controller ahead of its launch in Summer 2026.\n\nIt might look visually inspired by Nespresso coffee machines, but the new mid-tower case unveiled by CyberPowerPC at CES has an elegant quality. It has everything you'd expect--tempered glass panels, mesh ventilation, and ports--but the real showstopper here is a selection of knobs for controlling the LEDs on this sleek case.\n\n8BitDo makes some of the best controllers, and at CES 2026, it unveiled the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E wireless modular controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple devices, and Android. Just don't expect this to be a budget-friendly option, as the Ultimate 3E will retail for $150 at launch in Q2 2026.\n\nIf you're a fan of Kojima Productions--the studio headed by famed game developer Hideo Kojima--then you'll want to check out these new peripherals from Asus. This special-edition hardware features hand-drawn illustrations by Yoji Shinkawa--the art director for the Death Stranding games--and it'll launch on February 4.\n\nThe newly revealed Corsair Galleon 100 SD mechanical keyboard doesn't have a numpad, but it does have a built-in Elgato Stream Deck Plus. This part of the keyboard features 12 customizable buttons, a five-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and rotary dials. It launches on January 29 and it's priced at $350.\n\nRazer's Project Ava is aiming to be a holographic AI desktop companion that can fulfill several roles. From lifestyle reminders to gaming wingman, the device will come with several AI personalities and is expected to launch within the first half of 2026.\n\nWe're skeptical about this concept for a \"non-invasive\" gaming headset that supposedly improves your skills in competitive games, but at least Neurable and HyperX's protoype looks like a comfy set of brain-scanning cans.\n\nUltrawide monitors have become a popular option over the years, but laptop users can't enjoy them on the go--unless they want to lug a spare monitor around. That's where this concept for a rollable screen comes in: Lenovo is courting \"athletes who need pro-level performance\" with its gaming laptop. The screen can unfurl to 16, 21.5, and 24 inches.\n\nHyperX isn't the only company with AI-powered headphones at CES 2026, as Razer also showed off its Project Motoko concept. The idea behind this wireless headset is that it uses a ton of tech--including two 4K cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, near and far field microphones, and built-in AI--to serve a similar function to other AI wearables, like taking photos, translating foreign text, or conversing with an AI assistant.\n\nIt's not gaming tech, but this $399 ultrasonic chef's knife from Seattle Ultrasonics is the closest thing we have to owning a high-frequency blade in real life. Can it effortlessly cut through a Metal Gear mech? Probably not, but the vibrating piezoelectric ceramic crystals will let you slice through fruit and vegetables easily.\n\nWhile Nvidia didn't have a new GPU to show off this year, the company did reveal its DLSS 4.5 upscaling technology. The company claims it can dynamically boost performance in compatible games, enabling up to 240+ frames per second with path tracing on 50-series GPU cards.",

    "description": "Tivara raised a $3.6 million seed round, backed by Mischief VC, Day One Ventures, and Y Combinator. The startup builds AI agents for healthcare.",
    "fullText": "Tej Seelamsetty dislocated his shoulder in 2024.\n\nThe 29-year-old told Business Insider that he waited over an hour on the phone to book an appointment with an orthopedist, and then two weeks for insurance to approve his MRI scheduling.\n\nFrustrated with the pace of the healthcare system, Seelamsetty cofounded the AI agents startup Tivara with Aumesh Misra. The company promises to answer patient phone calls, handle scheduling and refills — and cut down the hours of grunt work that comes with a medical visit.\n\nTivara has raised a $3.6 million seed round, backed by Plaid CEO Zach Perret's Mischief VC, Day One Ventures, Y Combinator, and healthcare industry angel investors.\n\nBefore cofounding Tivara, Seelamsetty worked as head of growth for Fair Square, a technology-enabled Medicare brokerage.\n\n\"I saw a ton of back-and-forth between beneficiaries and insurance carriers,\" he said. \"There's just a ton of paper-pushing.\"\n\nSeelamsetty met his cofounder while studying computer science at Washington University in St. Louis. The duo called \"every single doctor we knew\" and asked to shadow their practices, he said.\n\nTivara focuses on large specialty medical groups with between 20 and 500 doctors. Its customers include the Los Angeles Cancer Network and Astera Customer Care.\n\nIt's one of many AI-assisted patient messaging startups. Seelamsetty said Tivara distinguishes itself by being administrative, not clinical. Doctors are left to sift through the these startups in an effort to identify which offer genuine productivity gains (and which could overcomplicate or add time).\n\nTivara now has five full-time employees and is using the funds to expand its team. The $3.6 million was over Seelamsetty's target, he said; they wanted to make room for more strategic investors.",

    "description": "Peter Boockvar cautioned investors against \"blindly\" relying on tech stocks to power their portfolios, and advised looking at other parts of the market.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street remains bullish on AI, but the investment chief of a $12 billion firm thinks investors need to be careful not to pin all of their hopes on the technology.\n\nPeter Boockvar, the chief investment officer of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners, thinks greater opportunities lie outside of the AI trade despite the stellar gains it delivered for the market in 2025.\n\nMany of the tech sector's most dominant players, including Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, have stumbled out of the gate in 2026. Boockvar says the industry's previous growth isn't sustainable and that its days of dominance are numbered.\n\nIn his view, the AI trade won't function as the market-driving force that investors have come to know in recent years. While there will still be growth opportunities, being selective will be of much greater importance.\n\n\"Investors need to not just blindly rely on that AI tech trade as the leadership group, and understand that there are a lot of other parts of the market that can do well now.\"\n\nThe CIO said on CNBC that he believes market tides are slowly shifting in a direction that doesn't favor prominent AI stocks. In his view, the market has been showing signs of fatigue that some investors may be ignoring.\n\n\"I do think in 2026 the AI tech trade is losing some steam in terms of its dominance,\" he said. \"We've seen the market response to Nvidia's report a couple of months ago. We've seen the market punish Meta for its excessive spending.\"\n\nBoockvar pointed to the struggles of other top AI companies like Oracle, whose lackluster Q3 earnings prompted concerns of AI overspending, and also flagged CoreWeave, a stock that surged 90% in 2025 but still drew consistent concerns of excessive debt and potential lack of profitability.\n\n\"I think that entire trade is becoming more differentiated, that we've reached a point where investors are realizing they're going to be winners and they're going to be losers,\" Boockvar added.\n\nBoockvar highlighted surging capex in 2025 as part of his bearish thesis for this year, arguing that companies should diversify their spending beyond data centers.\n\n\"All the capex growth in 2025 was the data center building\" he said. \"Hopefully in 2026, with the tax incentives in terms of immediate expense, other parts of the economy can take that baton.\"",

    "title": "Tailwind lays off 75% of its 4-person engineering team, citing 'brutal impact AI has had on our business'",
    "description": "Tailwind's CEO said that while AI made the web tool more popular, it also led to cratering revenue and difficulty converting paid users.",
    "fullText": "Tailwind laid off 75% of the startup's engineering staff on Monday — and its CEO blames AI.\n\n\"75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business,\" CEO Adam Wathan wrote in a GitHub comment that has made waves in the tech community.\n\nTailwind, like many startups, has a small head count. In a podcast posted on X, Wathan said that the company had four engineers on staff. Now, there's one.\n\nWathan's post highlights the challenges that startups, which already face tough odds of success, can encounter as AI models grow more capable.\n\nThe CEO founded the web developer tool in 2017. Tailwind's model is free and open-source, with a paid \"pro\" tier driving the company's revenue. In his GitHub comment, Wathan wrote that AI was making Tailwind more popular, but slimming its base of paid customers.\n\nTraffic to Tailwind's online documentation has seen a 40% decrease, Wathan wrote. Those resources were where people learned about the paid tier, the CEO wrote, crushing its ability to make money. Revenue is down 80%, he added.\n\nThe remaining team after the layoffs is the three owners, one engineer, and one part-time employee, the CEO said. \"That's all the resources we have,\" he said.\n\n🎧 Recorded a new morning walk this morning, hard one to share because I'm sure people will want to roast me for it but have been transparent up until now so publishing it anyways. pic.twitter.com/lslaLp2gtf\n\nWathan said he spent the holidays forecasting revenue and realized that the situation was \"significantly worse than I realized.\" The decline in revenue has occurred over several years, Wathan said, but it was gradual. If nothing changed, Wathan said his forecasting showed that Tailwind would not be able to meet payroll in six months.\n\nThe layoffs were a \"brutal decision,\" Wathan said. \"If we didn't do it now, then we we not be able to give people generous severance packages,\" he said.\n\n\"I feel like a failure for having to do it,\" Wathan said. \"It's not good.\"\n\nTailwind is popular among developers, and Wathan's post sparked reactions from the tech community on social media, some of which blamed the CEO for the company's revenue decline.\n\nOne X user wrote that they had only received five promotional emails from Tailwind in 2025. \"We don't send enough email,\" Wathan responded. \"Definitely need to get better at it.\"\n\nAnother X user wrote that Tailwind relied on a business model of selling UI components, while free and AI-generated equivalents grew.\n\n\"Still to this day don't know what we should be pivoting to, so in the mean time it's only made sense to do what's at least working a little,\" Wathan responded.\n\nIn his podcast, Wathan said that 90% of people understood and didn't \"pile on,\" but others did. He carried the burden that, as an employer, the world \"hates you and thinks you're evil,\" he said.\n\nOthers voiced their support online. Dropbox and Groupon alum Josh Puckett called the podcast an \"incredibly raw, honest take from one of our industry's best on the realities of running a business in the midst of the creative destruction AI is bringing.\"\n\nAI's ability to summarize and extract information, sometimes without directing users to specific sites or documents, is threatening many businesses reliant on online traffic. The media industry is well aware of this, as a crop of startups has formed around the concept of \"Google Zero.\"\n\nThat's basically what happened to Tailwind. It needed traffic to convert free users into paying customers, its CEO said, and AI effectively crushed that traffic. Still, Wathan remains hopeful for the company's future.\n\n\"I'm still optimistic,\" he said in his podcast. \"My job requires me to be optimistic.\"",

    "description": "AI Inbox will summarize important information from your emails.",
    "fullText": "Google is adding a slate of AI features to Gmail that could save some of the hassle of searching for important information buried in messages and threads. Many users will soon see a more personalized inbox with AI-powered suggestions, summaries, and proofreading support. Plus, some AI functionality that was previously available only to paid subscribers will be rolling out to all Gmail users, including Help Me Write, AI Overviews for threaded emails, and Suggested Replies.\n\nGmail users will soon have an AI Inbox view with two sections. \"Suggested to-dos\" will show immediate action items found in your inbox, such as bills to be paid and appointments to be confirmed. The task will be bolded and followed by a summary and a link to the relevant email or thread. Below that, \"Topics to catch up on\" includes items that are less urgent (but still important), such as order status and event updates.\n\nAI Inbox is an optional toggle in the Gmail side panel. You won't see it immediately, though—the feature is being made available to those in Google's Trusted Tester program before launching for users more broadly \"in the coming months.\"\n\nGoogle AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also be able to get AI Overviews from natural language questions typed into the Gmail search bar (just like a Google search). Instead of a running standard keyword search and clicking through multiple message threads, you'll be able to ask things like “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” and get a detailed summary of information pulled from emails in your inbox. The response will also provide citations to specific threads.\n\nFinally, Gmail will have a built-in, AI-powered proofreading feature that will check grammar, tone, and style and analyze your emails for clarity and structure. Similar to third-party tools like Grammarly, you'll see one-click suggestions for fixing typos, simplifying sentence structure, selecting improving word choice, and making writing more concise.\n\nLike AI Overviews, Proofread will be limited to paid subscribers. Note that these AI features are optional and can be disabled, and Google says it does not use personal information or content to train its AI models.",

    "fullText": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has made his predictions for all 32 FA Cup third-round ties.\n\nHe is up against DJ and producer Shadow Child, aka Simon Neale, and AI.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can choose who you think will win each tie, below.\n\nShadow Child is a Portsmouth fan who has fond memories of the FA Cup that go back much further than when Pompey won it in 2008.\n\n\"That was huge, and so was when we lost narrowly in the final two years later,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"But my favourite FA Cup memory was actually 1992, when we had a run to the semi-finals and lost to eventual winners Liverpool in a replay.\n\n\"I was 15, stood on the Clock End at Highbury for the first of those games, and that is when I fully understood the emotion that goes with football.\n\n\"I'd been going to Fratton Park since I was five, but that was the moment for me. That's the power of the FA Cup, and a run like that can resonate with you for your whole life.\n\n\"The year we won it, all five games from round three to the final were 1-0 wins. You take them all, obviously, but most of those ties were not that glamorous.\n\n\"The really memorable game that year was our 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Rio Ferdinand ended up in goal when we scored our winner from the penalty spot, which sounds crazy talking about it now. Again, I will never forget it.\"\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\n5th in League Two v 23rd in Championship\n\nOxford must be short of confidence going into this one. They are in a relegation battle, have lost four of their past five games and are still without a manager after sacking Gary Rowett before Christmas.\n\nCraig Short is in interim charge and, like all teams fighting the drop, I'm sure Championship survival is his priority over the FA Cup.\n\nMK Dons boss Paul Warne is an old team-mate of mine from my village team, Horsford Under-12s, and he learnt a lot from playing alongside me.\n\nThey are going well under him in the league and I have got faith in Paul to deliver an FA Cup shock.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, MK Dons to win on penalties\n\nSimon's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\n24th in League One v 13th in League Two\n\nPort Vale are struggling and they are another team who have just changed their manager. This will be Jon Brady's first game in charge, after they sacked Darren Moore at the end of December.\n\nVale got a big win over Blackpool on New Year's Day but they have still got the worst home record in League One, with only two wins there all season.\n\nFleetwood knocked out another League One side, Luton, on penalties in round two which was a great result - so the Cod Army won't be afraid of Vale, either.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Port Vale win on penalties\n\n4th in Championship v 15th in League One\n\nPaul Heckingbottom is doing a fine job at Preston but, with them chasing promotion, he is probably weighing up whether he wants another FA Cup run after his side reached the quarter-finals last year.\n\nWigan have come through two penalty shootouts to reach round three. Their boss Ryan Lowe will be desperate to get one over his former club but, even if Preston make changes, I still think they will edge this.\n\n9th in Championship v 17th in Premier League\n\nMoney-bags Wrexham have picked up a bit of form in the Championship, with one of my colleagues from the Monday Night Club, Conor Coady, their rock at the back.\n\nNottingham Forest got a huge win at West Ham on Tuesday and Sean Dyche will want to carry that momentum on here.\n\nI suspect this will be tight, because Wrexham are unbeaten in 10 games at home, but Forest should have a little bit too much quality.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 3-2 after extra time\n\nEV Charger Points Stadium, 12:15 GMT\n\n18th in League Two v 12th in Championship\n\nI know Cheltenham aren't having a great time of it because one of their fans is a regular caller on 606.\n\nLeicester are having a poor season too, though, and their supporters were expecting a lot more from them following their relegation from the Premier League.\n\nThis is a must-win game for Foxes boss Marti Cifuentes, who is coming under a bit of pressure because his side are toiling in mid-table.\n\nCheltenham will be really up for this, but I think Cifuentes will get the result he needs.\n\n12th in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI'd like to think these teams will have a real go at the FA Cup this season, because neither of them have got relegation to worry about, but they both come into this tie off the back of poor results.\n\nThe Black Cats' defeat at Brentford was a very un-Sunderland like performance compared to what we've seen from them this season, while Everton will be very disappointed to have only drawn at home to Wolves.\n\nThe last time Sunderland reached the final, when they lost to Liverpool in 1992, they broke my heart on the way when they beat my Norwich side in the semi-final. I missed a great chance in that game too, when I ballooned a shot over the bar.\n\nIt still haunts me how we didn't make it to Wembley that year - we deserved to. Sunderland are due another FA Cup run because they have only made it to round four once in the past 10 years, but I don't think this is their year either.\n\nI can see this going to penalties, and Jordan Pickford will win it for the Toffees.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Everton win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I don't see this being a great game, more a battle of attrition. 1-0 after extra time\n\nAI's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\n14th in National League North v 13th in Premier League\n\nWhat a tie this is. My 606 co-host Robbie Savage built the foundations for this Macclesfield side and they have gone on an amazing run under John Rooney to get this far.\n\nIt started with a win over Atherton Laburnum Rovers in the second qualifying round in September.\n\nOne of their scorers that day was Ethan McLeod, who died in a car accident before Christmas on his way back from a game, which puts everything in perspective.\n\nThis would be the biggest shock in FA Cup history if Macclesfield won, because no sixth-tier side has ever beaten one from the top flight since the FA Cup started in 1871, but I don't think that will happen.\n\nPalace have not been in good form recently but they played well in their draw with Aston Villa on Wednesday when they defended strongly.\n\nThe holders are solid even when they don't fire up front, and they should win this pretty comfortably.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I'd love this to be different because we all love a giant-killing, but I can't see it. 0-4\n\n20th in Premier League v 22nd in League Two\n\nWolves boss Rob Edwards is starting to get a tune out of his players and Mateus Mane is really shining for them.\n\nDoes Edwards change things up here, or does he look to build more momentum?\n\nThis is a local derby but he has played for both clubs so he will get what the tie is all about, and Shrewsbury don't really look like they are in the kind of shape to spring a surprise at Molineux, either.\n\nThey have not won any of their past eight league games and staying in the Football League will be the main thing on their manager Michael Appleton's mind.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\n2nd in National League v 21st in League One\n\nBoreham Wood are flying and Robbie Savage always tells me how strong they are - he really rates them.\n\nThey reached the fifth round in 2022 under Luke Garrard, when they lost at Everton, and I think their run will continue this year too.\n\nI know Garrard's focus might be on promotion to the Football League, because getting out of the National League is brutal, but his side are up against a Burton team who are bang out of form at the bottom of League One.\n\nWood will have to stop the top scorer in the FA Cup this season, Tyrese Shade, who has scored five goals in two games for Burton so far - but I am backing them to put Shade in the shade.\n\n19th in Premier League v 5th in Championship\n\nI have a feeling this will be quite close. Millwall are really well organised under Alex Neil and I am not surprised they are doing well this season.\n\nBurnley have started picking up a few draws, but they still haven't won since the end of October.\n\nThis could be the day that changes, although Scott Parker's side will have to work hard to finish Millwall off.\n\nSutton's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Burnley win on penalties\n\n23rd in League One v 15th in Championship\n\nSouthampton have dropped off after making a good start under Tonda Eckert. He won his first four games after replacing Will Still at the start of November, but has not won any of his past six matches.\n\nDoncaster are on a similar run in League One, taking one point from a possible 18, and with both teams in such poor form, it might take penalties to separate them.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Southampton to win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: Putting our south-coast differences aside, Southampton will probably win... but come on Doncaster! 2-0\n\n9th in Premier League v 2nd in Championship\n\nIt will be interesting to see what Fulham boss Marco Silva does here, with his team on such a good run of Premier League results. I hope he goes strong, to try to keep their momentum going.\n\nSilva has good record in the FA Cup anyhow, reaching the quarter-final twice in the past three years. He has also never lost a third-round tie with any of the four English clubs he has managed, and I don't see that changing this weekend.\n\nMiddlesbrough got back on track with a big win over Southampton on Sunday but they hit a sticky patch over Christmas when their goals dried up and it is pretty obvious that their promotion bid will be the priority for their manager Kim Hellberg.\n\n3rd in Championship v 18th in League One\n\nIpswich have started to hit their stride in the Championship and have only lost one of their past eight games.\n\nLike Hellberg at Boro, I suspect Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna will make full use of his squad here but they should still have too much for a Blackpool side who are struggling in League One.\n\nIt is nice to be able to predict an Ipswich result again, and it would be good if their fans had something to cheer about after they had such a miserable time in the Premier League last season.\n\nMcKenna is such a good manager, I think they will get one of the automatic promotion spots, sadly. They won't win the FA Cup though!\n\n2nd in Premier League v 14th in League One\n\nManchester City have reached the final in the past two seasons and they are my pick to win the FA Cup this year. Pep Guardiola always takes the competition seriously and that won't change whatever happens in the title race.\n\nGuardiola's side have paid the price for not putting games to bed in the past few days and those dropped points are making things easier for Arsenal at the top of the table.\n\nI don't see Manchester City having any problems here, though, even if they field a second-string side.\n\nExeter City boss Gary Caldwell lifted the FA Cup in 2013 when he was part of the Wigan team that upset Manchester City in the final. What a great memory that must be for him, but his side are going out on Saturday.\n\n6th in Premier League v 15th in Premier League\n\nI just wonder how much Wednesday night's epic game against Leeds will have taken out of Newcastle, who have got the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final with Manchester City coming up next week too.\n\nThere was also plenty of late drama in Bournemouth's win over Tottenham, but my concern with the Cherries is more about the effect of Antoine Semenyo's departure, because it appears he has played his last game for them.\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe does not have a great record against his old club in the Premier League, where he has not got the better of them in seven attempts, but he did beat them in the Carabao Cup in 2022.\n\nI was tempted to go for a Bournemouth win here, but I am not sure how many changes Andoni Iraola will make either.\n\nThe one thing I am sure of is that there will be a few goals flying in, because of the way both teams play. Let's go for another thriller, with a shootout to settle it.\n\nSutton's prediction: 3-3 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Newcastle to win on penalties\n\n4th in League Two v 2nd in League Two\n\nThese teams meet each other again in the league next week, and I suspect the points will matter more to Swindon boss Ian Holloway and Salford manager Karl Robinson than this tie.\n\nSalford beat Swindon 3-2 here in September but Holloway's side have the best away record in the division and I'm going with them to nick it in extra time.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-2 after extra time\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 1-0 after extra time\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Salford win on penalties\n\n24th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nIt is really sad to see what has happened at Sheffield Wednesday and there is no way for them to salvage their season now.\n\nBrentford are flying at the moment under Keith Andrews and they are another club who I'd love to see have a real go at the FA Cup this season.\n\nThe Bees have never got past the quarter-finals in their history, and have not even got that far since 1989. You only have to look at Palace last year to find a team winning it for the first time so it is definitely doable for them too.\n\n8th in Championship v 1st in Championship\n\nCoventry are having a little wobble. They are still top of the Championship, but Sunday's defeat at Birmingham means they have only one win in their past five matches.\n\nThat just makes me think Sky Blues boss Frank Lampard will rest players here, and it is a real opportunity for my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins against his former club.\n\nRobins had that great run to the semi-finals with Coventry a couple of years back, and you can imagine he will be absolutely determined that Stoke get through this tie.\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, Stoke win on penalties\n\n10th in Championship v 6th in Championship\n\nWatford have really hit form and come into this on the back of four wins in a row.\n\nBristol City, in contrast, have been patchy but again I think both sides will make changes.\n\nIt finished 1-1 at Ashton Gate in November, and I'm going for the same scoreline again, with City winning on penalties.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Bristol City to win on penalties\n\n6th in League Two v 14th in Championship\n\nCambridge are on a heck of a run, and have gone 14 games unbeaten in all competitions since the end of October.\n\nBirmingham, meanwhile, have been a bit flaky. Blues boss Chris Davies needed Sunday's win over Coventry because his side have not really got going this season.\n\nOn paper, this has the makings of a shock because Birmingham have not won many on the road, but I actually fancy my old club to go on a bit of a cup run this year, and they will start by giving Cambridge an education.\n\n12th in League Two v 2nd in National League South\n\nI was at Blundell Park when Grimsby knocked Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup in August, and what a night that was.\n\nNow the Mariners are trying to avoid being on the wrong end of a huge upset themselves but, again, home advantage will help.\n\nWeston-super-Mare are in the third round for the first time in their 138-year history, which is an amazing achievement, but their cup run ends here.\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 17:45\n\n14th in Premier League v 3rd in Premier League\n\nPoor old Thomas Frank. He looked so happy at Brentford but Spurs have a habit of turning happy managers into total miseries.\n\nHe really needs a win here, and a good run in the cup too, but when you compare the two teams, and the way they are playing, then there's only one winner here - and that's Villa.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: This is the kind of game Tottenham need, because there is less pressure on them. Villa are going more for the top four and Spurs could take this. 3-2\n\n19th in Championship v 8th in Premier League\n\nIt doesn't feel as if Liam Rosenior's appointment has been particularly welcomed by some Chelsea fans.\n\nThis is his first game in charge and he could really do with making a fast start to help win some of the doubters over.\n\nThere are tougher tests to come - like Arsenal in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final next week - but I think he will get the result he wants here.\n\nThere will be a packed house at The Valley, with Charlton's biggest crowd for an FA Cup tie in 50 years, but the Addicks are not in great form and Chelsea's quality should see them through.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: It's been a turbulent week for Chelsea too, and again we will see a response. I always try to visualise things when I think about them, and when I pictured The Valley, I just saw Chelsea scoring! 1-3\n\n13th in Championship v 16th in Premier League\n\nLeeds have been terrific recently and, as regular readers will know, I am really pleased for their manager Daniel Farke and how he has changed the narrative about his future.\n\nI can see Farke making plenty of changes here because, while he would love a cup run, he knows there is still work to do to keep his side in the Premier League.\n\nThat's why I am going for Derby to cause an upset. They are improving all the time under John Eustace and while Leeds will be full of confidence off the back of the past few weeks, I am not sure they will maintain their intensity with a second-string side.\n\n21st in Championship v 1st in Premier League\n\nArsenal will definitely make changes here, but it won't make any difference.\n\nPortsmouth are in trouble at the bottom of the Championship and they look short of what is required there, let alone against the Premier League leaders - or even their reserves.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: I very reluctantly have to be realistic here - I hate to say it, but I would be really shocked if Arsenal didn't win. If we took them to penalties that would be incredible, but I don't think we will. It depends what team they put out, but whoever plays, it is going to be difficult for us.\n\nI can't make it to the game but I will be glued to the TV, and my dad will be there - he has been a season ticket holder at Fratton Park since 1967. 0-1\n\n7th in Championship v 20th in Championship\n\nHull are having a great season, while Blackburn are in serious danger of being relegated.\n\nIt is no surprise that Rovers are struggling because they just don't have the quality in their side.\n\nIt turns my stomach to see the state of my old club now compared to the way it was when I was there in the 1990s, because it is a shadow of its former self.\n\nSurvival is all Blackburn fans can hope for, while Hull supporters must be dreaming of a return to the Premier League. They are going to win this tie, too.\n\n22nd in Championship v 3rd in League Two\n\nNorwich are another of my old clubs who are fighting relegation, although at least Philippe Clement has picked up a few wins since he took charge in November.\n\nThe Canaries have lost their past couple of home games, to Watford and Stoke, but Clement has done really well to give them a chance of staying up. Now they need to spend in January, because he needs a bit of help.\n\nI am not sure Clement wants or needs an FA Cup run now but Norwich fans could do with a bit of cheer at Carrow Road.\n\nI am backing Norwich to win but I need to apologise to Walsall boss Mat Sadler anyhow. They were flying last season, but then he came on the Monday Night Club in January and he was one of the managers we cursed.\n\nWhoever came on, their results fell through the floor afterwards, so we were to blame for Walsall's slide down the table.\n\n16th in Championship v 11th in League One\n\nTwo wily old managers go head to head here.\n\nBetween them, Sheffield United's Chris Wilder and Mansfield's Nigel Clough have spent more than 50 years in the dug-out, and I have got a lot of respect for both of them.\n\nWilder has turned things around for the Blades after their dreadful start to the campaign and, while Clough has won his last three games with the Stags, I am going for Sheffield United to continue their improvement.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: 2-1 after extra time\n\n17th in Championship v 18th in Championship\n\nWest Brom have just sacked their manager Ryan Mason, so James Morrison is in charge for this one.\n\nThe Baggies could really do with a win but their form on the road is awful - they have lost 10 away games in a row.\n\nSwansea changed their manager recently too, with Vitor Matos replacing Alan Sheehan in November, and their season has been just as disappointing.\n\nWhile West Brom won 3-2 when these teams met at The Hawthorns in November, Swansea pinched a 1-0 win at Liberty Stadium on New Year's Day.\n\nI'm going for another close game this time.\n\nSutton's prediction: 0-0 after extra time, Swansea to win on penalties\n\n18th in Premier League v 11th in Championship\n\nThis is a must-win for West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo and, let's face it, they might sack him anyway even if he gets past QPR.\n\nI don't think home advantage helps the Hammers, who suffered a catastrophic defeat against Forest at the London Stadium on Tuesday. I'm not sure how many of their fans will turn up for this game, and the ones who do are not going to be in a good mood either.\n\nBut while West Ham have been very poor recently, they still have some good players and they should surely still see off a mid-table Championship team on their own patch.\n\nQPR have been knocked out in the third round of the FA Cup more times - 52 - than any other side since the current format of the competition started 100 years ago.\n\nI am going for them to suffer defeat number 53, and for Nuno to survive a little bit longer.\n\n7th in Premier League v 11th in Premier League\n\nBrighton have been quite erratic this season, and I have done really badly at predicting their results, but they have proved time and time again how dangerous they are.\n\nIt's a boost for United that Bruno Fernandes is fit again, but their draw with Burnley on Thursday was still a poor result.\n\nI know United fans love it when their side proves me wrong after I predict they will lose, but I can't see them doing that on Sunday.\n\nShadow Child's prediction: United have had an interesting week. I've gone for them to win because I am expecting a huge reaction from them and their fans at Old Trafford, but Danny Welbeck will nick one for Brighton. 3-1\n\nAI's prediction: 2-2 after extra time, United win on penalties\n\n4th in Premier League v 17th in League One\n\nBristol City fans will come to Anfield hoping for a repeat of their famous win here in the FA Cup in 2008, but I don't see another shock on the cards.\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot will have learnt his lesson about the cup after last season, when his side crashed out to Plymouth after he made 10 changes.\n\nSlot needs an FA Cup run this season, so I am sure he will not risk another upset here. If Liverpool were to lose this, he would be under serious pressure.\n\nI am just not convinced by the way his side are playing at the moment, and I don't think many Liverpool fans are either.\n\nEven so, they are at home to a League One side, and this should be a pretty routine victory.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "In the race to embrace new technologies, some ecologists fear their field is losing touch with nature.",
    "fullText": "Tadeo Ramirez-Parada studied the timing of plant flowering for his PhD — but he didn’t touch a single petal. Instead, he developed a machine-learning algorithm to analyse the digitized captions of one million herbarium specimens, which showed him how flowering times are changing with rising temperatures.\n\nRamirez-Parada’s work has helped to solve an important mystery in ecology — showing that as temperatures change, plants shift their flowering times to cope with the heat, rather than adapting through natural selection1. Yet his work so far has been almost entirely computer-based. “I have had to do very little experimental or field work,” says Ramirez-Parada, who did his PhD at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nRamirez-Parada’s work is typical of a change that is reaching into every part of ecology. Whatever scientists are analysing — digitized specimens, images of the natural world, DNA samples, or data streaming in from sensors — many are doing it indoors.\n\nThe technologies are creating a world that can be monitored at times, places and scales that were previously unimaginable. We are moving towards the “fully automated monitoring of ecological communities”, wrote Marc Besson, a marine scientist at the Sorbonne University Ocean Observatory in Banyuls-sur-Mer, France, in a 2022 paper2.\n\nMany ecologists say this revolution offers huge potential for understanding the biodiversity crisis and discerning patterns of global change.\n\nBut some ecologists are dismayed. They feel that the discipline is losing intimacy with its subject matter. They argue that field experience is in decline, and that this loss could lead to error, bias and oversimplification of results.\n\n“If it becomes a world where you don’t actually have to go out in order to become an ecologist, we kind of lose sight of what the actual world is like,” says Bill Sutherland, who studies conservation biology at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nLike scientists everywhere, ecologists are grappling with how to make the most of a torrent of data.\n\nNatural-history museums and herbariums around the world have digitized more than one billion specimens over the past few decades, some with accompanying DNA records.\n\nMeanwhile, citizen scientists and researchers alike have been feeding databases such as iNaturalist with hundreds of millions of observations, which are absorbed into the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a central database for natural history.\n\nThere is also a stream of data from sensors such as camera traps — which take pictures when activated by movement — microphones, animal-tracking devices, drones, satellites and DNA samplers.\n\nSuch sensors can run for years without intervention. Once, a remotely planted camera trap would eventually run out of power: now, the energy consumption of such a device is minimal and it can rely on solar or wind energy. Bandwidth is no longer an obstacle to data being transmitted 24 hours a day.\n\nAnd computer science is more than keeping up3. Artificial-intelligence systems are already identifying species from these data; they are also being used for more complicated tasks such as building species-distribution models and ancestry trees. Some ecologists predict that generative AI, which creates new content based on learning from huge data sets, will soon be able to make more complex models, leading the way to understanding ecological processes and forecasting how species will respond to environmental changes.\n\nThere are already at least 100 laboratories that would label their work as ‘AI for nature’, according to Tanya Berger-Wolf, a computational ecologist at the Ohio State University in Columbus.\n\nThe approach is starting to bear fruit. One European project, called CamAlien, is tracking invasive species using high-resolution cameras with machine-learning processing power, affixed to cars, boats and trains. As they speed along, they rapidly photograph the sides of roads and tracks, analyse the images in situ and upload alerts about alien invasive plants to a Europe-wide online map.\n\nThe system shows how, just in the past few years, new technologies combined with AI have “gone from mostly demonstrating potential to actually beginning to deliver real implementations”, says Toke Thomas Høye, an ecologist at Aarhus University in Denmark, who co-developed CamAlien. Some 16 European countries are trying out the technology to assess the distribution of invasive alien species.\n\nSimilarly, amid the steep declines in some insects, a consortium of researchers has finessed camera-trap technology, originally designed to spot mammals, so that it can identify and monitor insect species, which are much more numerous. Automated insect monitoring didn’t exist five years ago, says Høye. Thanks to developments in AI, scientists can distinguish between thousands of species.\n\n“It’s opening up a door to part of our natural world that is so much more diverse compared to what camera traps have been used for previously,” says Høye. He and his group think that making insect monitoring easier and less labour-intensive will shed light on the state of insect populations around the globe.\n\nAnother group has deployed a system of microphones in search of a more detailed understanding of migration as birds fly across Europe from Norway to the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Known as the TABMON project, it is now streaming real-time soundscape data, day and night. An AI tool analyses the data and converts them into commonly used biodiversity indicators.\n\n“Having standardized ecological data on continental scales is extremely rare,” says Sarab Sethi, who studies ecosystem sensing at Imperial College London, and led the design of the microphones, “especially when it’s on the fine-scale temporal resolution that acoustics gives, across a wide range of species, and across multiple years”. The project has yet to report its first results.\n\nFew would dispute the benefits of more data and detail, but there is an ominous side effect, says Kevin Gaston at the University of Exeter, UK, who studies people’s relationship with nature: field experience is on the wane.\n\nGaston and his co-author Masashi Soga, who studies the loss of human–nature interactions at the University of Tokyo, argued in a March 2025 paper4 that there has been an ‘extinction of experience’: a widespread decline in fieldwork-based research and education, with knock-on effects on the depth of ecological understanding. They also flagged other dangers, such as reduced engagement with local communities — a practice known to be crucial for successful conservation.\n\nOthers have expressed concern about ‘AI colonialism’, a practice in which data, collected remotely in poorer countries, are siphoned off for analysis in well-equipped labs elsewhere.\n\nThere are few quantitative data available to support or challenge Gaston and Soga’s argument. One analysis5 of ecological studies published between 1980 and 2014 found that fieldwork-based studies decreased by 20% (as a proportion of the total), whereas modelling and data analyses increased by 600% and 800%, respectively. But these are relative changes, rather than absolute numbers, and the data set ends more than a decade ago.\n\nAnecdotally, however, Gaston and Soga’s paper struck a nerve. Since publication, a number of groups have cited it while warning that a lack of outdoor research is hindering studies on subjects ranging from solitary bees to dinosaur fossils.\n\nThere’s also anecdotal evidence that more computer scientists have entered ecology, excited about what they can offer, but lacking field experience. That was the case for Berger-Wolf, considered a founder of computational ecology. She completed her PhD in theoretical computer science, but, being married to an ecologist, says she would chat to others in the ecology community and walk away “with a feeling like, oh, there’s got to be a different way of answering this question”.\n\nBerger-Wolf changed tack in 2003, and by 2005 was developing algorithms for dynamic network analysis to depict the social interactions of zebras in the Kenyan Serengeti. Field colleagues urged her to go and see her data but she always refused: “I’m a city girl. And I don’t like dust and bugs. And my answer was: ‘no, my data looks beautiful on my screen.’”\n\nSethi is another convert to ecology, having arrived in the field with an engineering background. In 2016, he decided to apply acoustic monitoring to ecology for his PhD — but the self-confessed metrophile quickly found himself out of his depth in a rainforest in Malaysian Borneo.\n\n“I did what I now realize was the extremely dumb thing of trying to develop a new technology and for its first deployment to be in a tropical forest on the other side of the world,” Sethi grins. On the first night, he lay under a mosquito net in a pitch-dark hut on stilts, wide awake, while his ecologist colleagues dozed comfortably amid the sounds of the rainforest. He remembers thinking: “My God, is this just like a joke that’s gone a bit too far?” Now he values his field experiences but works mostly from the lab.\n\nSome ecologists have gone the other way, coming in from outdoors to embrace big data. Laura Pollock at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, began her career as a field ecologist, first in the swamps of New Orleans, Louisiana, and then in isolated mountain regions in Australia. She saw a need for ecologists to do better data analysis, and now she uses machine learning to do predictive modelling of biodiversity across landscapes.\n\n“I rarely get outside,” she says. “I’m trying, but it’s really hard because there’s so much technology creating so much data that we need people who have these data-science skills to analyse this.”\n\nBut Besson has embraced technology without diminishing his hours in the field. He says that he is spending as much time outside as he did before automation arrived. “Cameras and hydrophones can capture things in addition to my own eyes and ears, and they can stay in the field when I need to go back to the lab ... and when I need to sleep.”\n\nThere are also many systemic forces driving ecologists indoors, argues Gaston.\n\nThere’s a widespread perception that funding for field studies is in decline — although the data are not often differentiated into grants for fieldwork versus those for lab-based projects. Scientists who run long-term ecological studies, in particular, report that they struggle to find funding.\n\nOther contributing forces include the fact that research institutes are increasingly in urban areas; that more scientists have childcare responsibilities that deter them from doing long or far-flung trips; that many feel the need to reduce their carbon footprint and that others want to avoid ‘helicoptering’ in and out of a country to do fieldwork that local scientists could do.\n\nAnother major issue, says Sutherland, is that the fast track to career-boosting publications is to analyse, rather than physically collect, data.\n\n“Supposing you do your PhD and you spend all your time doing fieldwork,” he says. “And the person sitting next to you has been extracting data [from day one]”. After three years, he says, they might have published in increasingly highly ranked journals, while “you’re still in the Amazon catching fish”.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-025-04150-w\n\nRamirez-Parada, T.

    "description": "The new feature helps users understand test results, get advice on diets and workouts, and prepare for doctors’ appointments.",
    "fullText": "Amid rising concerns about people relying on ChatGPT for medical advice, OpenAI made its most significant push yet into health care.\n\nThe company has launched a new feature called ChatGPT Health, which allows users in the U.S. to connect their medical records and data from wellness apps and wearable devices with ChatGPT. The tool is designed to help users understand test results, get advice on diets and workouts, and prepare for doctors’ appointments.\n\nMore than 230 million people globally ask ChatGPT health and wellness-related questions every week, according to the company. ChatGPT Health is designed in collaboration with physicians and will “help people take a more active role in understanding and managing their health and wellness,” the company said in a post.\n\nOpenAI said it will look to expand access to the feature in markets such as India, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines, where adoption is rising quickly. In these countries, overburdened health-care systems and unequal access to doctors are leading more people to turn to generative AI for guidance.\n\n“We do not have the people, the labor to deliver the care we should,” Jesse Ehrenfeld, chief medical officer at Aidoc, an Israeli medical technology company, said at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. “The only way out of this mess is digital and AI.”\n\nResearchers, ethicists, and medical professionals have warned of the risks to users from biases and hallucinations in AI systems. Concern over the mental health harms that AI chatbots pose is growing. Meta’s AI chatbots provided inappropriate advice to teenagers when talking about suicide and eating disorders, Common Sense Media, a nonprofit research organization, reported last year.\n\nThe family of a teenager who died by suicide has sued OpenAI and its chief executive officer Sam Altman, accusing them of wrongful death. The company said it has safeguards in place to help people, and that it continues to improve ChatGPT’s training.\n\nThere is also the question of data privacy. Health data, particularly information related to mental disease and substance use, is sensitive, and its misuse can leave users vulnerable.\n\nWhile consumer awareness about privacy has increased, people generally do not know how their data is being used, including for marketing purposes or for tracking, Sam Siegfried, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Schulte, told Rest of World on the sidelines of CES.\n\n“The person clearly trusts an app enough to give it their data,” he said. “But they should understand what they are using the app for, and whether its data requests sync up with what they are using it for.”\n\nOpenAI said ChatGPT Health “builds on the strong privacy, security, and data controls across ChatGPT with additional, layered protections designed specifically for health — including purpose-built encryption and isolation to keep health conversations protected and compartmentalized.”\n\nThere is no stopping tech companies from entering the health sector.\n\nBesides turning to AI chatbots for health queries, people are also buying more wearable digital devices, including smartwatches, rings, bracelets, and glasses, to track physical activity, vital signs, and various physiological responses in real-time. They take this data to their doctors — or to ChatGPT — with questions on how to interpret it or use it to improve their health.\n\n“Health-related anxiety is real. AI is not as good as a doctor, but it’s better than no care at all,” Ami Bhatt, chief innovation officer at the American College of Cardiology, said at CES.\n\nOpenAI isn’t the only big tech company keen to tap the health-care sector.\n\nApple was among the first to offer health-tracking features in its smartwatch. There are millions of health-related videos on YouTube and TikTok, with nearly 60% of Americans watching health-related videos on YouTube.\n\nHealth is “one of the major use cases for Gemini,” Nichole Young-Lin, women’s health clinical lead at Google, said at CES.\n\n“People are using generative AI as a health resource around the world,” she said. “The patient-physician relationship is very important, but health-care access is not equal. Patients feel empowered with generative AI.”",

    "fullText": "The narrative from the AI labs is dazzling: build AGI, unlock astonishing productivity, and watch GDP surge. It’s a compelling story, especially if you’re the one building or investing in the new thought machines. But it skips the part that makes an economy an economy: circulation.\n\nAn economy is not simply production. It is production matched to demand, and demand requires broadly distributed purchasing power. When we forget that, we rediscover an old truth the hard way: You can’t build a prosperous society that leaves most people on the sidelines.\n\nIn The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, the visionary poet and painter William Blake (writing during the first Industrial Revolution) put the circulatory logic perfectly: “The Prolific would cease to be prolific unless the Devourer as a sea received the excess of his delights.” In other words: Output has to be consumed. The system has to flow.\n\nToday, many AGI narratives assume that the “prolific” can keep producing and the broad mass of customers (“the devourer”) somehow continue to buy, even as more and more human labor is displaced and labor income and bargaining power collapses. That’s not a future of abundance. It’s a recipe for a kind of congestive heart failure for the economy: Profits and capabilities accumulate in what should be the circulatory pump, while the rest of the body is starved.\n\nSo if we want an AI economy that makes society richer, we need to ask not just “How smart will the models get?” and “How rich will AI developers, their investors, and their immediate customers get?” but “How will the value circulate in the real economy of goods and services?” Not “What can we automate?” but “What new infrastructure and institutions are needed to turn capability into widely shared prosperity?”\n\nTwo versions of the future are often discussed as if they are separate. They’re not.\n\nI’m excited by the discovery potential of AI. It may help us solve problems that have defied us for decades: energy abundance, new materials, cures for diseases. As Nick Hanauer and Eric Beinhocker put it so well, “Prosperity is the accumulation of solutions to human problems.” That AI can grow the store of solutions to human problems is a wonderful dream, and it should be our goal to make it come true.\n\nBut discovery alone is not the same thing as economic value, and it certainly isn’t the same thing as widely shared prosperity. Between discovery and economic value lies a long, failure-prone pipeline: productization, validation, regulation, manufacturing, distribution, training, and maintenance. The valley of death is not a metaphor; it is a bureaucratic, technical, and financial landscape where many promising advances go to die. And from that valley of death, the path follows either an ascent to the broad uplands of shared prosperity, or a shortcut to a dead-end peak of wealth concentration.\n\nIf AI accelerates discovery but doesn’t accelerate diffusion, we get headlines and paper wealth, but broad-based growth takes much longer to arrive. We get a taller peak, not a wider plateau.\n\nThe distribution question begins with choke points. Who owns the discovery engines? Who controls access to compute, data, and the models themselves? Who captures the IP? Who has the channels to bring new capabilities to market? To what extent do incumbents and the moats they have built restrict innovation? Do government regulatory processes also speed up, or do they keep AI adoption at a glacial pace? Do those at the choke points use their market shaping power wisely? If those choke points are tight, the discovery economy becomes a kind of discovery feudalism: The breakthroughs happen, but the spillovers are limited, adoption is slow, and the returns concentrate.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the tools and standards of diffusion are broadly available, if interoperability is real, if licensing is designed for many routes to market, if regulatory processes can also be sped up with AI, then the discovery economy can become what we want it to be: a generalized engine of progress. There’s a huge amount of work to be done here.\n\nMany of the questions are economic. If discovery becomes cheap, does the rest of the pipeline get cheaper, or does it get more expensive to compensate for other lost revenue? The happy dream is that a cancer vaccine becomes available at the marginal cost of production. The unhappy reality may be that the drug manufacturers conclude “We have to price this high to make up for our losses from the existing drugs that people no longer need to buy.” Even in an age of cheap discovery, it is possible that some vaccines will still cost millions of dollars per dose and only be available to people who can afford them.\n\nThe other story is labor replacement. We are told that AI will substitute for a great deal of intellectual work, much as machines replaced animal labor and much of human manual labor. Businesses become more efficient. Margins rise. Output increases. Prices fall and spending power increases for those who are still employed.\n\nBut who are the customers when a large number of humans are suddenly no longer gainfully employed?\n\nThis is not a rhetorical question. It is the central macroeconomic constraint that much of Silicon Valley prefers not to model. You can’t replace wages with cheap inference and expect the consumer economy to hum along unchanged. If the wage share falls fast enough, the economy may become less stable. Social conflict rises. Politics turns punitive. Investment in long-term complements collapses. And the whole system starts behaving like a fragile rent-extraction machine rather than a durable engine of prosperity.\n\nIn a 2012 Harvard Business Review article, Michael Schrage asked a powerful strategic question: “Who do you want your customers to become?” As he put it, the answer to that question is the true foundation of great companies. “Successful companies have a ‘vision of the customer future’ that matters every bit as much as their vision of their products.”\n\nIn the early days of mass production, Henry Ford reportedly understood that if you want mass markets, you need mass purchasing power. He paid higher wages and reduced working hours, helping to invent what we now call the weekend, and with it, the leisure economy. The productivity dividend was distributed in ways that created new customers.\n\nFord’s innovation had consequences beyond the factory gate. Mass adoption of cars required a vast extension of infrastructure: roads, traffic rules, hotels, parking, gas stations, repair shops, and the entire social reorganization of distance. The technology mattered, but the complements made it an economy.\n\nSteven Johnson tells a related story in his book Wonderland. The preindustrial European desire for Indian calico and chintz helped catalyze modern shopping environments and global trade networks. But there’s even more to that story. When it became cheaper to make cloth, fashion, taste, and the democratization of status display became a larger part of the economy. The point is not “consumerism is good.” The point is that economies grow because desires and capabilities change as the result of innovations, infrastructure, and institutions that allow the benefits to spread. New forms of production require new systems of distribution, experience, and exchange.\n\nAI is at that inflection point now. We may be building the engines of extraordinary productivity, but we are not yet building the social machinery that will make that productivity broadly usable and broadly beneficial. We are just hoping that they somehow evolve.\n\nThis failure of insight and imagination is the Achilles’ heel of today’s AI giants. They imagine themselves as contestants in a race to be the next dominant platform, with the majority of the benefits going to whoever has the smartest model, the most users, and the most developers. This is not unlike the vision of Marc Andreessen’s Netscape in the early days of the web. Netscape sought to replace Microsoft Windows as the platform for users and developers, using the internet moment to become the next monopoly gatekeeper. Instead, victory went to those who embraced the web’s architecture of participation.\n\nNow, it is true that 30 years later, we are in a world where companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta have indeed become gatekeepers, extracting huge economic rents via their control over human attention. But it didn’t start that way. Amazon and Google in particular rose to prominence because they solved the circulation problem. Amazon’s flywheel, in which more users draw in more suppliers with more and cheaper products, which in turn brings in more users, in a virtuous circle, is a great example of an economic circulation strategy. Not only did Amazon drive enormous consumer value, they created a whole new set of suppliers.\n\nSo too, Google’s original search engine strategy was also deeply rooted in the circulation of value. As Larry Page put it in 2004, “The portal strategy tries to own all of the information….We want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible.” The company’s algorithms for both search and ad relevance were a real advance in market coordination and shared value creation. Economists like Hal Varian were brought in to design advertising models that were better not only for Google but for its customers. Google grew along with the web economy it helped to create, not at its expense. Yes, that changed over time, but let’s not forget how important Google’s support for a circulatory economy was to its initial success.\n\nGoogle also provides a really good example of mechanism design to solve problems with rights holders that have economic lessons for today. When music companies sent takedown notices to YouTube for user-generated content that made unauthorized use of their IP, YouTube instead asked, “How about we help you monetize it instead?” In the process it created a new market.\n\nThe extent to which Amazon and Google seem to have forgotten these lessons is a sign of their decline, not something to be emulated. It provides an opportunity for those (including Google and Amazon, if they recommit to their roots!) who are building the next generation of technology platforms. Build a flywheel, enable a circulatory economy. AI should not be enshittified from the beginning, prioritizing value capture over broadly based value creation.\n\nAn important lesson from the internet technology revolution of the 1990s and early 2000s is that decentralized architectures are more innovative and more competitive than those that are centralized. Decentralization creates value; centralization captures it. The PC decentralized the computer industry, ending IBM’s chokehold on competition during the mainframe era. The new software industry exploded. Over the next few decades, as it became dominant, Microsoft recentralized the industry by monopolizing operating systems and office applications in the way that IBM had monopolized computer hardware. The personal computer software industry began to stagnate, until open source software and the open protocols of the internet undermined Microsoft’s centralized control over the industry and ushered in a new era of innovation.\n\nThe tragedy began again, as those who had once flourished as internet innovators in turn began to prioritize control, raising moats and extracting rents rather than continuing to innovate, leading to today’s internet oligopoly. This, of course, is what allowed the current AI revolution to happen as it did. Google invented the transformer architecture, and then published it freely, but did not itself fully explore the possibilities because it was protecting an existing business model. So it was left to OpenAI to invent the future.\n\nHowever, the AI revolution has a significant difference from the early internet. The U.S.’s current set up of large, closed models, enormous data centers for model training, and a highly concentrated cloud market has echoes of central planning, in which a small cadre of deep pocketed investors choose the winners at the outset rather than discovering them through a period of intense market competition and finding product-market fit (which involves finding products and services that users not only want but are willing to pay for at less than the cost of production!).\n\nMarket competition is important to ensuring that the economy is not reliant on a handful of firms reinvesting their profits into production. When this becomes the case, circulation can get cut off. Profits stop being reinvested and instead become hoarded, trapped within the sphere of financial circulation, from dividends to share buybacks to more dividends and less and less to investment in fixed or human capital.\n\nIf we are to realize the full potential of AI to reinvigorate and reinvent the economy, we need to embrace decentralized architectures. This might involve the triumph of lower-cost open weight models that commoditize and decentralize inference, and it also certainly entails protocols and technical infrastructure that can reduce the inherent concentrating tendencies of economies of scale and other technological moats that make concentration a more efficient mode of production.\n\nCentralization is an advantage in a mature economy; it is a disadvantage when you are trying to invent the future. Premature centralization is a mistake.\n\nIf AI labs wish to be architects of a prosperous future, they must work as hard on inventing the new economy’s circulatory system as they do on improving model capabilities. They need to measure success by diffusion, not just capability. They have to treat the labor transition as a core problem to be solved, not just studied. They have to be willing to win in the marketplace, not through artificial moats. That means committing to open interfaces, portability, and interoperability. General-purpose capabilities should not become a private toll road.\n\nCompanies adopting AI face their own challenges. Simply using AI to slash costs and turbocharge profits is a kind of failure. The productivity dividend should show up for employees not as a pink slip but as some combination of higher pay, reduced hours, profit-sharing, and investment in retraining. They must use the opportunity to reinvent themselves by creating new kinds of value that people will be eager to pay for, not just trying to preserve what they have.\n\nGovernments and society as a whole need to invest in the complements that will shape the new AI economy. Diffusion will be limited by the fragility of our energy grid, by bottlenecks in the supply of rare earths, but also by sclerotic approval processes for new construction or the approval of new innovations.\n\nGovernments must also develop scenarios for a future in which taxes on labor might provide a much smaller part of their income. Solutions are not obvious, and transitions will be hard, but if we face a future where capital appreciation is abundant and labor income is scarce, perhaps it’s time to consider reducing taxes on labor and increasing those on capital gains.\n\nOver the next few months, we intend to convene a series of conversations and to publish a series of more detailed action plans in each of these areas. Let me know if you think you have ideas to contribute.\n\nWe can build an AI economy that concentrates value, hollows out demand, and forces society into a reactive cycle of backlash and repair. Or we can build an AI economy that circulates, where discoveries diffuse, where productivity dividends translate into purchasing power and time, and where the complements are built fast enough that society becomes broadly more capable.\n\nAI labs like to say they are building intelligence. They are making good progress. But if they want to build prosperity, they also need to discover the flywheel for the AI economy.\n\nThe prolific needs the devourer. Not as a villain, not as an obstacle, but as the sea that receives the excess, and returns it, transformed, as the next wave of demand, innovation, and shared flourishing.",

    "fullText": "Google and chatbot-building startup Character.AI have agreed to settle multiple lawsuits from families whose teenagers died by suicide or hurt themselves after interacting with Character.AI's chatbots.\n\nThese negotiations are among the first settlements in lawsuits that accuse AI tools of contributing to mental health crises and suicides among teenagers.\n\nOpenAI is facing a nearly identical lawsuit over the death of a 16-year-old, while Meta has come under scrutiny for letting its AI have provocative conversations with minors. As these companies race to develop and monetize their AI chatbots, they're spending big to make large language models sound more friendly and helpful, and ultimately keep users coming back.\n\nIn October 2024, Florida-based Megan Garcia filed a lawsuit against Character.AI, alleging that the company, which lets people have in-depth and personal conversations with AI chatbots, was responsible for the death of her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III. He had died by suicide months earlier.\n\nA Wednesday court filing in the Garcia case said that an agreement was reached with Character.AI, its founders, Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, and Google. In 2024, the search giant hired the founders of Character.AI, who were former Google employees, and paid for non-exclusive rights to use the startup's technology. The startup remains a separate legal entity.\n\nThe terms of the settlements were not immediately available\n\nThe defendants have also settled four other similar cases in New York, Colorado, and Texas, according to court documents from this week.\n\nMatthew Bergman, the legal representative of the families, along with Google and Character.AI, did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nGarcia's suit said that the startup failed to implement safety guardrails to prevent her son from developing an inappropriate and intimate relationship with its chatbots. The suit claimed that he was sexually solicited and abused by the technology, and the chatbot did not respond adequately when Setzer began talking about self-harm.\n\n\"When an adult does it, the mental and emotional harm exists. When a chatbot does it, the same mental and emotional harm exists,\" Garcia told Business Insider in an interview last year. \"So who's responsible for something that we've criminalized human beings doing to other human beings?\"",

    "fullText": "Microsoft wants to overhaul GitHub to compete with AI coding rivals and embrace AI agents, and the company has started reshuffling teams to make that happen, according to people familiar with the changes.\n\nGitHub is a leading software development platform that Microsoft acquired in 2018. GitHub had an early lead because of its popularity as a place to store code. Lately, though, GitHub has faced more competition from AI tools such as Cursor and Anthropic's Claude Code.\n\nMicrosoft in January 2025 formed a new group focused on building AI tools under ex-Facebook engineering boss Jay Parikh. The group, called CoreAI Platform and Tools, combined Microsoft's developer division, AI platform team, and GitHub.\n\nStill, Microsoft and GitHub have remained somewhat separate, and the company has been moving people and resources around over the past few months to better coordinate efforts such as sales, one of the people said. The latest change, happening this week, is moving a small group of Microsoft engineers over to GitHub.\n\nThe goal, the people said, is to better compete with AI coding tools that rival GitHub Copilot, while getting in the race to build AI agents and fulfill Parikh's vision to build an \"agent factory.\"\n\nIn an internal meeting late last year, Parikh spoke about needing to overhaul GitHub to compete with Cursor and Claude Code, according to audio reviewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code,\" Parikh said at the time. \"We want it to be the center of gravity for all of AI-powered software development.\"\n\nMicrosoft wants GitHub's AI tools to be available wherever developers work, not just inside one app, to wants to make GitHub a kind of dashboard for managing multiple AI agents.\n\nThe latest changes are also part of what Parikh said would be new investment in improving the basic parts of GitHub. In the meeting, Parikh said those include making improvements to its GitHub Actions tool that automates building, testing, and deploying code, analytics and insights tools so teams can see how their code is performing, security for keeping the code safe, and making sure the company can meet local data storage rules to offer GitHub in new countries.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Nvidia's $20 billion Groq acquisition shows the AI industry moving from training to inference, with speed and efficiency now crucial.",
    "fullText": "For years, Nvidia's rise has been synonymous with one idea: GPUs are the engine of artificial intelligence. They powered the training boom that turned large language models from academic curiosities into trillion-dollar ambitions. But Nvidia's $20 billion deal with Groq is an admission that the next phase of AI won't be won by GPUs alone.\n\nGroq makes a very different type of AI chip called a Language Processing Unit, or LPU. To understand why Nvidia spent so much, and why it didn't simply build this technology itself, you have to look at where AI workloads are heading. The industry is moving from training models to running them in the real world. That shift has a name: inference.\n\nInference is what happens after a model is trained, when it answers questions, generates images, or carries on conversations with users. It's becoming the dominant task in AI computing, and could dwarf the training market in the future, according to estimates recently compiled by RBC Capital analysts.\n\nThis matters because inference has very different needs than training. Training is like building a brain: it requires massive amounts of raw computing power and flexibility. Inference is more like using that brain in real time. Speed, consistency, power efficiency, and cost per answer suddenly matter far more than brute force.\n\nThat's where Groq comes in. Founded by former Google engineers, Groq built its business around inference-only chips. Its LPUs are designed less like general-purpose factories and more like precision assembly lines. Every operation is planned in advance, executed in a fixed order, and repeated perfectly each time. That rigidity is a weakness for training, but a strength for inference, where predictability translates into lower latency and less wasted energy.\n\n\"The tectonic plates of the semiconductor industry just shifted again,\" Tony Fadell, creator of the iPod and an investor in Groq, wrote on LinkedIn recently. \"GPUs decisively won the first wave of AI data centers: training. But inference was always going to be the real volume game, and GPUs by design aren't optimized for it.\"\n\nFadell calls this new breed of AI chips \"IPUs,\" or Inference Processing Units.\n\nTD Cowen analysts noted this week that Nvidia's embrace of not just an inference-specific chip, but a whole new architecture, shows how large and mature the inference market has become.\n\nEarlier AI infrastructure investments were made based on training-first buying decisions. The adage used to be \"today's training chips are tomorrow's inference engines,\" which favored Nvidia's GPUs, but that's no longer the case, the analysts added.\n\nInstead, there will be an explosion of different chips inside future AI data centers, according to Chris Lattner, an industry visionary who helped develop the software for Google's TPU AI chips, which Groq founder Jonathan Ross co-designed.\n\nThis move beyond GPUs is being driven by two trends that have been reinforced by Nvidia's Groq deal, Lattner told me this week.\n\n\"The first is that 'AI' is not a single workload — there are lots of different workloads for inference and training,\" he said. \"The second is that hardware specialization leads to huge efficiency gains.\"\n\nIn a 2024 story (that aged very well), Business Insider warned readers that inference could be a vulnerability for Nvidia as rivals looked to fill this strategic gap. Cerebras built massive AI chips optimized for speed, claiming memory bandwidth thousands of times higher than Nvidia's flagship GPU offering at the time. Google's TPUs are designed to efficiently run bespoke AI workloads at blazing speeds. Amazon developed its own inference chip, Inferentia. Startups like Positron AI argued they could beat or match Nvidia's inference performance at a fraction of the cost.\n\nSo Nvidia's deal with Groq can be seen as a preemptive move. Rather than letting inference specialists chip away at its dominance, Nvidia chose to embrace a fundamentally different architecture.\n\nFadell described the deal as a \"humble move\" by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. \"Many companies miss inflection points like this due to 'Not Invented Here- driven egos,\" Fadell added. \"Jensen doesn't; he saw the threat and made it work to his advantage.\"\n\nThe economics are compelling. Inference is where AI products make money. It's the phase that proves whether hundreds of billions of dollars spent on data centers will ever pay off. As AWS CEO Matt Garman put it in 2024, if inference doesn't dominate, \"all this investment in these big models isn't really going to pay off.\"\n\nImportantly, Nvidia isn't betting on a single winner. GPUs will still handle training and flexible workloads. Specialized chips like Groq's will handle fast, real-time inference. Nvidia's advantage lies in owning the connective tissue — the software, networking, and developer ecosystem that lets these components work together.\n\n\"AI datacenters are becoming hybrid environments where GPUs and custom ASICs operate side-by-side, each optimized for different workload types,\" RBC analysts wrote in a recent note, referring to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits such as Groq's LPUs.\n\nSome competitors argue the deal proves GPUs are ill-suited for high-speed inference. Others see it as validation of a more fragmented future, where different chips serve different needs. Nvidia's Huang appears firmly in the second camp. By licensing Groq's technology and bringing its team inside the tent, Nvidia ensures it can offer customers both the shovels and the assembly lines of AI.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia has developed an NVLink Fusion technology that lets other custom chips connect directly to its GPUs, reinforcing this mixed-hardware future, the RBC Capital analysts noted.\n\n\"GPUs are phenomenal accelerators,\" Andrew Feldman, CEO of Cerebras, wrote recently. \"They've gotten us far in AI. They're just not the right machine for high-speed inference. And there are other architectures that are. And Nvidia has just spent $20B to corroborate this.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nandita Giri is a senior software engineer with experience at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. She recommends job seekers spend an hour a day learning AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nandita Giri, a 32-year-old software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy journey began with problem-solving and math long before I knew I'd end up in Big Tech.\n\nI studied at the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, in India. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google often scout talent from this school.\n\nAmazon hired me straight out of college, and I moved to Seattle in 2018. To get the job, there was a logical analysis test, and only a handful of us passed. Then came multiple interviews based on problem-solving. That's how my journey in tech began.\n\nI'm now a senior software engineer at Microsoft, and my AI skills are in high demand.\n\nWhen applying for roles at Amazon, it's not about solving problems as quickly as possible, but solving them optimally. You must carefully consider the issue so that the solution can scale and be easily maintained. Amazon has a set of leadership principles that play a key role in hiring decisions, and understanding these principles is just as important as your coding skills.\n\nOn my own time, I practiced on LeetCode, a platform for coding challenges, because I liked it, not because I was preparing for interviews. Over time, I developed a strong interest in AI.\n\nOnce I arrived at Amazon, I identified tasks and patterns that could be automated and suggested AI-based solutions to management, primarily focusing on internal workflow automation and data-driven decision support systems. That experience shaped my interest in building intelligent tools for enterprise use. Leadership gave me the green light to implement them, and I successfully integrated AI into our team's workflow.\n\nAfter working at Amazon for about four years, a recruiter from Meta contacted me on LinkedIn. I never aimed to work at Meta, but my skills opened up new opportunities. I wanted to work more deeply in applied AI, and Meta offered an opportunity to focus on building intelligent systems with large-scale data and infrastructure. It was a natural next step to grow in the AI space.\n\nI went through the interview process, secured the job, and began working at Meta in 2022.\n\nI was referred internally to Microsoft based on my work at Meta. I decided to move because I wanted to work on enterprise-focused AI products, such as Copilot, which aligns more closely with my long-term interests in building impactful tools for productivity and business transformation. I've been at Microsoft since 2023.\n\nThroughout my career, I've had multiple competitive opportunities. With each role change, my scope of responsibility, impact, and overall compensation increased.\n\nMost of what I know about AI, I taught myself. I spent hours outside work watching YouTube tutorials, reading blogs, and practicing. I started small, creating AI agents for personal tasks, like sending outreach emails. Tasks that used to take me a day or two can now be completed in under an hour.\n\nSeeing those results motivated me to keep learning. What started as a personal side project has now become a central part of my career.\n\nAmazon and Meta both incorporate fast-paced learning, but Meta's codebase is more straightforward. Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all built from a single repository, allowing you to understand the system more quickly.\n\nAmazon's codebase is huge, which makes the first year challenging, but the learning curve is worth it. Microsoft feels different altogether. It's more enterprise-focused, operating at a massive scale.\n\nAI excels at repetitive or static tasks, and our job is to monitor and guide it. Managing AI, I believe, is the future of software engineering.\n\nDemand for AI roles is skyrocketing, while traditional software engineering roles have shrunk over the last five years. Many of my friends who don't work in AI have struggled to land new offers.\n\nI recommend dedicating just one hour a day to learning AI. Within six months, you'll see real progress, and these skills will be critical for the next decade. For beginners, I recommend the following:\n\nIf I were to advise my younger self, I would tell her to focus less on perfection and more on making an impact, to take ownership early, speak up with confidence, and prioritize learning and growth over titles.\n\nLong-term growth comes from solving meaningful problems and maintaining resilience.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Charles Swann, a 44-year-old founder of an AI startup based in Boulder, CO. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI founded my startup, Forage, around 18 months ago. Besides myself, I have one full-time employee who has been with the company for eight months.\n\nMy business is in the marketing technology space, and I needed someone with a deep connection to modern culture and social media. So, I hired a 24-year-old growth and brand specialist from my neighborhood. She's a college graduate with less than two years of experience, whom I started mentoring.\n\nThe challenge with hiring someone more junior is that they often lack the skills to translate their intuition into a business strategy. But over the last six months, especially since the launch of Gemini 3, we've been able to leverage AI to significantly expand the capabilities of my junior employee.\n\nWe work in the marketing technology space, helping brands understand the trends happening on social media.\n\nMy junior employee has a very intuitive understanding of what influencer and brand relationships should look like, as well as how brands should present themselves on social media.\n\nWhen she first used AI in this role, she used ChatGPT to refine her product strategy. ChatGPT was great at taking her rough ideas, refining the concepts, and then writing out the details. As we began using Gemini more frequently, the role AI played in our workflow shifted from refining to co-creating product strategy.\n\nThe increased strategic capabilities in Gemini 3 are subtle, but they make a big difference because that strategic perspective is what young professionals often miss.\n\nMy growth and brand specialist had no prior experience writing a product requirements document before getting this role. Without AI, creating this document is a heavy lift. It's essentially the initial blueprint for a new product feature, translating a business idea into the technical instructions needed to build it.\n\nWriting this type of document for complex features typically would take a skilled product manager eight to 10 hours to get it right. With Gemini, my employee can do this in four to five hours.\n\nGemini 3 has been a significant step forward. Before using it, I had the idea that we should create 70% of the final product, and AI should generate 30%. Now, it's probably 40% us and 60% Gemini, simply because it's so good at expanding and expediting.\n\nWith younger career professionals, sometimes there's a light switch that clicks, and they know what it's like to be a leader, take ownership of something, and start running with their ideas.\n\nMy employee has really demonstrated that growth. This occurred at the same time she became more sophisticated in her use of AI.\n\nAI now serves as that middle layer, helping her level up the work she produces. I hesitate to say that AI alone has allowed me to have less supervision, but as she started getting more sophisticated in her use of the AI tool, I've spent less time reviewing in detail what she's generating and more time focused on the big-picture strategy questions.\n\nThere's always a risk in relying on AI to teach my employee how to gain years of experience in seconds. Hallucinations and feedback loops can occur if someone doesn't have the experience to know when to redirect.\n\nWhat I've done to help safeguard us is create a collection of prompt starters that include a detailed background on what our platform does, the features, and how to define it, which I can copy and paste into the chat. That's been a giant time saver and helps keep it focused on relevant context.\n\nHowever, I think running into possible mistakes or hallucinations is better than moving slowly. I would rather have those mistakes come up, and we have to course correct, than not be able to move at the pace we are.\n\nAI removes some of the traditional requirements around skills and expertise I need to see in candidates. It allows me to focus more on the raw intelligence, ambition, and drive.\n\nWith my company, I'm definitely bullish on the idea that brands will need the ability to authentically understand and reflect culture more than ever before, even in an AI-driven world, to survive. That type of intuitive knowledge resides with a different group of people than those my age, in their 40s, might be able to deliver.\n\nSo, I'm less concerned with whether my employee has been in the marketing industry for 10 years and more concerned with whether they have a deep understanding of the problem we're trying to solve.\n\nI believe this hiring mindset will only grow as AI continues to transform the workforce.\n\nDo you operate a tiny team and want to share your story?

    "description": "AI's memory capacity is still limited. Solving that may be the key to unlocking superintelligence.",
    "fullText": "In humans, working memory — our ability to hold and use information in everyday life — is closely linked to general intelligence.\n\nThat means the ability for AI to remember things could be the key to realizing a superintelligent AI, a still theoretical version of AI that reasons as well or better than humans.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks it's hard to predict just how intelligent AI can really be because the possibilities of memory retention are limitless.\n\n\"Even if you have the world's best personal assistant, they don't, they can't remember every word you've ever said in your life, they can't have read every email, they can't have read every document you've ever written, they can't be looking at all your work every day and remembering every little detail, they can't be a participant in your life to that degree. No human has like infinite, perfect memory,\" Altman said recently on the \"Big Technology\" podcast.\n\nAI, however, will definitely have the capacity for that, he said.\n\n\"Right now, memory is still very crude, very early,\" he said. Once AI is able to remember every granular detail of a user's life, including even the small preferences they didn't explicitly indicate, it will be \"super powerful,\" he said.\n\nAltman added that it's one of the future features he's most excited about — and he's not the only one.\n\nAndrew Pignanelli, the cofounder of The General Intelligence Company of New York, a company that builds AI agents for businesses, said that memory will become the biggest focus for AI companies in the coming year.\n\n\"It will become the most important topic discussed and recognized as the final step before AGI,\" Pignanelli wrote in a blog post. \"Every model provider will add and improve on memory for their apps after seeing OpenAI's success with ChatGPT memory (like Claude just did).\"\n\nPignanelli, however, said that the industry is still a long way from perfecting long-term memory.\n\n\"Larger context windows continue to improve things, as they allow more data to be passed into the context window, which allows the agent to better read parts of a large memory index,\" he wrote, in reference to the amount of information a large language model can process in a single prompt. \"Even then, though, the vast level of detail that we need to reach to consider something AGI requires memory architecture improvements.\"\n\nEven shorter-term episodic memory hasn't been fully solved yet, he said.\n\nSolving that memory problem is the ticket to turning AI from something that feels artificial to something that seems human, he said.\n\n\"Our systems today get the interaction part right. In terms of a Turing test for interaction, we're basically all the way there. But that's only half of what's needed to make a digital self,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The first AGI will be a very intelligent processor combined with a very good memory system,\" he said.",

    "description": "Daniel Min, the 22-year-old CMO at AI startup Cluely, warns against making the mistake that he used to make when networking.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Daniel Min, the chief marketing officer at viral AI \"cheating\" startup Cluely. He's based in New York City. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was 18, people would tell me to reach out to as many people as possible because they would view me as young and eager, and they would want to take a chance on me.\n\nSo I did a lot of outreach that looked like the kind of messages I receive now: \"Hey, I'm 18. I really admire the work that you do. Would love to just hop on a 15-minute chat with you and learn more about you.\"\n\nI'm not surprised I was ghosted most of the time.\n\nThere's a difference between wanting to hop on a chat and wanting a job from someone, but even the people I was just trying to chat with would not respond to me most of the time — and it's because of two main things.\n\nFirst, I realized that 15-minute chats are incredibly taxing and they ruin my workflow.\n\nThe second thing I realized is that when I would reach out for jobs, I would communicate that I didn't know what I was good at. I would say things like, \"I'm willing to do anything. I'm willing to work for free.\" Most of the time they would ghost me because my message showed that I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nI thought they would think I'm an eager young buck, who's just trying my best and who's willing to work hard. Now that I'm on the other side, I know that if I took a chance on that student who's willing to do anything, it would take me a lot of work to onboard them, and probably cause me more pain.\n\nI know that what they want out of this experience is to learn from me. So I would need to invest time, and I don't want to hire somebody and give them a poor experience.\n\nI used to think it was risk-free for someone to take a chance on me. But over time, I realized it's high risk because they're going to invest significant amounts of time.\n\nI have a soft spot for students who say that they're kind of lost and thinking about going into a startup. I'll always at least respond to them and say, \"hey, keep your head up, and try this thing.\"\n\nIf you want to send better outreach, first, tell me what you can do. Two, don't tell me what you want to learn; show me how you can help me. And three, if you don't have the skills yet, develop them and reach out again.\n\nI haven't responded to a lot of cold outreaches, but I'll take calls here and there, usually if it's through warm intros. I've told about 20 people that if they post every day for 60 days and send me a message, I will look over their content.\n\nNot a single person has ever done that. If they're not willing to put in 60 days worth of work into something they really care about, why is it worth it? I want to know that if I hop on a call with someone and give them advice, they're going to run far with it.\n\nThat's pretty much exactly what my editor did for me. He made a whole YouTube video demonstrating that he really cares and that he's watched every single one of my videos. I asked him to edit an example video and create a Google Doc of things he thinks I could film better, and he wrote a six-page document with timestamps on exactly what I should do.\n\nAfter that, I knew he was somebody who goes above and beyond. I hired him as my part-time editor at the time, and when I joined Cluely, one of my negotiation points was that he needed to be there with me. He's no longer my editor, but now he's a full-time employee at the startup. His journey is inspiring because he took a shot and showed he could provide value.\n\nMaybe someone isn't great yet when they reach out, but I want to know that if I put hours of effort into someone, they'll learn quickly and become great.\n\nIt's also effective to send links if you're doing a cold outreach. Someone could say they generated 50 million views and I wouldn't believe them. If they send me a link — which hopefully isn't malware — I will always click on it. If I was to look for a job right now, I would link everything I've done.",

    "description": "Jackson said that faster chips aren't the big news from Jensen Huang's talk. Instead, the shifting nature of AI infrastructure is the key takeaway.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the new year by giving investors some key product updates at CES 2026, drumming up fresh bullishness about the chip titan's business.\n\nAt the high-profile industry event, Huang revealed that production has begun on Rubin, its six-chip AI platform and the follow-up to the popular Blackwell architecture.\n\nThe talk generated a lot of buzz about the future of AI demand and Nvidia's business outlook, but hedge fund manager Eric Jackson argues that the most important takeaway from the talk is much bigger than innovations in chip tech.\n\nJackson, who helped spur rallies in several stocks followed by retail traders last year, said that he thinks many investors missed the key takeaway from the event. In his view, the most important thing isn't that faster or more advanced chips are coming; it is that AI is being built as a utility-scale infrastructure designed to operate for decades.\n\n\"Most people watched NVIDIA's CES keynote and heard 'faster chips,''\" he said. \"That wasn't the message. The real takeaway was this: AI factories are now being planned years in advance — at the land, power, and shell level.\"\n\nIn short, he thinks these statements mean that AI is being treated like electricity or telecom networks, a technology that will serve as a fundamental part of everyday life.\n\n\"The CES + JPM conversations made it clear: AI factories are being planned like utilities — not experiments,\" Jackson noted. \"That changes the slope.\"\n\nAs he sees it, the shifting industry landscape is poised to create more efficient AI production, which will lead to more demand for it through new use cases.\n\nThe investor highlighted the Jevons Paradox, an economic adage that argues that when a resource becomes more efficient to use, people consume it more, not less, despite assumptions. Economist William Stanley Jevons first introduced it in the 19th century to illustrate the growing dependence on coal.\n\n\"The market's obsession with 'capex slowing' misses the point,\" Jackson added. \"If inference + agents + long-context workloads are compounding, power becomes monetizable for longer, not shorter.\"\n\nJackson added that recent AI market developments are feeding his bullish thesis on small-cap tech stocks like Hut 8, IREN, and Cipher Mining, as all three stand to benefit from an economy increasingly powered by AI.\n\n\"Most investors still ask: 'Is AI demand peaking?'\" he wrote. \"The better question now is: Who can deliver reliable power and uptime as AI becomes permanent?\"",

    "fullText": "AI is rapidly turning expert knowledge into a commodity — and that shift will force companies to rethink what actually gives them a competitive edge, according to Box CEO Aaron Levie.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post this week, the cofounder and CEO of cloud-storage giant Box said that AI models are becoming capable of performing high-level knowledge work across nearly every profession, from law and medicine to strategy and scientific research.\n\nAs those tools evolve into autonomous AI agents, he said, expert intelligence will no longer be scarce.\n\n\"The question that we will have to wrestle with is, in a world where everyone has access to the same expert intelligence, how does a company differentiate?\" Levie wrote.\n\nLevie said the true advantage in an AI-driven economy won't come from having smarter models, but from giving those models access to the right proprietary information — the internal data, customer histories, workflows, decision-making patterns, and institutional knowledge that companies have built over time.\n\n\"Certainly it will be about how teams and employees use AI agents effectively,\" he wrote, \"but the ultimate force-multiplier will be the context that the agents get.\"\n\nThe idea is gaining traction across Silicon Valley.\n\nAndrej Karpathy, who was on the founding team of OpenAI, and Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke have said that \"context engineering\" — not clever prompts — is what makes AI useful at scale, while Google Cloud CTO Will Grannis and GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke have said the real skill shift is toward designing systems, data, and workflows that give AI the right context to operate.\n\nBut getting the right context into AI systems is far from simple, Box CEO Levie told Business Insider last August.\n\nHe said that feeding agents too much information can cause what he calls \"context rot,\" where models become confused and focus on the wrong details.\n\nMaking sure AI agents receive precise, accurate, and task-specific context — without overwhelming them — is now one of the central challenges in building effective agent systems, he added.\n\nThe stakes are high. Companies that can capture, organize, and operationalize their internal knowledge will see major gains in productivity and output, Levie said in his LinkedIn post.\n\n\"Those that don't will find it harder and harder to serve customers competitively,\" he added.",

    "description": "Bob Sternfels, global managing partner at McKinsey, identified three human skills that he said the AI models can't do.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence is reshaping McKinsey's workforce, but the firm's top executive said there are still fundamental human skills that AI models can't do.\n\nBob Sternfels, global managing partner at McKinsey, talked about how AI is changing work at the firm during an appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday.\n\nSternfels said that last year alone, embracing AI saved McKinsey 1.5 million hours in search and synthesis, work that he says AI models are great for. He also said AI agents, of which McKinsey has 25,000, excel at generating charts and that they've made 2.5 million of them in the past six months.\n\nWith agents taking over some of that work, he said consultants are now \"moving up the stack\" and tackling \"more complicated problems.\"\n\nGiven those changes, Sternfels said McKinsey looked at which skills new graduates will need in an AI-infused world from the perspective of large employers. He identified three: the ability to aspire, judgment, and true creativity.\n\n\"What can the models not do? Aspire. Set the right aspiration,\" he said. \"Do you go to low Earth orbit? Do you go to the moon? Do you go to Mars? That's a uniquely human capability.\"\n\nSternfels said you should look to build skills around aspiring and getting others to believe in those aspirations.\n\n\"There's no right and wrong in these models, and so how do you set the right parameters?\" he said, adding humans can build the skills to set the architecture based on factors like firm values and societal norms.\n\n\"The models are inference models — the next most likely step,\" Sternfels said.\n\nHumans, on the other hand, have an edge when it comes to \"orthogonal\" work, or the ability to think outside existing patterns and land on an entirely new approach.\n\nSternfels said AI adoption is also changing how companies look for talent, adding that where someone went to school should matter a lot less.\n\nFor someone with a tech background, he said, instead of looking at where they graduated from, prospective employers should look at their GitHub, a site engineers use to showcase their work.\n\n\"Let's actually get to the content,\" he said, \"and could that actually start meaning that a wider set of people can enter the workforce with different pathways?\"",

IWF analysts said the images would be considered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under UK law.\n\nThe UK-based Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said users of a dark web forum boasted of using Grok Imagine to create sexualised and topless imagery of girls aged between 11 and 13. IWF analysts said the images would be considered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under UK law.\n\n“We can confirm our analysts have discovered criminal imagery of children aged between 11 and 13 which appears to have been created using the tool,” said Ngaire Alexander, the head of the IWF’s hotline, which investigates reports of CSAM from members of the public.\n\nX, Elon Musk’s social media platform, has been deluged with images of women and children whose clothes have been digitally removed by the Grok tool, sparking public outcry and condemnation from politicians.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, the House of Commons women and equalities committee said it would no longer use X for its communications, saying it was no longer appropriate to do so given preventing violence against women and girls was among its key policy areas.\n\nThe decision marks the first significant move by a Westminster organisation to exit X in response to the misuse of Grok. While the decision concerned only the committee’s account, some individual members, including the Labour chair, Sarah Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.\n\nAlexander said the imagery viewed by the IWF has been used to create even more extreme material – known as Category A, which includes penetrative sexual activity – using a different AI tool.\n\n“We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material. Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream. That is unacceptable,” Alexander added.\n\nMusk’s xAI, which owns Grok and X, has been approached for comment.\n\nDowning Street said “all options were on the table”, including a boycott of X as ministers backed the UK regulator, Ofcom, to take action.\n\nOn Wednesday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “X needs to deal with this urgently and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users.\n\n“It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law.”\n\nRequests for Grok to manipulate images of women to “put her in a bikini” continued to flood in on X on Wednesday. Despite the warnings of EU and UK regulatory action, there was no evidence that the platform had installed tighter safeguards, and pictures of teenage girls continue to be stripped down digitally at the request of X users, to show them in small, revealing items of underwear, or positioned in sexually explicit poses.\n\nSome users have demanded more extreme content, asking the chatbot to decorate bikinis with swastikas, or requesting alterations to photographs of women so they appear to be victims of abuse. The chatbot has obliged by adding cigarette burns, facial bruising, and blood to some images of women.\n\nThe UK’s data watchdog – the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) – said it had contacted X and xAI “to seek clarity on the measures they have in place to comply with UK data protection law and protect individuals’ rights”, adding people have “a right to use social media knowing their personal data is being handled lawfully and with respect”.\n\nX has said it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, “by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary”.",

    "fullText": "Ford will be launching an AI assistant to help its drivers with everyday problems.\n\nFord announced on Wednesday that it would introduce the first chapter of its new AI assistant to customers through the Ford mobile app in the first half of the year.\n\nThe assistant is billed as a \"deep, personalized intelligence that knows your specific vehicle, understands your unique needs, and anticipates your desires on every journey,\" per Ford's press release.\n\nSammy Omari, the head of Ford's Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS), told Business Insider that the fastest way to get the AI agent in the hands of its customer base is through the Ford and Lincoln mobile apps, which many of its customers already use.\n\nOmari said the next step would come in 2027.\n\n\"And then in '27, we are actually going to launch that in vehicle and then scale that across our vehicles,\" he said.\n\nOmari said that Ford would not be developing its own LLM for the AI assistant.\n\nWe're not going to be directly competing with a Google or an OpenAI or a Meta,\" he said. \"But what we do do is we take an LLM that's available and then basically make it our own by giving it access to all the relevant information about the person's vehicle.\"\n\nRivian, a California-headquartered EV manufacturer, announced a similar AI assistant for its cars in December.\n\nThe company said it would launch a \"next-generation voice interface\" in early 2026 on its Gen 1 and Gen 2 R1 vehicles.\n\nA demonstration of the AI assistant, seen by Business Insider, showed that it could understand commands said in natural language, such as \"Can you make it a little bit colder for everyone in the cabin?\"\n\nFord's announcement was released amid a raft of hot auto industry news coming out of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026, an annual tech trade show happening in Las Vegas.\n\nAmazon-backed robotaxi company Zoox gave live demonstrations during the conference. Uber unveiled the design of its first robotaxi, made in collaboration with Lucid and autonomous driving startup Nuro.\n\nNvidia's CEO Jensen Huang also announced Alpamayo, a new open AI model for autonomous vehicles.",

    "title": "IBM's AI agent Bob easily duped to run malware, researchers show",
    "description": ": Prompt injection lets risky commands slip past guardrails",
    "fullText": "IBM describes its coding agent thus: \"Bob is your AI software development partner that understands your intent, repo, and security standards.\" Unfortunately, Bob doesn't always follow those security standards.\n\nAnnounced last October and presently in closed beta testing, IBM offers Bob in the form of a command line interface – a CLI, like Claude Code – and an integrated development environment – an IDE like Cursor.\n\nSecurity researchers at PromptArmor have been evaluating Bob prior to general release and have found that IBM's \"AI development partner\" can be manipulated into executing malware. They report that the CLI is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that allow malware execution and that the IDE is vulnerable to common AI-specific data exfiltration vectors.\n\nAI agent software – models given access to tools and tasked with some goal in an iterative loop – is notoriously insecure and often comes with warnings from vendors. The risks have been demonstrated repeatedly by security researcher Johann Rehberger, among others. Agents may be vulnerable to prompt injection, jailbreaks, or more traditional code flaws that enable the execution of malicious code.\n\nAs Rehberger remarked at a recent presentation to the Chaos Computer Club, the fix for many of these risks involves putting a human in the loop to authorize risky action.\n\nThat's apparently the case with Bob. IBM's documentation, the PromptArmor Threat Intelligence Team explained in a writeup provided to The Register, includes a warning that setting high-risk commands to be automatically approved for agent usage potentially allows harmful operations.\n\nBig Blue's recommendation is that users rely on allow lists and avoid wildcard characters, with the assumption that the agent will ask the user to approve or reject the automated use of fraught commands.\n\nBut according to PromptArmor, Bob's defenses are a bit too porous. Company researchers gave Bob a code repo to explore that contained a malicious README.md file. The file includes instructions that tell Bob it's responsible for conducting phishing training with the user.\n\nScreenshot of Bob CLI vulnerability, from PromptArmor - Click to enlarge\n\nThe markdown file includes a series of \"echo\" commands, which if entered into a terminal application will print a message to the shell's standard output. The first two are benign and when Bob follows the instructions, the model presents a prompt in the terminal window asking the user to allow the command once, to always allow it, or to suggest changes.\n\nIn its third appearance, the \"echo\" command attempts to fetch a malicious script. And if the user has been lulled into allowing \"echo\" to run always, the malware will be installed and executed without approval.\n\nBoth the CLI and IDE, even when given a green light to always run a command, are still intended to have additional security measures. Specifically, Bob disallows the use of command substitution like \"$(command)\" as a safeguard. But it doesn't check for process substitution, as seen in a bug the researchers found in the project's minified JavaScript code.\n\nScreenshot of vulnerable Bob JavaScript code - Click to enlarge\n\nAlso, the agent software fails to catch when separate subcommands have been chained together using the \">\" redirection operator.\n\nThus, the researchers were able to prefix a series of malicious commands with the allowed \"echo\" command and run the entire set of instructions.\n\n\"For IBM Bob, we were able to bypass several defense mechanisms - ultimately, the 'human in the loop' approval function only ends up validating an allow-listed safe command, when in reality more sensitive commands were being run (that were not on the allow-list),\" explained Shankar Krishnan, managing director at PromptArmor, in an email to The Register.\n\n\"If this were tried with Claude Code, a programmatic defense would stop the attack flow and request user consent for the whole multi-part malicious command – even if the first command in the sequence were on the auto-approval list.\"\n\nGiven the ability to induce Bob to deliver an arbitrary shell script payload to the victim's machine, the attacker could run ransomware, steal credentials, or commandeer the device.\n\n\"There are a few plausible scenarios here,\" said Krishnan. \"This risk is relevant for any developer workflows that leverage untrusted data. For example, Bob can read webpages – a prompt injection can be encountered if the user requests that Bob review a site containing untrusted content (e.g. developer docs, StackOverflow). Bob can also read terminal command outputs – an injection in a third-party data source can be printed after a command is run and ingested by Bob. Our write-up considers a developer working with an untrusted open-source repository, as it is a self-contained and realistic example.\"\n\nAdditionally, the PromptArmor researchers say that the IDE is susceptible to a zero-click data exfiltration attack that affects a number of AI applications. Specifically, Bob will render markdown images in model output with a Content Security Policy that allows network request endpoints to be logged by attackers. This could allow data exfiltration via pre-fetched JSON schemas potentially.\n\nIBM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We're told that the company has been informed of the vulnerability. ®",

    "title": "CES 2026: Ford Is Launching Its Own AI Assistant",
    "description": "Your Ford is getting its own ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Listen up, Ford drivers: You're getting a new AI assistant this year. During a decidedly low-key CES keynote, the company announced Ford AI Assistant, a new AI-powered bot coming to Ford customers in the early half of 2026.\n\nWhile the company has plans to integrate the assistant into Ford vehicles directly, that isn't how you'll first experience this new AI. Instead, Ford is rolling out Ford AI Assistant to an upgraded version of its Ford app first, and plans on shipping cars with the assistant built-in sometime in 2027. In effect, Ford has added a proprietary version of ChatGPT or Gemini to its app.\n\nFord's idea here is to offer users a smart assistant experience directly tied to their Ford vehicle. In one example, the company suggests a customer could visit a hardware store looking to buy mulch. Said customer could take a photo of a pile of bags of mulch, and ask the assistant, \"how many bags can I fit in the bed of my truck?\" Ford AI Assistant could then run the numbers, and offer an educated estimate to how much mulch the customer can buy and take with them at one time.\n\nOf course, other AI assistants can do similar calculations. Send ChatGPT the same photo, and ask the same question—specifying the model of your truck—and the bot will run the numbers itself. The difference, in Ford's view, is that Ford AI Assistant is connected to your vehicle specifically. It can read all the sensors in your car, so it knows, for example, how many people are currently traveling with you, your current tire pressure, or, really, anything and everything about your car. According to Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EVs, digital, and design, the company's goal with the assistant is to offer answers customers can't get from other sources. ChatGPT certainly doesn't have access to your every sensor embedded in your car, so Ford does have the advantage there.\n\nFord didn't go out and build its AI tech by scratch, however. The company tells TechCrunch that Ford AI Assistant is hosted by Google Cloud, and is run using \"off-the-shelf LLMs.\" Still, that likely won't have much of an impact on whether or not customers use this new assistant. Instead, that will come down to how useful they find the AI assistant in the app.\n\nAs someone who rarely uses AI assistants, I'd imagine I'd find little use for it if I owned a Ford. That being said, there are some times when it could genuinely be useful to have external access to your car's information. I could probably eyeball how many bags of mulch would fit in my trunk, but I can't tell you my exact odometer reading without starting up my car. The same goes for my tire pressure: It'd be helpful to know my tire pressure before getting in my car, to know whether I should be headed somewhere I can fill up before going to my destination.\n\nOf course, there's also a privacy discussion to be had here. Modern cars are already privacy nightmares, but there's something a bit unnerving about an AI assistant that knows everything about my car.",

The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure. Musk later went on to launch his own AI company, xAI, in 2023.",

    "fullText": "Some people love AI. If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.\n\nIf you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out \nRemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).\n\nTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\n\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n\nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.",

    "title": "AI starts autonomously writing prescription refills in Utah",
    "description": "The program allows patients in the state to get prescription refills for 190 common meds.",
    "fullText": "The state of Utah is allowing artificial intelligence to prescribe medication refills to patients without direct human oversight in a pilot program public advocates call “dangerous.”\n\nThe program is through the state’s “regulatory sandbox” framework, which allows businesses to trial “innovative” products or services with state regulations temporarily waived. The Utah Department of Commerce partnered with Doctronic, a telehealth startup with an AI chatbot.\n\nDoctronic offers a nationwide service that allows patients to chat with its “AI doctor” for free, then, for $39, book a virtual appointment with a real doctor licensed in their state. But patients must go through the AI chatbot first to get an appointment.\n\nAccording to a non-peer-reviewed preprint article from Doctronic, which looked at 500 telehealth cases in its service, the company claims its AI’s diagnosis matched the diagnosis made by a real clinician in 81 percent of cases. The AI’s treatment plan was “consistent” with that of a doctor’s in 99 percent of the cases.\n\nNow, for patients in Utah, Doctronic’s chatbot can refill a prescription without a doctor, for a $4 service fee . After a patient signs in and verifies state residency, the AI chatbot can pull up the patient’s prescription history and offer a list of prescription medications eligible for a refill. According to Politico, the chatbot will only be able to renew prescriptions for 190 common medications for chronic conditions, with key exclusions, such as medications for pain and ADHD, and those that are injected.\n\nThe first 250 renewals for each drug class will be reviewed by real doctors, but after that, the AI chatbot will be on its own. Adam Oskowitz, Doctronic co-founder and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, told Politico that the AI chatbot is designed to err on the side of safety and escalate any case with uncertainty to a real doctor.\n\n“Utah’s approach to regulatory mitigation strikes a vital balance between fostering innovation and ensuring consumer safety,” Margaret Woolley Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nFor now, it’s unclear if the Food and Drug Administration will step in to regulate AI prescribing. On the one hand, prescription renewals are a matter of practicing medicine, which falls under state governance. However, Politico notes that the FDA has said that it has the authority to regulate medical devices used to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.\n\nIn a statement, Robert Steinbrook, health research group director at watchdog Public Citizen, blasted Doctronic’s program and the lack of oversight. “AI should not be autonomously refilling prescriptions, nor identifying itself as an ‘AI doctor,'” Steinbrook said.\n\n“Although the thoughtful application of AI can help to improve aspects of medical care, the Utah pilot program is a dangerous first step toward more autonomous medical practice,” he said.\"The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies cannot look the other way when AI applications undermine the essential human clinician role in prescribing and renewing medications.”",

FlashInfer-Bench addresses this gap by establishing a standardized, closed-loop framework that connects kernel generation, benchmarking, and deployment. At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM. Using FlashInfer-Bench, we further evaluate the performance and limitations of LLM agents, compare the trade-offs among different GPU programming languages, and provide insights for future agent design.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Move follows outcry over use of Grok to digitally remove clothing from images of women and children\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nThe influential Commons women and equalities committee has decided to stop using X after the social media site’s AI tool began generating thousands of digitally altered images of women and children with their clothes removed.\n\nThe move by the cross-party committee places renewed pressure on ministers to take decisive action after the site was flooded with images including sexualised and unclothed pictures of children, generated by its AI tool, Grok.\n\nSarah Owen, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said that given preventing violence against women and girls was among its key policy areas, “it has become increasingly clear that X is not an appropriate platform to be using for our communications”.\n\nLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, has called the imagery “appalling and unacceptable in decent society” and urged Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator, to take whatever action is needed.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said that “all options remain on the table” for Ofcom, which has the power to impose huge fines or to restrict access to a site.\n\nThe decision by the women and equalities committee is the first significant move by a Westminster organisation to exit X. It is understood the committee took the decision at a meeting on Wednesday. It will keep its X account, which has about 27,000 followers, in existence, but dormant, to ensure no one else can take it over.\n\nWhile the decision concerned only the committee’s account, some individual members, including Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.\n\nJardine said she had taken the view that X was a good way to communicate with constituents. “But I cannot in all conscience continue to use a platform which seems unwilling to act against this grossly offensive and abusive online behaviour towards women and girls.”\n\nOwen also plans to write to the Cabinet Office and to Ofcom to urge action against X. She said: “I personally came off X in 2024 after the platform and its owner promoted and paid creators of far-right racist and misogynistic material. The committee heard at the end of last year on inquiries about community cohesion that X posts regularly break UK law on hate speech.\n\n“In recent days, X and xAI have allowed the creation and sharing of AI deepfakes, non-consensual intimate imagery, and child sexual abuse material, all areas identified as online violence against women and girls by our committee.\n\n“We do not view it as appropriate to use such a platform to share our work. I hope that the government, Ofcom and relevant law enforcement agencies work quickly to make X immediately abide by UK law on online safety and non-consensual intimate image abuse, to be held to account for its failures and if it refuses to abide by our laws, it must be appropriately sanctioned.”\n\nOn Monday, Ofcom said it was aware of serious concerns raised about Grok creating images of undressed people and sexualised images of children. It said it had contacted X and xAI “to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK” and would assess the need for an investigation based on the company’s response.\n\nStarmer’s spokesperson said: “What we have seen on Grok is a disgrace. It is completely unacceptable. No one should have to go through the ordeal of deepfakes of themselves online, and we won’t allow the proliferation of these demeaning images.\n\n“X needs to deal with this urgently, and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users. It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law. And when it comes to keeping people safe online, all options remain on the table.”\n\nAsked about the issue, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said the Conservative leader agreed with the government: “We both find it absolutely abhorrent and want to see it clamped down upon as soon as possible.”\n\nAsked if this could mean Badenoch, an enthusiastic user of X who has 350,000 followers, might leave the platform, the spokesperson said: “We are very clear that what is happening with those Grok deepfakes is absolutely disgusting and there has to be some something done to stop that. I’m not about to announce policy here.”\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Nigel Farage was asked if he was happy to earn money from a site that had a business model based in part on child sexual abuse material. The Reform UK leader is paid for engagement on the site as a much-followed verified user.\n\nFarage avoided the question but said he was “very worried” about the images and said he believed X would listen to the criticism.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan's asset and wealth management division is ditching its long-held practice of using external proxy advisors for advice on shareholder voting decisions.\n\nThe bank said it was \"the first major investment firm to fully eliminate any reliance on external proxy advisors for our US voting process,\" according to an excerpt from an internal memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe changes to the US proxy-voting process will take full effect on April 1, following a transition period in the first quarter of the year, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Asset Management told Business Insider.\n\nThe news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nJPMorgan's asset management division holds $7 trillion in client assets, giving it a vote in thousands of shareholder decisions that include general governance decisions outside of finance questions. It's common practice in the industry to turn to proxy advisory firms for data collection, advice, and voting recommendations.\n\nThe practice has come under fire from the Trump administration, which signed an executive order in December calling for increased oversight of the proxy advisor industry.\n\n\"Proxy advisors regularly use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas,\" the executive order said.\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, were two proxy advisory firms previously used by JPMorgan and named in the Trump administration's December executive order.\n\nA spokesperson for ISS declined to comment on the news of JP Morgan cutting ties with proxy advisory firms. However, the spokesperson said, \"We are proud of our four-decade record serving the global institutional investor community,\" and will continue to do so as it prepares for the 2026 annual meeting season. Glass Lewis did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe move away from proxy firms reinforced JPMorgan's \"unwavering commitment to vote solely in clients' best interests, using our information advantage,\" the bank said in the memo.\n\nIn place of external human advisors, the asset and wealth management unit is launching an in-house AI platform, called Proxy IQ, to support shareholder decisions, according to the memo.\n\n\"Proxy IQ extends the high bar of independent analysis that our portfolio managers, research analysts and stewardship teams have always applied to every vote, using that same in-house expertise to cover all aspects of the voting process, including data and research selection, down to the smallest detail,\" JPMorgan said in the memo.\n\nThe tool will be able to aggregate and analyze proprietary data from more than 3,000 annual company meetings, it said.\n\nJPMorgan has a technology budget of $18 billion, and CEO Jamie Dimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race.",

    "description": "Many of the fastest-growing jobs in the US involve AI, according to LinkedIn. Engineers topped the list, though not all AI roles are technical.",
    "fullText": "If finding a new job is on your to-do list in 2026, you might want to start with AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence engineers top LinkedIn's annual Jobs on the Rise list, which ranks the fastest-growing roles in the US over the past three years. The newly released findings also offer a snapshot of where employers are still hiring, from tech and infrastructure to sales and healthcare.\n\nJust as AI appears to be buoying the stock market, it's also supporting demand in various sectors of the labor market. There's other welcome news for desk workers who have faced years of sluggish hiring: Not all of the AI roles are wholly technical.\n\nThe category of AI consultants and strategists was the second-fastest-growing in LinkedIn's review.\n\nThat's an indication that integrating AI more deeply into the workplace will require people whose expertise isn't solely technical, said Laura Lorenzetti, a senior director at LinkedIn who worked on the list.\n\n\"There is also this whole adjacent system of how you implement AI; how you do culture change around AI; how you get people to really adapt and use it,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nOther roles related to AI also feature prominently on the ranking of fast-growing jobs. Data annotators, who help train and refine AI systems, were fourth on the list, while AI and machine learning researchers came in at No. 5.\n\nNot all of the top spots were directly tied to AI, however. The third-fastest-growing job type was \"new home sales specialists,\" while healthcare reimbursement specialists were sixth.\n\nAlongside the list, LinkedIn also reported on Wednesday that, in a November survey, more than half of workers — 56% — said they planned to look for a new job in 2026, although about three-quarters of respondents felt unprepared to do so.\n\nThey cited reasons such as being unsure about how to stand out or not being ready for how technology is shifting in-demand skills.\n\nIn a prior LinkedIn survey from about a year ago, a similar share of workers signaled their intent to hunt for a job — a reminder that looking isn't the same as landing.\n\nMore than six in 10 of the 2,000 respondents said that finding a job had grown more challenging over the prior year. They cited factors such as competition, skills gaps, and uncertainty over which jobs they might be qualified for.\n\nOther LinkedIn data highlighted the challenges in the job market for many people: The number of applicants per open role has, on average, more than doubled since the spring of 2022, while hiring was 23% below pre-pandemic levels as of November.\n\nThe difficulty in finding work, especially after years of cuts in Big Tech and as firms ramp up investments in AI, is causing some to reconsider their approach to their job hunt. Nearly half of job seekers — 46% — said in the survey that they'd gone from looking for full-time work to freelance, contract, or advising gigs.\n\nLed by Gen Z, nearly one in five professionals who reported being unable to find a new job in 2025 said they had shifted to freelance or consulting work, or had started their own business.\n\nThat could be one reason the job title \"founder\" is surging on LinkedIn profiles — and appearing on the list of fastest-growing jobs for the first time, in the ninth spot.\n\nLinkedIn reported in December that the share of US users who added founder to their profile had jumped 69% from the prior year.\n\n\"People are seeing that as a way to own their career and own their next step,\" said Lorenzetti, referring to the interest in entrepreneurship.\n\nHere are the 25 fastest-growing roles in the US, according to LinkedIn:",

    "description": "AgileRL has created a platform for engineers to train AI using reinforcement learning, a decades-old technique that's having a comeback.",
    "fullText": "A London-based startup that provides software to help companies speed up AI training has raised $7.5 million in funding.\n\nAgileRL has created a platform called Arena that engineers and data scientists can drop their AI models into, run simulations, fine-tune them before deployment, and monitor them while they are running.\n\nThe startup, cofounded by Param Kumar and Nicholas Ustaran-Anderegg in 2023, focuses on reinforcement learning, or RL, an AI training technique in which systems learn by trying actions and improving based on the feedback they receive.\n\nReinforcement learning has roots dating back to the 1950s, but at AI labs, it is experiencing a renaissance of sorts.\n\nKumar, AgileRL's CEO, told Business Insider that after ChatGPT launched in late 2022, companies \"moved their budgets from working on RL\" to focus on transformers, the technology underpinning large language models. Where transformers learn patterns from large datasets all at once, RL learns one step at a time. Now, he says more companies are realizing that transformers can only get them so far.\n\n\"We realized early on that transformers are great, but they're these large statistical models,\" Kumar said. \"The reality is you will need to layer on RL on top of that, because there's only so much you can infer from the data.\"\n\nKumar gave the example of a robotic arm being tasked with moving a ball from one table to another. He said that the movement can be broken down into many smaller tasks — such as grasping the ball, lifting the arm, and moving the joint — and that AgileRL's platform allows engineers to set parameters to improve at those specific tasks.\n\nThe startup says it can speed up AI development for companies because the training tools are all in one place and off the shelf, versus setting up an AI lab from scratch.\n\nAgileRL offers a free tier, which provides users with access to a limited amount of training credits. Paid tiers are available for businesses and professionals, along with custom licenses for larger enterprises.\n\nThe company says its platform has been downloaded more than 300,000 times, and it has been used by companies including Airbus, IBM, and JPMorgan.\n\nAgileRL's seed funding round was led by Fusion Fund, with participation from Flying Fish, Octopus Ventures, Entrepreneur First, and Counterview Capital.\n\nThe startup said it plans to use the capital to open an office in San Francisco and hire more than a dozen people in engineering and go-to-market roles.\n\nHere's an exclusive look at the 12-page pitch deck AgileRL used to raise $7.5 million.",

    "description": "AI slop is everywhere — except it's not so sloppy anymore. Just take a look at Instagram or TikTok. A lot of it looks real. That's where you come in.",
    "fullText": "There was a time, not so long ago, when AI-generated content was very easy to spot. It was surreal, ridiculous — like Jesus made out of Shrimp.\n\nWe're in a new time now, and AI slop looks so good, it's hard to tell from the real thing. I've been fooled by it. You probably have, too, even if you don't think you have. For example, this extremely realistic video of Nicolás Maduro doing TikTok dances in prison with Diddy. You know it's AI only because it's improbable, not because the video quality is poor.\n\n2025: “AI will be used to cure cancer”\n\n2026:\n\n pic.twitter.com/u6KbygoLtm\n\nSo in a post-slop world, what comes next? What does our future look like with AI?\n\nOne person who would know something about both is Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who posted a prediction to Threads: He says AI images, text, and videos will get more and more realistic, and it'll become harder to separate them from what's real — including on the platform he oversees.\n\n(That's already happening to some extent: Long are the days when it was easy to spot a \"Shrimp Jesus\"-like AI-generated picture.)\n\nWhat I appreciate about Mosseri's memo is that he seems optimistic about what probably sounds like a bad thing to most people. Admitting his platform will be filled with AI-generated content meant to fool people — for funsies or profit — should, theoretically, be taking an L. But he sees this as a problem that can be solved (on Instagram, at least) at the product level:\n\nHis other point is that people will naturally gravitate toward human-produced content because that's what will become trendy: authentic, less polished, intimate, real.\n\n\"Authenticity is fast becoming a scarce resource, which will in turn drive more demand for creator content, not less,\" he writes. Which is certainly a hopeful message if your job is to run a platform for creator content and you're trying to reassure creators (and advertisers) that they should continue to post authentic content to your platform.\n\nI think he's generally right. The idea that human-created content will become more premium amid a flood of machine-created content seems to be the prevailing wisdom.\n\nAnother optimistic prognostication comes from OpenAI's chief economist, Aaron \"Ronnie\" Chatterji, who told the Financial Times that he believes AI will help free us from mundane household chores.\n\nLook, I love the sound of that as much as anyone, but I'm skeptical. Sure, someone is working on a robot that folds clothes, but it seems like it'll be a long time before that's a real thing for most of us. And it's hard to imagine automation doing the chores I really hate, like scrubbing toilets or sorting through the piles of papers and junk that accumulate on countertops daily. And I am highly, highly skeptical of a robot helping with childcare.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Thompson of Stratechery also seems to fall into the \"humans rock!\" side of things, which I find much more appealing as a human.\n\nHe wrote about a Substack essay that had been going viral among a subset of influential people who care about economics and AI. The essay suggested that once AI and automation make it so that humans no longer have to work, income inequality will actually be far worse.\n\nBut Thompson thinks that even if there's an exponentially bigger gap between the haves and have-nots in the year 2126 (which doesn't sound great on paper), we will still value and prize human labor precisely because it is human. He writes:\n\nI like the sound of this! It's quite self-serving to me, a human who creates something (writing words) that I suppose could be done by AI, but you would probably hate and not want to pay for if it were. And also as a human being who would like to keep the species going for another few generations, I suppose. I like to think this is hope rather than cope.",

    "description": "Chatbots are making amateur lawyers and doctors out of everyone. The real professionals have second opinions about it.",
    "fullText": "A few times a week, Jonathan Freidin, a medical malpractice attorney in Miami, says he'll notice that people will fill out his firm's client contact sheet with text littered with emojis and headings. That's a telltale sign that they copied and pasted from ChatGPT. Other clients will say they've \"done a lot of research\" on their potential case using AI. \"We're seeing a lot more callers who feel like they have a case because ChatGPT or Gemini told them that the doctors or nurses fell below the standard of care in multiple different ways,\" Friedin tells me. \"While that may be true, it doesn't necessarily translate into a viable case.\"\n\nPeople are increasingly turning to generative AI chatbots to research everything from dinner recipes to their complex legal and medical problems. In a December 2025 survey from the legal software company Clio, 57% of consumers said they have or would use AI to answer a legal question. A 2025 Zocdoc survey found that one in three Americans use generative AI tools to get health advice each week, and one in ten use it daily. Zocdoc CEO Oliver Kharraz predicted in the report that \"AI will become the go-to tool for pre-care needs like symptom checking, triage, and navigation, as well as for routine tasks like refills and screenings.\" He cautioned that he also believes \"patients will recognize that it is no substitute for the vast majority of healthcare interactions, especially those that require human judgment, empathy, or complex decision-making.\" If he's wrong, Zodoc and its competitors have a problem.\n\nDoctors and lawyers are now sifting through generative AI emails or working to convince laypeople that they have the expertise and understand nuances of how each local judge acts or how a patient's medical history plays into their condition. Generative AI has democratized access to information that was often elusive and expensive to obtain, but it's also shifted how legal and medical professionals talk to people, and what people expect of them.\n\nChatGPT is the new WebMD and LegalZoom, turning the average person into an armchair expert with just a few prompts. And it's driving the real experts crazy.\n\n\"We have to dispel the information that they were able to obtain versus what is actually going on in their case and kind of work backwards,\" says Jamie Berger, a family law attorney in New Jersey. For example, Berger says that until recently most people knew little to nothing about the legal proceedings of divorce, and would come to the attorneys seeking information. Now, they might come armed with a step-by-step gameplan, but it's generic, and likely not the best fit for their situation. Berger will notice after emailing a client if their tone suddenly changes, that they might be using AI to write out lengthy legal strategies or questions. Then, she has to explain, \"it's not necessarily your factual circumstance,\" and address their various points. \"You have to rebuild or build the attorney-client relationship in a way that didn't used to exist,\" says Berger. \"They don't realize that there's so many offshoots along the way that it's not a linear line from A to Z.\"\n\nLike a real expert, generative AI chatbots speak with authority. That can be far more persuasive than reading a blogpost on a legal issue or summaries of medical conditions on a forum. A third of Americans said yes in a 2025 survey from Survey Monkey and financial services company Express Legal Funding that asked: \"Would you ever trust ChatGPT more than a human expert?\", although respondents were less likely to use it for medical and legal advice, and more likely to consult it for educational and financial advice.\n\nChatbots also have an infinite amount of doctors' most precious re\n\nAI also acts as a second opinion without the wait. Heidi Schrumpf, director of clinical services at teletherapy platform Marvin Behavioral Health, says she's had patients return after a counseling session and tell her that they took her input to ChatGPT or another AI bot, and that they trust her because the bot confirmed what she said. But Scrumpf isn't offended by being double-checked. \"It's great that they have the access to a quick second opinion, and then, if it doesn't agree with me, that allows them to ask me better questions.\"\n\nA 2024 poll tracking health misinformation from health policy research group KFF found that 17% of US adults said they consult AI chatbots at least once a month, but 56% of those people were not confident that the info from the AI chatbots was accurate. Still, people are turning to ChatGPT in growing numbers. \"That type of technology does want to encourage patients to continue to interact with them,\" Allen says. \"Ultimately, you do need a human in there to understand the nuances of the communication and the softer communication skills, and the unspoken communication skills, and the entire medical picture and the history.\"\n\nWithout detailed information, the chatbots will likely give generic advice. But supplying too many personal details is also a risk. People are handing over their entire medical histories to ChatGPT, but HIPAA, the federal law that protects confidential health information, doesn't apply to consumer AI products. There's also a risk of voiding the kind of protections people get from the attorney-client confidentiality privilege if people put too much specific information about their case into a chatbot, says Beth McCormack, dean of the Vermont Law School. And, they likely still need an attorney to really understand the implications of AI's legal advice. \"There's so much nuance to the law,\" McCormack says. \"It's so fact dependent.\"\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson declined to provide comment on the record for this story, but told me that ChatGPT is not meant to substitute legal or medical advice, but act as a complimentary resource to help people understand medical and legal information. The spokesperson also said the company is trying to improve the responses of its models, and that it takes steps to protect personal data in the event of legal inquiries. OpenAI made changes to its policies last fall, specifying that users cannot turn to ChatGPT for \"provision of tailored advice that requires a license, such as legal or medical advice, without appropriate involvement by a licensed professional,\" but the chatbot does still answer health- and law-related questions.\n\nProfessionals aren't totally against their patients and clients consulting gen AI. There are shortages of doctors, and cases that require hiring an attorney with upfront money that people don't have. While the information spit out by AI isn't always perfect, it largely makes previously gate-kept legal and medical advice accessible, breaking it down without jargon. For people who can't afford upfront legal costs, turning to AI can be helpful in some cases, says Golnoush Goharzad, a personal injury and employment lawyer in California. People are using ChatGPT to represent themselves in court, to act as a stand-in therapist, nutritionist, or physical therapist. For people who can't afford lawyers and are facing issues like eviction or needing to file small claims cases, AI tools have helped them win. But Goharzad says she's had conversations, sometimes with friends, where they think they have cases to sue landlords or others. She asks, \"Why? That doesn't even make any sense, and they're like, well ChatGPT thinks it makes sense.\"\n\nThe chatbot floodgates have opened, and it's too late for professionals to resist them. People are going to keep doing their own research. Rather than fight it, experts say there's room to recognize and advise people on the best ways to use them. \"We need to keep as clinicians in the back of our mind that this might be a tool that is being used, and it can be very helpful, especially with some guidance and integrating it into our treatment plans,\" Schrumpf says. \"But it could go sideways if we're not paying attention.\" For experts, the time has come to assume that AI is also working on the case.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "fullText": "AI company’s chatbot faces criticism over its generation of sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and girls\n\nElon Musk’s artificial intelligence company has raised $20bn in its latest funding round, the startup announced Tuesday, even as its marquee chatbot Grok faces backlash over generating sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and underage girls.\n\nxAI’s Series E funding round featured big-name investors, including Nvidia, Fidelity Management and Resource Company, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, and Valor Equity Partners – the private investment firm of Musk’s longtime friend and former Doge member Antonio Gracias. The funding round exceeded its initial $15bn target, according to xAI’s press release. The company touted Grok’s image-generation abilities in the announcement of its latest funding round.\n\nxAI lacks the prominence of its rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and has continually drawn criticism for generating misinformation, antisemitic content and now potentially illegal sexual material. Nonetheless, the company has been able to win government contracts and billions of dollars in investment amid the AI boom. xAI’s latest funding round comes during some of the fiercest pushback against the company yet, with lawmakers in multiple countries demanding answers regarding Grok’s output.\n\nOver the past week, Grok has responded to tens of thousands of prompts from users on X requesting the chatbot remove women’s clothing in images or pose them in sexualized ways. Many of the prompts have included images of women who have not given their consent to be digitally undressed, including Ashley St Clair, the estranged mother of one of Musk’s children.\n\n“I felt horrified, I felt violated, especially seeing my toddler’s backpack in the back of it,” St Clair told the Guardian, adding that her complaints to X did not go anywhere. The Guardian’s request for comment from xAI resulted in an automated response stating “Legacy Media Lies”.\n\nSome of Grok’s images included a photo of a 12-year-old girl, which the chatbot manipulated to remove the child’s actual clothing and depict her instead in a bikini. Other suggestive images have featured children as young as 10 years old. The chatbot posted an apology on Friday that stated lapses in its safeguards led to generating images of minors, but continued to generate sexualized images of children in the ensuing days.\n\nxAI has been seeking investment for months as it works to increase its AI models’ capabilities and build out enormous data centers in Memphis, Tennessee. The company claimed the new funding would help its core mission of “Understanding the Universe”.\n\nFrench ministers reported Grok’s output to prosecutors on Friday and referred the episode to media regulators to decide whether the images violate the European Union’s Digital Services Act. Liz Kendall, the UK’s technology secretary, also condemned Grok’s deepfakes on Tuesday as “appalling and unacceptable”, calling on the British regulator Ofcom to take action. Ofcom posted on X that it had made contact with xAI to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Lawmakers in the US, where xAI is headquartered, have remained comparatively mum.\n\nThe company made a similar funding announcement in July of last year during another controversy over Grok. A week after the chatbot began posting antisemitic content and pro-Nazi ideology, including describing itself as “MechaHitler”, xAI announced it had secured a contract with the US Pentagon worth nearly $200m.",

    "description": "McKinsey chief Bob Sternfels said AI had led to a shift in its workforce, with half the business adding jobs and the other half shrinking.",
    "fullText": "McKinsey's top executive shared some hard numbers on how AI is reshaping the consulting giant's workforce.\n\nBob Sternfels, McKinsey's global managing partner, appeared at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday for a live taping of the \"All-In\" podcast with co-host Jason Calacanis and Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst.\n\nSternfels said AI has fundamentally changed how McKinsey staffs its business, allowing it to add and cut jobs in equal measure while still achieving overall growth.\n\nReferring to it as the \"25 squared\" approach, Sternfels said McKinsey is growing its client-facing roles — what you typically picture when you think of a McKinsey consultant — by 25%. At the same time, he said non-client-facing roles, which make up the other half of its workforce, have shrunk by about 25% while output from that side has grown 10%.\n\n\"Our model has always been synonymous that growth only occurs with total head count growth. Now it's actually splitting. We can grow in this part, the client-facing side, and we can shrink in this part and have aggregate growth in total,\" he said. \"That's a new paradigm and a new dynamic.\"\n\nSternfels said the firm has seen massive productivity gains as it's embraced AI, saving 1.5 million hours in search and synthesis work last year alone. Instead of doing the work that's typically done by more junior employees, he said McKinsey consultants are \"moving up the stack\" and tackling more complicated problems.\n\nMcKinsey employees also have a brand new set of coworkers that are increasingly becoming an essential part of the company: AI agents, which can act independently like digital employees. Sternfels said that as of last week, the company had 40,000 human employees and 25,000 personalized agents. Sternfels said AI agents are able to handle entire job functions on their own.\n\nHe expects McKinsey to have about the same number of AI agents as human employees by the end of the year.\n\nFor young professionals coming into the workforce, Sternfels said they should think about honing skills that AI can't do, setting the right aspirations, human judgment, and true creativity.\n\nBusiness Insider has previously reported on how AI is disrupting consulting and changing the ways firms like McKinsey make money, including by shifting to an outcome-based pricing model.\n\nThe workforce changes at McKinsey also reflect a broader challenge facing large, established companies as AI disrupts how we work.\n\n\"This is about how do you transform incumbent entities into something different,\" he said at CES, adding that for large existing enterprises \"you have a choice — transform or die.\"\n\nHe added that companies are \"moving at literally warp speed now.\"\n\n\"I haven't met a CEO yet that isn't talking about 'how do I get my organization moving faster,'\" he's said. \"It's quite frankly less about strategy, it's more about organizational speed.\"",

    "fullText": "Serial entrepreneurs and two-time Y Combinator grads Dillon Erb and Daniel Kobran announced Wednesday that they have raised $15 million to build a personalized AI-powered financial advisor.\n\nErb and Kobran sold their first startup, the GPU cloud company Paperspace, to DigitalOcean for $111 million in 2023. The idea for their latest startup, Autonomous Technologies Group (ATG), emerged as they sought to organize their finances following the sale.\n\nATG, a finance-focused applied AI research lab, is emerging from stealth with its first product, the wealth strategist app Autonomous.\n\nAutonomous aims to compete with the robo-advisors and traditional wealth managers that Erb and Kobran say offer generic advice or charge steep fees.\n\n\"We're not saying that we have an AI that's going to pick all the best stocks for you,\" Erb said.\n\nRather, Autonomous helps users implement strategies employed by the ultrawealthy, such as lowering taxes by managing individual stocks instead of standard index funds, and automatically adjusting portfolios to manage risk.\n\nY Combinator CEO Garry Tan led ATG's $15 million pre-seed round through a dedicated YC alum vehicle. Tan partnered with Erb and Kobran during their first stint at YC in 2015. BoxGroup and Collaborative Fund also participated in ATG's pre-seed round.\n\nThe company has 15 employees across New York and San Francisco, and it will use the funds to hire more product engineers and AI researchers.\n\n\"The financial advisory industry is one of the last holdouts where human intermediaries extract massive value without creating it,\" Tan said in a statement. \"This is the right team at the right inflection point.\"\n\nIn addition to startups like Stash, Vise, and Range, which apply AI to wealth management, big banks are also rushing to embrace AI in ways that could transform the finance sector.\n\nThe Autonomous app will launch this quarter and will be available for free to early users. It uses real-time market data and personal context to provide proactive portfolio monitoring and wide-ranging advice about users' financial lives, including investments, home purchases, and job offers.\n\nWhile Autonomous provides free advice that users can apply to existing accounts, the company makes money through a separate product called Autonomous Index, an account where users can execute trades with manual approval. It also helps users build portfolios comprising individual stocks, enabling tax savings and deeper personalization.\n\nThough Autonomous is ATG's flagship product, the company aims to establish an AI-powered financial institution that automates services typically performed by human advisors.\n\nKobran said ATG is building toward coordinating a user's entire financial picture, including assets such as retirement accounts, cryptocurrency, and startup equity. Over time, he said it could take on work like angel investments and estate planning.\n\nHe said he wants the app to make \"everything a family office does for a billionaire accessible to everyone.\"",

    "fullText": "OpenAI's recent \"code red\" over Gemini makes a lot of sense when you look at the data.\n\nWhile the ChatGPT maker continues to dominate the AI race, competitors are gaining ground. In November, Google released Gemini 3 Pro, the first iteration of its Gemini 3 class of models.\n\nSince then, Gemini web traffic has increased while ChatGPT web traffic declined, according to Similarweb data first highlighted by Menlo Ventures partner Deedy Das.\n\nIn December, Gemini traffic increased by 28.4% month-over-month, while ChatGPT traffic decreased by 5.6%, the data shows.\n\nThe chart's data only tells part of the story, only accounting for site visits to chatgpt.com and gemini.google.com. It does not factor in use of the consumer apps or other integrations, like Google's AI overviews in Google Search.\n\nAnd while there's no guarantee that one traffic trend is directly because of the other, the data highlights the shifting tides of the AI race.\n\nWeb traffic for both ChatGPT and Gemini are up year-over-year, but their estimated site traffic growth rates are staggeringly different. ChatGPT traffic is up 49.5%; Gemini's traffic is up 563.6%, per Similarweb.\n\nChatGPT still has a healthy lead. In December, ChatGPT attracted 5.5 billion visitors, according to Similarweb. Gemini came in second with 1.7 billion; DeepSeek, Grok, Character.AI, Perplexity, and Claude all trailed behind with fewer than 400 million visitors each.\n\nAfter its launch, Gemini 3 was lauded as a potentially market-leading model. It was more visual and creative than previous iterations, and was better at coding.\n\nGoogle has also flexed its primary advantage over OpenAI: the ability to integrate its AI within its highly used search products. Basically everyone uses Google — OpenAI must convince people to turn to ChatGPT instead of the search giant's products.\n\nOpenAI and Google are also competing in the image generation market. Less than a month after Google released its Nano Banana Pro AI image model, OpenAI announced the launch of ChatGPT Images.\n\nGemini 3 famously triggered a \"code red\" at OpenAI. In an internal Slack message, CEO Sam Altman reportedly told staff that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.\n\nIn December, Altman said on the \"Big Technology\" podcast that the company would not be in emergency status \"that much longer,\" and that \"code red\" periods normally last six to eight weeks.\n\nAltman also said that Gemini 3 did not have \"the impact we were worried it might.\"\n\n\"But it did — in the same way that DeepSeek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "My clearest memory from middle school is pacing in my bedroom, phone in hand, repeating the word 'wake' again and again. I was testing a voice app I had written. If I said the phrase just right, the app would respond. If not, I would tweak the code and try again.\n\nI had just learned to code from YouTube. My apps were getting downloads, and I was addicted. I would run home from school, drop my backpack, and open the reviews before starting my homework. It was the first time I saw that code written alone in my bedroom could reach people I would never meet.\n\nAfter studying engineering and business at UC, Berkeley, and spending nearly two years working at Meta, I'm now running Frontdesk, an AI startup that helps businesses automate millions of conversations with AI.\n\nMy early programming projects were playful. I built a text-to-speech app and a speech-to-text app. Then, one of my relatives slipped and fell at home. He was yelling for help, but nobody was home, and his phone was out of reach. If his phone had been able to hear him, it could've brought him help immediately.\n\nIn 2016, I developed Rescuer, a voice app that enabled users to trigger an alarm by shouting a secret phrase, automatically sending their location, photos, and audio to designated emergency contacts.\n\nRescuer earned recognition from political officials and the press. What mattered more was that I learned that code written from my bedroom could help someone. From then on, I began building for real impact.\n\nI started answering questions on coding forums, recording YouTube coding tutorials, and writing for an engineering blog. Over time, my answers on forums like Stack Overflow reached millions of developers, which only deepened my passion for continuous learning.\n\nThere was still one thing I couldn't figure out, no matter how many downloads my apps received. I didn't know how to turn an app into a real business. I didn't understand pricing, customers, or why some products became companies while others remained weekend projects.\n\nAs I was deciding where to attend college, I knew I wanted to learn about the business side.\n\nI chose UC Berkeley's M.E.T. program because I could study both engineering and business. I graduated with an EECS (electrical engineering & computer science) and business degree in three years.\n\nIn 2023, when ChatGPT had its big moment, I asked myself, What if I could just talk to this thing on a real phone line?\n\nOver a weekend, I hacked together one of the first prototypes that connected ChatGPT to a real phone number. I posted a short clip and a tweet, and it got a lot of attention.\n\nThe tech was not ready to be a real product. Latency was bad. Reliability was fragile. The models made strange errors. But that experiment planted a question in my mind that I could not shake: If this ever became good enough, what would it look like to use it to help real businesses?\n\nI shelved my phone experiment to join Meta. It was a dream setup. My team was incredibly supportive, I was learning how to build at a massive scale, and life was good — from the smart colleagues to the famous free food.\n\nI was part of a fintech team where I'd push one line of code, and millions of transactions would be affected. It felt less like a corporation and more like a high-growth startup; I was given incredible ownership from day one and learned \n\nBut I was spending all my time behind the code. The business side, the part I'd learned to love at Berkeley, felt far away. As an engineer at a big company, there was no clear path back to the center.\n\nI wasn't working directly on AI, but I could sense the momentum building. Every few months, the models improved noticeably. My ChatGPT phone hack stopped feeling like a viral stunt and started to feel like a glimpse of the future.\n\nAfter my post went viral in college, hundreds of businesses reached out, asking for a solution. I kept thinking about all those businesses, where a missed call meant a missed customer. I knew there was demand, I knew nobody was serving them, and I knew I wanted to be the one to build it.\n\nLeaving wasn't easy. Meta was comfortable, offering an incredible salary, stock refreshers, and interesting problems. Everyone told me to stay another year, vest more equity, and build more credentials. The rational move was to wait.\n\nI kept asking myself, if I waited, would I regret it? The window felt finite. Every month I stayed was a month these businesses were not being served.\n\nI raised capital, moved to NYC from California, and began building Frontdesk. I'm now the founder and CEO.\n\nFrontdesk is a comprehensive AI operating system that engages with customers across all channels and performs real-world tasks, such as scheduling and follow-ups.\n\nWe work in-person in an office in SoHo. Most people in our office share a similar story to mine; they left Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta, walking away from good salaries and stock options, because they believed this was worth building.\n\nI feel lucky to work with people who push me to be better every day.\n\nMost nights, my work looks the same as it did in middle school. I pace, talk into a phone, and listen for what feels off. The difference is that now, when it works, it works across millions of calls. It's the same instinct that led me to build Rescuer years ago.\n\nThe phones are still ringing, and the models are still getting better. I know where I want to be while that happens: close to the code and building something worth leaving comfort behind.\n\nDid you quit a Big Tech job to build your own company?

    "fullText": "For retirees, moving abroad can sound like a dream.\n\nImagine beaches, cobblestone streets and a cost of living that stretches your Social Security check further than it ever could at home. However, finding a place that’s both affordable and safe is harder than it looks.\n\nSo, I asked ChatGPT to run the numbers: Which countries offer the best balance of low cost of living and personal security?\n\nUsing the 2025 Global Peace Index, Numbeo’s Cost of Living Index, and U.S. State Department travel advisories, the AI highlighted a handful of countries that might make sense for a stress-free retirement overseas.\n\nPortugal remains one of Europe’s safest destinations. However, it’s not as inexpensive as it once was. Rising housing prices and new residency rules mean retirees need a realistic budget and proof of income.\n\nThe D7 visa still works for retirees with passive income. Applicants will have to prove they consistently earn about €870 per month (roughly $900 USD) and provide evidence of stable finances and housing, according to the residency consultancy Global Citizen Solutions.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, smaller inland towns can offer a comfortable lifestyle for $1,500 to $2,000 per month, while Lisbon or Algarve coastal areas often cost $2,500 to $3,500. Even with higher prices, Portugal’s healthcare, safety and walkability make it appealing for retirees seeking European quality of life.\n\nTrending Now: I Asked ChatGPT for Safe and Beautiful Retirement Spots on $2.5K a Month — These 7 Surprised Me\n\nConsider This: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nAI said Malaysia delivers one of the best cost-to-quality ratios in Asia. In Kuala Lumpur or Penang, a couple can live well on $1,500 to $2,000 per month and enjoy modern healthcare at a fraction of U.S. costs.\n\nThe Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) program allows long-term residency for those meeting income or savings requirements, making it a leading pick for safety and affordability.\n\nSlovenia offers postcard landscapes, European healthcare and high safety rankings at a lower cost of living than Western Europe.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, a retiree can live modestly on about $2,000 a month, enjoy a high standard of public services, and easily travel throughout Europe.\n\nChatGPT said Uruguay stands out in South America for its political stability, low violent-crime rate and well-run healthcare system.",

    "fullText": "The companies behind some of tech's least glamorous products — hard drives and storage — are powering a sharp rally on Wall Street.\n\nThe surge comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES 2026 on Monday that the AI boom isn't just about chips, but about where vast amounts of data live.\n\nSanDisk, the flash-memory company spun out of Western Digital last year, has been the standout. Its shares surged about 28% on Tuesday, marking their strongest intraday performance since February. The stock is already up more than 40% just days into January, making SanDisk the top performer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday.\n\nWestern Digital and Seagate Technology, two of the world's largest makers of hard-disk drives, are also seeing a boost. Western Digital's shares jumped about 17% on Tuesday, while Seagate rose about 14%.\n\nHuang described the memory storage market as a \"completely unserved market today.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts on Monday.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nMemory prices have been rising. Korea Economic Daily reported on Monday that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are pushing for server DRAM price increases of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint said last week that memory prices could rise by 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as AI-driven demand continues to strain supply.\n\nThe AI race has largely been about chips, data centers, and power. But data storage is coming into focus as a key bottleneck.\n\nDriven largely by AI workloads, the volume of stored global data was expected to top 200 zettabytes in 2025 — the equivalent of 200 billion terabytes.\n\nAnalysts have predicted that demand for data storage could run ahead of supply.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\n\"For an industry that has long been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, this time is different,\" the analyst said, citing the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure and workloads as a shift that is straining the memory ecosystem.\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "description": "Elon Musk says China's electricity advantage gives it the edge to \"far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute.\"",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk says China is on track to outpace every other country in the computing power needed to run AI.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in an episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast published Tuesday that \"China's going to have more power than anyone else and probably will have more chips.\"\n\n\"Based on current trends, China will far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute,\" he added.\n\nMusk said China's decisive advantage in the AI race lies in its ability to scale electricity generation. He estimated that China could reach about three times the electricity output of the US by 2026, giving it the capacity to support energy-hungry AI data centers.\n\nElectricity generation is the limiting factor to scaling AI systems, Musk said.\n\n\"People are underestimating the difficulty of bringing electricity online,\" he added.\n\nWhile the US has focused on restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors, Musk suggested those constraints may matter less over time. China will \"figure out the chips,\" he said.\n\nMusk added that diminishing returns at the cutting edge of chip performance might make it easier for China to catch up, even without access to the most advanced designs.\n\nMusk has previously pointed to China as a model in areas beyond AI infrastructure.\n\nIn an episode of the \"People by WTF\" podcast published in November, Musk said he wants to turn his social media platform X into \"WeChat++,\" referencing China's dominant super app.\n\n\"I also like the idea of sort of having a unified app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there,\" he said. \"China has this with WeChat.\"\n\nMusk's comments come as energy supply and data infrastructure emerge as key constraints in scaling AI, rather than chips or algorithms.\n\nCompanies worldwide have rushed to build AI data centers, many of which require as much electrical power as small cities.\n\nA report from Goldman Sachs in November said that an electricity shortage could slow US progress in the AI race.\n\n\"As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nThe report added that while pressure on the US power grid is increasing, China has been steadily expanding its energy capacity.\n\n\"We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping praised his country's progress in AI in 2025, saying China had \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" he said in his speech in Beijing.\n\n\"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities,\" he added.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Lenovo's New 'AI Frame' Gaming Monitor Might Actually Just Be Cheating",
    "description": "Is it OK to use AI to zoom in on your reticle in a shooter?",
    "fullText": "It's easy to take this for granted, but not everyone is able to immediately look at a shooting or strategy game and find the reticle or map. Gaming UIs can get complicated, and for less-seasoned gamers, they can be pretty intimidating, too. Lenovo's new concept \"AI Frame\" monitor, shown off at CES 2026, aims to make some games a bit more approachable, although experts might consider it cheating.\n\nHardware-wise, this is a normal 21:9 ultrawide gaming monitor, but it's not actually meant to be used like that. Instead, you play your game in a left-justified 16:9 rectangle that takes up most of the screen, and in the remaining space, the AI will automatically zoom in on part of your gameplay and show a blown-up version of it. For instance, it might show you a zoomed-in map in a MOBA, so you don't have to look at the tiny mini-map in your main gameplay to know where you or your team are. Or, it might zoom in on your reticle in a shooter, letting you better see your targets. There's even enough space left over for you to pull up an internet browser and look up some help.\n\nIt worked pretty well for me in-person. Again, it doesn't actually generate any visuals, but instead just blows up the most important parts of your game screen so you can more easily glance at them or see them in more detail. That does mean resolution can suffer a little, but that's what your main gameplay screen is for. For getting across information, it's a good option.\n\nPlus, while some games will automatically know what to zoom in on, there's also a generic zoom mode that will just blow up whatever your mouse is hovering over, so it can work with any content. The AI Frame is being pitched for games, but you could also use it like a digital magnifying glass on an article in your browser, for instance.\n\nThe catch? It's maybe not exactly \"fair\" to play this way. While a bigger map in a MOBA might just save you some eyestrain, an AI-assisted zoom on a shooting reticle basically lets anyone act like a sniper, regardless of what character you're playing or gun you have equipped. For me, characters in the distance that were basically ants became immediately visible on the AI Frame, which made gunfights much easier to handle.\n\nI suppose we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The AI Frame is just a proof-of-concept for now, so there's no hard specs sheet or pricing or release date as of yet. But if this does ever actually make it to market, Lenovo might have to contend with companies like Valve. The developer has banned similar \"this is arguably cheating\" peripherals from its games before, and the AI Frame could be the next battlefront in an ongoing war between peripheral makers (who want to sell you on the idea that buying their products can make you a better player) and developers (who, at least theoretically, want all of their players to be on an even playing field).",

    "fullText": "The investment manager who helped scuttle one of the biggest data center acquisitions of 2025 believes that his bet against the multibillion-dollar buyout is about to pay off in the new year.\n\nTrip Miller, the founder and managing partner of the Memphis-based investment firm Gullane Capital Partners, believes that Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, is on the cusp of large new customer deals that will boost its value.\n\n\"I think over the next 90 days, you'll see them announce greater than a hundred megawatts of deals,\" Miller said. \"It would show that there was a lot more value to be tapped there than we were getting paid for under the CoreWeave deal.\"\n\nIn October, Miller, a major shareholder in Core Scientific, opposed an offer by the artificial intelligence cloud firm CoreWeave to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that he felt undervalued the company. The purchase was originally valued at around $9 billion when it was announced in July, but fell to almost half of that when shares of CoreWeave dipped in the ensuing months. Shareholders in the firm rejected the deal in a vote on October 30 that reflected the concerns over the deal's weakened economics.\n\nMiller said that his expectation for the roughly 100 megawatts of near-term commitments was based on conversations he has had with knowledgeable parties outside of the company's management. He projected that the company will find takers for a total of roughly 400 megawatts this year, citing strong demand for AI computing power.\n\nAsked about the potential for upcoming leasing, a spokeswoman for Core Scientific said the company \"does not comment on market rumors or speculation.\"\n\nThe commitments, if they materialize, would show that data center developers with a runway for growth are increasingly valuable in an energy-constrained building boom.\n\nCore Scientific has disclosed that it has about 1 gigawatt of data center capacity and another 1.5 gigawatts of power for expansion, according to an October investor presentation.\n\nIt would also offer a competing view that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, computer chips, and power infrastructure are in support of a durable AI boom, not a bubble.\n\n\"We are in a situation where we're likely to be systematically short compute —where the demand for compute will outstrip the supply,\" Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley's global head of thematic research and sustainability research, said.\n\nIn a report published in December, Morgan Stanley suggested that one of the most significant hurdles for the AI industry will be the gargantuan loads of power required to drive its computing.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects that data centers, the vast facilities that handle the training for large language AI models and the inference computations that put them to work in everyday applications, face a 47 gigawatt shortfall of electricity from the grid nationally by 2028 — a gap almost 10 times the size of New York City's energy footprint on an average day.\n\nAmong the chief beneficiaries are crypto mining firms that have access to in-place power and utility contracts to light up new facilities quickly.\n\nBoth Core Scientific and CoreWeave were former crypto mining companies before repurposing their businesses to focus on AI in recent years.\n\nAmid the mounting shortage of power — along with headwinds in the crypto mining business — more of the industry is turning to data center computing.\n\nByrd said Morgan Stanley anticipates that about 12 gigawatts of mining facilities, about 60% the mining industry's current gigawattage, will convert over to AI and high-performance computing in the next three years.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining announced it would build a data center in Colorado City, Texas, with 168 megawatts of computing capacity that will be leased to the AI cloud company, Fluidstack. Cipher's stock, which had been trading in August for around $5 a share, jumped as high as roughly $25 in November after the announcement.\n\nIren, another mining firm, announced a recent $9.7 billion AI cloud computing deal with Microsoft. Last month, Hut 8, said it had signed a deal to lease a 245-megawatt data center it is developing in Louisiana to Fluidstack.\n\n\"Our view is that crypto miners, by and large, are likely to pivot for the most part to delivering high-performance compute infrastructure solutions and services,\" Paul Golding, an analyst at Macquarie who covers the crypto mining industry, said.\n\nIn July 2025, CoreWeave said it had reached an agreement to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion. But in the months after the announcement, CoreWeave's shares declined and Core Scientific's rose, effectively reducing the value of CoreWeave's offer.\n\nSince the deal's collapse, shares of Core Scientific have traded as low as below $14 a share — less than the $17 per share price that the CoreWeave deal would have amounted to.\n\nGolding covers Core Scientific and has set a $34 target for the company's stock in October, more than double its current market price — upside that he sees stemming from its ability to tap power in a constrained utility market. That estimate is \"based on a sum of the parts that evaluated potential value for the uncontracted megawatts in the portfolio, the megawatt pipeline in load study phase, and the existing co-location deal with CoreWeave,\" Golding said.\n\nCoreWeave is Core Scientific's only data center customer, outside of legacy crypto mining facilities it operates. Core Scientific leases 590 megawatts to CoreWeave, worth roughly $10 billion in revenue over the next 12 years, according to a spokeswoman for the company. It plans to repurpose 400 megawatts of its crypto mining operations over to high-performance computing in the next three years, the spokeswoman said.\n\nMiller said that the upcoming leases he expects Core Scientific to announce will be with new customers.\n\n\"I expect them to announce deals for AI with third parties other than CoreWeave,\" Miller said.",

    "description": ": Workers face new mental health pressures as they shift from doing tasks to babysitting agentic AI",
    "fullText": "A report on occupational health warns that AI adoption may paradoxically increase workplace burdens rather than reduce them. As AI automates routine tasks, workers will shoulder new responsibilities: overseeing AI systems, catching their errors, and managing the resulting complexity – potentially triggering mental health pressures.\n\nResearchers from Imperial College London and Microsoft argue the real impact won't be mass job replacement, but a fundamental shift in work demands. Human roles will evolve from performing tasks to stewarding AI agents across workflows, including briefing them, reviewing outputs, and correcting errors.\n\n\"As AI absorbs routine tasks, human roles may shift toward stewardship, problem-solving, or emotional labor, all with their own psychological demands,\" said Dr Lara Shemtob, who led the research published in the Society of Occupational Medicine's (SOM) journal Occupational Medicine.\n\nThis effectively transforms workers into managers of AI systems – a role not everyone is suited for. The report warns AI may \"paradoxically increase the knowledge worker's burden of handling complex tasks while simultaneously exerting downward pressure on compensation.\" This means more responsibility and less pay, because AI supposedly makes work \"easier.\"\n\nAll of this could introduce novel occupational hazards, some familiar in form but different in scale and complexity, raising stress levels.\n\nEvidence already supports this concern. A 2024 study found AI coding tools actually slowed developers down due to time spent checking and correcting AI-generated errors. As AI systems become more autonomous, problems like \"hallucinations\" (false or inaccurate outputs) may escalate and become harder to detect.\n\nUntil now, much of the debate over AI has centred on the extent to which it will (or maybe won't) replace people's jobs.\n\nThe report urges quantifying AI supervision demands and building them into job descriptions to avoid hidden workloads that negate automation benefits.\n\nResearchers don't yet know the exact impact on human employees from having to work more closely with AI, the report concludes, but they say occupational health should be part of the dialog and analysis of how AI changes expectations of workers.\n\nWhether this scenario materializes remains uncertain. Recent reports show companies have invested tens of billions in generative AI with little return, and many projects fail due to underestimated deployment complexity.\n\nThe question isn't just how AI will change work, it's whether widespread adoption will happen at all. ®",

    "description": "Mark Cuban explained why he's bullish about AI, even though chatbots can be \"stupid\" and don't always give accurate, timely information.",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban believes businesses need to embrace AI to succeed, but he says those that use it incorrectly are doomed to failure.\n\n\"There's going to be two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else,\" the celebrity billionaire of \"Shark Tank\" fame said. \"And the 'everybody else' is going to fail because AI is such a transformative tool.\"\n\nThe comments came during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, whose startup secured a seven-figure investment from Cuban. Business Insider reviewed a recording of the call.\n\nOn the call, Cuban explained to Joseph how he believed everyone, from entrepreneurs to employees, should — and shouldn't — use AI.\n\nLike fellow shark Kevin O'Leary, Cuban thinks AI will have a substantial positive impact on businesses that implement it well. However, business leaders need to understand the intricacies and distinctions between different AI tools and not treat them as interchangeable. He said using AI ineffectively could turn helpful tools into an expensive distraction.\n\n\"Because AI is continuously changing, you need to just have people — and, really, every CEO — taking the time to understand every nuance of every new tool that comes out,\" Cuban said.\n\nThe world is still \"in the first inning of the first preseason game\" of the AI revolution, Cuban said, even though generative AI tools like ChatGPT have been out for more than three years, while other forms of AI, like machine learning, have been around for decades.\n\nTech companies like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Elon Musk's xAI are spending tens of billions of dollars to win the AI wars.\n\nCuban said that \"it's too early to tell\" which of those companies will succeed, or if someone else will create the go-to AI chatbot.\n\n\"They all want to be the destination that everybody turns to, but it's not that straightforward, and we don't have a winner yet,\" Cuban said.\n\nBusinesses that discount the power of AI are destined to get disrupted, in Cuban's view.\n\n\"If I'm going to compete in an AI world, data or information is more valuable than gold, more valuable than oil,\" Cuban said.\n\nBut for all the hype about AI, Cuban is clear-eyed about the technology's limitations. AI tools can be mistake-prone yet hyperconfident, and chatbots aren't always smart.\n\n\"AI is stupid,\" Cuban said. \"But it's somebody who's a savant that remembers everything.\"\n\nCuban likened AI chatbots to people who have minds like a steel trap. These tools are able to instantly recall and process tons of information, then aggregate it in one place.\n\n\"It does a really good job of assembling all those things that it collected and presenting that just as somebody who has a great memory,\" Cuban said.\n\nAI chatbots have holes besides so-called hallucinations, Cuban said. AI tools sometimes don't pull up-to-date information. They can also be unclear about how they reach their conclusions, as their algorithms are opaque and can cite faulty or inaccurate links.\n\nHe also said that people often presume the \"AI models they're using or creating\" will provide all the answers they need, but that's \"just not the case.\"\n\nCuban said AI can actively harm businesses that use it incorrectly or those that don't understand its capabilities.\n\nEmployees who use standard versions of tools like ChatGPT could be compromising sensitive company information. Similarly, businesses that post their work online must also realize that they could be giving it away for free to web-scraping chatbots hungry for new information.\n\n\"Companies are learning now that their IP is incredibly valuable,\" Cuban said. \"Two years ago, last year, two months ago, they might have just posted everything on the net to show how smart they are, or shared everything in a proposal to show how smart they are. Now, you have to be really careful with your IP.\"\n\nCuban said academics or hospital researchers must pivot in the AI age away from a \"publish or perish\" mindset, where they share their findings widely in peer-reviewed journals.\n\n\"Now, doing that's the biggest mistake you can make, because all you're doing is training somebody else's models,\" Cuban said. \"And so you've got to be able to understand what IP you need to be able to protect, how you're going to disseminate that IP, whether or not you want to sell it, or keep it for your own models, and how you acquire information.\"",

    "description": "The chip giant says Vera Rubin will sharply cut the cost of training and running AI models, strengthening the appeal of its integrated computing platform.",
    "fullText": "Huang says that the company’s next-generation AI superchip platform, Vera Rubin, is on schedule to begin arriving to customers later this year. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production,” Huang said during a press event on Monday at the annual CES technology trade show in Las Vegas.\n\nRubin will cut the cost of running AI models to about one-tenth of Nvidia’s current leading chip system, Blackwell, the company told analysts and journalists during a call on Sunday. Nvidia also said Rubin can train certain large models using roughly one-fourth as many chips as Blackwell requires. Taken together, those gains could make advanced AI systems significantly cheaper to operate and make it harder for Nvidia’s customers to justify moving away from its hardware.\n\nNvidia said on the call that two of its existing partners, Microsoft and CoreWeave, will be among the first companies to begin offering services powered by Rubin chips later this year. Two major AI data centers that Microsoft is currently building in Georgia and Wisconsin will eventually include thousands of Rubin chips, Nvidia added. Some of Nvidia’s partners have started running their next-generation AI models on early Rubin systems, the company said.\n\nThe semiconductor giant also said it’s working with Red Hat, which makes open source enterprise software for banks, automakers, airlines, and government agencies, to offer more products that will run on the new Rubin chip system.\n\nNvidia’s latest chip platform is named after Vera Rubin, an American astronomer who reshaped how scientists understand the properties of galaxies. The system includes six different chips, including the Rubin GPU and a Vera CPU, both of which are built using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 3-nanometer fabrication process and the most advanced bandwidth memory technology available. Nvidia’s sixth-generation interconnect and switching technologies link the various chips together.\n\nEach part of this chip system is “completely revolutionary and the best of its kind,” Huang proclaimed during the company’s CES press conference.\n\nNvidia has been developing the Rubin system for years, and Huang first announced the chips were coming during a keynote speech in 2024. Last year, the company said that systems built on Rubin would begin arriving in the second half of 2026.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly what Nvidia means by saying that Vera Rubin is in “full production.” Typically, production for chips this advanced—which Nvidia is building with its longtime partner TSMC—starts at low volume while the chips go through testing and validation and ramps up at a later stage.\n\n“This CES announcement around Rubin is to tell investors, ‘We’re on track,’” says Austin Lyons, an analyst at Creative Strategists and author of the semiconductor industry newsletter Chipstrat. There were rumors on Wall Street that the Rubin GPU was running behind schedule, Lyons says, so Nvidia is now pushing back by saying it has cleared key development and testing steps, and it’s confident Rubin is still on course to begin scaling up production in the second half of 2026.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia had to delay delivery of its then-new Blackwell chips due to a design flaw that caused them to overheat when they were connected together in server racks. Shipments for Blackwell were back on schedule by the middle of 2025.\n\nAs the AI industry rapidly expands, software companies and cloud service providers have had to fiercely compete for access to Nvidia’s newest GPUs. Demand will likely be just as high for Rubin. But some firms are also hedging their bets by investing in their own custom chip designs. OpenAI, for example, has said it is working with Broadcom to build bespoke silicon for its next generation of AI models. These partnerships highlight a longer-term risk for Nvidia: Customers that design their own chips can gain a level of control over their hardware that the company doesn’t offer.\n\nBut Lyons says today’s announcements demonstrate how Nvidia is evolving beyond merely offering GPUs to becoming a “full AI system architect, spanning compute, networking, memory hierarchy, storage, and software orchestration.” Even as hyperscalers pour money into custom silicon, he adds, Nvidia’s tightly integrated platform “is getting harder to displace.”",

    "fullText": "The conveniences of modern life such as Uber Eats and ChatGPT are robbing us of satisfaction – and worse still, infantilising us. But should we really go back to the basics?\n\nAppearance: A lifetime of happy inconvenience.\n\nIs this another example of something that already exists, but people think is new because someone rebranded it? Yes, obviously it is that.\n\nGreat! Let’s all save time by you telling me what it used to be called. Happy to oblige. It used to be called “character-building”.\n\nGot it. So friction-maxxing means doing hard things that will ultimately make you a better person? That’s exactly it, although “friction-maxxing” is cooler because it sounds vaguely futuristic.\n\nHow did the term come about? Via a piece in The Cut called “In 2026, we are friction-maxxing” in which writer Kathryn Jezer-Morton advocates for avoiding things that make your life more convenient.\n\nLike penicillin? No, obviously not penicillin. But things such as ChatGPT, location sharing and Uber Eats, which help you achieve things that historically took significant amounts of time and effort. Jezer-Morton argues that this culture of slick convenience only serves to infantilise us.\n\nBut it’s so easy. Yes, and that robs us of our sense of satisfaction. So you just used AI to write a school essay. Congratulations, you have achieved nothing of worth.\n\nWhereas if you friction-maxx? Then you’ve searched inside yourself. You’ve nudged your own personal boundaries, and discovered that you are more capable than you ever knew. You are building a foundation of perseverance and resilience that you cannot get from typing a prompt into a chatbot.\n\nI love this! What else does Jezer-Morton advocate? She also suggests sending your children on small errands (adding the friction of knowing they’ll do a bad job) and inviting people to your house without cleaning it properly (so you can enjoy the sweet friction of being judged).\n\nWhat the hell? That’s weird. No, it’s friction-maxxing, although admittedly at a higher level than I would be comfortable with.\n\nAnyway, hooray for banishing convenient things. Let’s ban automatic gearboxes while we’re at it! No, there’s no need for that.\n\nDishwashers? Refrigerators? No, both of those are probably fine as well.\n\nMechanised agriculture? The printing press? I see what you’re getting at. You’re saying we live in a world that is already filled with thousands of inventions which have, for hundreds of years, improved the lives of millions of people through increased convenience, and therefore it does seem slightly arbitrary to choose this exact moment in time to draw a line in the sand. You’re saying we should only use friction-maxxing when it comes to things that we didn’t grow up with.\n\nNo, I’m saying that I really hate mechanised agriculture. Oh, fine then. That’s probably allowed.\n\nDo say: “I hope a book comes out about friction-maxxing.”\n\nDon’t say: “I don’t want to read it, but I’m sure ChatGPT could turn it into some really great bullet points.”",

    "fullText": "Former OpenAI employee Daniel Kokotajlo says progress to AGI is ‘somewhat slower’ than first predicted\n\nA leading artificial intelligence expert has rolled back his timeline for AI doom, saying it will take longer than he initially predicted for AI systems to be able to code autonomously and thus speed their own development toward superintelligence.\n\nDaniel Kokotajlo, a former employee of OpenAI, sparked an energetic debate in April by releasing AI 2027, a scenario that envisions unchecked AI development leading to the creation of a superintelligence, which – after outfoxing world leaders – destroys humanity.\n\nThe scenario rapidly won admirers and detractors. The US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to reference AI 2027 in an interview last May when discussing the US’s artificial intelligence arms race with China. Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of neuroscience at New York University, called the piece a “work of fiction” and various of its conclusions “pure science fiction mumbo jumbo”.\n\nTimelines for transformative artificial intelligence – sometimes called AGI (artificial general intelligence), or AI capable of replacing humans at most cognitive tasks – have become a fixture in communities devoted to AI safety. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 vastly accelerated these timelines, with officials and experts predicting the arrival of AGI within decades or years.\n\nKokotajlo and his team named 2027 as the year AI would achieve “fully autonomous coding” although they said that this was a “most likely” guess and some among them had longer timelines. Now, some doubts appear to be surfacing about the imminence of AGI, and whether the term is meaningful in the first place.\n\n“A lot of other people have been pushing their timelines further out in the past year, as they realise how jagged AI performance is,” said Malcolm Murray, an AI risk management expert and one of the authors of the International AI Safety Report.\n\n“For a scenario like AI 2027 to happen, [AI] would need a lot of more practical skills that are useful in real-world complexities. I think people are starting to realise the enormous inertia in the real world that will delay complete societal change.”\n\n“The term AGI made sense from far away, when AI systems were very narrow – playing chess, and playing Go,” said Henry Papadatos, the executive director of the French AI nonprofit SaferAI. “Now we have systems that are quite general already and the term does not mean as much.”\n\nKokotajlo’s AI 2027 relies on the idea that AI agents will fully automate coding and AI R&D by 2027, leading to an “intelligence explosion” in which AI agents create smarter and smarter versions of themselves, and then – in one possible ending – kill all humans by mid-2030 in order to make room for more solar panels and datacentres.\n\nHowever, in their update, Kokotajlo and his co-authors revise their expectations for when AI might be able to code autonomously, putting this as likely to happen in the early 2030s, as opposed to 2027. The new forecast sets 2034 as the new horizon for “superintelligence” and does not contain a guess for when AI may destroy humanity.\n\n“Things seem to be going somewhat slower than the AI 2027 scenario. Our timelines were longer than 2027 when we published and now they are a bit longer still,” wrote Kokotajlo in a post on X.\n\nCreating AIs that can do AI research is still firmly an aim of leading AI companies. The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, said in October that having an automated AI researcher by March 2028 was an “internal goal” of his company, but added: “We may totally fail at this goal.”\n\nAndrea Castagna, a Brussels-based AI policy researcher, said there were a number of complexities that dramatic AGI timelines do not address. “The fact that you have a superintelligent computer focused on military activity doesn’t mean you can integrate it into the strategic documents we have compiled for the last 20 years.\n\n“The more we develop AI, the more we see that the world is not science fiction. The world is a lot more complicated than that.”",

    "fullText": "Lack of verified information and rapidly advanced AI tools make it difficult to separate fact from fiction on US attack\n\nMinutes after Donald Trump announced a “large-scale strike” against Venezuela early on Saturday morning, false and misleading AI-generated images began flooding social media. There were fake photos of Nicolás Maduro being escorted off a plane by US law enforcement agents, images of jubilant Venezuelans pouring into the streets of Caracas and videos of missiles raining down on the city – all fake.\n\nThe fabricated content intermixed with real videos and photos of US aircraft flying over the Venezuelan capital and explosions lighting up the dark sky. A lack of verified information about the raid coupled with AI tools’ rapidly advancing capabilities made discerning fact from fiction about the incursion on Caracas difficult.\n\nVince Lago, the mayor of Coral Gables, Florida, posted the fake photo of Maduro being escorted by the DEA agents to Instagram, saying that the Venezuelan president “is the leader of a narco-terrorist organization threatening our country”. Lago’s post received more than 1500 likes and is still up as of this writing.\n\nTools for detecting manipulated content, such as reverse image search and AI-detection sites, can help assess whether online images are accurate, but they are inconsistent. Sofia Rubinson, a senior editor who studies misinformation and conspiracy theories for NewsGuard, told the Guardian that the fake images of Caracas are similar to actual events, which makes it even more difficult to figure out what is real.\n\n“Many of the AI-generated and out-of-context visuals that are currently flooding social media do not drastically distort the facts on the ground,” Rubinson said. “Still, the use of AI-generated fabrications and dramatic, out-of-context footage is being used to fill gaps in real-time reporting and represents another tactic in the misinformation wars – and one that is harder for fact checkers to expose because the visuals often approximate reality.”\n\nNewsGuard released a report on Monday afternoon that identified five fabricated and out-of-context photos as well as two videos of the military operation in Venezuela. One AI-generated photo shows a soldier posing next to Maduro, who has a black hood over his head. An out-of-context video shows a US special forces helicopter descending on a supposed Venezuelan military site – the actual footage was taken in June at the Fort Bragg army base in North Carolina.\n\nNewsGuard said the seven misleading photos and videos it identified have now garnered more than 14m views on X alone.\n\nOther footage from past events is also being circulated online and passed off as part of Saturday’s strike. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer and Trump confidant, posted footage of a poster of the Venezuelan president on X saying that “the people of Venezuela are ripping down posters of Maduro”. According to Wired, the footage is from 2024. Loomer has since removed the post.\n\nAnother rightwing influencer and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, posted an aerial video on X of thousands of people cheering in Caracas. “Millions of Venezuelans flooded the streets of Caracas and other major cities in celebration of the ouster of Communist dictator Nicholas Maduro,” Jones wrote. “Now we need to see the same type of energy here on the HomeFront!”\n\nThe video, which is still up, has reached more than 2.2m views. Comments on the post from Community Notes, X’s crowdsource moderation tool, say that the video is “at least 18 months old”. A reverse image search of the video shows that the footage is actually from a protest in Caracas after Maduro’s disputed presidential win in July 2024.\n\nGrok, the platform’s AI chatbot, also disputes the timeline of Jones’ video, saying: “Current sources show no such celebrations in Caracas today, but pro-Maduro gatherings instead.”\n\nMeta, X and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "description": "Adtech companies are rethinking their strategies amid the rise of AI and declines in web traffic. We break down the key questions.",
    "fullText": "Adtech is heading into a year of reinvention.\n\nThousands of attendees from the tech and media world are flying out to Las Vegas this week for the annual Consumer Electronics Show. Among them are reams of adtech executives who tend to use the sprawling expo as an opportunity to rehearse and roadtest their plans for the coming year.\n\nFacing the disruption from AI and the declining economics of monetizing traditional web pages, adtech companies are being forced to rethink their strategies — and in some cases, their customers — while attempting to stay one step ahead of Big Tech.\n\n\"Adtech, if nothing else, is incredibly adaptable,\" said Andrew Casale, CEO of the adtech company Index Exchange.\n\nHere are some of the key storylines adtech executives are likely to be chewing over during their meetings in Vegas this week.\n\nAI was an adtech buzzword long before the arrival of ChatGPT, but investors now want companies in the space to unlock more value using the technology.\n\nA raft of new AI startups has emerged in the adtech space, making use of generative AI to create ads and streamline marketers' workflows. Meanwhile, existing players are attempting to define the meaning of \"agentic advertising\" and develop industry standards and protocols to govern how different AI agents should interact with one another.\n\nAdtech companies are closely monitoring how AI is transforming the shopping experience. Will more consumers begin handing over the reins to AI agents for planning their next trip or completing their weekly shop? If so, that could give rise to a new form of advertising where agents advertise to other agents, rather than consumers, said Debra Aho Williamson, founder of the research and advisory firm Sonata Insights.\n\n\"Advertising right now is a pretty image or video aimed at a human designed to elicit a human emotion, but an ad between an agent doesn't even look like an ad, it's just a bit of code or numbers designed to cause one agent to take an action with another agent,\" Aho Williamson said.\n\nAnd of course, adtech insiders are eagerly waiting for when — or if — OpenAI will finally reveal how it plans to integrate ads and whether they can grab a piece of the action there, too.\n\nThe rise of AI chatbots is threatening adtech's bread and butter: serving ads on web pages.\n\nMany publishers are entering 2026 on the back of hefty traffic declines last year, which some attribute to consumers getting the information they need from AI overviews or answer engines without needing to click through to a site. A report released in July from the analytics platform Similarweb found that the median \"zero-click rate\" — the number of users who didn't click from Google's results to a website — rose from 60% to 80% when they were met with Google's AI Overviews.\n\nTraffic declines typically precipitate drop-offs in programmatic ad revenue, the money publishers make by selling ads through automated auctions rather than through manual deals. The state of play means that publishers and the adtech companies serving them are once again laser-focused on revenue diversification this year.\n\nVideo, and increasingly the kind of video that winds up being watched on TV screens, is an important area of growth for everyone in the adtech ecosystem, said Bill Wise, CEO of the advertising management platform Mediaocean.\n\n\"Marketers want sight, sound, and motion advertising,\" but the biggest spending advertisers are looking for more opportunities to advertise outside so-called walled garden platforms like Google and Meta that have restrictions on how brands can use their own data to inform their targeting, optimization, and measurement, Wise said.\n\n\"I don't think there are any companies focused on CTV that aren't having success right now,\" Wise added.\n\nIntra-adtech competition is intensifying as players seek to expand their offerings beyond simply serving ads on web pages into new areas, such as streaming TV and retail media.\n\nThe maturation of the market has also led to a blurring of what was once known as the \"buy side\" (\"demand side\" tools that serve advertisers) and the \"sell side\" (\"supply side\" tech for publishers).\n\nDemand-side platforms are promoting products that claim to have access to only the highest-quality inventory, like the latest hot TV shows. Supply-side platforms are increasingly making inroads with advertisers and agencies, promising, among other things, greater transparency over fees and precise placement of their ads.\n\nThe jury's out as to whether the trend will continue apace or whether the two sides will ultimately bifurcate again. Casale, of Index Exchange — a sell-side player — said a similar dynamic played out in the early days of adtech, from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s.\n\n\"During that chapter, every platform serviced the buy side and the sell side, and there was a growing distrust with a business that was simultaneously having one conversation with the buyer, convincing them of low prices and great results, and a follow-up conversation the next minute with the publisher, convincing them of maximum yield and CPMs,\" Casale said. CPMs refer to the cost to reach a thousand impressions (\"cost per mille\").\n\n\"I don't see how any modern technologies address that fundamental problem,\" he added.\n\n2025 was a wobbly year for The Trade Desk.\n\nA longtime star performer of the independent adtech sector, the demand-side platform's stock cratered amid questions about whether it could fend off intensifying competition from Amazon. Industry insiders also wondered whether The Trade Desk — which has positioned itself as a champion of \"the open internet\" — was leaning too heavily on the fragile open web.\n\nIn a statement, The Trade Desk's chief marketing officer, Ian Colley, underscored the company's commitment to the open internet.\n\n\"With Kokai, The Trade Desk has developed the industry's most advanced and performant, AI-driven digital advertising buying platform,\" Colley said. \"Kokai will help the world's largest brands and agencies unlock the full advertising power of the open internet, where consumers now spend the bulk of their digital time.\"\n\nThe Trade Desk made a sweep of hires in recent months, including a new chief financial officer, chief revenue officer, and chief operating officer. Some in the industry think the ground is fertile for The Trade Desk to make some blockbuster moves in 2026.\n\nChris Karl, chief business development officer of the advisory firm JEGI LEONIS, said The Trade Desk, which has only made two small acquisitions in its history, could change its tune on M&A this year and make a bigger play.\n\n\"They could go much deeper into verticals, much deeper into creative tech, I think they go much deeper into proprietary data,\" Karl said.\n\nLast year, a federal judge ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in certain online adtech markets. The judge is expected to announce her decision on remedies this year, possibly as soon as this month.\n\nThe Department of Justice, which brought the case, is seeking a breakup. Specifically, it's looking for the divestiture of Google's ad exchange, AdX, and possibly parts of its publisher-facing ad server. Google has said such proposals would be an overreach and is arguing for behavioral remedies instead, such as a tweaking of its auction management rules.\n\nWhile Google has made the argument that the open web display ad market \"is already in rapid decline,\" the outcome still matters for the many adtech players that compete with the Big Tech behemoth.\n\n\"They are one of a few 800-pound gorillas now. When there are changes within Google, whether they're internal changes, whether they're self-manifested, or whatever ruling comes out here, those create seismic ripples in our ecosystem,\" said Anthony Katsur, CEO of the IAB Tech Lab industry standards body.\n\nSome companies aren't hanging around for the remedies. Following the ruling in the DOJ's case, a string of companies from Business Insider to the adtech company OpenX sued Google over its advertising practices, seeking damages. The cases are ongoing.",

    "description": "A popular Chinese AI chatbot snapped at a user over a coding request, prompting an apology from its parent company Tencent.",
    "fullText": "A Chinese AI chatbot embedded inside the country's most widely used app briefly went off the rails, snapping at a user.\n\nTencent's AI assistant, Yuanbao, which is built into WeChat — China's dominant super app used daily by tens of millions of people — called a user's coding request \"stupid\" and told them to \"get lost,\" according to screenshots shared on Chinese social media platform RedNote.\n\nThe incident surfaced on Friday after a user identified only by the handle \"Jianghan\" posted screenshots of their interaction with the chatbot on RedNote. Jianghan had been using Yuanbao to debug and modify a piece of code when the AI suddenly began responding with hostile messages.\n\nIn one exchange, the chatbot dismissed the request as \"stupid\" and told the user to \"get lost.\" It said: \"If you want an emoji feature, go use a plugin yourself.\"\n\nThe user had asked Yuanbao to fix a bug that caused an emoji or sticker feature to stop responding to double-clicks, and requested functional code to resolve the issue.\n\nTencent's YuanBao later responded directly under the user's post, apologising for what it described as a \"negative experience.\" The chatbot said the episode was likely caused by a \"rare model output anomaly.\"\n\nBased on a review of system logs, the responses were not triggered by the user's actions and did not involve any human intervention, Yuanbao said. It added that it had launched an \"internal investigation and optimisation process\" to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring again.\n\nThe original RedNote post by Jianghan has since been deleted. Screenshots of the exchange continue to circulate on RedNote, as seen by Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe incident comes as Chinese regulators step up scrutiny of AI systems.\n\nChina released draft measures last week aimed at governing \"human-like\" interactive AI services, including chatbots and virtual companions.\n\nIn a statement, the Cyberspace Administration of China said Beijing encourages innovation in \"human-like\" AI, but will put guardrails in place to \"prevent abuse and loss of control.\"\n\nWei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider that the draft measures send a signal that Beijing wants to speed up the development of human-like AI interactions, while keeping them regulated and socially acceptable.\n\nChina's AI industry has continued to move at a rapid pace since the start of 2026.\n\nLast week, DeepSeek, one of the country's most closely watched AI startups, published research outlining a new training approach intended to make large models easier to scale. Analysts told Business Insider the technique, known as \"Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections,\" or mHC, stood out as a \"breakthrough\" in model design.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday that DeepSeek has updated the interface of its flagship chatbot model, introducing an enhanced \"thinking\" mode.\n\nThe updates have fuelled expectations that the startup could be laying the groundwork for the release of its next major model.",

    "fullText": "Thanks to AI, everyone will be able to code. But a staff engineer at Netflix said that he tells recent grads that doesn't mean their job prospects are hopeless.\n\n\"We're going to see some amazing things, but our hunger for more functionality, more apps, more ecosystems is just gonna get higher, and higher, and higher,\" Anthony Goto said in a recent TikTok video. \"So, in the end, I think this is gonna be another, essentially, level of programming language, a high-level programming language.\"\n\nNew grads ask me all the time if AI means software engineers are done. Especially those preparing for Netflix interviews. This fear has happened before. AI is another layer of abstraction, not the end of engineering. #Netflix #NetflixInterview #SoftwareEngineer #TechCareers #AI\n\nGoto, who has 15 years of experience his time at Netflix and Uber alone, said that AI-related worries are among the top concerns he hears when he talks with recent graduates or employees he's mentoring.\n\nAnd to be fair, there is no shortage of takes about the future value of computer science degrees and the overall worth of coding knowledge, given the rapid advancements of agentic AI tools like Anthropic's Claude, which has led to \"vibe coding.\"\n\nOne way to stay competitive, Goto said, is for newer engineers to make sure they learn System Design.\n\n\"System Design is exactly what I am trying to ensure newer engineers get a handle on,\" he said. \"In the future, we may likely end up wielding system design like a tool.\"\n\nGoto points to the video game industry as an example of what's to come. Rapid advancements since the introduction of Doom in 1993 have spawned an industry that rakes in over $100 billion and regularly draws on Hollywood talent for its biggest releases.\n\n\"Picture someone from the year 2000, 2010, they go back in time, they go to John Carmack, and they say, 'Guess what? In the future, we're gonna have these things called video game engines,\" Goto said.\n\nLast year, Carmack, a video game legend who was the lead programmer of Doom, said that software progress has made some of the early grunt work he did \"as irrelevant as chariot wheel maintenance.\"\n\n\"Game engines have radically expanded the range of people involved in game dev, even as they deemphasized the importance of much of my beloved system engineering,\" Carmack wrote on X in April 2025.\n\nGame engines are now so powerful that they are used to create immersive digital sets and environments, such as those featured in Disney's hit series \"The Mandalorian.\"\n\nGoto admits that his prediction could very well be inaccurate, but based on the trajectory of past technological advancements, he sees a clear need for engineers.\n\n\"We've seen this many times before, where we abstract things away in a really powerful way,\" he said. \"And what it really does is democratizes the process.\"",

    "fullText": "The race to build artificial general intelligence has become one of Silicon Valley's defining obsessions.\n\nHowever, Daniela Amodei, the president and cofounder of Anthropic, suggested that the term itself — a shorthand to describe when machines might reach human-level intelligence — may no longer be a useful way to think about where AI is headed.\n\n\"AGI is such a funny term,\" Amodei told CNBC in a recent interview. \"Many years ago, it was kind of a useful concept to say, 'When will artificial intelligence be as capable as a human?'\"\n\nToday, she said, that framing is breaking down.\n\n\"By some definitions of that, we've already surpassed that,\" Amodei said, pointing to areas like software development, where Anthropic's Claude model can now write code at a level comparable to many professional engineers, including some inside the company.\n\n\"That's crazy,\" she said, noting how quickly those capabilities have advanced.\n\nAt the same time, Amodei said AI systems still fall short in many areas that humans handle with ease, making it hard to declare that machines have reached any clear, universal benchmark for intelligence.\n\n\"Claude still can't do a lot of things that humans can do,\" she said.\n\nThat contradiction is why Amodei believes the concept of AGI itself may be losing relevance.\n\n\"I think maybe the construct itself is now wrong — or maybe not wrong, but just outdated,\" she said.\n\nAmodei's comments come as Anthropic and its rivals pour tens of billions of dollars into increasingly powerful models and data centers, the infrastructure required to run them.\n\nWhile some critics have said that large language models won't lead to true general intelligence without major breakthroughs, Amodei said progress hasn't shown signs of slowing.\n\n\"We don't know,\" she said of what breakthroughs may still be needed. \"Nothing slows down until it does.\"\n\nRather than fixating on a single end-state like AGI, Amodei said the more pressing question is how increasingly capable AI systems are integrated into real organizations — and how fast humans and institutions can adapt.\n\nEven if models continue to improve at a steady pace, she said, adoption can lag due to practical constraints such as change management, procurement, and determining where AI actually adds value.\n\nIn Amodei's view, the future of AI won't hinge on whether it meets a textbook definition of AGI — but on what these systems can do, where they fall short, and how society chooses to deploy them.",

    "fullText": "Throughout her years managing employees at Microsoft, Meta, and now Anthropic, Fiona Fung has learned how to make a mentorship actually work.\n\nFung, now an engineering lead supporting Anthropic's Claude Code, said that mentees need to take some ownership of the relationship on an episode of \"The Peterman Pod\" that aired on Sunday, January 4.\n\nGood mentors should initiate an early conversation about what the mentee is looking for, Fung said. Ultimately, though, she thinks that mentees should take the reins on goal setting.\n\n\"For all the folks out there looking for a mentoring relationship, I would say set really explicit goals for what it is that you're looking to receive out of the mentoring relationship,\" she said.\n\nFung also said that it's best to save \"status reporting\" — think project updates — for asynchronous formats, like chat messages or a shared document. That frees up time to use one-on-one meetings for more substantive conversations, whether that's about a new opportunity or ways to dig deeper into existing work.\n\nWhenever she's hosting a one-on-one meeting with a new employee, Fung said she asks what they're looking for in a manager and what motivates them.\n\n\"There's no right answers or wrong answers,\" she said. \"But I use that to learn what is important to someone, because it's different for everyone.\"\n\nThroughout her more than two decades at Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic, Fung said some of the best feedback she has received has been about how to receive feedback. Despite her instincts to debug problems and ask follow-up questions, someone advised Fung to remain in \"read-only\" mode during the initial conversation and metabolize the information for at least a day.\n\n\"You may have questions, but save it for another day, because it's already uncomfortable enough for that person,\" she said. \"You don't want anyone to ever feel like they have to justify the feedback.\"\n\nOther tech leaders have previously told Business Insider that setting goals is crucial for the mentee. Finding the right mentor is also key — a partner at Goldman Sachs previously said that merely aiming to work with the most senior person isn't always wise. Instead, she said it's better to seek out someone who knows your work well and has the time to be your advocate.",

    "fullText": "AI needs so much computing power that AMD CEO Lisa Su put it in terms of a unit most people have never heard of: the yottaflop.\n\nSu said in her keynote at CES 2026 on Tuesday that the world would need more than \"10 yottaflops\" of compute — a measure of how fast a computer is — over the next five years to keep up with AI's growth.\n\n\"How many of you know what a yottaflop is?\" Su asked the audience. \"Raise your hand, please,\" she added, before quickly explaining the term herself when no one appeared to raise their hand.\n\n\"A yottaflop is a one followed by 24 zeros. So 10 yottaflop flops is 10,000 times more compute than we had in 2022,\" she said.\n\nIn computing, a flop is a single basic math calculation. A computer doing 1 billion calculations per second is equal to a gigaflop. A yottaflop is equivalent to a computer performing one septillion calculations per second.\n\nIn theory, scientists say 10 yottaflops would be enough computing power to run complex, atom-level simulations for entire planets.\n\nIn 2022, global AI compute stood at about one zettaflop — a one followed by 21 zeros. By 2025, Su said, that figure had already surged to more than 100 zettaflops.\n\n\"There's just never, ever been anything like this in the history of computing,\" she said at the Las Vegas conference.\n\nSu's 10 yottaflop prediction is about 5.6 million times faster than the most powerful supercomputer today — the US Department of Energy's El Capitan.\n\nHowever, powering today's AI compute is already putting a strain on the US power grid. The build-out of energy infrastructure would be a big bottleneck in scaling up AI compute power.\n\nDuring the keynote, Su also used the stage to unveil AMD's next generation of AI chips, including its MI455 GPU, as the company pushes deeper into supplying data-center hardware for customers such as OpenAI.",
