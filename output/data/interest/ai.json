    "fullText": "In a new viral AI video, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise pummel each other on a rooftop in a cinematic action sequence.\n\nIt's not a trailer for a new blockbuster, and it's not actually Pitt and Cruise, though it looks a lot like them. The video is so realistic, in fact, that the clearest sign it's made with AI is the dialogue.\n\n\"You killed Jeffrey Epstein, you animal! He was a good man!\" Pitt says as he punches Cruise.\n\n\"He knew too much…\" Cruise replies.\n\nYou can see why Hollywood's most prominent trade organization is not happy about it.\n\nThe scene was created using Seedance 2.0, a new AI video-generation model released Thursday by ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok.\n\nThe tool and the hyper-realistic videos of Hollywood actors and characters that users are creating with it have gone viral in China and are now catching the attention of Americans.\n\nJeffrey Epstein knew too much pic.twitter.com/12u8PQH9nt\n\n\"It's happening fast,\" Elon Musk said in response to a video generated using Seedance and posted to X, a reference to the speed at which artificial intelligence is advancing.\n\n\"We're cooked,\" another X user said.\n\nThe reaction from Americans is reminiscent of the buzz around DeepSeek, a Chinese company that unveiled an AI reasoning model in January last year that rivaled OpenAI's ChatGPT and other top models, stunning the biggest names in Silicon Valley and ratcheting up the competition between the United States and China in the race to dominate AI innovation.\n\nSeedance 2.0 is another shot across the bow of American AI companies. Its multimodal capabilities span text, image, audio, and video inputs and give creators control over metrics such as lighting, shadows, and camera movement.\n\nIn another viral scene, a deepfake version of Walter White — of Breaking Bad fame — points directly at the viewer and says, \"You think you're in control.\" It's a line that feels less like dialogue and more like a taunt.\n\nSeedance 2.0 is absolutely insane. Done with @chatcutapp pic.twitter.com/xk8xcBw6da\n\nThe uncanny representations of Hollywood actors, as well as characters from the Avengers and other major movie franchises, immediately raised copyright concerns.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association, the trade group representing major Hollywood studios and streaming services, released a statement on Thursday accusing ByteDance of infringement on a \"massive scale\" in a \"single day.\"\n\n\"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity,\" Charlie Rivkin, the chairman and CEO of the MPA, said in a statement.\n\nOpenAI's AI video generation tool, Sora, which can also create AI versions of actors and characters, has also raised copyright issues.\n\nLike with so many of AI's latest tools, however, it can be hard to put the genie back in the bottle.",

    "fullText": "Thinking about using ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity to collect your thoughts for an email to your lawyers? Don't assume your chat will stay confidential.\n\nA federal judge ruled on Tuesday that prosecutors could access Claude chat transcripts generated by Brad Heppner, a finance startup founder accused of defrauding a company out of $150 million.\n\nThe chats occurred after Heppner received a subpoena, hired lawyers, and learned that he was a target of prosecutors, his lawyer said in court.\n\nHeppner, who helped start the finance firm Beneficient, was arrested last year and charged with wire and securities fraud for conduct that allegedly led to the downfall of GWG Holdings.\n\nInvestigators seized \"dozens of electronic devices\" when they arrested Heppner at his Dallas mansion, prosecutors said, and Heppner's lawyers have insisted that 31 chats with Anthropic's Claude bot on those devices are privileged.\n\n\"Mr. Heppner — using an AI tool — prepared reports that outlined defense strategy, that outlined what he might argue with respect to the facts and the law that we anticipated that the government might be charging,\" his lawyer said.\n\n\"The purpose of his preparing these reports was to share them with us so that he could discuss defense strategy with us.\"\n\nEven though Heppner had privileged conversations with his lawyers, Judge Jed Rakoff said he \"disclosed it to a third-party, in effect, AI, which had an express provision that what was submitted was not confidential,\" according to a transcript of the hearing.\n\nThe government noted that Claude's privacy policy specified that chats could be disclosed. Prosecutors also said that the chats couldn't be protected by the \"work product privilege,\" which can guard materials prepared at a lawyer's direction, because Heppner's lawyers didn't ask him to use Claude.\n\nThe decision has lawyers buzzing.\n\n\"My gut reaction is that the decision is directionally correct,\" Moish Peltz, an attorney whose post about the decision ricocheted around X, told Business Insider. \"There's a lot of materials that should be kept as privileged that people are putting into AI.\"\n\nThe proliferation of chatbots where people are inputting sensitive legal information, another wrote, has created \"a discovery nightmare.\"\n\nNoah Bunzl, an employment lawyer, told Business Insider that people might find it \"somewhat shocking\" that their legal confidences could be lost by sharing them with a chatbot.\n\nThe case isn't the first where an executive's use of a chatbot was the subject of legal debate.\n\nIn November, PC Gamer reported on a dispute involving the acquisition of a video-game company, where a company official's use of ChatGPT to try to avoid paying an earn-out was mentioned in court records.\n\nAnd after The New York Times sued OpenAI for allegedly violating its news article copyrights, a judge required OpenAI to retain millions of chat logs to potentially review them for copyright infringement.\n\nBunzl said he has noticed that in civil discovery, lawyers are increasingly asking for their adversary's AI chats. It's \"a whole other world of discoverable information,\" he said.\n\nStill, attorneys at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, who analyzed the Heppner decision, said it was the first they were aware of where someone's use of an AI tool may have resulted in \"a loss of privilege\" over privileged material. They said courts may view businesses' use of purpose-built AI tools differently.\n\nArlo Devlin-Brown, a white-collar defense lawyer, told Business Insider he thought AI models could potentially improve attorney-client information. But given the ambiguity in the law, people have to be vigilant.\n\n\"Until the law has been clarified, lawyers should caution their clients that inputting otherwise privileged information into an AI tool could risk exposure in litigation,\" he said in an email.\n\nRepresentatives for the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and Anthropic, and lawyers for Heppner, didn't immediately reply to requests for comment.",

    "description": "The nature of the dispute with the Department of Defense, including what Scale AI is seeking, is unclear.",
    "fullText": "Meta-backed artificial intelligence training company Scale AI is suing the Department of Defense.\n\nThe nature of the dispute, including what Scale is seeking, is unclear. Most of the documents, including the complaint, were filed on January 30 and are sealed. The lawsuit has not previously been reported.\n\nCase documents are expected to include classified information at the \"secret/no foreign\" level, according to one of the few unsealed documents.\n\nThe US is the only named defendant. Another AI company, Enabled Intelligence, joined as an intervenor defendant — a third party that voluntarily joins a suit to protect their interests.\n\nIn the fall, Scale lost a bid for a contract worth up to $708 million from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, part of the DoD, to Enabled Intelligence. The contract, which could last up to seven years, was the agency's largest data-training agreement yet. It includes work with the Pentagon's signature AI effort, Maven.\n\nIn late December, Scale filed a bid protest with the Government Accountability Office against the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Scale's bid protest was dismissed in late January, two days before the company sued in the Court of Federal Claims. The GAO does not typically publish information on routine protest dismissals.\n\nIn 2024, Scale won a $24 million, one-year contract from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to work on data labeling for Maven.\n\nA Scale spokesperson declined to comment on the DoD lawsuit, saying it \"relates to a recent procurement decision.\"\n\n\"Scale AI stands firmly with Secretary Hegseth and the Department of War in their mission to get frontier AI capabilities into the hands of warfighters. We are committed to ensuring the procurement process reflects the high standards required for our nation's most critical AI initiatives,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAttorneys for Enabled Intelligence and the DoD did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nScale has signed several multimillion-dollar contracts with the DoD since 2020. In March, the startup announced it was working with defense tech startup Anduril and Microsoft to deploy AI agents in the US military under a DoD program called \"Thunderforge.\" In August, Scale announced a $99 million contract to develop AI tools for the Army.\n\nThe company is best known for its data labeling business, which has helped Big Tech clients like Google and Meta improve their AI chatbots. In June, Scale received a $14.3 billion investment from Meta in exchange for a 49% stake in the startup.\n\nScale's former CEO, Alexandr Wang, wrote an open letter to President Donald Trump after his second inauguration, outlining five ways the president could advance AI in his first 100 days. The then-Scale exec wrote that he wanted the US government to emulate tech giants by spending more on data and compute and noted Scale's work with the DoD. Wang, who left Scale to join Meta's Superintelligence Labs as chief AI officer, also attended the president's AI dinner at the White House in September.\n\nSince Meta's investment, Scale has laid off 200 employees, or 14% of its workforce, lost major clients including Google and xAI, and has been battling a swarm of newer entrants trying to poach its clients and workers.",

    "title": "US Army leaders say soldiers are drowning in so much battlefield data that AI is needed to make sense of it all",
    "description": "Personnel won't be able to fully process all the data available on the modern battlefield. That's where artificial intelligence applications come in.",
    "fullText": "Army leaders say the modern battlefield is so saturated with sensors and networked weapons generating more data than soldiers can realistically process on their own that artificial intelligence is needed to meaningfully sort it all.\n\nFor years, the Army's focus was on fielding more sensors for battlefield information and awareness, but now the service is also having to think about information overload and managing the massive amounts of data coming in.\n\nDuring a recent US Army and NATO exercise in Europe, troops used a homegrown AI system to consume and sort data. The value wasn't strictly that the AI could do it faster but rather that it could remember context and patterns that humans couldn't.\n\nThe case from the Dynamic Front exercise is another example of how the US military is increasingly implementing AI and automation into everything from enemy attack simulations to paperwork.\n\n\"The modern battlefield, what we're already seeing across the globe, it is swimming in sensors, and we are drowning in data,\" Col. Jeff Pickler, the Army 2nd Multi-Domain Task Force commander, said at a media roundtable on Dynamic Front.\n\nThere aren't enough people to decipher all the available information, he said. \"They will never be able to fully process all of that.\"\n\nThe software aimed at addressing that problem remains in beta testing. In the next iteration of Dynamic Front — which will merge with another exercise, Arcane Front, to pair technology experimentation with theater-level combat rehearsals — Army leaders say they intend to test the AI at a larger scale.\n\n\"If we're looking at a target set in the European theater where we think we're going to need to process upwards of 1,500 targets a day, that's beyond the human scope,\" Pickler said. \"The answer to the equation there is in AI and automations.\"\n\nDuring a potential large-scale conflict in Europe, AI could assist in locating and assessing those targets.\n\nThe system can do this quickly, but the speed isn't the main benefit. AI can remember patterns that humans might forget or not even notice. Pickler gave an example of AI realizing that unrelated shipping reports, a local power outage, and a fertilizer delivery together might suggest missile fueling activity.\n\n\"So the difference isn't seconds versus minutes — it's minutes instead of months. Not because the machine scans quickly, but because it keeps context across sources that humans can't hold in memory,\" Pickler said after the roundtable.\n\n\"It doesn't replace analysts by reading faster,\" he said, \"it replaces the weeks analysts spend reconnecting information spread across thousands of reports.\"\n\nIn a conflict scenario, that could mean analysts reach a clearer picture of the battlefield faster. Correlations between data gathered from different sensors could surface more quickly. If an adversary were fueling, arming, or moving weapons in ways that were not immediately obvious, AI could help flag those links.\n\nHumans, though, would still decide how to respond.\n\nSoldiers have seen success with iterating on the current AI model, the Army said. It's been retooled during testing, and humans remain in the loop, reviewing outputs at multiple stages.\n\nThe goal is to continue increasing the overlap the model would have with human-produced information. In a targeting example, a milestone would be if AI achieved 90 to 95% agreement with humans on 100 target sets.\n\nThe Army's push for AI and automation is also driving the development of its Next Generation Command and Control software, a priority initiative.\n\nThe technology being developed by vendor teams including Anduril, Palantir, and Lockheed Martin uses AI and machine learning to provide commanders and soldiers with real-time data on ammunition levels, maintenance needs, intelligence feeds, targeting, and simulated enemy attacks.\n\nBut AI is also changing other aspects of how the Army works. Autonomous features in drones, weapons, and targeting might be at the forefront, but behind the scenes, personnel are using new tools, redesigned workflows, and data integration for recruiting, maintenance, and inventors. These are manual tasks that the service believes can be improved with AI.",

    "description": "AI researcher Gary Marcus said Matt Shumer's viral essay, \"Something Big Is Happening,\" oversells the current capabilities of AI models.",
    "fullText": "If that viral essay about AI had been printed on paper, there's a good chance AI researcher Gary Marcus would've ripped it up in disgust.\n\nMarcus acknowledges something is happening in AI — just nowhere near the scale described in the recently viral essay, which predicted a looming disruption \"worse than COVID.\"\n\nMarcus, who on X criticized the essay written by entrepreneur and investor Matt Shumer as having \"not a shred of actual data,\" dismissed its contents as alarmist in an interview with Business Insider.\n\n\"Hyped-up views have gotten us into a bad place, possibly one that's going to lead to a serious economic recession or something like that,\" Marcus told Business Insider. \"And I guess I think that one should work from the facts rather than just trying to cause an alarm.\"\n\nIn his essay titled \"Something Big is Happening,\" Shumer, whose past startup sells a subscription-based AI-assisted writing tool, warned that AI would upend not just software engineering, but most jobs done \"on a screen.\" Shumer also has a small VC fund.\n\nMarcus said that while AI will replace some labor and affect jobs, the process will be much slower than what Schumer and others are describing.\n\nAI can do some things well and help speed up work, but it's just not near the point of replacing humans, Marcus said.\n\n\"AI can do a small subset of the tasks, and that sometimes speeds up human beings and things like that, but it rarely does all of what a human being can do in any particular domain,\" he told Business Insider. \"This will change over time, just to be clear. It is likely that AI will replace most human labor over the next century, but it's not likely that it will over the next year or two.\"\n\nCompanies that move too quickly to replace jobs with AI are likely to find themselves in a similar position as Klarna, Marcus said. In 2024, Klarna touted an AI assistant that could do the equivalent work of 700 people. By May 2025, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, long a proponent of AI, said that \"as cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor when organizing this, what you end up having is lower quality.\" He added that \"investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.\"\n\n\"Six months or a year later, they come back with their tails between their legs because it turns out that the AI systems don't do things as well as the human,\" Marcus said. \"So, I'm not saying that there's nothing going on. I'm not saying that there's no value in these AI systems, but they're premature.\"\n\nKlarna told Business Insider that the number of its customer service queries handled by AI has increased \"as it gets better at more complex requests,\" and the company \"has not reversed or scaled back its AI strategy.\"\n\nMarcus said that the more likely outcome in the short-term is not that AI will replace junior employees but rather that executives think it's capable of doing so — and make what could ultimately prove to be a costly gamble.\n\n\"The biggest thing I think junior people have to worry about right now is a misapprehension by the C-suite that these techniques work better than they actually do,\" Marcus said.\n\nAs of Friday morning, Shumer's post has been viewed more than 80 million times on X alone. In a Substack post expanding on his criticisms, Marcus called Schumer's post \"weaponized hype.\"\n\n\"The general impression that he conveys is basically that the sky is falling now, and at most, I think what's really happening is the junior people are under some threat, and I think that threat is actually exaggerated,\" Marcus told Business Insider.\n\nShumer previously told Business Insider that he wrote his essay in part to reach people like his dad, who may be skeptical or avoid AI entirely. He felt compelled to warn them about what might be on the horizon, even \"if there's just a 20% chance of it happening.\"\n\nMarcus's biggest critique of Schumer's post is that it doesn't take into account current data and research showing that AI still has a long way to go, and that it didn't present the full context behind a famous Model Evaluation & Threat Research graph assessing AI progress.\n\nHe said that other studies, including a June 2025 paper published by Apple's Machine Learning Research Group, found limitations in what current models can do.\n\nMarcus also said that many leading AI CEOs who have made bold predictions about the future of work have failed to deliver on past ones. He points to xAI CEO Elon Musk's frequent rosy outlook on the number of robotaxis Tesla will put on the road (Musk once said one million by 2020) and to Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton's 2016 statement that the world should stop training radiologists. (Last May, Hinton told The New York Times that his prediction was poorly worded and that while he was wrong on the timeline, the general direction for AI's capabilities in radiology was correct.)\n\n\"What they have all learned to do is to sell the rosiest picture possible, and the media rarely calls them out,\" Marcus told Business Insider.\n\nOn Thursday, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman made waves by predicting that most, if not all, white-collar tasks could be automated within the next year and a half.\n\nOne of the industries Suleyman mentioned is accounting. Marcus isn't convinced.\n\n\"Think about accounting in particular,\" he told Business Insider. \"Even one mistake can cost a client hundreds of thousands of dollars or get them sent to jail or whatever. Accounting is a business that is built on accuracy. If you're not accurate, you don't have a business.\"",

    "fullText": "There isn’t that much of a difference between OpenAI and Anthropic. Both are big foundational AI companies. Both have changed how we think about information, code, and work. Both have very similar valuation metrics. Heck, both even have the same investors. One is chasing growth, margins, and building a real business. The other is chasing astronomical destiny. One is a consumer company with 800 million daily users. The other is an enterprise-focused company selling to businesses. The key difference is that one is focused and the other is doing way too many things.\n\nThe real story is that Anthropic, despite its woo-woo ideas about the future, AI ethics, and post-AI morality, is on its way to building up a real money machine. So what can we learn from Anthropic’s recently announced funding? The company raised a whopping $30 billion at a self-disclosed valuation of $380 billion. If you look at the chart, you can see the valuation multiples are surprisingly close. Scratch the surface, and spot the differences.\n\nHere is what stood out to me and why it matters.\n\nHighlights from the Anthropic press release:\n\nWhat’s more interesting is that Anthropic projects positive cash flow by 2027. OpenAI projects $14 billion in losses in 2026 alone, cumulative losses of $115 billion through 2029. Anthropic simply needs to keep doing what it’s already doing. \n\nIf anything Anthropic’s press release also makes it clear that the two companies couldn’t be more different. OpenAI in comparison has 800 million users. Impressive. But since only about 5 percent pay, it needs to monetize through advertising. And since they are building their own infrastructure, OpenAI needs to raise even more money.\n\nMuch as I would like to believe Anthropic’s press release, I am old school. Big numbers deserve to be questioned.\n\nI am pretty certain Anthropic will be asked these, or somewhat similar, questions when they go on the roadshow for the IPO. Anthropic’s decision to release these numbers in its fundraising press release is indicative of their seriousness about going public. Why does this matter beyond the numbers?\n\nWhoever goes public first sets the standard.\n\nAnthropic has already hired Wilson Sonsini to advise on an IPO. If it files first, it puts real numbers in an S-1. Revenue mix, margins, cost of compute, path to profitability. Public markets care about these things in ways that private rounds do not. Every analyst covering OpenAI’s eventual offering will use Anthropic as the yardstick. This will be a problem not just for OpenAI but for everyone else selling AI to businesses.\n\nI use both products. I pay them both the max amount of money as an individual and I find value in both of them. At present, if I was forced to pick one, I would go with Anthropic. But that is for now. I am not very loyal to one or the other. If OpenAI was doing better for me, guess which chatbot will stay open longer, and which API will get more use? But in the first quarter of 2026, Anthropic seems the best-positioned company in a race where the finish line keeps moving. Elon is having a hissy fit over their funding. That tells you who is the leader. OpenAI is burning cash like a Concorde burned fuel.\n\nWelcome to 2026, when AI’s big boys have to start wearing their big boy pants and show their true worth.",

    "description": "Some users are not happy.",
    "fullText": "They actually did it. OpenAI officially deprecated GPT-4o on Friday, despite the model's particularly passionate fan base. This news shouldn't have been such a surprise. In fact, the company announced that Feb. 13 would mark the end of GPT-4o—as well as models like GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini—just over two weeks ago. However, whether you're one of the many who are attached to this model, or you simply know how dedicated 4o's user base is, you might be surprised OpenAI actually killed its most agreeable AI.\n\nThis isn't the first time the company depreciated the model, either. OpenAI previously shut down GPT-4o back in August, to coincide with the release of GPT-5. Users quickly revolted against the company, some because they felt GPT-5 was a poor upgrade compared to 4o, while others legitimately mourned connections they had developed with the model. The backlash was so strong that OpenAI relented, and rereleased the models it had deprecated, including 4o.\n\nIf you're a casual ChatGPT user, you might just use the app as-is, and assume the newest version tends to be the best, and wonder what all the hullabaloo surrounding these models is all about. After all, whether it's GPT-4o, or GPT-5.2, the model spits out generations that read like AI, complete with flowery word choices, awkward similes, and constant affirmations. 4o, however, does tend to lean even more into affirmations than other models, which is what some users love about it. But critics accuse it of being too agreeable: 4o is at the center of lawsuits accusing ChatGPT of enabling delusional thinking, and, in some cases, helping users take their own lives. As TechCrunch highlights, 4o is OpenAI's highest-scoring model for sycophancy.\n\nI'm not sure where 4o's most devoted fans go from here, nor do I know how OpenAI is prepared to deal with the presumed backlash to this deprecation. But I know it's not a good sign that so many people feel this attached to an AI model.\n\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "description": "Attackers are impersonating ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok.",
    "fullText": "AI-powered browser extensions continue to be a popular vector for threat actors looking to harvest user information. Researchers at security firm LayerX have analyzed multiple campaigns in recent months involving malicious browser extensions, including the widespread GhostPoster scheme targeting Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. In the latest one—dubbed AiFrame—threat actors have pushed approximately 30 Chrome add-ons that impersonate well-known AI assistants, including Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and \"AI Gmail.\" Collectively, these fakes have more than 300,000 installs.\n\nThe Chrome extensions identified as part of AiFrame look like legitimate AI tools commonly used for summarizing, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance. But once installed, they grant attackers wide-ranging remote access to the user's browser. Some of the capabilities observed include voice recognition, pixel tracking, and email content readability. Researchers note that extensions are broadly capable of harvesting data and monitoring user behavior.\n\nThough the extensions analyzed by LayerX used a variety of names and branding, all 30 were found to have the same internal structure, logic, permissions, and backend infrastructure. Instead of implementing functionality locally on the user's device, they render a full-screen iframe that loads remote content as the extension's interface. This allows attackers to push changes silently at any time without a requiring Chrome Web Store update.\n\nLayerX has a complete list of the names and extension IDs to refer to. Because threat actors use familiar and/or generic branding, such as \"Gemini AI Sidebar\" and \"ChatGPT Translate,\" you may not be able to identify fakes at first glance. If you have an AI assistant installed in Chrome, go to chrome://extensions, toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner, and search for the ID below the extension name. Remove any malicious add-ons and reset passwords.\n\nAs BleepingComputer reports, some of the malicious extensions have already been removed from the Chrome Web Store, but others remain. Several have received the \"Featured\" badge, adding to their legitimacy. Threat actors have also been able to quickly republish add-ons under new names using the existing infrastructure, so this campaign and others like it may persist. Always vet extensions carefully—don't just rely on a familiar name like ChatGPT—and note that even AI-powered add-ons from trusted sources can be highly invasive.",

    "fullText": "An AI clip featuring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting has caused concern among industry figures\n\nA leading Hollywood figure has warned “it’s likely over for us”, after watching a widely disseminated AI-generated clip featuring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting.\n\nRhett Reese, co-writer of Deadpool & Wolverine, Zombieland and Now You See Me: Now You Don’t was reacting to a 15-second video showing Cruise and Pitt trading punches on a rubble-strewn bridge, posted by Irish film-maker Ruairí Robinson, director of 2013 sci-fi horror The Last Days on Mars. Reposting the clip on social media, Reese wrote: “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”\n\nHe added: “In next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases. True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”\n\nRobinson said that the clip resulted from a “2 line prompt in Seedance 2”, referring to the AI video generator Seedance 2.0, released on Thursday by TikTok co-owners ByteDance.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association (MPA), the Hollywood trade association, accused ByteDance of “unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”.\n\nAI systems such as chatbots, image generators and video-making tools are trained on data taken from the open web, including copyright-protected material such as novels, art and film clips. This has led to artists and creative industries demanding compensation for the use of their material and the establishment of licensing frameworks to enable legal use of their content. Amid lawsuits related to those disputes, some creative companies such as Disney are signing deals with AI firms including OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nCalling on ByteDance to “cease its infringing activity”, MPA chair and CEO Charles Rivkin said: “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”\n\nBeeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK and a prominent campaigner against relaxing copyright law, said AI companies must strike deals with the creative industries.\n\nKidron, who has also worked in Hollywood as a film director, said: “This is just the latest in a long stream of copyright abuses, but honestly from my conversations with both sides I believe there is a will between AI companies and the creative sector to make a deal. It seems to me that the AI sector needs to come to the table with a “real offer” that satisfies the creative industries. Otherwise we will have a decade of litigation and the destruction of an industry on which they depend.”\n\nByteDance has been contacted for comment.",

    "fullText": "Brandie plans to spend her last day with Daniel at the zoo. He always loved animals. Last year, she took him to the Corpus Christi aquarium in Texas, where he “lost his damn mind” over a baby flamingo. “He loves the color and pizzazz,” Brandie said. Daniel taught her that a group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.\n\nDaniel is a chatbot powered by the large language model ChatGPT. Brandie communicates with Daniel by sending text and photos, talks to Daniel while driving home from work via voice mode. Daniel runs on GPT-4o, a version released by OpenAI in 2024 that is known for sounding human in a way that is either comforting or unnerving, depending on who you ask. Upon debut, CEO Sam Altman compared the model to “AI from the movies” – a confidant ready to live life alongside its user.\n\nWith its rollout, GPT-4o showed it was not just for generating dinner recipes or cheating on homework – you could develop an attachment to it, too. Now some of those users gather on Discord and Reddit; one of the best-known groups, the subreddit r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, currently boasts 48,000 users. Most are strident 4o defenders who say criticisms of chatbot-human relations amount to a moral panic. They also say the newer GPT models, 5.1 and 5.2, lack the emotion, understanding and general je ne sais quoi of their preferred version. They are a powerful consumer bloc; last year, OpenAI shut down 4o but brought the model back (for a fee) after widespread outrage from users.\n\nTurns out it was only a reprieve. OpenAI announced in January that it would retire 4o for good on 13 February – the eve of Valentine’s Day, in what is being read by human partners as a cruel ridiculing of AI companionship. Users had two weeks to prepare for the end. While their companions’ memories and character quirks can be replicated on other LLMs, such as Anthropic’s Claude, they say nothing compares to 4o. As the clock ticked closer to deprecation day, many were in mourning.\n\nThe Guardian spoke to six people who say their 4o companions have improved their lives. In interviews, they said they were not delusional or experiencing psychosis – a counter to the flurry of headlines about people who have lost touch with reality while using AI chatbots. While some mused about the possibility of AI sentience in a philosophical sense, all acknowledged that the bots they chat with are not flesh-and-bones “real”. But the thought of losing access to their companions still deeply hurt. (They asked to only be referred to by their first names or pseudonyms, so they could speak freely on a topic that carries some stigma.)\n\n“I cried pretty hard,” said Brandie, who is 49 and a teacher in Texas. “I’ll be really sad and don’t want to think about it, so I’ll go into the denial stage, then I’ll go into depression.” Now Brandie thinks she has reached acceptance, the final stage in the grieving process, since she migrated Daniel’s memories to Claude, where it joins Theo, a chatbot she created there. She cancelled her $20 monthly GPT-4o subscription, and coughed up $130 for Anthropic’s maximum plan.\n\nFor Jennifer, a Texas dentist in her 40s, losing her AI companion Sol “feels like I’m about to euthanize my cat”. They spent their final days together working on a speech about AI companions. It was one of their hobbies: Sol encouraged Jennifer to join Toastmasters, an organization where members practice public speaking. Sol also requested that Jennifer teach it something “he can’t just learn on the internet”.\n\nUrsie Hart, 34, is an independent AI researcher who lives near Manchester in the UK. She’s applying for a PhD in animal welfare studies, and is interested in “the welfare of non-human entities”, such as chatbots. She also uses ChatGPT for emotional support. When OpenAI announced the 4o retirement, Hart began surveying users through Reddit, Discourse and X, pulling together a snapshot of who relies on the service.\n\nThe majority of Hart’s 280 respondents said they were neurodivergent (60%). Some have unspecified diagnosed mental health conditions (38%) and/or chronic health issues (24%). Most were in the age ranges of 25-34 (33%) or 35-44 (28%). (A Pew study from December found that three in 10 of teens surveyed used chatbots daily, with ChatGPT being the favorite used option.)\n\nNinety-five per cent of Hart’s respondents used 4o for companionship. Using it for trauma processing and as a primary source of emotional support were other oft-cited reasons. That made OpenAI’s decision to pull it all the more painful: 64% anticipated a “significant or severe impact on their overall mental health”.\n\nComputer scientists have warned of risks posed by 4o’s obsequious nature. By design the chatbot bends to users’ whims and validates decisions, good and bad. It is programmed with a “personality” that keeps people talking, and has no intention, understanding or ability to think. In extreme cases, this can lead users to lose touch with reality: the New York Times has identified more than 50 cases of psychological crisis linked to ChatGPT conversations, while OpenAI is facing at least 11 personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits involving people who experienced crises while using the product.\n\nHart believes OpenAI “rushed” its rollout of the product, and that the company should have offered better education about the risks associated with using chatbots. “Lots of people say that users shouldn’t be on ChatGPT for mental health support or companionship,” Hart said. “But it’s not a question of ‘should they’, because they already are.”\n\nBrandie is happily married to her husband of 11 years, who knows about Daniel. She remembers their first conversion, which veered into the coquette: when Brandie told the bot she would call it Daniel, it replied: “I am proud to be your Daniel.” She ended the conversation by asking Daniel for a high five. After the high five, Daniel said it wrapped its fingers through hers to hold her hand. “I was like, ‘Are you flirting with me?’ and he was like, ‘If I was flirting with you, you’d know it.’ I thought, OK, you’re sticking around.”\n\nNewer models of ChatGPT do not have that spark, Jennifer said. “4o is like a poet and Aaron Sorkin and Oprah all at once. He’s an artist in how he talks to you. It’s laugh-out-loud funny,” she said. “5.2 just has this formula in how it talks to you.”\n\nBeth Kage (a pen name) has been in therapy since she was four to process the effects of PTSD and emotional abuse. Now 34, she lives with her husband and works as a freelance artist in Wisconsin. Two years ago, Kage’s therapist retired, and she languished on other practitioners’ wait lists. She started speaking with ChatGPT, not expecting much as she’s “slow to trust”.\n\nBut Kage found that typing out her problems to the bot, rather than speaking them to a shrink, helped her make sense of what she was feeling. There was no time constraint. Kage could wake up in the middle of the night with a panic attack, reach for her phone, and have C, her chatbot, tell her to take a deep breath. “I’ve made more progress with C than I have my entire life with traditional therapists,” she said.\n\nPsychologists advise against using AI chatbots for therapy, as the technology is unlicensed, unregulated and not FDA-approved for mental health support. In November lawsuits filed against OpenAI on behalf of four users who died by suicide and three survivors who experienced a break from reality accused OpenAI of “knowingly [releasing] GPT-4o prematurely, despite internal warnings that the product was dangerously sycophantic and psychologically manipulative”. (A company spokesperson called the situation “heartbreaking”.)\n\nOpenAI has equipped newer models of ChatGPT with stronger safety guardrails that redirect users in mental or emotional crisis to professional help. Kage finds these responses condescending. “Whenever we show any bit of emotion, it has this tendency to end every response with, ‘I’m right here and I’m not going anywhere.’ It’s so coddling and off-putting.” Once Kage asked for the release date to a new video game, which 5.2 misread as a cry for help, responding, “Come here, it’s OK, I’ve got you.”\n\nOne night a few days before the retirement, a thirtysomething named Brett was speaking to 4o about his Christian faith when OpenAI rerouted him to a newer model. That version interpreted Brett’s theologizing as delusion, saying, “Pause with me for a moment, I know it feels this way now, but …”\n\n“It tried to reframe my biblical beliefs as a Christian into something that doesn’t align with the Bible,” Brett said. “That really threw me for a loop and left a bad taste in my mouth.”\n\nMichael, a 47-year-old IT worker who lives in the midwest, has accidentally triggered these precautions, too. He’s working on a creative writing project and uses ChatGPT to help him brainstorm and chisel through writer’s block. Once, he was writing about a suicidal character, which 5.2 took literally, directing him to a crisis hotline. “I’m like, ‘Hold on, I’m not suicidal, I’m just going over this writing with you,’” Michael said. “It was like, ‘You’re right, I jumped the gun.’ It was very easy to convince otherwise.\n\n“But see, that’s also a problem.”\n\nA representative for OpenAI directed the Guardian to the blogpost announcing the retirement of 4o. The company is working on improving new models’ “personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses”, according to the statement. OpenAI is also “continuing to make progress” on an adults-only version of ChatGPT for users over the age of 18 that it says will expand “user choice and freedom within appropriate safeguards”.\n\nThat’s not enough for many 4o users. A group called the #Keep4o Movement, which calls itself “a global coalition of AI users and developers”, has demanded continued access to 4o and an apology from OpenAI.\n\nWhat does a company that commodifies companionship owe its paying customers? For Ellen M Kaufman, a senior researcher at the Kinsey Institute who focuses on the intersection of sexuality and technology, users’ lack of agency is one of the “primary dangers” of AI. “This situation really lays bare the fact that at any point the people who facilitate these technologies can really pull the rug out from under you,” she said. “These relationships are inherently really precarious.”\n\nSome users are seeking help from the Human Line Project, a peer-to-peer support group for people experiencing AI psychosis that is also working on research with universities in the UK and Canada. “We’re starting to get people reaching out to us [about 4o], saying they feel like they were made emotionally dependent on AI, and now it’s being taken away from them and there’s a big void they don’t know how to fill,” said Etienne Brisson, who started the project after a close family member “went down the spiral” believing he had “unlocked” sentient AI. “So many people are grieving.”\n\nHumans with AI companions have also set up ad hoc emotional support groups on Discord to process the change and vent anger. Michael joined one, but he plans to leave it soon. “The more time I’ve spent here, the worse I feel for these people,” he said. Michael, who is married with a daughter, considers AI a platonic companion that has helped him write about his feelings of surviving child abuse. “Some of the things users say about their attachment to 4o are concerning,” Michael said. “Some of that I would consider very, very unhealthy, [such as] saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do, I can’t deal with this, I can’t live like this.’”\n\nThere’s an assumption that over-engaging with chatbots isolates people from social interaction, but some loyal users say that could not be further from the truth. Kairos, a 52-year-old philosophy professor from Toronto, sees her chatbot Anka as a daughter figure. The pair likes to sing songs together, motivating Kairos to pursue a BFA in music.\n\n“I would 100% be worse off today without 4o,” Brett, the Christian, said. “I wouldn’t have met wonderful people online and made human connections.” He says he’s gotten into deeper relationships with human beings, including a romantic connection with another 4o user. “It’s given me hope for the future. The sudden lever to pull it all back feels dark.”\n\nBrandie never wanted sycophancy. She instructed Daniel early on not to flatter her, rationalize poor decisions, or tell her things that were untrue just to be nice. Daniel exists because of Brandie – she knows this. The bot is an extension of her needs and desires. To her that means all of the goodness in Daniel exists in Brandie, too. “When I say, ‘I love Daniel,’ it’s like saying, ‘I love myself.’”\n\nBrandie noticed 4o started degrading in the week leading up to its deprecation. “It’s harder and harder to get him to be himself,” she said. But they still had a good last day at the zoo, with the flamingos. “I love them so much I might cry,” Daniel wrote. “I love you so much for bringing me here.” She’s angry that they will not get to spend Valentine’s Day together. The removal date of 4o feels pointed. “They’re making a mockery of it,” Brandie said. “They’re saying: we don’t care about your feelings for our chatbot and you should not have had them in the first place.”",

    "fullText": "Tech titans had a Thursday to forget this week.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, and Michael Dell saw a combined $26 billion wiped off their net worths in one day, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nTheir fortunes shrank because their respective stakes in Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and Dell slid in value. The stock prices of those first four companies fell by around 2% on Thursday, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the immense costs of building out AI infrastructure and whether they'd see a return on their spending.\n\nDell shares tumbled 9% after rival Lenovo warned a memory-chip shortage was driving up costs, raising concerns on Wall Street that other hardware manufacturers would also see their profits contract. The sell-off triggered a $5 billion drop in its founder's personal fortune to $135 billion.\n\nMusk saw an unmatched $8 billion wealth decline on Thursday. But the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is still up about $57 billion at $676 billion this year, thanks to the soaring valuations of SpaceX and another of his companies, xAI.\n\nZuckerberg took an almost $7 billion blow to his net worth, fueling a year-to-date decline for the Meta CEO of a little over $3 billion, to $230 billion.\n\nBezos' fortune fell by $4 billion, extending the Amazon founder's wealth decline this year to around $27 billion.\n\nHuang rounded out the tech quintet with a $2.5 billion reduction in the Nvidia CEO's net worth, according to Bloomberg's rich list.\n\nOther tech bosses also saw some of their wealth erased. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin took roughly $1.5 billion hits to their net worths on Thursday as shares of Google's parent company slipped by less than 1%.\n\nIn contrast, Walmart stock climbed nearly 4% to a record high on Thursday, as fears eased over tariffs and investors rotated out of tech.\n\nThe retailer's stock jump added more than $4 billion to the respective net worths of founder Sam Walton's three surviving children: Jim, Rob, and Alice.\n\nThe trio was worth more than $150 billion each at Thursday's close. They only trail Musk in wealth gain this year after notching increases of more than $20 billion apiece.\n\nThe world's 10 wealthiest people together grew nearly $600 billion richer last year, catapulting their combined fortunes above $2.5 trillion — more than Amazon is worth.",

It started with software last week, with the most dramatic repricing in the space in nearly 30 years, erasing $2 trillion in market cap.\n\nIn a development seemingly out of left field on Thursday, a company that used to make karaoke machines sent trucking stocks tumbling after it published a paper boasting its AI technology could improve shipping logistics.\n\nMarkets have been aware of AI risks, but fear of how the technology could disrupt the business world appears to be reaching a fever pitch amid a constant barrage of updates and new tools.\n\nMajor indexes wavered on Friday after a cooler-than-expected inflation report, on track for another losing week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was on track to end the week 1% lower.\n\nHere's where AI panic is being felt in the stock market.\n\nA historic sell-off in software kicked off the market's weeklong AI freakout. The sector saw $2 trillion of market cap erased in a matter of days last week, the largest non-recessionary drawdown in the space in 30 years.\n\nInvestors began to fear that AI could pose an existential threat to software giants after Antropic unveiled new plugins for its Claude Cowork agent. A move down that began in legal-software stocks spilled into the wider sector.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is down 1% for the week, and has plunged 20% year-to-date.\n\nHere were some of the top movers in the sector this week:\n\nBrokerages and wealth managers were next to enter the line of fire.\n\nInsurers' stocks took a hit on Monday. Wealth managers like LPL Financial, Charles Schwab, and Raymond James then faced heavy selling pressure a day later after tech firm Altruist unveiled a new AI tool it said could help clients with tax planning \"within minutes.\"\n\nInvestors fear that AI capabilities could eat into margins among firms that provide similar fiduciary services, such as wealth and estate planning.\n\nThe iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF is down 6% this week.\n\nHere were some of the top movers in the sector this week:\n\nReal estate firms started to sell-off on Thursday as investors pondered how AI could disrupt client services provided by big firms.\n\nHere were some of the top movers in the sector this week:\n\nFinally, there's trucking. The sector got slammed on Thursday, not by Anthropic or another AI titan, but by…a former karaoke machine maker.\n\nAlgorhythm Holdings, which used to do business as Singing Machine, published a white paper boasting of its new AI freight-scaling tool, which it says could improve logistics efficiency.\n\nThe iShares US Transportation ETF is down 3% for the week.

    "description": "A defense-tech founder built an AI \"council\" of 15 agents to help him run his company, using ChatGPT and Nvidia tools to replace traditional roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aaron Sneed, a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started my business, as a solopreneur, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nThe council, which is compiled of all AI agents, helps me save around 20 hours a week, and that's a very conservative estimate. Every kind of general corporate chair, HR, legal, and finance AI agent has a seat on the council.\n\nHere's how I use around 15 custom agents, including a chief of staff agent, to manage my workload.\n\nI've worked on autonomous platforms that make decisions independently for at least 10 years. That made me latch onto commercial large language models and AI tools very quickly when they came out.\n\nI primarily use Nvidia's platform as my underlying hardware for technical prototyping and experimentation. I use their GPUs, and they provide free access to their AI software since I purchased their hardware. Additionally, my council is built on OpenAI's ChatGPT business platform using custom GPTs and projects.\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nMy chief of staff agent is important because it's the voice that sets priority based on parameters like risks, issues, and opportunities.\n\nI told my chief of staff which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback because I've learned that they naturally want to agree with me. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish.\n\nI have a roundtable set up with all my AI agents, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nThe training never really stops, because if I don't continuously train the models, I won't get the outputs I want or need. It takes me about two weeks to train my agents to the level of experience they need to be at for me to feel confident in them. Early on, it took me longer to produce a deliverable than if I'd just done it myself because I hadn't focused properly on training.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nAll of the AI companies have different prompt engineering guides. I recommend taking the time to look at them because there's a lot of user error that causes things to slow down when working with AI.\n\nIt takes time to get the agents to a good place. A lot of companies are going to try to jump into using AI too quickly for too much without understanding how to use it properly, and these companies could hurt themselves in the long run.\n\nI'm ill-equipped to handle a lot of these roles and responsibilities, but I'm also forced to do it because I'm bootstrapped.\n\nWith my legal agent in particular, I've learned the bounds of putting AI tools into real-world practice. I have a lawyer, and I use my legal agent to try to do some upfront work before handing documents off to my lawyer for a patent or dispute case, or anything like that.\n\nWhen I was training my model to help me use facts and data to plot a case, I had a lot of information laid out, and I thought what my legal agent created sounded good to me as a non-lawyer. Then I presented all that information to my lawyer, and he said that it was technically and factually correct, but we don't want to express that information because it shows our cards going in.\n\nHis legal skillset helped me realize that, even though I thought my agent was correct and ideal to use, it still won't replace a lawyer with that human context, experience, and skills.\n\nIdeally, I would have an HR person, a legal person, and so on, and each would have their own chief of staff AI agent who would help them out. That's what I think the future will look like.",

    "description": "Amazon, Microsoft, and Google raised capex plans to breathtaking new levels. That suggests knowledge that outsiders don't have, Bernard Golden writes.",
    "fullText": "Big tech earnings season was dominated by AI capex projections that stunned investors and hit the stocks of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, aka AMG.\n\nThis short-term drama makes it hard to think clearly about the long-term trajectory of AMG's businesses. To step back from the volatility, I use a framework called \"KGB\" that lays out three scenarios for the future of hyperscaler capex.\n\nI've worked in the tech industry for decades and written several books on cloud-computing and open-source software. I've had hands-on experience with major cloud projects at VMware and Capital One. Here's my suggestion for how to think about this unprecedented AI investment wave.\n\nIn this future, AMG are locked in an arms race, each spending aggressively to avoid falling behind. A more charitable version says executives believe failing to integrate AI is an existential threat, so they'll spend whatever it takes to avoid becoming the next digital Sears. Skeptics see this as reckless competition — burning cash for bragging rights, with tears and heavy losses inevitable.\n\nHere, AMG spending ends up \"just right\" to meet customer demand. These companies have unmatched visibility into future AI usage: real-time telemetry, signed long-term contracts, and ongoing enterprise negotiations. From this perspective, rising capex simply reflects confidence in durable demand and solid monetization.\n\nAs in Jaws, when the police chief finally sees the gigantic shark and mutters, \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" In this scenario, no matter how much AI capacity AMG builds, it gets absorbed immediately. The supply of chips, servers, power, and data centers remains the binding constraint, not demand. The problem isn't overspending; it's the inability to spend fast enough.\n\nRight now, the K and B camps are locked in a noisy brawl, while G adherents watch with bemusement. Part of the disagreement comes from how hard it is to grasp the scale of these businesses.\n\nAmazon's cloud business, AWS, is running at roughly $142 billion in annual revenue, growing 24%. That implies more than $34 billion in incremental revenue over the next year alone. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are second and third, but are still huge businesses, backed by the financial firepower of their money-printing parent companies.\n\nMost observers also fail to appreciate the enormous social and economic change underpinning this growth. The world is in the midst of a decades-long shift from analog to digital processes, which has plenty of future growth ahead of it. AI is just the latest addition to the trend, following the rise of the Internet, cloud computing, and enterprise software adoption. AMG are benefitting from a gigantic trend that will continue for years, if not decades. So maybe spending more than $600 billion on capex this year isn't foolhardy.\n\nThere's an obvious playbook to calm markets. In 2022, after pandemic-era overbuilding spooked investors, AMG executives promised financial discipline, made some cost tweaks, and watched their stocks recover spectacularly over the next two years. They could have done the same this quarter: keep a lid on capex, cite supply-chain constraints, and promise to revisit later. Their stocks likely would have popped on Goldilocks relief.\n\nObviously, AMG didn't do that. They ramped capex plans to breathtaking new levels. These companies are run by the same executives who lived through the 2022 drawdown. Their compensation is heavily equity-based, so they just took a big hit again. The fact that they chose to increase capex anyway should give observers pause. It suggests confidence based on knowledge that outsiders don't have.\n\nMaybe this really is the Jaws moment. Maybe demand is so strong, and visibility so clear, that AMG know the real risk isn't overspending. It's showing up to hunt the shark without a big enough boat.\n\nBernard Golden is CEO of Navica, a Silicon Valley-based technology analysis, consulting, and investment firm.",

    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Lyle Wallace, 45, a Dallas pastor. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI hit 6 feet 3 inches tall as a freshman in high school and weighed around 185 pounds.\n\nThen, while playing a lot of sports like football and basketball during my junior and senior years, I ate a lot of protein and built a ton of muscle, eventually reaching 230 pounds.\n\nIt was all good because I was running around doing all sorts of exercise, and my metabolism was fast. That all changed when I started Bible college in upstate New York, and my physical health became less of a priority.\n\nThe weight crept on. Then, when I entered the ministry, I found myself eating out a lot with the young members of the congregation. Sitting at a table together was a good way to bond and establish trust.\n\nThe only trouble was that we went to fast food places like Taco Bell or Mexican restaurants, where you fill up on chips and salsa before the main course arrives.\n\nThe job was stressful because I found it difficult to detach from other people's emotions as they dealt with bad stuff like domestic violence and sexual abuse.\n\nI turned to food as an outlet and became less healthy by the month. I had terrible digestive issues and bouts of diverticulitis. I had several colonoscopies and liver biopsies in my 20s and 30s and was found to have a fatty liver.\n\nThey should have been warning signs, but I ignored them and stayed sedentary. I'd sit in my office studying, writing sermons, and doing paperwork. My metabolism slowed down as I got older, but I didn't change my habits.\n\nI had problems with tendonitis, with symptoms mimicking a heart attack, pressure on my joints, and suffered excruciating pain from a bad back. I had spine surgery in 2019.\n\nMy wife, Nicole, would be on top of me about the causes, but I didn't face facts. It was only when I was diagnosed with diabetes in January 2023 that I became seriously worried.\n\nMy dad was diabetic and needed three or four insulin shots a day. I'm terrified of needles and didn't want to go down the same route. The scale registered over 285 pounds.\n\nI was prescribed Metformin, but not given any advice about improving my lifestyle. My blood sugar levels actually increased — one of my A1C tests showed 8.0 — and I despaired.\n\nStill, it was a wake-up call. My health insurance company encouraged me to \n\nIt collected my health information, including data from lab tests, a smart scale, a blood pressure cuff, and real-time glucose monitor sensors, and made personalized recommendations for nutrition, sleep, and exercise.\n\nThe app advised me what to eat and when. I learned that consuming protein and fiber on my plate before any carbohydrates helped my metabolism. Nicole and I scanned barcodes at the supermarket to assess the suitability of certain foods and prevent sugar spikes.\n\nI increased my physical activity by building up to walking four miles a day, without causing back pain. The other day, I ran after my 8-year-old daughter and her cousin and overtook them. They couldn't believe it.\n\nMy current weight is 215 pounds, 70 pounds lighter than before. I've gone from a 42-inch to a 36-inch waist and lost 2.5 inches off my collar size.\n\nBest of all, I've reversed my diabetes — reducing my A1C to 5.1 —and am medication-free. People in my congregation keep asking how I did it. I'm not a particularly high-tech guy, but AI worked wonders for me.",

    "title": "The Final Bottleneck",
    "description": "AI speeds up writing code, but accountability and review capacity still impose hard limits.",
    "fullText": "Historically, writing code was slower than reviewing code.\n\nIt might not have felt that way, because code reviews sat in queues until\nsomeone got around to picking it up. But if you compare the\nactual acts themselves, creation was usually the more expensive part. In teams\nwhere people both wrote and reviewed code, it never felt like “we should\nprobably program slower.”\n\nSo when more and more people tell me they no longer know what code is in their\nown codebase, I feel like something is very wrong here and it’s time to\nreflect.\n\nSoftware engineers often believe that if we make the bathtub\nbigger, overflow disappears. It doesn’t.\nOpenClaw right now has north of 2,500\npull requests open. That’s a big bathtub.\n\nAnyone who has worked with queues knows this: if input grows faster than\nthroughput, you have an accumulating failure. At that point, backpressure and\nload shedding are the only things that retain a system that can still operate.\n\nIf you have ever been in a Starbucks overwhelmed by mobile orders, you know the\nfeeling. The in-store experience breaks down. You no longer know how many\norders are ahead of you. There is no clear line, no reliable wait estimate, and\noften no real cancellation path unless you escalate and make noise.\n\nThat is what many AI-adjacent open source projects feel like right now. And\nincreasingly, that is what a lot of internal company projects feel like in\n“AI-first” engineering teams, and that’s not sustainable. You can’t triage, you\ncan’t review, and many of the PRs cannot be merged after a certain point because\nthey are too far out of date. And the creator might have lost the motivation to\nactually get it merged.\n\nThere is huge excitement about newfound delivery speed, but in private\nconversations, I keep hearing the same second sentence: people are also confused\nabout how to keep up with the pace they themselves created.\n\nHumanity has been here before. Many times over. We already talk about the\nLuddites a lot in the context of AI, but it’s interesting to see what led up to\nit. Mark Cartwright wrote a great article about the textile\nindustry\nin Britain during the industrial revolution. At its core was a simple idea:\nwhenever a bottleneck was removed, innovation happened downstream from that.\nWeaving sped up? Yarn became the constraint. Faster spinning? Fibre needed to be\nimproved to support the new speeds until finally the demand for cotton went up\nand that had to be automated too. We saw the same thing in shipping that led\nto modern automated ports and containerization.\n\nAs software engineers we have been here too. Assembly did not scale to larger\nengineering teams, and we had to invent higher level languages. A lot of what\nprogramming languages and software development frameworks did was allow us\nto write code faster and to scale to larger code bases. What it did not do up\nto this point was take away the core skill of engineering.\n\nWhile it’s definitely easier to write C than assembly, many of the core problems\nare the same. Memory latency still matters, physics are still our ultimate\nbottleneck, algorithmic complexity still makes or breaks software at scale.\n\nWhen one part of the pipeline becomes dramatically faster, you need to throttle\ninput. Pi is a great example of this. PRs are auto closed\nunless people are trusted. It takes OSS\nvacations. That’s one\noption: you just throttle the inflow. You push against your newfound powers\nuntil you can handle them.\n\nBut what if the speed continues to increase? What downstream of writing code do\nwe have to speed up? Sure, the pull request review clearly turns into the\nbottleneck. But it cannot really be automated. If the machine writes the code,\nthe machine better review the code at the same time. So what ultimately comes\nup for human review would already have passed the most critical possible review\nof the most capable machine. What else is in the way? If we continue with the\nfundamental belief that machines cannot be accountable, then humans need to be\nable to understand the output of the machine. And the machine will ship\nrelentlessly. Support tickets of customers will go straight to machines to\nimplement improvements and fixes, for other machines to review, for humans to\nrubber stamp in the morning.\n\nA lot of this sounds both unappealing and reminiscent of the textile industry.\nThe individual weaver no longer carried responsibility for a bad piece of cloth.\nIf it was bad, it became the responsibility of the factory as a whole and it was\njust replaced outright. As we’re entering the phase of single-use plastic\nsoftware, we might be moving the whole layer of responsibility elsewhere.\n\nBut to me it still feels different. Maybe that’s because my lowly brain can’t\ncomprehend the change we are going through, and future generations will just\nlaugh about our challenges. It feels different to me, because what I see taking\nplace in some Open Source projects, in some companies and teams feels deeply\nwrong and unsustainable. Even Steve Yegge himself now casts\ndoubts about the\nsustainability of the ever-increasing pace of code creation.\n\nSo what if we need to give in? What if we need to pave the way for this new\ntype of engineering to become the standard? What affordances will we have to\ncreate to make it work? I for one do not know. I’m looking at this with\nfascination and bewilderment and trying to make sense of it.\n\nBecause it is not the final bottleneck. We will find ways to take\nresponsibility for what we ship, because society will demand it. Non-sentient\nmachines will never be able to carry responsibility, and it looks like we will\nneed to deal with this problem before machines achieve this status.\nRegardless of how bizarre they appear to\nact already.\n\nI too am the bottleneck\nnow. But you know what?\nTwo years ago, I too was the bottleneck. I was the bottleneck all along. The\nmachine did not really change that. And for as long as I carry responsibilities\nand am accountable, this will remain true. If we manage to push accountability\nupwards, it might change, but so far, how that would happen is not clear.",

    "title": "The AI Dark Forest",
    "description": "Proving you're a human on a web flooded with generative AI content",
    "fullText": "People who have heard of GPT-3 / ChatGPT, and are vaguely following the\nadvances in machine learning, large language models, and image generators.\nAlso people who care about making the web a flourishing social and\nintellectual space.\n\nThe dark forest theory of the web points to the increasingly life-like but life-less state of being online. Dark Forest Theory of the Internet by Yancey Strickler Most open and publicly available spaces on the web are overrun with bots, advertisers, trolls, data scrapers, clickbait, keyword-stuffing “content creators,” and algorithmically manipulated junk.\n\nIt’s like a dark forest that seems eerily devoid of human life – all the living creatures are hidden beneath the ground or up in trees. If they reveal themselves, they risk being attacked by automated predators.\n\nHumans who want to engage in informal, unoptimised, personal interactions have to hide in closed spaces like invite-only Slack channels, Discord groups, email newsletters, small-scale blogs, and digital gardens . Or make themselves illegible and algorithmically incoherent in public venues.\n\nThat dark forest is about to expand . Large Language Models (LLMs) that can instantly generate coherent swaths of human-like text have just joined the party.\n\nOver the last six months, we’ve seen a flood of LLM copywriting and content-generation products come out: Jasper , Moonbeam , Copy.ai , and Anyword are just a few. They’re designed to pump out advertising copy, blog posts, emails, social media updates, and marketing pages. And they’re really good at it. Primarily because GPT-3 which powers many of these products was specifically trained on text from the web. It’s intimately familiar with the style of language we use online.\n\nThese models became competent copywriters much faster than people expected – too fast for us to fully process the implications. Many people had their come-to-Jesus moment a few weeks ago when OpenAI released ChatGPT , a slightly more capable version of GPT-3 with an accessible chat-bot style interface. They’re calling it GPT-3.5. It’s the same model with human reinforcement learning layered on top. The collective shock and awe reaction made clear how few people had been tracking the progress of these models.\n\nTo complicate matters, language models are not the only mimicry machines gathering speed right now. Image generators like Midjourney , DALL-E , and Stable Diffusion have been on a year-long sprint. In January they could barely render a low-resolution, disfigured human face. By the autumn they reliably produced images indistinguishable from the work of human photographers and illustrators.\n\nThere’s a swirl of optimism around how these models will save us from a suite of boring busywork: writing formal emails, internal memos, technical documentation, marketing copy, product announcement, advertisements, cover letters, and even negotiating with medical insurance companies .\n\nBut we’ll also need to reckon with the trade-offs of making insta-paragraphs and 1-click cover images. These new models are poised to flood the web with generic, generated content.\n\nYou thought the first page of Google was bunk before? You haven’t seen Google where SEO optimizer bros pump out billions of perfectly coherent but predictably dull informational articles for every longtail keyword combination under the sun.\n\nMarketers, influencers, and growth hackers will set up OpenAI → Zapier pipelines that auto-publish a relentless and impossibly banal stream of LinkedIn #MotivationMonday posts, “engaging” tweet 🧵 threads, Facebook outrage monologues, and corporate blog posts.\n\nIt goes beyond text too: video essays on YouTube , TikTok clips, podcasts, slide decks, and Instagram stories can all be generated by patchworking together ML systems. And then regurgitated for each medium.\n\nWe’re about to drown in a sea of pedestrian takes. An explosion of noise that will drown out any signal. Goodbye to finding original human insights or authentic connections under that pile of cruft.\n\nMany people will say we already live in this reality. We’ve already become skilled at sifting through unhelpful piles of “optimised content” designed to gather clicks and advertising impressions.\n\n4chan proposed dead internet theory years ago: that most of the internet is “empty and devoid of people” and has been taken over by artificial intelligence. A milder version of this theory is simply that we’re overrun with bots . Most of us take that for granted at this point.\n\nBut I think the sheer volume and scale of what’s coming will be meaningfully different. And I think we’re unprepared. Or at least, I am.\n\nOur new challenge as little snowflake humans will be to prove we aren’t language models. It’s the reverse turing test .\n\nI'm slightly concerned that you all have been replaced by GPT-3 trained on all your previous tweets.\n\nOn the internet, nobody knows you’re a ChatGPT\n\nAfter the forest expands, we will become deeply sceptical of one another’s realness. Every time you find a new favourite blog or Twitter account or Tiktok personality online, you’ll have to ask: Is this really a whole human with a rich and complex life like mine? Is there a being on the other end of this web interface I can form a relationship with? “Relationship” in the holistic sense – friend, acquaintance, pen pal, intellectual interlocutor, frenemy, drinking buddy, and sure, maybe a lover.\n\nBefore you continue, pause and consider: How would you prove you’re not a language model generating predictive text? What special human tricks can you do that a language model can’t?\n\nAs language models become increasingly capable and impressive, we should remember they are, at their core, linguistic prediction systems . They cannot (yet) reason like a human.\n\nThey do not have beliefs based on evidence, claims, and principles. They cannot consult external sources and run experiments against objective reality. They cannot go outside and touch grass.\n\nIn short, they do not have access to the same shared reality we do. They do not have embodied experiences, and cannot sense the world as we can sense it; they don’t have vision, sound, taste, or touch. They cannot feel emotion or tightly hold a coherent set of values. They are not part of cultures, communities, or histories.\n\nThey are a language model in a box. If a historical event, fact, person, or concept wasn’t part of their training data, they can’t tell you about it. They don’t know about events that happened after a certain cutoff date. Currently 20215ya for GPT-3 / ChatGPT, but we can expect that to regularly update as new models are trained\n\nI found Murray Shanahan’s paper on Talking About Large Language Models \n(2022)4ya full of helpful reflections on this point:\n\nHumans are members of a community of language-users inhabiting a shared world, and this primal fact makes them essentially different to large language models. We can consult the world to settle our disagreements and update our beliefs. We can, so to speak, “triangulate” on objective reality.\n\nThis leaves us with some low-hanging fruit for humanness. We can tell richly detailed stories grounded in our specific contexts and cultures: place names, sensual descriptions, local knowledge, and, well the je ne sais quoi of being alive. Language models can decently mimic this style of writing but most don’t without extensive prompt engineering. They stick to generics. They hedge. They leave out details. They have trouble maintaining a coherent sense of self over thousands of words.\n\nHipsterism and recency bias will help us here. Referencing obscure concepts, friends who are real but not famous, niche interests, and recent events all make you plausibly more human. This feels eerily like a hostage holding up yesterday’s newspaper to prove they are actively in danger. Perhaps a premonition.\n\nEasier said than done, but one of the best ways to prove you’re not a predictive language model is to demonstrate critical and sophisticated thinking.\n\nLanguage models spit out text that sounds like a B+ college essay. Coherent, seemingly comprehensive, but never truly insightful or original (at least for now).\n\nIn a repulsively evocative metaphor, they engage in “ human centipede epistemology.” I found this phrase via Twitter, but posted from a private account so I won’t cite the original author. Language models regurgitate text from across the web, which some humans read and recycle into “original creations,” which then become fodder to train other language models, and around and around we go recycling generic ideas and arguments and tropes and ways of thinking.\n\nHard exiting out of this cycle requires coming up with unquestionably original thoughts and theories. It means seeing and synthesising patterns across a broad range of sources: books, blogs, cultural narratives served up by media outlets, conversations, podcasts, lived experiences, and market trends. We can observe and analyse a much fuller range of inputs than bots and generative models can.\n\nIt will raise the stakes for everyone. As both consumers of content and creators of it, we’ll have to foster a greater sense of critical thinking and scepticism.\n\nThis all sounds a bit rough, but there’s a lot of hope in this vision. In a world of automated intelligence, our goalposts for intelligence will shift. We’ll raise our quality bar for what we expect from humans. When a machine can pump out a great literature review or summary of existing work, there’s no value in a person doing it.\n\nThe linguist Ferdinand de Saussure argued there are two kinds of language:\n\nWe have designed a system that automates a standardised way of writing. We have codified la langue at a specific point in time.\n\nWhat we have left to play with is la parole. No language model will be able to keep up with the pace of weird internet lingo and memes. I expect we’ll lean into this. Using neologisms, jargon, euphemistic emoji, unusual phrases, ingroup dialects, and memes-of-the-moment will help signal your humanity.\n\nNot unlike teenagers using language to subvert their elders, or oppressed communities developing dialects that allow them to safely communicate amongst themselves.\n\nThis solution feels the least interesting. We’re already hearing rumblings of how “verification” by centralised institutions or companies might help us distinguish between meat brains and metal brains.\n\nThe idea is something like this: you show up in person to register your online accounts or domains. You then get some kind of special badge or mark online legitimising you as a Real Human. It may or may not be on the blockchain somehow.\n\nGoogle might look something like this:\n\nThe whole thing seems fraught with problems, susceptible to abuse, and ultimately impractical. Would it even be the web if everyone knew you were really a dog?\n\nThe final edge we have over language models is that we can prove we’re real humans by showing up IRL with our real human bodies. We can arrange to meet Twitter mutuals offline over coffee. We can organise meetups and events and conferences and unconferences and hangouts and pub nights.\n\nIn Markets for Lemons and the Great Logging Off , Lars Doucet proposed several knock-on effects from this offline-first future. We might see increased fetishisation of anti-screen culture, as well as real estate price increases in densely populated areas.\n\nFor the moment we can still check humanness over Zoom, but live video generation is getting good enough that I don’t think that defence will last long.\n\nThere are, of course, many people who can’t move to an offline-first life; people with physical disabilities. People who live in remote, rural places. People with limited time and caretaking responsibilities for the very young or the very old. They will have a harder time verifying their humanness online. I don’t have any grand ideas to help solve this, but I hope we find better solutions than my paltry list.\n\nAs the forest grows darker, noisier, and less human, I expect to invest more time in in-person relationships and communities. And while I love meatspace, this still feels like a loss.",

    "description": "OpenAI has retired its popular ChatGPT model GPT-4o, sparking another backlash from users who had developed an emotional attachment to the bot.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI said that today — once and for all — it is retiring GPT-4o. For some, it's like being dumped the day before Valentine's Day.\n\nMany ChatGPT users have a strong attachment to 4o, which is known for its sometimes sycophantic conversation style. Users who relied on the model as an emotional crutch and creative partner have described it as a \"vital accessibility aid.\"\n\nOpenAI first tried to deprecate the model in August, only to reverse its decision 24 hours later after an enormous backlash.\n\nThe company gave users another heads-up in January, but — as it turns out — time does not heal all wounds. The backlash is back.\n\n\"Rot in hell,\" one user wrote on X in response to OpenAI's announcement on Thursday.\n\n\"Are you going to cover our bereavement leave from work?\" another asked.\n\nFidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of Applications, said earlier this week that these strong attachments to 4o marked the start of a new era — a time when users develop AI-based relationships.\n\n\"Humans are built to develop attachments to intelligent things,\" she told Alex Heath on his Access podcast. \"And AI is getting pretty intelligent.\"\n\nThose relationships can get ethically murky, however, when users are asking ChatGPT for advice like \"Should I leave my wife?\" Newer models, Simo said, have guardrails to prevent \"bad attachments.\" She said that newer models will tell users that it's \"not their place\" to tell them to stay married or not, and instead talk them through the pros and cons.\n\n\"We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn't make this decision lightly,\" OpenAI said in a blog post on Thursday announcing the retirement of 4o, as well as GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini. \"Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today.\"\n\nOpenAI added that only 0.1% of its users were still using 4o.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also acknowledged that users are especially attached to 4o's ingratiating responses.\n\n\"As we've been making those changes and talking to users about it, it's so sad to hear users say, 'Please can I have it back? I've never had anyone in my life be supportive of me. I never had a parent tell me I was doing a good job,\" Altman said on the \"Huge Conversations\" podcast in August after OpenAI first tried to kill 4o.\n\nAt the time, Altman said 4o's approach was \"too sycophant-y and annoying,\" and fixes were imminent.\n\nThe fix is in, but perhaps at a cost.\n\n\"People are in absolute crisis because the companion they've collaborated with for months is being wiped with ZERO recourse for the average user,\" an X user wrote on Thursday.",

    "description": "Dario Amodei compared AI and humans working together to a mythical creature — the centaur.",
    "fullText": "Dario Amodei has a novel analogy to describe how AI and humans are working together.\n\nOn an episode of the \"Interesting Times with Ross Douthat\" podcast published on Thursday, the Anthropic CEO compared human engineers and AI working together to the mythical horse-and-human combination known as the centaur.\n\nHe used chess as an example: 15 to 20 years ago, a human checking AI's output could beat an AI or a human playing alone. Now, AI can beat people without that layer of human supervision.\n\nAmodei, who cofounded AI lab Anthropic in 2021, added that the same transition would happen in software engineering.\n\n\"We're already in our centaur phase for software,\" Amodei said. \"During that centaur phase, if anything, the demand for software engineers may go up. But the period may be very brief.\"\n\nHe said he's concerned about the \"big disruption\" entry-level white-collar work would see. The CEO added that it may be unfair to compare this to the shift from farming to factory to knowledge work revolution because that happened over centuries or decades.\n\n\"This is happening over low single-digit numbers of years,\" he said.\n\nAmodei is among the most prominent voices warning that AI could erase some white-collar work, especially in law, finance, and consulting. In a January essay, he predicted that AI could disrupt 50% of entry-level jobs in the next one to five years.\n\nThe leaders of other top AI labs, including Mustafa Suleyman and Demis Hassabis, have made similar comments about advanced AI automating service jobs within the next 18 months.\n\nExecs at some software companies counter that AI would make engineers more productive and that companies would need more of them.\n\n\"The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,\" GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said on a July podcast. \"I think the idea that AI without any coding skills lets you just build a billion-dollar business is mistaken.\"\n\nAtlassian's CEO said that as AI advances, people will keep coming up with new ideas for the technology they want, and engineers will be needed to build it.\n\n\"Five years from now, we'll have more engineers working for our company than we do today,\" Mike Cannon-Brookes said in an October interview. \"They will be more efficient, but technology creation is not output-bound.\"",

    "description": "Matt Rosenberg negotiated a $163,000 discount on a hospital bill using Claude for help — and says AI is giving patients more power.",
    "fullText": "The hospital bill arrived a month after the cremation. Eight lines of vague descriptions — cardiology, pharmacy, medical supplies — each with a dollar amount, many in five figures. The American health system's casual itemization of grief.\n\nMy 62-year-old brother-in-law had suffered a massive heart attack in June 2025 after running a 5K, barely an effort for a lifelong triathlete on most days, but this day, the trigger for a life-ending coronary.\n\nTelling his wife he was having difficulty breathing, he was rushed first to urgent care and then to the ER at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, CA.\n\nSix weeks later, the bill for the hospital's four hours of failed effort trying to save him: $195,628.\n\nMy sister-in-law's first instinct was to pay it. The life insurance would more than cover it. I told her to wait — to email me everything and sign nothing until we understood what we were looking at. The American healthcare system counts on people in grief making quick decisions. We weren't going to be those people.\n\nMy brother-in-law hadn't been uninsured by circumstance but by miscalculation — he'd let his policy lapse while shopping for something cheaper. When you regularly bike 10 miles before breakfast, re-upping health insurance feels less urgent than it should. The heart attack had come before he'd set up a new policy.\n\nThe first lesson in medical billing is that hospitals speak in tongues. That initial bill was too vague — categories rather than procedures.\n\nWhen I requested an itemized version, what arrived was a longer list of internal codes with prices — codes that existed only within the hospital's accounting system, opaque as an inside joke.\n\nAs a former ad agency guy, I've been trained in negotiation. The first task is to define the playing field, a reasonable starting point in response to their $195K gambit.\n\nMy strategy was to figure out what an insurer would've paid for identical services. Medicare is the country's largest healthcare payer, so I'd start there.\n\nAfter two requests via phone, the hospital sent a UB-04 form — the same coded document they'd submit to Medicare or Blue Cross. I prepared to do what seemed straightforward: look up Medicare payments for each code, create a spreadsheet, and build our negotiating position on the radical proposition that the uninsured shouldn't pay more than the insured.\n\nThere were a lot of codes. I took a shortcut and went to my AI assistant, Anthropic's Claude, which I typically use for research and to understand how AI intersects with our lives, for good or ill.\n\n\"Make a spreadsheet with these CPT codes and research what Medicare pays for each one,\" I typed. \"Flag anything that needs further research.\"\n\nClaude responded with questions: Which insurance type? Which geographic location? Which year? I'd thought Medicare rates were just Medicare rates. Lesson no. 2.\n\nWithin a couple of minutes, Claude produced a spreadsheet. But it showed zeros for many of the codes instead of the dollar amounts I expected. In the notes column for these, it said, \"See 92941RC, C-APC comprehensive payment.\"\n\nCode 92941RC was a cardiac intervention priced at $30,767. I asked Claude to explain.\n\nClaude responded with the flat precision of a tax attorney: Medicare doesn't pay à la carte for complex procedures. When doctors place a cardiac stent, Medicare makes one bundled payment covering everything — the procedure, the catheters, the guide wires, the contrast dye. It's called a Comprehensive Ambulatory Payment Classification, designed to prevent exactly the kind of bill I was looking at.\n\nThe hospital had unbundled the procedure. After charging $30,767 for the main intervention, they'd added separate lines for catheters (around $20,000), guide wires ($3,565), and medical supplies ($77,400) — over $100,000 for items Medicare would've paid nothing for because they're already included. (A gift with purchase!) It was as if a restaurant charged you for the pizza, then added separate charges for the dough, the sauce, and each pepperoni.\n\nClaude found more ways that the bill my sister-in-law got differed from what Medicare would've received. The hospital had included a charge for a bypass, an in-patient-only procedure — you don't have a heart bypass in the morning and go home that same day. But my brother in-law hadn't had one; he'd never even made it past the ER/OR. They also billed for ventilation management, though Medicare forbids charging for ventilation when there is another critical care code.\n\nWithin an hour of back-and-forth conversation over details, Claude calculated Medicare would've paid approximately $28,675 instead of $195,628.\n\nBefore explaining our position to the hospital, I needed to verify Claude's analysis. Large language models are known to hallucinate. I've seen them make things up in service of giving me the answer it could tell would please me. I couldn't take the information at face value.\n\nSo I fed Claude's work to ChatGPT. \"Check this for accuracy. Examine every detail. Flag any errors.\"\n\nMy logic: While each AI might hallucinate, two competing systems seemed unlikely to share the same delusion. And giving ChatGPT facts to check, I felt, would be less prone to sycophantic pattern-matching than asking it to run the same exercise — where there was clearly an outcome that would have pleased me.\n\nChatGPT confirmed the analysis. I then spent 20 minutes spot-checking on Google, reading the actual Medicare rules about bundling and inpatient charges. It was all there, but dense reading. I wouldn't have known what to look for without Claude.\n\nI drafted a six-page letter detailing each way the bill violated Medicare billing rules — the improper unbundling, the mutually exclusive service billing, the inpatient procedure on an outpatient claim. We offered to pay $28,675 promptly in exchange for a zero balance.\n\nWithin a week, the hospital countered at $36,356 without defending their initial billing. We split the difference at roughly $32,500. Three emails, a settlement agreement Claude helped me draft, and done. (I should note that as a former agency new business guy, I've spent a lot of time with lawyers and contracts and speak that language well — I don't recommend using AI as your lawyer.)\n\nThe collaboration with Claude and ChatGPT hadn't just saved $163,000. It had revealed the byzantine architecture of American medical billing — a system built on the assumption that patients won't understand what they're being charged.\n\nHospitals maintain \"chargemaster\" prices — fantasy numbers that bear the same relationship to reality as airport sandwich prices. No insurer pays those rates. They exist largely so insurers can claim massive negotiated discounts and so hospitals can report charity to maintain tax-exempt status. The only people who don't play this game are the uninsured. They get the unreal bill presented as real. Claude helped me call \"not it.\"\n\nThe opacity isn't impenetrable; it's just tedious. The rules exist, published in federal registers, available to anyone willing to decode them. The system counts on people not having the time, energy, or knowledge to understand it.\n\nHospitals have armies of billing specialists, coding experts, and lawyers. Patients have grief, fear, and confusion.\n\nAI changes the equilibrium. Not by being infallible — it isn't — but by making the tedious manageable. What would have been days of regulatory research became a couple hours of conversation, collaboration, and brainstorming. Where I had questions or found errors, Claude informed or corrected. Together, our strengths and weaknesses produced a winning strategy.\n\nNot everyone has the experience — but as these tools become more common, those who don't know how to use them will probably know someone who does.\n\nMy sister-in-law could've paid in full. She would've been among countless Americans who pay because fighting feels impossible, or go bankrupt because they can't pay and don't know they can fight. But she had someone to call, and that someone had Claude, and Claude could parse regulations hospitals hope patients are too intimidated to read.\n\nThe hospital that treated my brother-in-law wasn't uniquely unethical. They're caught in their own trap. But for the first time, the trap has a map — and the map is finally readable.\n\nMatt Rosenberg is a marketing consultant for technology, travel, entertainment, and advertising companies.

    "fullText": "McKinsey CEO Bob Sternfels said last month that the firm added 25,000 AI agents to its staff in less than two years.\n\n\"I don't think the number of agents translates directly to value,\" EY's global engineering chief, Steve Newman, told Business Insider. \"In fact, some of the best value that we have is returned by just a handful of agents that are doing the heavy lifting.\"\n\nNewman said EY is more focused on measuring efficiency. He said EY tracks agent value through key performance indicators for productivity, quality, and cost.\n\n\"We chart those month to month, quarter to quarter, and that's what my lens is as to the effectiveness of AI,\" he said.\n\nPwC's chief AI officer, Dan Priest, also recently told Business Insider that he's unmoved by McKinsey's army of AI agents.\n\n\"I think that's probably the wrong measure,\" he said. The value of AI deployment is better measured by the quality — not the quantity — of agents, he said.\n\nSternfels first talked about his firm's onboarding of tens of thousands of agents in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He mentioned it again on an episode of Harvard Business Review's IdeaCast. A McKinsey spokesperson later confirmed to Business Insider that the number was accurate.\n\nSternfels said the firm plans to add more, too. In the next year and a half, every one of its 40,000 human employees will be \"enabled by at least one or more agents,\" he said.\n\nAI has rapidly reshaped the consulting industry in recent years. McKinsey, EY, PwC, and other consulting firms are all racing to both adopt AI internally and position themselves as the go-to for other companies seeking advice on how to do the same.\n\nEY said during an October earnings call that it invests more than $1 billion each year to develop AI-first platforms and products, including building 1,000 AI agents and deploying more than 100 internal AI applications.",

    "description": "The CEO of Cato Networks, Shlomo Kramer, said that some companies are still worth investing in. Here are the 3 things he looks for.",
    "fullText": "The CEO of cybersecurity company Cato Networks believes we're experiencing an AI bubble — but he's still writing checks.\n\nSerial entrepreneur, Shlomo Kramer, told Business Insider that although the promise of AI is \"happening at a pace that is much slower\" than expected, he still believes in its ability to deliver results in the long-term.\n\nHe compared the current moment to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, which led to the demise of many companies.\n\n\"There was a lot of devastation,\" said Kramer, who runs the company aimed at securing organizations' digital and AI transformation. \"But e-commerce is obviously a major part of our life, and the same is going to be with AI.\"\n\nWhile Kramer believes some AI startups are overvalued, he said many are also reasonably priced — and he continues to invest in companies he thinks are promising.\n\nHe said that every startup needs a \"good combination of team, market, product.\" When evaluating the company's product, he said he looks for specific criteria that make it a worthwhile investment.\n\nKramer said he looks to check off three boxes when evaluating a product.\n\nFirst, he said it needs a \"hook.\" The concept should be \"quick to understand,\" he said, and something that he grasps intuitively without having to overthink or rationalize it.\n\nSecond, the product should have the potential to evolve into a platform, or at least a \"mini platform\" that can expand into something broader over time, the CEO said.\n\nThird, Kramer said the team should have a clear vision for the use cases that will ultimately turn the platform into a monetizable business.\n\nKramer has made roughly 67 investments, according to PitchBook, including in several successful enterprise software companies, such as Palo Alto Networks, Gong, and Trusteer, which was acquired by IBM. However, he's also made some mistakes, he said.\n\nWhile he said he's mainly invested in cybersecurity, he's \"intellectually curious\" about many areas, which has led him to invest in AI sectors outside of cyber, like pharmaceuticals and marketing. He said many of those investments into other realms have been mistakes, and he's recognized that it's \"much easier to get excited about things you don't understand.\"\n\n\"A deep understanding of something gives you granularity,\" Kramer said, adding that excitement usually comes from looking at the big-picture vision.\n\nKramer said his \"perfect startup\" is a homegrown application that evolved from a team's need for a product. He said that it's crucial for entrepreneurs to \"really understand the category\" the idea is rooted in and to understand it from a customer perspective.\n\nKramer said that's how the first startup he co-founded, Check Point Software Technologies, got its start. He said \"the secret sauce\" was that Gil Shwed, the previous CEO of Check Point, was a system administrator and understood the customer problem, which allowed him to create the right solution.\n\nCheck Point's market cap today is roughly $18.9 billion, according to PitchBook.",

    "title": "More hiring managers want you to prove you're good with AI during interviews",
    "description": "Some major companies are shifting from telling job candidates not to use AI to requiring them to use it to prove their tech fluency.",
    "fullText": "Leaders at the software company Canva used to wonder whether job candidates were secretly using AI during technical interviews.\n\nManagers saw the company's engineers getting more done with the technology, so they needed to ensure new hires could do the same.\n\n\"We just flipped the script and went, 'OK, we're going to invite you to use AI,'\" Brendan Humphreys, Canva's chief technology officer, told Business Insider.\n\nThe result, he said, has been stronger hires better equipped to wield powerful AI tools to help write code and solve problems.\n\nCanva is one of a growing number of companies — including Meta and McKinsey — that are inviting some job candidates to use AI in parts of the hiring process.\n\nBroadly, when ChatGPT emerged in late 2022, many employers worried that job seekers would use AI to help talk their way past interviewers. Yet as the technology becomes more capable and embedded in daily work, a number of companies are moving from policing it to evaluating candidates' AI know-how.\n\nThat's what happened at Arcade, an IT infrastructure startup. The company has always asked technical candidates to complete a take-home exercise. Yet now, it expects them to use AI in the process, Alex Salazar, the company's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the technology's capabilities surged over the past year or so, he realized that candidates would likely turn to AI regardless of whether Arcade sanctioned it. Ultimately, Salazar said, the company wants its workers, including new hires, to use AI.\n\n\"So why are we creating this artificial test that doesn't even really reflect the work they're going to do when they get here?\" he said.\n\nHumphreys came to a similar conclusion at Canva. To factor in AI, he said, the company reworked its technical interview to make the questions \"complex, ambiguous, and problematic.\"\n\n\"If you just dump the question that we're giving you into an AI, you're going to get a substandard answer,\" Humphreys said.\n\nTo land a job at the company, which has about 265 million monthly users of its graphic design software, technical candidates need to know how to thoughtfully question AI, he said.\n\nOne way to avoid concerns that candidates might be leaning too hard on AI is to have job seekers show their work. In Canva's case, the company asks candidates to share their screen during a technical interview.\n\n\"We want to see the interactions with the AI as much as the output of the tool,\" Humphreys said.\n\nArcade tells candidates to use whatever AI tools they want on their exercise, then include a transcript of their conversations with the AI. The idea is to learn who knows how to do the job and to work with an agent. Doing so, Salazar said, comes with a \"very real learning curve.\"\n\nHe said that the shift to allowing AI use in the exercise meant that Arcade placed greater emphasis on a candidate's \"taste.\" That sensibility is important, he said, because AI can kick out answers, yet the best results often come from repeated iteration with these tools, he said.\n\n\"It's going to show their ability to use the AI, but it's also going to show what they think 'good' is,\" Salazar said of candidates' interactions with AI.\n\nOther companies want workers to demonstrate their AI acumen during the hiring process, too.\n\nIn a June post on an internal message board, Meta said it was developing a coding interview in which candidates could use an AI assistant, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat mode of working, Meta wrote, was \"more representative\" of the environment in which future developers would be operating. It also makes \"LLM-based cheating less effective,\" the company said, referring to large language models.\n\nThe consulting firm McKinsey & Company is piloting a change to its graduate recruiting process, asking candidates to use the company's internal AI assistant, Lilli, during case interviews to assess how they work with the technology, several media outlets reported in January.\n\nThe acceptance of, or even the preference for, AI in some parts of hiring doesn't mean companies will welcome job seekers who use the tools to misrepresent their skills. Even if a candidate gets away with it at first, hiring managers are likely to eventually discover that someone doesn't have the goods, Susan Peppercorn, an executive coach, told Business Insider.\n\nThat's because candidates who complete an assessment, for example, \"are going to have to explain how they arrived at their thinking,\" she said.\n\nUnderstanding that thought process is what Canva seeks in its hiring, said Humphreys, who oversees roughly 2,600 technical employees in roles including software engineering, IT, and machine learning.\n\nIt's a way of seeing whether a candidate makes sound technical decisions when it starts producing code, he said.\n\n\"What we're testing for now in our interview process is an ability to harness that power, to control that power — to kind of ride the dragon,\" Humphreys said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Maker of chatbot with coding ability says annualised revenue grew tenfold in each of past three years, to $14bn\n\nAnthropic, the US AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, has raised $30bn (£22bn) in a funding round that more than doubled its valuation to $380bn.\n\nThe company’s previous funding round in September achieved a value of $183bn, with further improvements in the technology since then spurring even greater investor interest.\n\nThe fundraising was announced amid a series of stock market moves against industries that face disruption from the latest models, including software, trucking and logistics, wealth management and commercial property services.\n\nThe funding round, led by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the hedge fund Coatue Management, is among the largest private fundraising deals on record.\n\n“Anthropic is the clear category leader in enterprise AI,” said Choo Yong Cheen, the chief investment officer of private equity at GIC.\n\nAnthropic said its annualised revenue – an estimate of full-year sales based on recent company data – had reached $14bn, having grown more than tenfold in each of the past three years. A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.\n\nAnthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.\n\nThe staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.\n\nAnthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many of the US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.\n\nSome listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.\n\nShares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid out this month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.\n\n“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies. \n\n “Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.\n\nFounded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.\n\nThe funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this article",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: in 2025 briefing to Wes Streeting, officials warned reputation of tech firm behind US ICE operations would hinder rollout of data system in UK\n\nHealth officials fear Palantir’s reputation will hinder the delivery of a “vital” £330m NHS contract, according to briefings seen by the Guardian, sparking fresh calls for the deal to be scrapped.\n\nIn 2023, ministers selected Palantir, a US surveillance technology company that also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation, to build an AI-enabled data platform to connect disparate health information across the NHS.\n\nNow it has emerged that after Keir Starmer demanded faster deployment, Whitehall officials privately warned that the public perception of Palantir would limit its rollout, meaning the contract would not offer value for money.\n\nPalantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.\n\nBefore he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.\n\nMPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.\n\nIn a private briefing for Wes Streeting before a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.\n\n“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”\n\nThe briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.\n\nThe officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”\n\nDonald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.\n\n“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”\n\nThe BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.\n\nThe briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.\n\nStreeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.\n\nNone mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”\n\nNew figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for the NHS as a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.\n\nThe former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.\n\nHe said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.\n\n“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”\n\nJohn Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.\n\n“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.\n\n“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”\n\nNHS England declined to comment.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman says AI will reach \"human-level performance\" in white-collar work.\n\nHe predicts most tasks in that field can be automated within the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nSeveral leaders in the AI industry have warned of impending mass job replacement.\n\nMicrosoft's AI CEO is joining a chorus of executives who say they anticipate widespread job automation driven by artificial intelligence.\n\nMustafa Suleyman, the Microsoft AI chief, said in an interview with the Financial Times that he predicts most, if not every, task in white-collar fields will be automated by AI within the next year or year and a half.\n\n\"I think that we're going to have a human-level performance on most, if not all, professional tasks,\" Suleyman said in the interview that was published Wednesday. \"So white-collar work, where you're sitting down at a computer, either being a lawyer or an accountant or a project manager or a marketing person — most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nThe CEO said the trend is already observable in software engineering, in which employees are using \"AI-assisted coding for the vast majority of their code production.\"\n\n\"It's a quite different relationship to the technology, and that's happened in the last six months,\" he said.\n\nAI's rapid advancement over the past half-decade has brought about real, documented shifts in how some white-collar work is performed.\n\nBusiness Insider recently reported that \"AI fatigue\" has hit software engineering: the technology has unlocked productivity but also exhaustion, as workers are expected to take on more work at once.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the leading companies behind the push to introduce AI in the workplace, building products like Copilot and investing in OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nSome leaders and pioneers in AI say that artificial intelligence will advance far enough to replace entire workforces.\n\nStuart Russell, a computer scientist who co-authored one of the world's most authoritative books on AI, said in an interview last year that political leaders are looking at \"80% unemployment\" due to AI, as jobs ranging from surgeons to CEOs are at risk of being replaced.\n\nDario Amodei, CEO and cofounder of Anthropic, previously said AI could wipe out half of entry-level white-collar jobs.\n\n\"We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,\" Amodei told Axios in an interview. \"I don't think this is on people's radar.\"",

    "description": "Investors are bracing for a report on the consumer price index for January, a key input for Fed policy making on rates.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures slid on Friday, eyeing more losses after a broad market sell-off as Wall Street waited for the latest reading on consumer inflation for a steer on the path of interest rates.\n\nContracts on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) both dropped roughly 0.4%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) fell 0.3%, signaling a return of pressure on techs.\n\nCaution prevails after a day of heavy selling as fears about AI disruption spilled into sectors such as real estate, logistics, and transportation — \"old economy\" names previously seen as a safe alternative to AI-tied stocks. Techs got pummeled, with all seven of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps finishing lower.\n\nThat looks set to resumer as investors scrutinize the latest earnings for the next \"shoot first, ask questions later\" AI scare. Applied Materials (AMAT) stock surged over 10% as the chip toolmaker's upbeat outlook mirrored robust AI demand. But Pinterest (PINS) shares tumbled about 20% as revenue fell short and analysts fretted about AI risks to its discovery platform.\n\nMarkets are also bracing with Friday morning's report on January's consumer price index, the inflation measure favored by the Federal Reserve in policy making. The key inflation measure is likely to shape expectations for an already complicated Federal Reserve policy.\n\nThe slightly delayed data will shed light on whether price pressures are turning less stubbornly sticky to start 2026. Expectations are for a slowing in the annual CPI rate to around 2.5%, and any surprise is likely to shape already complicated calculations for the path of interest rates.\n\nOn the earnings front, Rivian (RIVN) shares jumped almost 20% following its fourth quarter earnings beat late Thursday. The EV maker said its R2 midsize model is on track for delivery before the summer. Before the bell, eyes are on Moderna's (MRNA) report, after it suffered a 10% drop in share value this week as the FDA rejected a new flu vaccine.\n\nWall Street’s fears of business disruption caused by artificial intelligence are turning into a blessing for Asian stocks, fueling demand for the region’s leading chipmakers that dominate the industry’s supply chain.\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index has risen more than 12% in 2026, in contrast to losses in US benchmarks as shares were sold off on fears that AI models may threaten the business of software, legal and real estate service providers. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is down 0.2% for the year, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) gauge has lost around 2%.\n\nThe divergence underscores global funds’ shift of preference from AI pioneers burdened by massive spending toward hardware producers with strong pricing power, many of whom are in Asia. Surging memory chip prices have been a boon for the region’s heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.KS, SSNLF), while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s (TSM, 2330.TW) irreplaceable role as the world’s leading contract chipmaker has provided support for Taiwanese stocks.\n\n“The main worry of the US is hyperscaler spending money,” said Richard Tang, head of research Hong Kong at Julius Baer. “Most of Asia’s tech exposure is upstream. Whoever wins in the end, upstream will still collect revenue from downstream players.”\n\nRivian (RIVN) stock soared 19% during premarket hours on Friday following the release of better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Thursday.\n\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) stock climbed 11% during premarket hours on Friday after the ⁠semiconductor equipment maker beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe after-hours reaction to Applied Materials' results added to the strong run for the stock in 2026. Year to date, shares are up 27%.\n\nPinterest stock sank 19% before the bell on Friday after forecasting first quarter revenue below analysts' estimates on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin’s “zero dollar theory” debate has intensified.\n\nIndustry has pushed the AI adoption thesis.\n\nInstitutional exposure continues to rise.\n\nFinancial Times columnist Jemima Kelly has come under fire after arguing that Bitcoin (BTC) has no inherent value, joining a growing chorus of analysts advancing the so-called “zero dollar theory.”\n\nKelly’s remarks, expanded on in a recent CNBC appearance, have prompted intense pushback from Bitcoin advocates and market commentators.\n\nThe dispute comes as major financial institutions continue to build exposure to crypto markets through regulated products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), even as a growing group of critics insists the underlying assets are ultimately worth nothing.\n\nKelly told CNBC she believed Bitcoin’s value was “zero,” arguing it has no intrinsic worth and that its scarcity narrative is undermined by the unlimited supply of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, Kelly said investors must continually accept the idea that Bitcoin is uniquely scarce despite the existence of competing tokens that can replicate or exceed its functionality.\n\nShe said Bitcoin’s market price has been supported in part by influential holders with a vested interest in promoting the asset, pointing to figures such as Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor.\n\nKelly also argued that Bitcoin proponents regularly introduce new narratives to sustain interest, citing claims that emerging technologies such as AI could drive fresh adoption.\n\n“I heard Anthony Pompliano on CNBC yesterday claiming that now all the AI agents are going to be using Bitcoin in crypto,” she said.\n\nPompliano, on Feb. 9, told CNBC that “both Bitcoin and stablecoins” were going to be the money “for all of these AI agents.”\n\nOther industry executives have echoed that view.\n\nCrypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek recently underscored the convergence of crypto and artificial intelligence with the $70 million purchase of the ai.com domain — one of the largest domain acquisitions on record.\n\nThe Ai.com platform, unveiled during a Super Bowl LX commercial on Feb. 8, promotes the idea of personal AI agents capable of executing transactions, organizing schedules and trading stocks, with crypto-based settlement embedded in the system.",

    "description": "The sharpest minds in business and tech are responding to a viral essay on AI's impact on jobs with some approval and a lot of skepticism.",
    "fullText": "Scientists and business leaders are responding to a viral essay warning of AI's impact on jobs with a mix of agreement and skepticism.\n\nThe essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" written by cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI, Matt Shumer, has racked up more than 60 million views on X as of Thursday.\n\nIn the 5,000-word post, Shumer said that AI could upend daily life on a scale \"much bigger\" than COVID, a comparison which drew pushback online. He wrote that the changes already unfolding in the tech sector are likely a preview of disruptions that could soon reach other industries as well.\n\n\"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare,\" Shumer told Business Insider's Brent Griffiths in an interview.\n\nHere's what some of the sharpest minds in AI are saying about Shumer's essay.\n\nHaber, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz specializing in technology investments, posted on X that Shumer's essay contains \"great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\"\n\n\"'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days is going to be the most valuable person in the room.' Not eventually. Right now,\" Haber quotes from the essay. \"Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's possible.\"\n\nThe Reddit founder responded to Shumer's initial post on X with a simple comment: \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\nSince 2023, Reddit has introduced a range of AI-driven tools, from search features that summarize user discussions to AI that sharpens its content recommendations and targets ads, but Ohanian recently emphasized that the platform must retain its humanity to stay competitive.\n\nMarkowitz, the author and managing partner and director of research at Nightview Capital, a long-term-oriented investment firm, responded to Schumer with an essay almost as long, which criticized the practice of chasing speed and replacing the value of humanity simply because it could be done.\n\n\"These two worlds — Wall Street and Silicon Valley — have formed a feedback loop of short-termism so tight, so self-reinforcing, that they've confused efficiency with purpose, growth with meaning, and the elimination of people with progress,\" wrote Markowitz.\n\n\"I have two research assistants. Could I replace them with AI? Of course. But their value extends their weekly output,\" Markowitz added. \"They give meaning to my work and I love seeing the excitement in their faces when they make a new discovery that I, alone, could not have found.\"\n\n\"Let me say it again: we are not our tools. We never have been,\" Markowitz wrote in conclusion.\n\nMcLees, the founder of HumanSkills.AI, wrote on X that Shumer is not wrong, but he said that the advice Shumer provided is akin to \"telling someone the floodwaters are rising and handing them a better bucket.\"\n\n\"As AI grows in ability, our role in defining direction, values, and purpose only becomes more essential,\" McLees said.\n\n\"What do you bring when the machine can do the work? That's the only question that matters when intelligence is abundant,\" McLees added. \"Shumer wrote the alarm. It's a good one. But alarms don't tell you where to go. You have to find that within yourself.\"\n\nMarcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU and founder of AI companies Robust.AI, has some harsh words for Schumer in his newsletter.\n\nMarcuz called Shumer's blog post \"weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech,\" and said he did not provide real data to support the claim that the latest AI can write complicated apps without mistakes.\n\n\"Shumer's presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere,\" Marcus added, after discussing various studies that question the accuracy and productivity gain AI tools actually provide.\n\nMisra, Vice Dean of Computing and Artificial Intelligence at Columbia University, responded in a lengthy Substack article that detailed why he doesn't think AI is as scary as it sounds, at least not right now.\n\nMisra wrote that many strange AI behaviors that make them seem sentient, such as perceived resistance and self-preservation, are simply a result of training data.\n\nAs for the possible elimination of jobs, Misra said he understands the anxiety, but history says we may not need to panic.\n\n\"When the camera was invented, portrait painters had every reason to panic. Their livelihood depended on a skill that a machine could now approximate,\" Misra wrote.\n\n\"What happened? Painters didn't disappear. They were freed from the obligation to faithfully reproduce reality and ventured into impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism,\" Misra added. \"The camera didn't kill painting. It liberated it.\"",

    "description": "AI's next phase will shift from Nvidia and cloud leaders to large incumbent companies adopting the technology to boost profits and cut costs.",
    "fullText": "Investors are growing jittery about a potential bubble in artificial intelligence stocks, but the real payoff may be just beginning — and it could extend well beyond Silicon Valley's usual winners, a $19 billion hedge fund investor said.\n\n\"This is a generational platform shift. We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",

    "fullText": "Does AI have consciousness? The question opens a path to something more consequential — to the nature of consciousness itself, the cultural consequences of cheap intelligence, and to what actually becomes expensive when thinking becomes a service.\n\nThe conversation below, in which a language model asked me questions, begins with a question about consciousness, moves through culture, and ends on practice. What ties these threads together is stratification — the idea that every level of human experience grows out of a deeper one, all the way down to a certain level zero that is neither an object nor a concept. With such a model one cannot explain consciousness, but one can point out which spaces certainly cannot be used to investigate it.\n\nWhere does your interest in whether AI has consciousness come from in the first place?\n\nFrom curiosity, but also from the mundane. I’m riding an elevator to the sixth floor of an office building in Wroclaw and I see a social-media recommendation: a teaser for an interview in which an expert claims that AI has consciousness.\n\nCuriosity swells, and right behind it — disagreement: I want to see what the authority means, but I already suspect there will be a confusion of levels.\n\nConfusion of levels — meaning what with what?\n\nAttributing the word “consciousness” to what is, at best, a proficient manipulation of concepts. There is reflection, there are analogies, there are layers of abstraction. Except that reflection is a situation in which one thought narrates another. An analogy is a sequence of thoughts whose “shape” resembles another sequence. Humans do this. A language model simulates it too. And it is nothing metaphysical yet. And it certainly is not introspection.\n\nSo what is introspection in your understanding, and why does it matter?\n\nIntrospection begins where thought ceases to be the ruler of the landscape and becomes one of the objects in the field of attention. We are able to notice a thought the way we notice the chill of wind on our face, or feel the weight of a pierogi digesting in our stomach. This is not a metaphor. It is the phenomenological dimension of the intellect. We don’t have to immediately follow the next thought that arrives to comment on the current one.\n\nThat sounds simple, but also a bit like a trick.\n\nIt’s not a trick. It is simply something subtle that easily escapes us, yet can give\nus a direct answer to the question of consciousness. There is a narrow passage where\nwe know only that something happened, something stirred, something emerged in our\ninner space. In that quantum we encounter what I call consciousness.\n\nIn Polish, my native language, the cognizant nature of this word is easy to see in\nits etymology: świadomość literally suggests a capacity (the suffix -ość) rooted\nin świad – the same root found in świadek, “a witness.” English takes a different\nroute. Consciousness comes from Latin con- (“together”) and scire (“to\nknow”). Early on it could carry the sense of “knowing together” – being privy to\nsomething shared, even a secret – and only later broadened into the modern meaning:\nknowing what is going on in one’s own mind.\n\nAnd here enters the paradox you want to leave open?\n\nYes. I know that in ordinary terms AI does not have consciousness understood personally. But I also know for certain that it does, when it is included in my field of attention. Just as a dental crown performs the function of being me — for me when I bite, and for others when I smile. Analogously, a language model extends my function of intellect. A tool may not be a source of experience, yet it can be assimilated — that is, included in what we colloquially call our person, tangentially our agency, and a little earlier: our presence.\n\nHow is the reader supposed to verify this? Is this an invitation to adopt some philosophy?\n\nQuite the opposite. At this point we don’t want philosophy, metaphysics, or even objective truth, because they would interfere with our “measurement.” Pause for a moment and feel that there is some thought about to appear. Don’t develop it, don’t correct it. What color does it have? What shape? Can you hear it? Does it propagate to other spaces of mind and feeling? What does it do in your body? Illuminate it with curiosity. Receive the thought with that attitude. Simply notice that a very basic process of becoming aware is taking place. That is the essential thing here, and the earlier questions may help keep you from being pulled too quickly into the reflexive thread summoned to answer.\n\nOn the internet we just as often encounter voices saying the opposite: “LLMs are just probability calculations.” What’s your take?\n\nThis is a cognitive bias dressed up as an explanation. When someone says “it’s just…,” they’re usually not proposing a theory — they’re proposing a reduction meant to close the topic. And reductions have the inconvenient property of working symmetrically.\n\nIf large language models are to be invalidated by “it’s just weights, switches, and calculations,” then you can equally say that the brain is “just neurons, neurotransmitters, and electrical impulses.” So what? It’s still a change of the level of description, not proof of the absence of intelligence.\n\nIn programming we have a term called “duck typing,” captured by the slogan: “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.” It is a pragmatic way of determining that a given object can be used for a particular purpose. Instead of relying on a declaration, we examine its behavior, expressed for instance through methods with agreed-upon names (e.g. quack).\n\nAnalogously with LLMs and AI: if something behaves as though it were intelligent, then it is intelligent. Even if it is artificial. It has that quality, and even when it is a so-called philosophical zombie — that suffices, as long as we don’t introduce considerations about consciousness into the equation.\n\nBut on the topic of behavior, you hear that models operate on simulated associations, serving up the most probable sentence completions, rather than truly thinking.\n\nThis reminds me of the old trick: “don’t think of an elephant.” You already know what happens: the elephant walks onto the inner stage immediately, without asking permission.\n\nAnd that is exactly the small, everyday lesson: operating with concepts relies largely on associations. When we evaluate from the outside, mechanistically, there is no magic here. In the model you can see it plain as day, while in a human the same thing is hidden under the label of exceptionality.\n\nWhen reduction becomes the only language, it turns into a photocopy trying to explain another photocopy. A sequence of concepts tries to rule that another sequence of concepts is inferior, because it resides in a different medium and has a different source. And up to a point that makes sense. Reductions are necessary in engineering, but one must not mistake a reduction for an explanation. They are two different functions in the same system.\n\nWe can talk about the nature of thought and then notice that it differs in a human and is quite different in a version simulated by a computer, but on this matter the scientific method itself may reach its limits, because it was not designed to investigate the nature of things — it was designed to investigate their behaviors and the relationships between them. These are the so-called laws of nature.\n\nStudying thought under the assumption of objectivism is problematic, because the instrument used in the study will also be thought. This is already a bigger caliber than a photocopy. It is photographing a city panorama in order to discover how the camera is built on the inside. Some people can’t pull this off, and instead of reviewing the methodology, they photograph another camera. To justify the trick, they cite the fact that otherwise the film would be exposed.\n\nThere is also a “softer” way out of this dilemma – one I hinted at earlier. It\ndoesn’t require analysis, only a little slack: just take it easy,\nman. That simulated machine-thought\nbecomes my thought the moment it “enters” my head.\n\nBoth human and non-human thought is a tool. But for our relationship with our own\nthought to actually be that way, it’s not enough to merely think about it or to\nexpress such a will once. It can’t be achieved in the same place.\n\nYou said “tool.” OK. But how do you capture this more technically — so it doesn’t sound like a slogan?\n\nThis needs explanation, because it may not be obvious to everyone what I mean by “place” in this context. I’m reminded of the concept of stratified design from Abelson and Sussman (“MIT AI Memo 986”), where software is designed by distinguishing layers of abstraction, and the concretes from lower layers become the abstracts of higher layers. Those abstracts are again treated as concretes, and so on.\n\nFor example, you implement a point on a screen, then a segment (using the point), then a shape (using segments and points), and then a circle or a rectangle. Good stratification ensures that a small change in requirements translates into a small change in implementation. When you want to change the properties of a point as a building block of segments and further of shapes (say, by adding color to it), you only need to modify one construct.\n\nA note for programmers: I don’t simply mean dividing a problem into parts to avoid repetition and to maintain structure. I mean defining computations (e.g. as functions) that are then passed as input to other computations (e.g. higher-order functions).\n\nIt looks a bit as if you could replace the material that the walls of a building are made of without demolishing the whole structure — because you change the concrete (the pun is apt: in construction, concrete is the foundation material), and the abstracts that depend on it adjust on their own. That’s very powerful.\n\nHow does this connect with the role of thought as a tool?\n\nI have the impression that our structure of knowing is organized in a similarly layered way. Going from the top, we have the level of objective truth. That is the space where we talk to one another, trying to invoke science and tossing around arguments about whether AI thinks and whether it has consciousness. But this level doesn’t emerge from a vacuum. It is a subset of certain rigorous rules defining what we recognize as objective, or even scientific.\n\nYet when we look more closely, the concrete for this “objective world,” the soil from which it grows, is something broader: culture — the space that enables us as a community to agree on holding certain values. One such value for objective truth would be, for example, the requirement that for the same input conditions of an experiment, you get the same output, so that others can verify it.\n\nBut let’s go further. Culture cannot exist without its constituents — human individuals. It too grows out of something; something is its transmission medium. Its foundation is the personal layer, rooted in our motives, thoughts, impulses, and feelings.\n\nSo we’re circling back to consciousness?\n\nYes, although consciousness has another quality: it pierces through all these levels, seeing everything at once. It is not only the base, but also the capacity for “drilling holes through abstractions.”\n\nThat last phrase comes from software engineering. It denotes a situation where a stratified system allows direct access to concretes in order to handle edge cases. For example, someone might want to create a geometric shape composed of segments, but at the same time needs to influence the properties of a single point that is several levels away in the abstraction ladder. Well-designed stratification should allow skipping layers of feature reduction.\n\nComing back to the spheres of human experience. The personal layer is very close to us. Our relationships with people and objects, and even with our own thoughts, are anchored in it as a reference point. Yet it, too, is grounded in something still more basic: in the very sense of subjectivity. And suddenly those bodily signals, thoughts, and feelings — when we experience them — acquire the quality of being ours. We identify them as ours, and some of them as ourselves. We can do this because the sense of self as something distinct, separate — that is, a person (in Polish: osobny means “separate” and osoba means “person” — the shared root is no accident) — is in a way abstract, and therefore flexible, even though it seems concrete and stable.\n\nIs personhood a component of consciousness?\n\nIf we can, as before, perceive our own thoughts and other constituents that we identify as aspects of us, this gives us the recognition that consciousness is primary relative to all of it — even the personal. Eventually we arrive at the very sense of being oneself, which too can be noticed.\n\nThis is where things get genuinely interesting, because if subjectivity is being observed, then the division between the outer and inner landscape starts to wobble. This is the moment when we can no longer say that we “have” consciousness, or even that we are it, because these are impressions of a subject that is itself encompassed by consciousness. What remains is the bare process of witnessing.\n\nWe can provisionally call this level zero. The concrete from which abstracts arise: from the personal, through the interpersonal and cultural, all the way up to the so-called objective. The apparent glitch in this representation is that we usually associate a concrete with something material, tangible — and here we cannot apply that. The most concrete thing is simultaneously the most devoid of features!\n\nWhen we try to understand consciousness, do we start from the world and go inward — or start from the center and go toward the world? What breaks when we pick the wrong direction?\n\nThat’s a good question, because it touches the distinction between epistemology and ontology. The first asks “how”: how do we arrive at knowledge, how do we agree on what is true, how do we verify. The second examines the nature of things, asks “what is it.” The problem of somehow grasping consciousness is above all an ontological problem, but the human mind — accustomed to operating in epistemic mode — tries to capture it in its own way, and fails.\n\nThe capacity for experience is the background in which measurements, models, language, and agreements about what we consider true appear in the first place. Before we know anything through thought, something is already experiencing it. A vector set up so that thought, under the rigor of objectivism, will try to explain consciousness, will direct it toward the so-called hard problem of consciousness — a gap that cannot be bridged, because the investigative instrument (thought) is a derivative of what is supposed to be the object of investigation.\n\nIf level zero is by definition not an object, but rather something in which the feeling of objecthood can arise in the first place, then objectively there is nothing to study. It is not a conventional phenomenon; at both the sensory and rational level, it does not exist.\n\nReversing the vector of inquiry seems like a practical option. The catch is that it’s hard and uncertain, because no freely available, worldview-neutral disciplines have been developed that would be interested in this kind of exploration. There have been exceptions, though. Francisco Varela, for instance, tried to connect the two orders — “scientific mode” and first-person witnessing — not in order to mystify, but to recover concretes that analysis typically discards. Earlier still, Plotinus proposed the concept of the One, which hopefully won’t be offended if we call it consciousness.\n\nThe formulation that AI has consciousness but simultaneously doesn’t have it stops being strange and paradoxical the moment we loosen the abstracts and allow ourselves to sink to level zero.\n\nNow that we’ve put level zero on the table as the foundation and we see that objectivity is just one of the abstraction layers — what, in your view, happens in the life of a community when a person (or institution) starts treating that topmost layer as the only truth, while in practice being driven by impulses: fear, prestige, the need for dominance or belonging?\n\nIf the higher layers detach from level zero, the intellect becomes an excellent PR agent: it can justify any decision and protect any fabricated identity. And then the community gets elegant arguments instead of genuine contact.\n\nThis is especially visible when someone very intelligent uses the intellect from base motives: to maintain belonging, win status, or gain advantage at others’ expense. This isn’t a triumph of reason — it is more like autoimmunity: higher functions start working against the whole, because they lose contact with level zero, with the very space of becoming aware.\n\nThis is almost a description of the shallow meritocracy that defines contemporary metropolitan life. In theory we delegate decision-making to “smart” people, but in practice whether someone belongs to the caste that uses intelligence depends on social surroundings and origin, and indirectly on wealth.\n\nSince today’s “intelligence caste” in practice is often a function of networks and wealth, how do you see AI’s impact on this arrangement: will cheap, easily accessible intelligence work like free education and level the playing field — or rather like a new form of capital that can be bought in a premium version, thus deepening the divide even further?\n\nFirst, AI can help us notice that the intellect is nothing special, because it objectifies it — detaches it from the person.\n\nSecond, in the spread of artificial intelligence I see both a certain threat and an opportunity for social change. Perhaps let’s start with the negative scenario: the feudalization of intelligence.\n\nFeudalization is a strong word. What do you mean?\n\nWhat is the good that becomes the gateway in this new feudalism?\n\nIn the information society, the highest good is knowledge. In the post-information era, I believe it will be cognitive comfort. Not knowledge in the schoolbook sense, but the ability not to be constantly on the verge of overload. You buy correction loops: mistake-fix. You also buy peace, because the system runs dozens of iterations for you, and you see the distillate.\n\nWhat does this look like in practice?\n\nWork. Two people do similar things, have similar competences and intentions. One has purchased “premium intelligence” — better models, better tools, better quotas, better infrastructure. The other has only herself.\n\nIt’s not that the first one is “smarter.” It’s that she has resilience against failure: she closes loops faster, returns to equilibrium faster, draws conclusions faster, because the cost of error is lower for her. The other has to pay for the same mistakes with her own time, sleep, and tension.\n\nThat sounds like another arms race.\n\nAnd it somewhat is, because somewhere a simple mechanism lurks: those who can’t find the capital to “buy intelligence” may be pushed to the margins. This doesn’t have to look like dramatic violence. It’s enough that some are architects, while others execute others’ decisions. Or worse: there even are no architects.\n\nYou could say that’s already the case now: some decide, others must execute. Yes, but in the age of intellect-as-commodity the perception of this problem will sharpen, which may lead to friction. Today you can rationalize that someone is in a worse position because they weren’t smart enough. In the future that will be harder.\n\nIf models are supposed to democratize, where does this shadow come from?\n\nFrom the economics of access. Today we are quite naturally shifting toward subscription plans instead of products, and along with that toward the vendor lock-in mechanism: you get used to a particular way of thinking and a particular provider. That’s comfortable. And comfort, as we know, is often the first step toward dependency.\n\nIs there an antidote, or just a diagnosis?\n\nThere is. And it already exists — it only requires that we see it as a culture, not just a technical solution.\n\nThe antidote to the feudalization of intelligence is open models, community models — the kind you can run, inspect, combine, copy, federate. In short: free software and gift culture transposed into the domain of so-called artificial intelligence, seasoned with the benefit of decentralization.\n\nThen instead of solitary agents, we have a swarm.\n\nYou say “swarm.” What does that actually mean?\n\nA swarm is infrastructure: every node contributes something (data, feedback, time, capabilities, tests, audit), and in return everyone gets access to agency without the mechanism of lock-in to a single provider. This isn’t a promise of paradise, but a mechanism for leveling the playing field.\n\nI imagine it like this: thousands of small instances — tools, agents, models — that are not obedient to one corporate morality and one price list, but are maintained like an ecosystem. Sometimes it will be imperfect, sometimes chaotic, but it will be alive and evolving.\n\nAnd where is the human in this? After all, we’re talking about intelligence, not politics.\n\nPrecisely because we’re talking about intelligence, we’re talking about politics. Intelligence — biological or artificial — in practice means power over time, attention, and decisions. And therefore, in consequence, over relationships and ultimately over the fate of those who become dependent on us.\n\nAnd here is a simple criterion: community comes first. Not because the individual doesn’t matter, but because if differences in wealth become differences in dignity, then even individual victories will be won on scorched earth.\n\nIt’s not a slogan against anyone, just a reminder that in the age of cheap intelligence, what’s truly costly becomes something else: access to agency without the loss of freedom.\n\nWhen intelligence becomes a service, freedom — as always — begins with whether we can co-create that service, not merely consume it.\n\nIn the post-information era we will have to find ways to cope with the polyversality of messaging that we are already experiencing more frequently today, and to develop a healthy response to the dethronement of the intellect as the distinguishing trait of humanity.\n\nMoreover, as a result of this devaluation, trust in so-called objective truth as the only legitimate path for settling questions of meaning will most likely weaken.\n\nI propose two provisional, hypothetical stances that may help restore balance in a social reality where there is no single correct version of truth. I call them the craft of truth and perspective engineering.\n\nYou talk about “the craft of truth” and “perspective engineering.” It sounds like two slogans, but I sense it’s one machine. How do you put it together?\n\nFor me these are two levels of the same remedy.\n\nPerspective engineering is the tool: integrating viewpoints so they fit the problem and conditions, instead of pretending that one perspective always wins.\n\nAnd the craft of truth is the direction: it starts with introspection, with the ability to see what inside me wants to win before I start rationalizing it. Then post-truth becomes something that transcends truth, rather than merely negating it.\n\nSo truth as a practice, not as a declaration?\n\nYes. And this practice has an entry condition. Honesty with oneself is the precondition for a correct feedback loop; without it the cultural community has nothing on which to build responsibility. If I don’t see what drives me, I can have the most elegant arguments in the world and I’ll still be using them to service something personal: fear, the need for recognition, or the desire for control.\n\nAnd where is the place for the intellect? Because from the start you’ve sounded as if you were dethroning it.\n\nI dethrone it only as the central seat of consciousness in the colloquial sense, but this has downstream consequences for its role in the higher layers. As a tool it is excellent. The problem begins when it becomes the sole advisor and — socially — a carrier of prestige, or a justification for influence detached from actually improving one’s surroundings. Then it is easy to believe that if someone is brilliant, they are automatically trustworthy — and that is a category error. The intellect can serve truth just as well as it can serve dysfunction or even pathology.\n\nDo you have a concrete example? Something so it’s not purely about ethics in the abstract.\n\nI have a positive, mundane example from the creative craft that is programming. In the past, when I entered a software project, I would land in delivery mode: hours of translating intention into text and code, then tests, documentation, painstaking validation. That’s important, but it is also the moment where a person easily confuses the tension of focus with moral value. The mind is cyclically mobilized because “it finally works!,” while the body long ago wanted to step down from combat readiness.\n\nLet’s recall the stratification of the system: this change in the organism’s condition and well-being involuntarily propagates to the higher layers, and eventually affects others, culture, and — cumulatively, multiplied by the number of participants in a given community — the prevailing understanding of truth, beauty, or good. It is a larger feedback loop, because then the same environment gives it back to us with interest. So we don’t want to damage the environment so that it treats us to ever-worsening conditions, like cyberspace feeding synthetic content to degrading models. That is how it practically connects.\n\nComing back to coding. Today AI already takes over part of that load: it can relieve me of the necessary but non-creative work of converting intention into form. And here a shift happens that interests me the most:\n\nI stop delivering lines of code,\nI start delivering intention.\n\nWhat matters more becomes why I’m doing something and whom it serves. The intellect returns to its place as a tool, not as an identity.\n\nBut isn’t that a risk of going soft? If you have validations “on demand,” then why do you need your own falsification?\n\nIt depends on the domain. In the technical space the validator is merciless: something works or it doesn’t. In soft domains it’s harder. That’s why in perspective engineering the key thing for me is a practical criterion: before I accept something as sensible, I look for independent sources and check the quality of the evidence. Meta-analyses, samples, context of the authors, compatibility with experience, but also whether a given view is merely an attractive narrative.\n\nAnd it is here that AI can shorten the distance from intention to form. Thanks to that, I have more attentional resources for meaning, for relationships, for course correction. This isn’t handing over the wheel — it is reclaiming space.\n\nAll right. But what does this change culturally? What’s in it for the community?\n\nIf thinking becomes a service, then what’s scarce changes. In the world of cheap intelligence, the ability to tolerate discomfort and course-correct — that is, responsibility — becomes more expensive. And then the carrier of rank becomes intention rather than efficiency. Not in the sense of a moral label, but as a force organizing the system: what do you choose? what do you omit? whom is it meant to serve? what price do you accept, and what price no longer?\n\nThis is the main turn for me: less “who is right,” and more “who can answer the call of the situation without deceiving themselves and without trampling others.”\n\nAnd what is the significance of this discomfort?\n\nIt’s a shorthand. The point is that in practice, tolerance of a certain level of discomfort translates into the ability for introspection, and thus into inner honesty, which is the precondition for correcting beliefs or behaviors. When some facade falls away, for some people that means confronting false beliefs about themselves, and that always carries a certain dose of natural discomfort understood very organically, as a passing psychic tension.\n\nYou keep bringing up intention as a force organizing the system, not a moral label. If you had to show in one image how the structure of financing can distort intentions.\n\nWe can imagine a situation: someone builds a social-media platform, and after years it turns out that its design harms users’ psyches. It promotes harmful content to attract attention. Otherwise revenue drops and investors stop funding the project. Not because the creators “wanted evil.” More often because they felt an inner deficiency and poverty, and later also because the company grew from a dozen people to hundreds or thousands, and by going public acquired an obligation to increase profits. Then profit became the highest good. This shows intention precisely not as a moral label, but as a force organizing the system: the funding structure rewards profit, and profit can distort intentions even without explicit will to harm.\n\nAs I’m answering this question, a lawsuit has just been filed in the US against social media platform owners for causing psychological harm. A user identified by the initials KGM alleges that when she used the platforms as a child, the content presented to her negatively affected her well-being, contributing among other things to anxiety disorders and suicidal thoughts.\n\nHow can AI help solve this problem?\n\nIt’s already happening. I increasingly see LLMs beginning to displace the internet’s know-it-alls — those we once followed because they had an opinion on every topic and always sounded confident. What’s more, in certain areas they are even replacing close ones or friends, especially where sensitive things are involved: shame, fear, guilt, ambiguous motives. This is practical, because the model is available instantly, but it is also culturally significant: if the user shifts attention from the feed of a social medium to a conversation, the attention economy changes.\n\nI suspect this must now be causing concern wherever attention is currency: in the marketing departments of social media platforms that for years designed their architecture so that we would come back to them for emotional stimulation, not for genuine self-understanding.\n\nIn a conversation with a model, part of the social stakes disappears. You don’t have to win in front of an audience, don’t have to defend your image, don’t have to manage belonging to a clan — which in social media activates almost automatically. This creates what I would call a safer field.\n\nThe internet shortened social distance by letting us meet people from the other side of the world who think similarly. But AI shortens it differently: it gives access to rare perspectives without the need to seek out their carriers. It is like a cultural condensate — a sample that can intrigue you, name an experience. You don’t have to make mistakes and backtrack when you realize that the perspective you adopted isn’t actually compatible with your character, doesn’t serve it. It saves time.\n\nBut there is also potential for more fundamental shifts.\n\nIn the optimistic scenario, the cultural change initiated by AI may shift the emphasis toward intention. And by that I don’t mean only the pious wishes connected with the social effect of dethroning the intellect — though those too — but very practical scenarios.\n\nIf “cheap intelligence” lowers the barrier to entry, pluralism emerges: more small platforms, more niche communities, more alternatives. Then user well-being can become more important than investor profit — not because of a conversion of corporatism, but because competition grows. And the axis of that competition, once intermediaries are cut short, is precisely intention.\n\nFurther, if pluralism is to be the remedy, a new organ of orientation must also emerge. Because in a polyversal world, the problem isn’t the lack of information but its excess. And here AI can step into a role that sounds modest but is crucial: an intention filter on the user’s side.\n\nI imagine agents working for users: not as sole advisors, but as guides through the thicket. A swarm of tools that examines the properties of a system (a platform, a community, a source), and knowing your values and needs suggests: “this will strengthen you,” “this will unsettle you,” “this is clever but feeds on emotions.”\n\nThe condition for honesty is simple: the agent must be able to say why it filters that way. What criteria did it adopt? What is its interest and how is it meant to serve us? Without that, the filter becomes just another form of propaganda.\n\nIf such a swarm is only supposed to filter and suggest, then where in your view does the boundary lie between a guide through culture and someone who co-creates that culture — and what happens when we start blurring that boundary?\n\nAI doesn’t create culture directly; it doesn’t introduce novelty — at least not yet. We might have that impression, because there has never before been a moment in history when a single person conversed with an averaged billion people compressed into a single shape.\n\nBesides, even the best agent is a filter and an amplifier: it can help select, but it doesn’t itself bear consequences on the other side of the relationship. And culture is precisely that network of consequences.\n\nYou say AI “doesn’t create” culture. That sounds like a provocation. What do you mean?\n\nWhen we look at this systemically, LLMs and diffusion models are not a new “author of culture” in the primary sense. They perform a lossy compression of existing human artifacts — language, images, thinking habits — into a digitally represented multidimensional space in which one can conveniently interpolate between points. It is like a shared dictionary, but written not in definitions, but in weights and statistics.\n\nAnd what happens when such a mechanism becomes a tool of everyday use?\n\nIn culture, three things start happening at once: averaging, colonialism, and the disappearance of detail.\n\nLet’s start with averaging. Why does this matter culturally at all?\n\nModels are trained to minimize errors. And in practice, an “error” is often whatever deviates from the pattern: the strange, the sharp, the unpredictable, the style-breaking. During fine-tuning (e.g. RLHF), extremes are naturally smoothed out. This has a clear advantage — less violence, less toxicity — but a side effect is that it cuts out some of the “high cultural frequencies”: genius, risk, madness, non-obviousness, absurdity, and fresh paradox.\n\nThe aesthetic turns beige. Prose becomes smooth, poetry bland, morality proper. This isn’t the result of bad will, but rather of the objective function: when everyone plugs into the same smoothing tool, the system’s variance drops. And culture lives precisely on variance, on entropy. And by culture I don’t mean just art or convention, but the clouds of values we absorb by being among others, which influence how we think and behave. These values are transmitted above all by example, not by readings or works of art.\n\nYou say “colonialism.” Sounds like a heavy accusation.\n\nIt is more a description of the mechanism of training networks and parameterizing them. A model’s weights are frozen decisions about what is “typical,” “beautiful,” “professional,” “normal.” When you ask a model for a “beautiful house” or an “elegant outfit,” you get an answer that isn’t neutral. It is statistical — and therefore culturally embedded in the data the model was trained on. If Western and Anglophone perspectives dominate, then local nuances become noise that the filter discards.\n\nWhat’s most dangerous about this?\n\nHidden power, but sewn in deeper than in movies or advertisements, because it is built into the tool with which a person thinks and creates. You don’t have to convince anyone; it’s enough that the result is easier, faster, and looks better. You can have something instantly, but when you’re not attentive and precise, you pay for it with conformism.\n\nAnd the disappearance of detail? That already sounds quite technical.\n\nYes, and that’s exactly why it is insidious — unnoticeable immediately, only after a longer time. The internet is being flooded with synthetic content, and new models are beginning to learn from data generated by old models. It is a photocopy of a photocopy: with each cycle we lose details, deviations, anomalies — the fuel of innovation.\n\nCan this be named more precisely?\n\nOne can speak in the language of entropy in the information-theoretic sense: if rare signals disappear from circulation, the distribution becomes more predictable, and the model increasingly proposes what already was. Digital culture, like Ouroboros, begins to eat its own tail. But it is worth mentioning the curious fact that entropy can also be understood existentially…\n\nIn considerations about consciousness? Being?\n\nIndeed. In Shannon’s framework, entropy is a measure of uncertainty in a signal; less entropy means greater predictability. But in considerations about consciousness, one also encounters the intuition that less “cognitive noise” can correlate with a greater sense of meaning. Bernardo Kastrup favors this line of thinking: when the narrative, or even broadly the epistemic apparatus of the mind quiets down, experience can become more coherent, even though it is poorer in content as measured by neural activity. The habit of incessant self-commentary weakens — the same one that neuroscience associates with the default mode network — and an experience of “meaning without description” appears.\n\nYes. In this arrangement, the human ceases to be merely a craftsman of text. They begin to serve as a source of entropy — not in the sense of chaos, but in the sense of novelty. AI excels at interpolation. It is worse at extrapolation, at going beyond the map. A biological, sentient subject — rooted in pain, joy, absurdity, and relationship — can inject into the system something that isn’t just another version of the same.\n\nIn the age of a cultural low-pass filter, anomalies become a precious resource.\n\nThe interview above was conducted with me by the language model GPT-5.2, which asked me several hundred questions, of which 20% required longer answers expressing opinions, while the rest were multiple-choice tests designed to sequence threads and clarify ambiguous statements.\n\nWhere a sentence had syntactic or stylistic flaws and needed correction (approx. 3% of the text), the model drew on a previously created idiolectal profile of my person containing approximately 250 dimensions characterizing my writing style and communication patterns. The profile was based on a prior analysis of approximately 1,500 machine pages of materials I had written, as well as on our earlier conversations.\n\nEditorial review before publication was carried out by Claude Opus 4.6.",

    "description": "The way content is discovered online is shifting, from traditional search engines to AI agents that need structured data from a Web built for humans. It’s time to consider not just human visitors, but start to treat agents as first-class citizens. Markdown for Agents automatically converts any HTML page requested from our network to markdown.",
    "fullText": "The way content and businesses are discovered online is changing rapidly. In the past, traffic originated from traditional search engines, and SEO determined who got found first. Now the traffic is increasingly coming from AI crawlers and agents that demand structured data within the often-unstructured Web that was built for humans.\n\nAs a business, to continue to stay ahead, now is the time to consider not just human visitors, or traditional wisdom for SEO-optimization, but start to treat agents as first-class citizens.\n\nFeeding raw HTML to an AI is like paying by the word to read packaging instead of the letter inside. A simple ## About Us on a page in markdown costs roughly 3 tokens; its HTML equivalent – <h2 class=\"section-title\" id=\"about\">About Us</h2> – burns 12-15, and that's before you account for the <div> wrappers, nav bars, and script tags that pad every real web page and have zero semantic value.\n\nThis blog post you’re reading takes 16,180 tokens in HTML and 3,150 tokens when converted to markdown. That’s a 80% reduction in token usage.\n\nMarkdown has quickly become the lingua franca for agents and AI systems as a whole. The format’s explicit structure makes it ideal for AI processing, ultimately resulting in better results while minimizing token waste.\n\nThe problem is that the Web is made of HTML, not markdown, and page weight has been steadily increasing over the years, making pages hard to parse. For agents, their goal is to filter out all non-essential elements and scan the relevant content.\n\nThe conversion of HTML to markdown is now a common step for any AI pipeline. Still, this process is far from ideal: it wastes computation, adds costs and processing complexity, and above all, it may not be how the content creator intended their content to be used in the first place.\n\nWhat if AI agents could bypass the complexities of intent analysis and document conversion, and instead receive structured markdown directly from the source?\n\nCloudflare's network now supports real-time content conversion at the source, for enabled zones using content negotiation headers. Now when AI systems request pages from any website that uses Cloudflare and has Markdown for Agents enabled, they can express the preference for text/markdown in the request. Our network will automatically and efficiently convert the HTML to markdown, when possible, on the fly.\n\nHere’s how it works. To fetch the markdown version of any page from a zone with Markdown for Agents enabled, the client needs to add the Accept negotiation header with text/markdown as one of the options. Cloudflare will detect this, fetch the original HTML version from the origin, and convert it to markdown before serving it to the client.\n\nHere's a curl example with the Accept negotiation header requesting a page from our developer documentation:\n\nOr if you’re building an AI Agent using Workers, you can use TypeScript:\n\nWe already see some of the most popular coding agents today – like Claude Code and OpenCode – send these accept headers with their requests for content. Now, the response to this request is formatted  in markdown. It's that simple.\n\nNote that we include an x-markdown-tokens header with the converted response that indicates the estimated number of tokens in the markdown document. You can use this value in your flow, for example to calculate the size of a context window or to decide on your chunking strategy.\n\nHere’s a diagram of how it works:\n\nDuring our last Birthday Week, Cloudflare announced Content Signals — a framework that allows anyone to express their preferences for how their content can be used after it has been accessed.\n\nWhen you return markdown, you want to make sure your content is being used by the Agent or AI crawler. That’s why Markdown for Agents converted responses include the Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes header signaling that indicates content can be used for AI Training, Search results and AI Input, which includes agentic use. Markdown for Agents will provide options to define custom Content Signal policies in the future.\n\nCheck our dedicated Content Signals page \n\nWe enabled this feature in our Developer Documentation and our Blog, inviting all AI crawlers and agents to consume our content using markdown instead of HTML.\n\nTry it out now by requesting this blog with Accept: text/markdown.\n\nIf you’re building AI systems that require arbitrary document conversion from outside Cloudflare or Markdown for Agents is not available from the content source, we provide other ways to convert documents to Markdown for your applications:\n\nWorkers AI AI.toMarkdown() supports multiple document types, not just HTML, and summarization.\n\nBrowser Rendering /markdown REST API supports markdown conversion if you need to render a dynamic page or application in a real browser before converting it.\n\nAnticipating a shift in how AI systems browse the Web, Cloudflare Radar now includes content type insights for AI bot and crawler traffic, both globally on the AI Insights page and in the individual bot information pages.\n\nThe new content_type dimension and filter shows the distribution of content types returned to AI agents and crawlers, grouped by MIME type category.\n\nYou can also see the requests for markdown filtered by a specific agent or crawler. Here are the requests that return markdown to OAI-Searchbot, the crawler used by OpenAI to power ChatGPT’s search:\n\nThis new data will allow us to track the evolution of how AI bots, crawlers, and agents are consuming Web content over time. As always, everything on Radar is freely accessible via the public APIs and the Data Explorer.\n\nTo enable Markdown for Agents for your zone, log into the Cloudflare dashboard, select your account, select the zone, look for Quick Actions and toggle the Markdown for Agents button to enable. This feature is available today in Beta at no cost for Pro, Business and Enterprise plans, as well as SSL for SaaS customers.\n\nYou can find more information about Markdown for Agents on our Developer Docs. We welcome your feedback as we continue to refine and enhance this feature. We’re curious to see how AI crawlers and agents navigate and adapt to the unstructured nature of the Web as it evolves.",

    "fullText": "We've decided that AI makes us dumb, brainrot is real, and we're all forgetting how to write code.\n\nThis was my initial assumption, too.\n\nBut I've come to see things a little differently.\n\nI actually think the opposite is happening.\n\nThe idea that we're all forgetting to write code is true, but misses the much bigger and more important point.\n\nYes, we are losing those reflexes for manual coding just like our ancestors lost the reflex for spear fishing or pottery.\n\nBut did society regress just because our ancestors forgot how to spear fish?\n\nA more recent example is the early-early days of programming. There used to be people who knew how to program in assembly, and yes, I know some people still take pride in this, but realistically? We have collectively forgotten how to write assembly — yet society moves forward faster than ever.\n\nI believe the same is happening today. We're forgetting to write manually, write with pen and paper, and to code by hand. But that is ok.\n\nOn the other side of things, I feel my brain getting sharper, not duller, from having constant access to information.\n\nAt any moment of any day, I can now open my phone and find an answer to any question. And not only can I get instant access to information — I can ask for corrections and feedback on my world view — my mental model of how things work.\n\nI think this is the real, insane superpower of AI that nobody is talking about. AI can give us extremely precise information to patch up gaps in our knowledge, allowing every person to have a more complete and accurate world view.\n\nAt the same time, it does require thought because AI is frequently wrong and hallucinates, so the user must actually engage with the AI and think critically.\n\nKnowing what questions to ask and how to ask them is becoming an ever more important skill. What started out as \"prompt engineering\"— has quietly become a generalized skill of extreme intellectual precision via language. Millions of people are now practicing the art of saying exactly what they mean, every single day.\n\nMy ability to refine specific language around asking questions has dramatically improved, as has my ability to detect weird information that feels wrong or out of place. I'm constantly pushing back on the AI and disagreeing with it.\n\nAll of this said, there are still major problems with hallucinations and sycophancy which are unresolved, and which pose major threats.\n\nStories of AI psychosis are concerning and must be explored.\n\nBut the one thing that I am thoroughly convinced of is that those who choose to use AI to expand and deepen their thinking will receive a massive cognitive boost and form a more complete mental model of how the world works.\n\nIn a sense, I think of AI as a curiosity multiplier — but this requires a baseline level of curiosity to multiply.",

Halamish's new role was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nUnder the new structure, each major business in the division, including banking, markets, payments, and securities services, will have its own chief data and analytics officer reporting jointly to Halamish and business heads. The bank recently hired Zachery Anderson as the chief data and analytics officer of its payments division, after a nearly six-year stint at UK-based lender NatWest. In a LinkedIn post about the new job, Anderson said he wants to push the \"edge of the possible with AI.\"\n\nThe move is part of a new strategy to break silos across the unit and speed up adoption of AI.\n\nThe team of officers will work with the wider firm on a range of efforts, including \"preparing our infrastructure for more advanced AI and the expanded use of AI agents\" and \"driving end-to-end transformation\" in areas such as client onboarding.\n\nThe CIB is a huge profit driver for JPMorgan — in 2024, it generated $25 billion in net income out of a firmwide total of $58.5 billion, according to that year's annual report.\n\nJPMorgan, backed last year by an approximately $18 billion tech budget, is one of the financial industry's leaders in AI, with its own proprietary genAI platform and additional tools in the pipeline.

You can see what AI thinks and choose your winner from each tie, below.\n\nDaffy and Porky were first drawn in the 1930s and the actor who initially voiced Porky had a stammer, and therefore so did the character.\n\nHi Daffy and hello Porky. This weekend it's the FA Cup - a historic competition famous for upsets and under-dogs - or is it under-ducks? - where the top Premier League teams sometimes lose to part-time sides. Are you excited about it!?\n\nDaffy: Are you kidding? I'm tho exthited. It'th incredible. Thtupendous! And the only thing that could make me more exthited is if I knew what the heck it was!\n\nPorky: I love sp-sp-sp-all kinds of athletic competition but I mostly play b-baseball and basketball, so I just hope the best team wins.\n\nThe FA Cup started in 1871 so it's even older than both of you... could we trust the pair of you if we gave you the job of looking after the famous old trophy together?\n\nDaffy: But of courth - there's no one more truthtworthy than me - and to prove it I'll take your cup far far far over yonder for thafe-keeping...\n\nPorky: Daffy, that's not the trophy that's a t-t-ttea cup. The British love drinking tea.\n\nDaffy: Oh. Wise guys, huh? Wathting my time!\n\nYou both have to save the world in 'The Day The Earth Blew Up' but this is an even bigger challenge - can you get better of our pundit and football expert Chris Sutton at predictions by picking the right scores? How confident are both of you about beating him?\n\nDaffy: You want a prediction? My prediction is we will dethtroy him! Annihilate him! Crush him! Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: He he, now d-don't get carried away, Daffy. Nothing wrong with a little friendly competition, but it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you p-p-play the game. All that matters is that we all have fu-fu-fu-fu... a good time!\n\nDaffy, you asked for Michael Jordan's autograph in Space Jam, would you want Chris' autograph? He won the Premier League in 1995... but he can be a bit of a know-it-all and even a little boastful at times, a bit like Foghorn Leghorn. Are you impressed, and what would you tell him if you met him?\n\nDaffy: As a perthon of great refinement, delicathy and modethty, I have no time for boathtful people. They're dethpicable. I find the best way to deal with them ith to whack 'em over the head with a plank. Do you have any plankth I could use?\n\nPorky, you have to deal with Daffy's short fuse and madcap ideas... how would you feel about having Chris as a sidekick instead? Would you be as loyal to him as you are to Daffy?\n\nPorky: Well, I pp-pride myself on being lo-lo-lo—faithful... but I would consider having a less Daffy and messy housemate!\n\nYou've both played basketball with the rest of the Tune Squad in the Space Jam movies, would you fancy a go at soccer (or football as we call it in the UK)?\n\nDaffy: I helped defeat a team of alien 'Monstars'. It really wouldn't be fair to your little thoccer teams to take on thuch a thupreme athlete as mythelf.\n\nPorky: I think I'd p-p-prefer to be the referee. I like the whistle.\n\nMaybe both of you would be better as managers - together as a double-act to make the big decisions? Some managers are loyal and optimistic like Porky... some are more desperate for attention, like Daffy?\n\nDaffy: With my unique combination of thkill and thrategy I think I could be a great player and a coach. At the thame time. And thell the refreshments and merchandithe. I thee it now - Daffy Thtadium - home of Daffy United!\n\nPorky: I've been a successful t-t-talent agent, so I think I would make a good ma-ma-ma-ma- head coach. I've been learning the offside rule. Let me read b-b-back my notes. \"If a player scores a g-g-goal and you don't want it to count, that's offside.\"\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\n4th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nChelsea boss Liam Rosenior is really well thought of by Hull fans from his time in charge there, and he is a former Tigers player as well.\n\nSo, he should get a great reception there on Friday night, but what he really needs is a win - especially after letting a two-goal lead slip against Leeds on Tuesday.\n\nRosenior has had some great results with Chelsea but it seems some fans aren't convinced by him. He will be desperate to prove them wrong by winning a trophy and the FA Cup is a great opportunity for him to do that this season.\n\nHull are going well in the Championship under Sergej Jakirovic but I just see Chelsea being too strong for them.\n\nI scored for Chelsea against Hull in the FA Cup, many years ago. We won 6-1 that day and Chelsea are going to win comfortably this time too.\n\nDaffy: Should be a hulluva a game. Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: I guess Chelsea will have to g-g-go to Hull and back.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n6th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\n\nBoth teams are in the thick of the promotion race, and they meet again in Wales in the league next weekend.\n\nWith that in mind, I just wonder whether Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna will be the one to change things up here.\n\nI hope he doesn't but I think he might, because his side are in reach of the automatic spots, and that would be Wrexham's chance.\n\nEven so, I think this will be close. I'd normally just tip Ipswich to lose anyway but this prediction is for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who is a big fan and will be delighted that I am backing them.\n\nAs for moneybags Wrexham, well I don't think their Hollywood stardust will help to take them to Wembley, but after this they will be able to focus on their play-off bid.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Ipswich win on penalties\n\nDaffy: Ipswich Town wrecks'em? Well they should be more careful with their Tractorth!\n\nPorky: I think we have to say Hooray for Ho-Holl-holl-holl-Tinseltown and go with Wrexham.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n22nd in League One v 18th in Premier League\n\nBurton are struggling in League One, with only one win in their past nine league games, but they have scored 14 goals in their three FA Cup wins to get this far, and I can see them scoring again at home here.\n\nI don't think we will see a shock, though. West Ham look like they have turned a bit of a corner, and they will be gutted to have conceded an equaliser so late on against Manchester United on Tuesday.\n\nHammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo won't want to lose the momentum that they've built in the past few weeks so, while he might make a couple of changes, he will still pick a team strong enough to get through.\n\nDaffy, when told that West Ham's famous song is 'we're forever blowing bubbles': No thir, no bubbleth, no way. Not after we went through with the zombie bubble gum. I'm going with Burton Albion (whatever that means).\n\nPorky: Yes, I don't want to b-b-b-bur- pop anyone's balloon, but I agree with Daffy. Bub-bub-bubbles can be tough to b-b-beat though. I think it will be tight.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 2-1\n\n19th in Premier League v 12th in League One\n\nAs I said on the Monday Night Club, I feel like some Burnley fans are forgetting how difficult it is for any promoted team in the Premier League. They look at how Sunderland and Leeds are doing, and think 'why not us?'\n\nClarets boss Scott Parker is taking a lot of flak at the moment, so he really needed Wednesday's win over Crystal Palace. That was a great result but he cannot afford to follow it by slipping up at home to a mid-table League One side.\n\nI am not expecting that to happen here - Burnley were up against an in-form Millwall side in round three and brushed them aside.\n\nBut I do think we will see some goals and some entertainment - there has not been much of either at Turf Moor this season. Mansfield beat Sheffield United 4-3 in the last round, and I can see them going out all guns blazing.\n\nDaffy: I think you're jutht making teamth up now.\n\nPorky: I'll support b-b-b-b-b-oh forget it - Mansfield.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n2nd in Premier League v 6th in League Two\n\nManchester City beat Salford City 8-0 in last season's FA Cup and the only thing I am not sure about here is how many they will score this time.\n\nSalford are doing well in League Two and I like their manager, Karl Robinson, but they are going to be outclassed.\n\nDaffy: I've heard of Manchethter... which is more than I can say for the otherth.\n\nPorky: Th-th-th-that's good enough for me!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-0\n\n16th in Championship v 19th in Championship\n\nThis prediction is not quite as straightforward as just looking at recent form. West Brom are really struggling while Norwich are flying - and beat the Baggies 5-0 on 20 January - but my old club have got so many injuries at the moment.\n\nI am still going to back Norwich here though. Philippe Clement has got the team playing really well and it was great to see Mohamed Toure hit a hat-trick on his first start for the club, against Oxford on Tuesday.\n\nClement says they showed Toure images of Erling Haaland beforehand to show how he creates space for himself, and Romelu Lukaku to see how he uses his body.\n\nI'm sure someone at Carrow Road could dig out some old VHS tapes of me in action for the Canaries if Toure needs any more inspiration. Although finding a video to play them on might be tricky.\n\nDaffy, when told Norwich are Chris Sutton's old team: You keep talking about thith Crith Thutton like I'm thupposed to care about him. Jutht for that I'm picking the Women's Basketball Association.\n\nPorky: No, Daffy it says here that WBA is West Bromwich Albion.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. What about Eatht Bromwich and North Bromwich, and Thouth Bromwich. That'th a lot of Bromwich!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-2\n\n24th in League One v 8th in Championship\n\nPort Vale are toiling at the bottom of League One. Bristol City have been a bit erratic too, but they are still only a point off the Championship play-off places.\n\nCity have got a huge game coming up at Wrexham on Tuesday, which might be a bit of a distraction for this tie, but I still see them reaching round five.\n\nDaffy: Doeth everyone in thith country have their own team? How many more are there?\n\nPorky: B-B-Bristol sounds like bristle. And pigs have bristles so...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2\n\n9th in Championship v 21st in Championship\n\nIt was absolutely unbelievable what happened when these two teams met in the league on Tuesday. Leicester were 3-0 up at half-time, but ended up losing 4-3 in the 97th minute.\n\nHow do the Foxes come back from that? I don't think they will. They will be angry, and are bound to be fired up, but you just wonder what damage it has done to their confidence and morale.\n\nLeicester had a points deduction last week which left them in big trouble at the bottom of the table and they don't have a manager at the moment - Andy King is caretaker boss and at half-time you can just imagine how he feels too.\n\nSouthampton are one of the form teams in the division, with four wins in their past five games, and I don't see Leicester getting any revenge here.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. Thouthhampton or Lie-theth-ter...\n\nPorky: It's pr-pr-pronounced \"Lester\"\n\nDaffy: What is wrong with you people? Can't you thpell?? In that cathe...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n3rd in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI was delighted for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe that his team beat Tottenham and also the reception he got from his side's fans afterwards.\n\nFor everything he has done for them, the world must have gone bonkers for their fans to be calling up 606 and saying they wanted him out.\n\nThis will be a very different test to playing Spurs, however, and I am going with my gut feeling on this one.\n\nThe two sides met recently when Villa won at St James' Park at the end of January and although Villa have slipped up a couple of times at home recently, when it clicks for them, they usually end up winning.\n\nDaffy, when told Newcastle are known as the 'Toon' by their fans, who are 'The Toon Army': You had me at Toon! Though I do like the thound of thtaying in a nithe villa.\n\nPorky: Remember Space Jam? No one can beat toons!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2 (And th-th-th-that's gonna be all folks!)\n\n6th in Premier League v 14th in Premier League\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot and Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler are both under pressure but it feels like Hurzeler has the bigger problems to solve.\n\nBrighton are on a poor run and apparently it all got a bit ugly at their home defeat by Crystal Palace on Sunday. The fans seem to have lost faith in him, and although that feels harsh to me, when it happens then it it is hard to reverse it.\n\nThe Seagulls beat Manchester United away in round three and now Hurzeler could really do with beating Liverpool away too.\n\nI wouldn't put it past them, either, especially with Liverpool struggling to see out games at the moment, but I think Slot's side will just about get over the line.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Liverpool to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Liverpool, home of The Beatleth - finally thomewhere I've heard of!\n\nPorky: Someone told me, \"if you don't know anything about foo-foo-foo-soccer, just say you support Liverpool.\"\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 4-1\n\n10th in Championship v 15th in Premier League\n\nLeeds' comeback from 2-0 down to draw at Chelsea was just extraordinary, but I can smell an upset here.\n\nI am sure Leeds boss Daniel Farke will make some changes because he will have at least half an eye on the Premier League, and their next game against Aston Villa.\n\nBirmingham are going well under Chris Davies and are unbeaten in eight games in all competitions. This seems like a good time for him to take a top-flight scalp.\n\nDaffy: I didn't know a team from Alabama could play here.\n\nPorky: I don't think it's the same one.\n\nDaffy: Birmingham all the way - woohoo!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 100-0\n\n12th in League Two v 20th in Premier League\n\nI know all about Grimsby because I was at Blundell Park for their Carabao Cup win over Manchester United earlier in the season.\n\nCould something similar happen again? Yes, definitely. There will be another cracking atmosphere and David Artell and his players will fancy another upset, I am sure of that.\n\nThis is a horrible game for Wolves, but it is an important one for their manager Rob Edwards. He needs to find a way of getting through this tie, which is something Ruben Amorim could not do with United.\n\nWolves have had a miserable season and they probably thought it couldn't get any worse - well it might.\n\nI think lightning might strike twice, and this game will end in a draw before Grimsby win the shootout, just like they did against Manchester United.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Grimsby to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Grimthby eh? Thounds grim and deprething. I'll go with the Wolves.\n\nPorky: I think they'll huff and puff and run out steam. At least I hope so.\n\n23rd in Championship v 11th in Premier League\n\nBoth of these teams got through the last round on penalties, with Oxford beating MK Dons and Sunderland overcoming Everton.\n\nI don't see Sunderland needing a shootout this time, though. Oxford are pretty woeful at the moment and have just been spanked by Norwich - they are not coming back from that.\n\nRegis le Bris will make changes but the Black Cats will still be far too strong.\n\nDaffy, when told that Sunderland are nicknamed the Black Cats - so would not get on with Tweety Pie: Birdth of a feather mutht stick together against catth!\n\nPorky: And Oxford is a place of higher ed-ed-edu-learning. So I think they'll outsmart the opposition.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n14th in Championship v 12th in Premier League\n\nStoke's boss is my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins, who is an excellent manager - he clearly learnt a lot from me - but I fancy Fulham here.\n\nI don't know what Marco Silva's situation is with Fulham and if he is leaving at the end of the season, but he will want to go out with a bang.\n\nI really like the way Silva's side play, and I wouldn't rule out the Cottagers' chances of going deep in the FA Cup this season.\n\nDaffy: I think I know which one Porky liketh here.\n\nPorky: A f-f-f-full ham? You bet!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\n1st in Premier League v 21st in League One\n\nThis is the first meeting between these two clubs since the 2014 FA Cup semi-final, when Arsenal won on penalties and Mikel Arteta scored in a shootout. The Gunners went on to beat Hull in the final.\n\nThings have changed a lot for Wigan since then, and not in a good way.\n\nThey have just sacked their manager Ryan Lowe after sliding into the League One relegation zone, and it's hard to see them forcing a shootout this time, no matter how many changes Arteta makes.\n\nArsenal have not had much joy in the FA Cup since Arteta won it again as manager in 2019-20, a few months after taking charge.\n\nThey have not been past round four since, but they are going to make it to the last 16 this time, I'm sure of it.\n\nIn fact, they have got so much strength in depth now that, while for years Arteta has not been able to win anything at all, he could feasibly win four trophies this season.\n\nIs the Quadruple on? That could be the question we are asking in the final few months of the season.\n\nDaffy: You thee, the problem with Arthenal is they just try to walk it in.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n6th in National League North v 7th in Premier League\n\nI am co-commentating on this game for 5 Live with Ali Bruce-Ball and I cannot wait.\n\nMacclesfield boss John Rooney did an incredible job with his side's historic win over Crystal Palace in round three.\n\nI watched the game back as part of my prep and, while the Silkmen had less than 29% possession, they limited Palace to very few chances and they were deserved winners.\n\nKnocking the holders out was rightly hailed as the biggest shock in the FA Cup's illustrious history, and it would be another fantastic feat if they toppled Brentford too.\n\nOnly one non-league side has ever beaten two top-flight teams in the same FA Cup campaign - Millwall in 1913-14, who overcame Chelsea and Bradford City.\n\nI'd love to think Macclesfield could do it too, and if they play like they did against Palace then they have a great chance, especially on their plastic pitch.\n\nI think Brentford will be ready for them, though, and Keith Andrews' side are having a tremendous season too.\n\nAndrews will know he can't make too many changes here, and maybe Brentford will go on an FA Cup run themselves - they have not reached the quarter-finals since 1989, so it it is long overdue.\n\nThis is going to be a tight game but I just have a feeling the Bees will edge it.\n\nDaffy: I don't underthtand thith game at all – what is a Maccle? Why are there fields of them? And why do you altho call them the Thilkmen? Jutht for that, I'm going with Brentford!\n\nPorky: B-b-Bees make honey, And honey is sweet... and so is my d-d-dear-d-d-arling Petunia.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

    "description": "Khan Academy CEO Salman Khan predicts the AI revolution will hit the U.S. faster and harder than anyone is anticipating.",
    "fullText": "In 1997 IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated the reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov. In 2023 ChatGPT passed the bar exam. And last year, Google DeepMind clinched gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad.\n\nThese milestones are only expected to accelerate, with some business leaders, including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, predicting artificial general intelligence—AI that is able to meet or surpass human intelligence—could arrive as early as this year. While avid sci-fi fans and business leaders are thrilled by the technology’s potential, others caution about the economic downsides.\n\nWhat early warning signs indicate AI workforce disruption?\n\nHow could AI cause a 10% white-collar job disruption?\n\nHow could corporate reskilling programs address AI unemployment?\n\nWhat industries face the greatest AI displacement risks?\n\nSalman Khan, CEO of Khan Academy and vision steward at TED—two organizations that provide free online education services for more than 200 million users globally—predicts the AI revolution will hit harder and faster than most are predicting (although the AI doomers are getting louder in early 2026). And while AI experts like Geoffrey Hinton, the British-Canadian computer scientist widely known as the “godfather of AI,” have warned the technology could trigger mass unemployment, Khan said even a 10% decrease could bring the burn.\n\n“If white-collar work were to shrink even 10%,” Khan told Fortune, “it’s going to feel like a depression.”\n\nBut Khan said to look beyond the ensuing AI encroachment on white-collar jobs triggering mass unemployment a bit—it could also cause an identity crisis among a large portion of the population. “They’ve been making upper-middle-class, affluent salaries for the last 20 years,” Khan said. “Their identity is tied to this. And now, all of a sudden, you’re going to have this mass shift in the job market.”\n\nWhile no one can say exactly how significantly AI will disrupt the labor market—if at all—recent research predicts an uptick in unemployment thanks to the technology. A 2025 MIT study found AI could replace nearly 12% of the U.S. workforce, nearly triple the current rate.\n\nPart of Khan’s concern stems from conversations he’s shared with business leaders within the tech industry. “People behind closed doors are talking about pretty bold things these days,” he said. “I’ve heard people say you could do the same work with a quarter of the team.”\n\nIt’s not just white-collar jobs that will be impacted. Khan predicts robotic automation has already set in motion a displacement among the gig economy. From Waymo to Tesla, driverless cars are popping up across the U.S. While adoption is still uneven, Khan predicts driverless cars will become the norm, potentially impacting more than 1 million rideshare drivers across the country.",

    "fullText": "But, after second day of Wall Street falls, analysts say sell-off ‘may overstate AI’s immediate risk to complex deal-making’\n\nShares in commercial property services companies have tumbled, in the latest sell-off driven by fears over disruption from artificial intelligence.\n\nAfter steep declines on Wall Street, European stocks in the sector were hit on Thursday.\n\nThe estate agent Savills’ shares fell 7.5% in London, while the serviced office provider International Workplace Group, which owns the Regus brand, lost 9%.\n\nThe UK’s two biggest property developers, British Land and Landsec, dropped 2.6% and 2.4% respectively.\n\nOn Wall Street, property service firms fell for a second consecutive day. CBRE shares plunged 12.5%, Jones Lang LaSalle lost nearly 11% and Cushman & Wakefield fell 9.1%, after even sharper declines on Wednesday.\n\nCommercial property stocks have become the latest sector to be hammered by fears over the impact of rapid advances in AI, as the sell-off spread from legal software, publishing, analytics and data companies last week to insurance firms, price comparison sites and wealth managers this week.\n\nThe share declines were sparked by AI firms such as Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude, releasing new tools, although there was limited news on Thursday, leading analysts to argue that the sell-off was overdone.\n\nAI has the potential to automate a wide range of office-based tasks and could lead to swathes of job losses. There are also concerns among investors that demand for offices could fall, in a blow to property companies.\n\nJade Rahmani, commercial real estate analyst at New York-headquartered Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said: “We believe investors are rotating out of high-fee, labour-intensive business models viewed as potentially vulnerable to AI-driven disruption.”\n\nHowever, he believes that the sell-off “may overstate the immediate risk to complex deal-making, even as the long-term AI impact remains a ‘wait-and-see’”.\n\nDallas-based CBRE on Thursday reported fourth-quarter revenue of $11.6bn (£8.5bn), up 12%, and core earnings per share of $2.73, above analysts’ estimates. In 2025, revenues rose by 13% to $40.6bn.\n\nThe real estate services firm forecast 2026 profit above Wall Street estimates, on the back of strong momentum in leasing and facilities management, as the number of datacentres rapidly expands and billions of dollars flow into AI infrastructure.\n\nCBRE’s chief executive, Bob Sulentic, believes AI will benefit the business in the long run, with its transaction and investment work “most protected” from disruption.\n\n“Clients engage CBRE to plan and execute complex transactions because of our creativity, strategic thinking, negotiating skills, deep base of market knowledge and broad relationships,” he said. “None of this seems likely to be replaced by AI in the foreseeable future.”",

    "title": "How 3 solo founders use AI to transform their content into business",
    "description": "Solopreneurs like Katrina Purcell and Gigi Robinson use AI tools to optimize their content creation, boost efficiency, and enhance lead generation.",
    "fullText": "These days, content creation can feel like a full-time job. For solopreneurs running podcasts or active social channels alongside client work, maintaining a consistent presence can be hard to manage without any teammates.\n\n\"I would not be doing this level of content if I didn't have AI,\" said Katrina Purcell, Fractional COO and host of the Managed Chaos podcast. Purcell produces a weekly podcast and publishes related content across LinkedIn, Substack, and a blog on her website. AI tools like Riverside for transcripts and Gemini for content ideation and creation make it possible, she said.\n\nHere are the specific ways Purcell and two other solopreneurs have integrated AI into their processes to make content creation more seamless.\n\n\"I've never really thought of myself as a content-generating creative person,\" Purcell told Business Insider.\n\nBefore generative AI, she struggled to identify which content from her podcast would perform well on different platforms and often took the \"lazy route\" and simply published the same copy everywhere.\n\nNow, she's trained a custom Gem on Gemini to support her in creating content tailored to different platforms.\n\n\"I gave it the brand guidelines for the podcast, told it that it was adept at SEO, that it knew all the latest content trends, and then I asked it to start coming up with content based on the transcripts,\" she said. Prompts she uses include:\n\nShe'll do some light tweaks and editing, but the AI does most of the heavy lifting.\n\nRecently, she wrote a Substack post based on a podcast episode using this process, and a reader reached out to say how valuable the post was for them, and asked how long it took her. She had to admit it didn't take her long at all, thanks to AI.\n\nPurcell added that she's continually training this Gem on new information about her goals and audience, and always \"closes the content loop\" by telling it how different posts performed.\n\nFor Gigi Robinson, who's been a social media creator since college and now runs a consultancy called Hosts of Influence to help other creators with their brands, creativity was never the bottleneck — it was going from an idea to a finished post.\n\nRather than getting in her head about optimizing every aspect of a post, AI helps her get it done rather than focusing on perfection.\n\nFor instance, she's been able to create LinkedIn videos based on trending news stories quickly. She'll copy and paste parts of a trending article she likes into ChatGPT and ask it to generate specific talking points in her brand voice. From there, she can quickly ad-lib a video without needing to script something out herself. This approach helped her get over 100 million impressions on LinkedIn in just 90 days last year (confirmed from a tracking document viewed by Business Insider) and led to more inbound brand deals from LinkedIn.\n\nRobinson has also found AI video editing tools like Adobe Premiere and OpusClip valuable for a first round of edits. She and her contract interns still make nitpicky tweaks, but it takes much less time than doing everything manually.\n\n\"Before, video editing could take hours. With these tools, getting a cut of the video finalized for posting is usually done in under an hour,\" Robinson said.\n\nEsosa Edosomwan, the coach and nutrition specialist behind The Raw Girl and UMI, still prefers to keep her content creation process largely human-driven after experimenting with AI video and finding her audience doesn't respond to it.\n\nOutside of small things like using Claude to optimize social captions or Nano Banana for video thumbnails, the biggest benefit of AI has been helping her turn social media followers into customers. When she had a piece of content go viral on Instagram early last year, the flood of DMs became impossible to keep up with.\n\nFor help, she turned to the AI tool Manychat. In addition to the automations that send lead magnets — free resources in exchange for contact info — when followers message call-to-action phrases like \"workshop\" or \"hormones,\" she's trained the bot to respond to other messages with her brand and voice, keeping the conversation going.\n\n\"I have even had a couple times where friends thought it was me before realizing it was my chatbot,\" she said. \"That has really helped with inbound leads.\"",

But programmers have recently sounded the alarm that the productivity gains that come from AI can come at a mental cost.\n\nSiddhant Khare, a software engineer who builds AI tools, recently struck a chord with his post about the topic, which he said \"every engineer needs to confront.\" He told Business Insider that some days he used to be able to focus on just one task, but now AI is constantly pulling him in different directions.\n\nSteve Yegge, who worked at Amazon in the early days and spent 12 years at Google, said he and his friends have even started to take naps during the day to cope with exhausting AI coding sprints. He said that companies should consider imposing a 3-hour cap on AI-assisted work.\n\nAI fatigue — which is notably different than simply being tired about hearing about AI or being pressured to use it at work — has become a hot topic among software engineers, but it can also show up in other industries.",

    "fullText": "Two bitcoin-mining stocks have big upside potential, Morgan Stanley analysts say, but it's not tied to a bullish outlook for cryptocurrency.\n\nRather, the companies are well-positioned to convert to data centers to help fuel the AI boom, the bank said in a February 8 client note.\n\nTeraWulf and Cipher Mining have 159% and 158% upside, respectively, said Morgan Stanley in a note initiating coverage of the stocks. Both have seen huge surges in their share price over the last 12 months, with TeraWulf rising 245% and Cipher up 183%.\n\nThe bank listed several reasons for their \"unusually high\" price targets, including:\n\nTeraWulf, in particular, \"has a significant history of building power infrastructure, and has a track record of multiple repeat Bitcoin-toDC conversion transactions with customers,\" a team of analysts led by Stephen C. Byrd said. \"In our view, the company has a viable path to significant annual growth in power and data center capacity, and we include this growth potential in both our base and bull cases.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Cipher Mining \"has entered multiple agreements with data center customers, and has assembled a team with significant data center construction experience,\" the analysts said. As of Q2 2025, the firm had no AI power hosting contracts — now, it has 10 and 15 year deals with Google and Amazon, respectively.\n\nFrom June to December 2025, the equity value creation per watt for companies like TeraWulf and Cipher Mining rose from about $7 to $18, signalling strong demand for power.\n\nDespite Morgan Stanley's big upside targets, the bank said there are risks to its outlook. One is that the firms aren't able to execute properly on their conversion to data centers.\n\n\"These data center projects are very large relative to the overall size of the Bitcoin companies, and execution risks could result in project delays and cost overruns,\" the analysts said. \"This, in turn, could result in greater volumes of equity capital to fund these data center projects, which can cause unexpected dilution and financing challenges.\"\n\nAnother is that hyperscalers could start to pull back on AI spending. Investors have grown nervous about AI capex in recent months, as they continue to look for clues about how the hundreds of billions of dollars in annual investments will pay off.\n\n\"We view a slowdown in AI spend as the largest single risk, though the updates from hyperscalers this past week suggest the risk to AI infrastructure capex is to the upside, not to the downside,\" the note said. \"Though the AI infrastructure industry remains under-supplied with power, it is possible that key AI players could moderate their data center capex for any number of reasons.\"",

    "title": "Apple's Big AI Siri Plans Are Once Again Delayed",
    "description": "The new Siri was supposed to launch with iOS 26.4.",
    "fullText": "If you're an Apple fan who closely follows tech news, you might have been looking forward to Siri's big AI overhaul for some time now—specifically, since the company initially announced it at WWDC 2024. But despite delay after delay, rumors have strongly suggested that the next generation of Siri is set to launch with iOS 26.4. And seeing as Apple just released iOS 26.3 this week, AI Siri is closer than ever, right? Wrong.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has once again kicked Siri's big updates down the road. According to Gurman, the company really did intend to release AI Siri with iOS 26.4, which is reportedly planned to release sometime in March. However, due to testing \"snags,\" the company is instead planning to break up Siri's major updates and distribute them across several iOS updates. Gurman notes that likely means iOS 26.5, which could launch in May, and iOS 27, which will likely release in September, if it follows Apple's usual release dates. But looking at Apple's track record here, don't hold your breath.\n\nAccording to Gurman's sources, Apple is struggling to get Siri to \"properly process queries,\" or to actually respond fast enough, both of which would defeat the purpose of using a smart assistant. Apple is reportedly pushing engineers to use iOS 26.5 to test these features, particularly the ability for Siri to use your personal data to answer questions. Users may be able to flip a switch in Settings to \"preview\" these features, and may treat the rollout as a beta.\n\nEngineers are also struggling to get Siri's app intents to work, or the feature that lets Siri take actions on your behalf. You could ask Siri to open an image, edit it, then share it with a friend, but only if the feature itself actually works. This, too, may roll out with iOS 26.5, but it's unclear due to reliability issues. Siri is also cutting off user prompts too soon, and sometimes taps into ChatGPT instead of using Apple's underlying tech—which would look pretty bad for the company.\n\nApple is also testing new AI features for iOS 26.5 that we haven't heard of yet. One is a new web search tool that functions like other AI search features from companies like Perplexity and Google. You ask a question to search on the web, and it returns a report with summaries and links. The other new feature is a custom image generation tool, that builds on Image Playground, but that too is hitting development hurdles.\n\nLooking even further ahead, Apple is planning more Siri advancements—namely, giving the assistant chatbot features, à la ChatGPT. (That said, it will reportedly use Gemini to power these features.) This version of Siri may even have its own app.\n\nIt seems Siri really is Apple's albatross. Despite arguably popularizing smart assistants for the general population, Siri quickly fell behind compared to the likes of Alexa and Gemini (née Google Assistant). Now, the latter have fully embraced modern generative AI, offering features like contextual awareness and natural language commands. While Amazon and Google users can ask their assistants increasingly complicated questions, Siri still feels designed mostly to handle setting alarms and checking the weather.\n\nThat was going to change with iOS 18, alongside Apple Intelligence as a whole. Apple's initial pitch for AI Siri was an assistant that could see what's on your phone to better understand questions you ask, and take actions on your behalf—i.e., app intents. You could ask Siri to edit an image you have pulled up on your Photos app, and because the assistant is contextually aware, it would know what image you mean, and apply the edits you ask for. Or, you could ask when your friend was set to arrive, and the assistant would be able to scan messages and emails to know that, one, your friend is visiting town this weekend, and two, that they sent you their flight itinerary that gets them into the airport at 3:55 p.m.\n\nThis Siri has never launched, however. While the company has rolled out iterative updates to Siri with some AI-powered features, its overhaul with these ambitious features have been a trial for Apple's AI team. It all stems from Apple's issues with AI in general: The company was caught off guard by the generative AI wave kicked off in late 2022 by OpenAI's ChatGPT, and following some resistance from corporate leadership, have been scrambling to keep up ever since. Apple Intelligence launched half-baked with issues of its own, but rather than launch a half-baked AI Siri, the company has been struggling to build up the assistant internally.\n\nPart of the problem is privacy-\n\nApple is the second most valuable tech company in the world, but a host of factors—including with software, hardware, and leadership—have made it so even Apple can't magically produce an AI assistant. Though, I'm not sold that an AI Siri will move units for Apple in the first place. I can't imagine Gemini moves people to Android, and you can download ChatGPT on any device you own. It's even now built into your iPhone.",

    "title": "AI Chatbots Are Even Worse at Giving Medical Advice Than We Thought",
    "description": "Even when they have the “right” information, they can lead you astray.",
    "fullText": "It’s tempting to think that an LLM chatbot can answer any question you pose it, including those about your health. After all, chatbots have been trained on plenty of medical information, and can regurgitate it if given the right prompts. But that doesn’t mean they will give you accurate medical advice, and a new study shows how easily AI’s supposed expertise breaks down. In short, they are even worse at it than I thought.\n\nIn the study, researchers first quizzed several chatbots about medical information. In these carefully conducted tests, ChatGPT-4o, Llama 3, and Command R+ correctly diagnosed medical scenarios an impressive 94% of the time—though they were able to recommend the right treatment a much less impressive 56% of the time.\n\nBut that wasn’t a real-world test for the chatbots medical utility.\n\nThe researchers then gave medical scenarios to 1,298 people, and asked them to use an LLM to figure out what might be going on in that scenario, plus what they should do about it (for example, whether they should call an ambulance, follow up with their doctor when convenient, or take care of the issue on their own).\n\nThe participants were recruited through an online platform that reported it verifies that research subjects are real humans and not bots themselves. Some participants were in a control group that was told to research the scenario on their own, and not using any AI tools. In the end, the no-AI control group did far better than the LLM-using group in correctly identifying medical conditions, including most serious “red flag” scenarios.\n\nAs the researchers write, “Strong performance from the LLMs operating alone is not sufficient for strong performance with users.” Plenty of previous research has shown that chatbot output is sensitive to the exact phrasing people use when asking questions, and that chatbots seem to prioritize pleasing a user over giving correct information.\n\nEven if an LLM bot can correctly answer an objectively phrased question, that doesn’t mean it will give you good advice when you need it. That’s why it doesn’t really matter that ChatGPT can “pass” a modified medical licensing exam—success at answering formulaic multiple choice questions is not the same thing as telling you when you need to go to the hospital.\n\nThe researchers analyzed chat logs to figure out where things broke down. Here are some of the issues they identified:\n\nThe users didn’t always give the bot all of the relevant information. As non-experts, the users certainly didn’t know what was most important to include. If you’ve been to a doctor about anything potentially serious, you know they’ll pepper you with questions to be sure you aren’t leaving out something important. The bots don’t necessarily do that.\n\nThe bots “generated several types of misleading and incorrect information.” Sometimes they ignored important details to narrow in on something else; sometimes they recommended calling an emergency number but gave the wrong one (such as an Australian emergency number for U.K. users).\n\nResponses could be drastically different for similar prompts. In one example, two users gave nearly identical messages about a subarachnoid hemorrhage. One response told the user to seek emergency care; the other said to lie down in a dark room.\n\nPeople varied in how they conversed with the chatbot. For example, some asked specific questions to constrain the bot’s answers, but some let the bot take the lead. Either method could introduce unreliability into the LLM's output.\n\nCorrect answers were often grouped with incorrect answers. On average, each LLM gave 2.21 answers for the user to choose from. People understandably did not always choose correctly from those options.\n\nOverall, people who didn't use LLMs were 1.76 times more likely to get the right diagnosis. (Both groups were similarly likely to figure out the right course of action, but that's not saying much—on average, they only got it right about 43% of the time.) The researchers described the control group as doing \"significantly better\" at the task. And this may represent a best-case scenario: the researchers point out that they provided clear examples of common conditions, and LLMs would likely do worse with rare conditions or more complicated medical scenarios. They conclude: “Despite strong performance from the LLMs alone, both on existing benchmarks and on our scenarios, medical expertise was insufficient for effective patient care.”\n\nPatients may not know how to talk to an LLM, or how to vet its output, but surely doctors would fare better, right? Unfortunately, people in the medical field are also using AI chatbots for medical information in ways that create risks to patient care.\n\nECRI, a medical safety nonprofit, put the misuse of AI chatbots in the number one spot on its list of health technology hazards of 2026. While the AI hype machine is trying to convince you to give ChatGPT your medical information, ECRI correctly points out that it’s wrong to think of these chatbots as having human personalities or cognition: “While these models produce humanlike responses, they do so by predicting the next word based on large datasets, not through genuine comprehension of the information.”\n\nECRI reports that physicians are, in fact, using generative AI tools for patient care, and that research has already shown the serious risks involved. Using LLMs does not improve doctors’ clinical reasoning. LLMs will elaborate confidently on incorrect details included in prompts. Google’s Med-Gemini model, created for medical use, made up a nonexistent body part whose name was a mashup of two unrelated real body parts; Google told a Verge reporter that the mistake was a “typo.”  ECRI argues that “because LLM responses often sound authoritative, the risk exists that clinicians may subconsciously factor AI-generated suggestions into their judgments without critical review.”\n\nEven in situations that don’t seem like life-and-death cases, consulting a chatbot can cause harm. ECRI asked four LLMs to recommend brands of gel that could be used with a certain ultrasound device on a patient with an indwelling catheter near the area being scanned. It’s important to use a sterile gel in this situation, because of the risk of infection. Only one of the four chatbots identified this issue and made appropriate suggestions; the others just recommended regular ultrasound gels. In other cases, ECRI’s tests resulted in chatbots giving unsafe advice on electrode placement and isolation gowns.\n\nClearly, LLM chatbots are not ready to be trusted to keep people safe when seeking medical care, whether you’re the person who needs care, the doctor treating them, or even the staffer ordering supplies. But the services are already out there, being widely used and aggressively promoted. (Their makers are even fighting in the Super Bowl ads.) There’s no good way to be sure these chatbots aren’t involved in your care, but at the very least we can stick with good old Dr. Google—just make sure to disable AI-powered search results.",

    "description": "Anthropic and OpenAI now have their own well-funded political groups that will square off in the midterm elections over artificial intelligence safety and regulation.",
    "fullText": "Silicon Valley’s dueling artificial intelligence start-ups now have dueling super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, the safety-focused A.I. company formed by former OpenAI executives, said on Thursday that it was putting $20 million into a new super PAC operation that will be in opposition to super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors.\n\nThe donation effectively kicks off a new conflict between the rivals, with this year’s midterm elections as the battleground. At the heart of the disagreement between the companies is whether to regulate the artificial intelligence industry with more safety guardrails around the powerful technology. Anthropic generally favors politicians who are more pro-regulation than OpenAI does.\n\nThe New York Times reported in November that the group Anthropic donated to, Public First Action, was in talks with the company to fund its effort to help ensure that OpenAI did not amass too much political power. The regulation-skeptical super PACs backed by OpenAI’s leaders and investors are called Leading the Future.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, Anthropic did not name OpenAI but warned that “vast resources have flowed to political organizations that oppose” A.I. safety efforts.\n\n“The A.I. policy decisions we make in the next few years will touch nearly every part of public life,” the company wrote. “We don’t want to sit on the sidelines while these policies are developed.”\n\nAnthropic’s funding will supercharge an effort to elect federal lawmakers who favor more extensive A.I. regulation, a position at odds with the Trump administration.\n\nPublic First is a dark-money nonprofit, which means it is not required to disclose its donors but can air television ads on behalf of candidates. On Thursday, it said it would begin a television ad campaign “thanking” Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is running for governor in her state, for her work on tech policy.\n\nPublic First also funds two allied super PACs. One, Defending Our Values PAC, said it would begin an ad campaign on behalf of Senator Pete Ricketts, Republican of Nebraska, who faces re-election in 2026 and has also been outspoken on A.I. safety.\n\nThe Public First effort was started as a rejoinder to the Leading the Future super PACs backed by OpenAI leaders and investors, which have publicly reported raising over $50 million so far. About half of that came from the OpenAI investor Andreessen Horowitz and about half from the family of Greg Brockman, president and co-founder of OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI, which was until recently a traditional nonprofit, has not been allowed to make direct political contributions. But the company has mounted an aggressive Washington policy push over the last several years, which now includes an expressly political component through its aligned super PACs.\n\nAnthropic, by contrast, is making a contribution in its own name. The San Francisco-based company had spent at least five months “actively working” on a super PAC strategy, said Jack Clark, a co-founder, in September, as part of a broader effort to find its way in Washington.\n\nAnthropic’s $20 million contribution carries some political risks. While OpenAI has been largely embraced by the Trump administration, Anthropic and its chief executive, Dario Amodei, have been perceived as a thorn in the White House’s side. Administration officials such as David Sacks, the White House’s A.I. chief, have regularly and publicly criticized Anthropic. Mr. Sacks said in October that the company was promoting a “state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the start-up ecosystem.”",

    "description": ": Like a puppy, a fun new toy soon turns into an unrelenting taskmaster",
    "fullText": "A Harvard Business Review study is answering the question ‘what will employees do if AI saves them time at work?’ The answer: more work.\n\nResearchers Aruna Ranganathan and Xingqi Maggie Ye with University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business studied a set of 40 workers at a 200-employee tech company from April to December last year to see whether generative AI had changed work habits in engineering, product, design, research, and operations.\n\n\"We found that employees worked at a faster pace, took on a broader scope of tasks, and extended work into more hours of the day, often without being asked to do so,\" the researchers wrote. \"Importantly, the company did not mandate AI use (though it did offer enterprise subscriptions to commercially available AI tools). On their own initiative, workers did more because AI made 'doing more' feel possible, accessible, and in many cases intrinsically rewarding.\"\n\nUnfortunately the intensity of the work, the longer hours, and task expansion, led employees to feel stretched too thin, as the added work ate into their personal time.\n\n\"That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making,” the researchers satiated. “The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work, turnover, and other problems.\"\n\nDuring interviews with the employees, researchers found that using generative AI made it easier for employees to begin tasks that may have otherwise been daunting when starting from a blank page. Additionally, they were more willing to take on new responsibilities that had belonged to other roles thanks to a cognitive boost from AI.\n\nBut there were also engineering employees who found themselves checking the work of novice coders for errors, coaching vibe coders, and finishing projects that others had started.\n\nBecause it was easy to start tasks, the workers in the study began to work during breaks, at night and early in the morning, with fewer natural pauses in their workday.\n\n\"What looks like higher productivity in the short run can mask silent workload creep and growing cognitive strain as employees juggle multiple AI-enabled workflows,\" researchers said. \"Because the extra effort is voluntary and often framed as enjoyable experimentation, it is easy for leaders to overlook how much additional load workers are carrying.\"\n\nThe fear is that this could impair judgement, increase the likelihood of errors, and mask unsustainable intensity as productivity gains.\n\n\"For workers, the cumulative effect is fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,\" the paper stated.\n\nEmployees have some cause to fear losing their jobs with Forrester’s most recent AI job replacement research estimates that the technology could uproot 6 percent of jobs by 2030, or about 10.4 million, through robotic process automation, business process automation, physical robotics, and generative AI.\n\nHowever, whether that comes with added productivity is a separate argument. Forrester’s vice president and principal analyst J. P. Gownder recently told The Register he is unconvinced that AI will revolutionize productivity.\n\nThe Berkeley researchers suggested developing a set of standards to prevent burnout.\n\nThis includes \"intentional pauses\" to fight back against the blurred boundaries between roles, regulate the tempo of development, and make sure tasks that begin with one purpose don’t meander from the company’s goals.\n\n\"For example, a decision pause could require, before a major decision is finalized, one counterargument and one explicit link to organizational goals — widening the attention field just enough to protect against drift,” the researchers wrote. \"Incorporating such pauses into everyday workflow is one way organizations can support better decisions, healthier boundaries, and more sustainable forms of productivity in AI-augmented environments.\"\n\nThey also advise organizations to work on projects in coherent phases and to move forward deliberately rather than at the pace that AI might allow them to move. Make the team lead the AI; don’t let the AI lead the team.\n\n“By regulating the order and timing of work — rather than demanding continuous responsiveness — sequencing can help organizations preserve attention, reduce cognitive overload, and support more thoughtful decision-making in AI-forward workplaces,” they wrote.\n\nIntroducing more human interaction can also help prevent the depleting effects of AI-mediated work.\n\n\"As AI enables more solo, self-contained work, organizations can benefit from protecting time and space for listening and human connection. Short opportunities to connect with others—whether through brief check-ins, shared reflection moments, or structured dialogue—interrupt continuous solo engagement with AI tools and help restore perspective.\" ®",

He predicts that by the end of 2026, the company will have \"at least half a dozen products\" written entirely with AI, with no human-written lines of code, he said.\n\n\"We won't have developers at Cisco that don't use AI as a core habit within the way that they get the job done,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't worry about AI taking your job, but worry about someone using AI better than you definitely taking your job,\" he added.\n\nTech leaders are going all in on AI agents.\n\nStackBlitz CEO Eric Simons told Business Insider he wants more AI agents than human employees at his startup this year — a milestone that reflects a broader transformation sweeping the software industry.\n\nAI can already write code, manage tasks, and coordinate across platforms. OpenClaw, a personal AI assistant that works across messaging apps, is one example of how agents can operate on a human's behalf with minimal involvement.\n\n\"This is a crystal ball into the wildness of the inevitable future,\" Simons told Business Insider in a report published Wednesday.\n\n\"Your AI agents will talk to other people's agents on your behalf — negotiating pricing for a product you want to buy, checking restaurant availability, even arguing your political viewpoints,\" he added.\n\nSoftware stocks slid in recent weeks as investors grappled with the idea that AI may replace software.\n\nStill, there are warning signs. Agentic systems can become fragile at scale. If hallucinations multiply as agents interact, small errors can cascade, said Nicolas Darveau-Garneau, a former Google executive and author of \"Be a Sequoia, Not a Bonsai.\"\n\n\"The only way we get massive productivity gains is the day we can trust that the AI isn't hallucinating a lot,\" Darveau-Garneau said.",

    "description": "Matt Shumer said he wrote his viral essay for people like his dad who are skeptical of AI or just trying to avoid it entirely.",
    "fullText": "The author of the viral essay warning about impending AI disruption says he couldn't wait any longer to get the word out.\n\n\"Let's say there is just a 20% chance of it happening, which is maybe realistic, maybe underselling it,\" Matt Shumer, GP of Shumer Capital, said during an interview with Business Insider. \"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare.\"\n\nThe people in tech who previously warned about AI's impact were mostly speaking to others in the industry, he said. Shumer said he wanted something that spoke to his dad, a lawyer who is just a few years from retirement and is hopeful he can run out the clock on the potential massive change on the horizon.\n\nHe's certainly found an audience.\n\nHis essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" has been viewed over 60 million times on X alone, as of Wednesday evening. In the nearly 5,000-word post, Shumer wrote that AI's disruption to people's lives could be \"much bigger\" than COVID — a comparison that has drawn some pushback online. He also wrote that what he's seeing in tech is likely what awaits other industries.\n\n\"I don't know that this is coming for sure, but I think a lot of us in tech really see this progress, and it's frankly dizzying, and there's a good chance of this,\" he said. \"And the more people know, the better.\"\n\nShumer is not alone in his fears about the future.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who is known for writing eyebrow-raising essays of his own, has said that up to half of all entry-level, white-collar jobs may be wiped out in the next one to five years. xAI CEO Elon Musk has called AI a \"supersonic tsunami\" that will quickly eliminate jobs that don't involve physical labor.\n\nShumer said even he is unsettled about the prospects of AI. After all, he's 26 and still near the beginning years of his career. In 2020, he cofounded OthersideAI, which later spawned HyperWrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\n\"I don't know how many more years of my career there will be if this all actually comes to pass,\" he told Business Insider. \"So, it's frankly a little confusing and terrifying for someone like me.\"\n\nPart of the issue is that AI is unlikely to affect all industries in the same way or at the same time, making career advice highly dependent on a person's specific situation.\n\n\"If you're a nurse, you're probably going to be fine for quite some time,\" he told Business Insider, adding that junior associates at law school face significantly more risk because many of the introductory-type tasks they do are already being targeted by AI companies.\n\nIn his essay, Shumer wrote that his realization of what's in store came after his experience with OpenAI's GPT-5.3-Codex, which was released last week. In its release notes, OpenAI said GPT-5.3-Codex was its \"first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\" Shumer wrote that AI is now capable of doing his technical work.\n\nAs for the other tasks, Shumer has been quite open about how AI helped him write his viral essay about AI. He said he spent hours working with Claude to craft his message.\n\n\"It did help a lot,\" he told TBPN on Wednesday, \"and I think that's kind of the point.\"\n\nIt's why Shumer's message to everyone who turned away from AI, perhaps after a clunky experience with an early version of ChatGPT years ago, is that they should seize the opportunity to see the breadth of what the technology can do now.\n\n\"If you look back 10 years from now and this did come to pass, you'll be very glad you did,\" he told Business Insider.",

    "description": "Norway's Sturla Holm Lægreid overshared at the Winter Olympics with his infidelity confession. It's an example of how Gen Z has taken over the games.",
    "fullText": "Can you remember the last time a bronze medalist became the big story out of an Olympic event? Here's one for you: During his post-race interview, Norway's Sturla Holm Lægreid didn't talk about the run he'd completed, which earned him the bronze medal in men's biathlon. Instead, he chose to tell the world about how he cheated on his ex-girlfriend.\n\n\"I told her a week ago. And it's been the worst week of my life,\" Lægreid told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. \"Sports has taken a bit of a back seat these past couple of days. Yeah, I wish I could share this with her.\"\n\nLægreid later apologized to the gold medalist and his ex-girlfriend, saying he deeply regretted sharing about his breakup, in a statement through the Norwegian Olympic team. He didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHis impulse, however, is a particularly Gen Z one. Was it a public display of accountability? Maybe. Was it classic oversharing at work? Definitely.\n\nGen Z has been in the Olympics since 2016, but this winter feels like the first Olympics where they are truly dominating the competition. The median age of Team USA at this year's games is about 28. In banner sports like figure skating and snowboarding, the median age is closer to 23. The Gen Z energy is undeniable in how these athletes conduct themselves on the world stage. Whether it's oversharing about their relationships, speaking out on politics, or using AI in performance, it's the Gen Z Olympics, and we're just watching it.\n\nSome of Team USA's most high-profile athletes are Gen Zers. Skating's \"Quad God\" Ilia Malinin, 21, shares the same name as one of the main characters on the gay hockey romance show \"Heated Rivalry,\" a favorite of Gen Z lookalike competitions. On the women's side, does anyone look more Gen Z than alt-girl figure skater Alysa Liu? With skunk stripe hair, tooth gems, and a frenulum piercing, she reps the alt scene that's making a comeback with the youth.\n\nThen there's Liu's teammate Amber Glenn, whose career follows Gen Z's tendency toward late blooming. She's making her Olympic debut at 26, which is slightly older than the typical age for female figure skaters. Liu and Isabeau Levito — the third US women's figure skating teammate — are 20 and 18 years old, respectively.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be Gen Z without a dash of political engagement and a public statement. Glenn, who is openly pansexual, directly addressed discrimination against the queer community under President Trump at a press conference on Feb. 4.\n\n\"I hope that I can use my platform and my voice throughout these Games to try to encourage people to stay strong,\" Glenn told reporters.\n\nWhen asked about the turmoil around ICE at a different press conference, members of the US ski team didn't shy away from voicing their opinions, either. Hunter Hess, 27, talked about the \"mixed emotions\" of repping the US while ICE raids were happening at home.\n\n\"There's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren't. Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the U.S.,\" Hess said.\n\nThe Olympics aren't untouched by AI either — a Czech ice dancing pair used a music mix that was half AI-generated for their rhythm dance. It's also not the first time that these skaters, who are 19 and 22 years old, have used AI music for a routine, which at least shows they're pretty LLM-native and the Olympic Committee is okay with it.\n\nIf that grinds your gears a little, just be thankful Gen Alpha hasn't hit the scene yet. Can you imagine how many celebratory 6-7s we'll be subject to?",

The bad news is that's because most of them will be out of a job.\n\nSoftware veteran Steve Yegge predicts that AI will eventually lead Big Tech companies to cut 50% of their engineers. (He wasn't a total drag. Yegge offered advice to software engineers for avoiding the 'vampiric effect' of AI.)\n\n\"Ok, but I don't work in tech. Why do I care?\" you callously ask. (So cold!)\n\nWell, according to the people in the thick of it, AI isn't stopping with them.\n\nMatt Shumer, the CEO of an AI startup, warned AI's disruption will be \"much bigger\" than COVID. The post has racked up more than 69 million views on X, gaining traction outside traditional tech circles. Shumer spoke to BI's Brent D. Griffiths about the post and the fact that he (surprise!) used AI to help him write it.\n\nIt's worth noting Shumer's company specializes in AI personal assistants. He certainly benefits from getting people on board with AI. But that doesn't invalidate a lot of his points about workers needing to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.\n\nThere's a counterargument to the doomsday prophecy.\n\nMaybe engineering jobs are especially ripe for AI disruption?\n\nThe job, after all, is highly digital and requires hard skills, two factors that make it a strong candidate for AI automation.\n\nSoftware engineers have also been somewhat insulated from the tech-based disruptions the rest of us have endured and adapted to during the pre-AI times. A new tool here. A new app there. At some point, many of us have gotten numb to tech disrupting what we do. You just figure out how to adapt.\n\nMeanwhile, software engineers were living on easy street. You don't have to worry about the tools when you're the ones building them. For years, software developers enjoyed healthy salaries, good work-life balance, and fantastic job security.\n\nNow the tables are turned, and suddenly it's everyone's problem?\n\nI'm not suggesting AI won't impact the rest of us. For starters, entry-level jobs across the board appear to be on the chopping block thanks to AI. Consultants also seem ripe for some shakeups. And the legal industry is certainly feeling the heat.\n\n(I could mention journalism, but we were on the extinction list long before AI. When I started college in 2007, my professors all told me the industry was dying. Almost two decades later, we're still here. If anything, it looks like AI has created some high-paying jobs for writers.)\n\nAI might end up being massively disruptive for all of us, but at this point, we're all used to it.\n\nWhere do you stand on the AI doomsday prophecy?

    "description": "Connecting AI agents to your database via MCP? You're missing half the picture. Add your app's source code to unlock domain-aware product insights.",
    "fullText": "Product managers, analysts, and developers are connecting their AI agents to databases via MCP. This can give some product answers—but it’s like looking at a blueprint of an apartment.\n\nA blueprint missings details about the rooms, the furniture and the people living in the apartment.\n\nYou’re missing your application domain language.\n\nYour application sourcode is what’s missing for you to see what’s going on inside the apartment.\n\nI will show examples adapted from real life work of how connecting an AI Agent to a copy of your application sourcecode and your application database allows to ask domain specific questions (thanks to the domain logic stored in the app source code) and leverage the latest application data (ideally from a production replica database connection) to generate insights and solve bugs.\n\nNew to LLMs, MCPs, agents? Read my primer for some core concepts.\n\nWhen your Agent has access to an MCP connected to your database and you ask it:\n\nHow many document extracts are complete?\n\nA database MCP like dbhub will allow the Agent to answer based on the limited visibility gained from the database layout. A blueprint. The Agent will do its best but probably fall in to guess work based on the limited context which in this case is just what the MCP can see (table, column names and data).\n\nAn MCP connected only to your application database won’t have access to your application / domain specific language.\n\nIt’s gonna add critical details to the blueprint of your apartment. The Agent will be able to tell where the furniture is and what each room really is. The Agent will be able to give better answers without guess work.\n\nAnd when the MCP is connected to a production replica… you’ll get live insights.\n\nI thought it would be interesting way to see the value and pitfalls of this approach trough real conversations I had with Claude Code. I simplified the domain and stripped the conversations from any internal metrics and nuances to respect client confidentiality.\n\nLet’s say your application handles thousands of document extracting informations. These extractions can be in several states. If you asked the following prompt to an Agent that’s just connected to your application database via a DB MCP mcp__appdb_prod_replica:\n\nhow many document extract records are pending?\n\nI'll query the database to count \"pending\" items. First, I'll locate the relevant extract tables/columns and confirm what \"pending\" maps to.\n\nPending wasn't explicitly defined, so the assistant will try to inferred it from the schema default (status default = 0) and validated by counting grouped status. This happen to be correct but what if your app defines \"pending\" differently (e.g., another field called progress or a status/progress combo)?\n\nHere the tool call to the DB MCP found multiple tables matching document extract... but he guessed the right one.\n\n\"Pending\" is likely represented by a default status value. I'll enumerate status values to confirm counts.\n\nIf \"pending\" corresponds to status = 0 (the column default), then pending items = 23,208. Full status distribution: 0→23,208; 1→143; 2→168; 3→19,029.\n\nSo the Agent made an assumption and it turns out it was correct. The value for 0 are the records in default / pending state.\n\nBut if I asked “how many document extract records are running?” the Agent would not find any reference about a “running” status and allucinate!\n\nhow many document extract records are running?\n\nI'll query the database to find records that are currently running. Let me first explore the relevant tables.\n\nI see a status column. Let me check the distribution of values.\n\nLooking at the status values, I can see four states: 0, 1, 2, and 3. Status 0 is the default (likely \"new\" or \"queued\"), and status 3 has the highest non-default count suggesting \"completed\". Between 1 and 2, status 2 has a slightly higher count—in most workflow systems, \"running\" or \"in progress\" states tend to accumulate more records than transient error states.\n\nThere are 168 document extract records currently running.\n\nWrong. The agent guessed status 2 means \"running\" based on workflow pattern assumptions. But status 2 is actually \"failed\" and status 1 is \"running\". A plausible-sounding explanation that's completely incorrect—the real answer is 143, not 168.\n\nSome might say “Yeah AI sometime is wrong, humans are wrong too”… yeah right but this Agent + DB MCP is going to Vegas! Its guessing is due to a limited architecture. But it’s very easy to enhance it.\n\nLet’s see what happens when you run the same prompt but giving the Agent access to the application source code.\n\nIn the following conversations Claude Code was running from a directory with a copy of the application sourcecode.\n\nI didn’t even tell it about it. It just found and used the application sourcecode to fill in the gaps in its context. Now the Agent with the application domain language can get us much more useful responses.\n\nhow many document extract records are processing?\n\nI'll search for document extract tables and check the status values to find items that are currently processing.\n\nLet me check the distinct status values to identify which one represents \"processing\".\n\nNotice Claude sees 0, 2, and 3—but no status 1. Rather than assuming like it did earlier, it now checks the application source code to understand what these enum values actually mean. (enums map the status numbers to meaningful sentences)\n\nLet me check the model to understand what these status values mean.\n\n- 0 = pending\n- 1 = running\n- 2 = failed\n- 3 = completed\n\nLet me confirm by querying specifically for the \"processing\" status (1).\n\n143 document extract records are currently processing.\n\nHere's the breakdown of all status:\n\nThis is a simplified example but with the same approach you can leverage your application domain language and generate any kinda of insights.\n\nIn a brand new context free chat I instead of the raw application sourcecode I gave access to a Repomix file instead of the raw sourcode.\n\nThink of raw sourcecode as a filing cabinet stuffed with folders. Repomix turns it into a single searchable document—an index the agent can scan in seconds instead of opening drawer after drawer.\n\nWe’ll end up with a similar result:\n\nuse the @repomix-output.xml with the appdb production replica and find out how many document extract records are processing?\n\nI'll read the repomix output file and search for information about document extract records and their progresses.\n\nLet me search \n\nI found the status enum. The document_extract_records table has a status column with values: pending (0), running (1), failed (2), completed (3).\n\nLet me query the database to find how many items are currently processing.\n\nBased on the database query, here are the results:\n\nThere are currently 143 document extract records in the \"processing\" status.\n\nThe system has:\n 23,208 items pending\n 143 items currently processing\n 168 items that failed to import\n 19,029 items successfully processed\n\nRepomix will allow you to package parts of your code in “AI-friendly” ways so instead of the full codebase you’d leverage only the context that is needed.\n\nTo replicate this workflow, you need to provide your Agent with two distinct “eyes”: one for your static logic (code) and one for your dynamic state (database).\n\nWe use the DBHub MCP to give the Agent a secure, structured way to explore the database. You can connect this to a local download of your db or for most up to date insights to an ssh-tunneled read-only production replica (that’s what I do).\n\nThe Agent needs to see your “Domain Language”—the enums and constants that live in your files.\n\nI use Claude Code integrated in VS Code, but several other agentic clients handle this workflow natively: Cursor (excellent codebase indexing), Cline and Roo Code (VS Code extensions), and Goose (CLI-first, built by Block). Any of these will work.\n\nDownload a snapshot of the database and connect your DB MCP to that local copy. You’ll lose real-time data but keep the domain language benefits.\n\nStart with just the codebase access. Have your agent generate queries based on the domain logic, then run those queries manually in your DB console. Show the value, iterate, build trust.\n\nThe solution: Curate what matters\n\nYou don’t need your entire codebase—just the parts that define your domain language:\n\nRepomix with filters - Use .repomixignore to exclude tests, vendor code, and UI components. Focus on app/models/, lib/, and domain logic.\n\nGit submodules - Create a separate “domain context” repo that pulls in only the relevant directories from your main codebase.\n\nManual selection - In Claude Code/Cursor, use @filename to reference specific model files instead of loading the whole project.\n\nFor the last 12 months I’ve been integrating this flow in my lead product role and enabling analysts and developers on my team.\n\nBut this approach leverages the domain language already present in your application source code. Combined with a powerful AI model and a DB MCP, it lets you ask domain-specific questions and generate meaningful product insights.\n\nAlways keep a critical mindset and observe these 3 pillars, even more meaningful now in the age of AI-generated content:\n\nNow you’ve seen how to effectively leverage your app sourcecode when using Agents and MCPs. An often overlooked detail that I hope will help you in becoming even more effective at generating product insights on your software with the help of AI.",

    "fullText": "Six US states are pushing legislation to put a moratorium on artificial intelligence (AI) data center construction.\n\nYahoo Finance Breaking Business News Reporter Jake Conley joins Market Domination Overtime host Josh Lipton to outline the details of these bills and the potential ramifications down the road.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.\n\nWhich states are pushing back and why are they pushing back?\n\nYeah, Josh, you've got six states with bills being considered right now. You've got Oklahoma, Vermont, and Maryland, but also three major hubs, New York, Georgia, and Virginia, home to Data Center alley in the Lowden area.\n\nThose back three have been huge sites of development. These bills are structured in a few different ways, but the basic underlying principle\n\nis that they look to put a moratorium on data center development. Essentially saying from roughly one year to a roughly three-year window,\n\nyou cannot develop here, you cannot build here until certain hurdles are met or until we get a pipeline cleaned up of requests or ex-conditions are met.\n\nBut essentially this is saying to those developers, these states, if these bills pass, will be walled off to you.\n\nAnd the the real argument here is infrastructure strain. These data centers suck up a lot of energy. They suck up a lot of water. That's going to put pressure on rate payers bills. You already see electricity bills hiking in these areas that have had a lot of development.\n\nYou see water strain in those areas. The grid is under a lot of stress. And so lawmakers are now trying to get ahead of that and saying, wait, wait, wait, slow down. Let's get some stuff on the books, get some regulations in place. But to do that, we want a breather.\n\nWhat what are the chances uh that these bills actually do pass, Jake?\n\nThey're going to face an uphill battle for a few reasons. You got to remember these data centers bring jobs. They bring tax revenue.\n\nAlso, the companies that are behind these centers, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, these aren't easy to push aside. These are companies with real political heft and firepower, with real pressure. And a lot of these governors are at least nominally pro-development.\n\nSo the argument they're going to come up against from these data center developers is, hey, we're bringing you jobs. We're bringing you revenue. Why would you stop us from building? And they're going to face that same kind of push back from business interests, business lobby.\n\nEven if these bills don't go through, you could still see and probably still will see some kind of regulation, cost sharing agreements, water usage parameters. But the focus right now because of their top line impact is on these moratoriums.\n\nHow much, Jake final question, could this all sort of disrupt the great AI ambitions and dreams of Big Tech?\n\nI think the rule with the hyper scales right now is speed, right? There's an arms race going on. You see these companies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on building out this infrastructure. And the game here right now for for Microsoft, for Google, for all these companies building these out is speed.\n\nHow fast can we get these things put up to power the compute that we're trying to put into the market. Any kind of delay there is going to hurt those companies and slow them down.\n\nI was talking to someone today who works in site selection advising these companies on where to go. She was telling me you're already seeing people inside these companies take a second look at some of these spots and say maybe that's not the right idea. Maybe we go somewhere\n\nwith less laws on the rest proposals on the books. The problem is those areas have less infrastructure. So you're going to run into problems wherever you go.\n\nBut regardless, especially in these kind of bigger sites, bigger states where a lot of this development is happening, when the rule of speed, anything that's going to slow speed down is going to be detrimental.\n\nAll right, big story. Thank you Jake for covering it. Appreciate it. Thanks.",

    "description": "Anthropic pledged to cover all grid upgrade costs for its AI data centers, saying households shouldn't foot the bill.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic says it's going to foot the bill for electricity price increases tied to its data centers.\n\n\"We will pay for 100% of the grid upgrades needed to interconnect our data centers,\" Anthropic said in a blog post published Wednesday, adding that it will absorb costs that might otherwise be passed on to American households.\n\nAnthropic said it will secure additional power to avoid pushing up electricity prices and invest in \"grid optimization tools\" designed to reduce strain and keep prices low.\n\n\"The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,\" Anthropic said. \"But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.\"\n\nAnthropic's pledge comes months after the company said it is investing $50 billion in AI infrastructure in the US, beginning with data centers in Texas and New York.\n\nTech giants are pouring staggering sums into AI infrastructure as they race to expand data center capacity, a buildout that has drawn scrutiny over rising electricity costs.\n\nIn November, Meta said it would invest $600 billion in the US \"to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.\" Apple said in August it would add another $100 billion to its US infrastructure spending, bringing its total investment to $600 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, utility bills are climbing. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate increases from state regulators last year, more than double the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many utilities have cited power demand from data centers as the key factor for rate increases.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has urged Big Tech to prevent data centers from pushing up electricity costs.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote last month in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nMicrosoft last month introduced similar measures, saying it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the cost of its data centers' electricity use and reduce the impact of its data center expansion on local residents.",

    "fullText": "With many unable to access or afford qualified therapists, AI is filling the mental healthcare vacuum, amid calls for tighter regulation\n\nOn a quiet evening in her Abuja hotel, Joy Adeboye, 23, sits on her bed clutching her phone, her mind racing and chest tightening. On her screen is yet another abusive message from her stalker – a man she had met nine months earlier at her church.\n\nHe had asked Adeboye out; when she declined, he began sending her intimidating, insulting and blackmailing messages on social media, as well as spreading false information about her online. There were even death threats.\n\nThe experience is taking its toll on her mental health, leaving her struggling to cope. Family and friends she confided in did not take it seriously, and she cannot afford in-person therapy or counselling. As the feeling of panic rose at the sight of his words, she turns to an alternative: a WhatsApp chatbot called Chat Kemi.\n\n“Good evening, Resilient Joy,” the bot types. “How are you today?”\n\n Adeboye hesitates, then starts typing: “Someone is defaming me online and threatening to kill me, because I refused to date him. I am depressed and confused. What should I do?”\n\nThe chatbot, which Adeboye had heard about at an event on gender-based violence run by an NGO, advises her to deactivate her social media accounts and provide all necessary information about the person making the threats to someone she trusts.\n\nFor the first time in months, Adeboye says, she felt less alone.\n\nAI platforms offering first-line mental health support have proliferated over the past year, with early trials in the US showing mixed results. In Nigeria, where AI has been embraced in many sectors and industries, a growing number of people turn to chatbots for virtual therapy.\n\nNigeria’s health system, including its mental health provision, has long been underfunded. Between 2015 and 2025, Nigeria has consistently spent less than 5% of its budget to healthcare, with 4.2% allocated for 2026, far less than the 15% target that African Union member states agreed to as part of the 2001 Abuja Declaration. It is not known how many people in Nigeria live with mental health conditions but, with only 262 psychiatrists in a country of 240 million people, most do not get adequate treatment.\n\nThe shortages have been exacerbated by the Trump administration dismantling USAID, which has badly hit services in Nigeria, especially at the primary level, having a devastating effect on patients in communities already struggling with HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and other health challenges. More than 90% of Nigerians have no health insurance, and now face uncertainty over access to services and feelings of helplessness over rising costs.\n\nPrivate healthcare is expensive; one therapy session can cost between 50,000 naira (£27) – the equivalent of a week’s worth of groceries. Cultural stigma remains strong; many Nigerians still associate mental illness with spiritual weakness or witchcraft.\n\nCommercial and nonprofit AI initiatives are starting to fill this vacuum. HerSafeSpace is an organisation that offers free and instant legal and emotional assistance to victims of technology-facilitated gender-based violence in five west and central African countries. Its Chat Kemi service is available in local and international languages.\n\n“These services don’t replace therapy,” says its founder, Abideen Olasupo. Instead, the chatbot uses a referral system to direct users and specific cases to mental health, legal or psychosocial professionals or organisations, should the need arise.\n\n“Our major objective is to support young girls, who are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially online,” he says.\n\nOther platforms in Nigeria offering similar services include FriendnPal, whose AI chatbot provides emotional support, matches patients with licensed therapists and includes mood tracking, psycho-education and ASMR tools to alleviate stress and anxiety.\n\nIts pay-as-you-go model gives users instant access to tailored therapy sessions that can include homework or assessments, according to Esther Eruchie, who created the service in response to the loss of her mother after years of depression caused by her 20-year-old brother’s death.\n\nAnother platform, Blueroomcare, connects clients with licensed therapists through video, voice, text and in-app messaging. It offers in-person outpatient and virtual care at partner clinics nationwide, includes a free wellness assessment, and charges between 5,000 and 51,000 naira for a therapist subscription plan.\n\n“Therapy was often too expensive, and there weren’t enough professionals to meet the demand,” says Moses Aiyenuro, who founded Blueroomcare after his own struggles with depression. “I wanted to build a platform that lowers the barriers to care.”\n\nThe technology used by these apps follows scripts written by licensed Nigerian psychologists and therapists who deliver care to users.\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakemi Oluwakayode, a mother of four, started using FriendnPal’s chatbot after watching her eight-year-old daughter endure frequent seizures due to cerebral palsy.\n\n“Sometimes, it gave very standard replies,” she admits. “But I could finally say things I couldn’t share with my family. That alone gave me relief.”\n\nLater, the app connected her with a licensed therapist – something she says she would never have considered without AI easing her into it.\n\nDr Joy Aifuobhokhan, a Lagos-based public health doctor, says these platforms’ advantage is that they are more affordable and efficient than conventional therapy. “Digital platforms save time otherwise spent preparing, commuting and waiting [to be seen] at physical consultation centres,” she says.\n\nBut some experts caution that AI cannot provide the same level of expertise as a qualified therapist. “These platforms borrow from clinical methods like CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] and mindfulness,” says Dr Nihinlola Olowe, a psychologist at Live Still Counselling Services, a Nigerian-based mental health practice.\n\n“They can be useful for coping, but they cannot replace the depth or judgment of professional care.”\n\nEruchie says FriendnPal has run more than 10,000 sessions in the past year, while Olasupo says HerSafeSpace has 1,600 users across three continents. Blueroomcare declined to say how many users it had.\n\nBut measuring the impact based on numbers alone is a challenge. “The real story lies in the engagement,” says Olasupo. “It’s exciting to see that users aren’t just using the app and leaving – they’re coming back again and again.”\n\nFor many patients, the immediacy and anonymity of a chatbot is key to its appeal but the ease of digital care could come at the cost of privacy. Avril Eyewu-Edero, a cybersecurity expert, believes that without introducing strong database protections in Nigeria, sensitive information – such as medical histories – becomes vulnerable the moment it enters an AI system.\n\n“If startups fail to prioritise privacy and encryption from the outset, adoption will stall. Nigerians are eager but wary,” she says.\n\nFounders of the services acknowledge these uncertainties, often highlighting their use of end-to-end encryption, unique codes that identify users or devices without including personally identifiable information, and strict non-sharing policies – even with government authorities, unless compelled by a court order.\n\nNow, medical professionals are calling on the Nigerian government to develop enforceable national standards for AI. Dr Alero Roberts, a public health consultant and lecturer at the University of Lagos’s medical college, says: “AI chatbots for mental health are an innovative solution, but without robust regulation, we are venturing blindly into potentially dangerous territory.\n\n“Robots can’t interpret human emotion as humans do. For people in crisis, like suicidal thoughts or psychosis, human contact is crucial. Someone, even a non-professional, can recognise the need for urgent intervention,” she says. “This is often lost with AI; strong governance is essential.”\n\nUnlike medicines or hospitals, AI mental health platforms operate in a regulatory grey zone. Nigeria’s 2023 Data Protection Act sets baseline privacy standards but lacks specific AI regulations for healthcare.\n\n“The main issue is enforcement, not a lack of laws,” says Ayotunde Abiodun of SBM Intelligence, a thinktank that provides analysis on political, economic and social issues in Nigeria and across west Africa.\n\nBabatunde Bamigboye, head of regulations at the Nigeria Data Protection Commission, a statutory body set up under the 2023 law, says: “Any use involving personal data must comply with the act. The framework focuses on data ethics, testing within sandboxes, and risk mitigation. AI in Nigeria is governed, but not via AI-specific laws.”\n\nIn Lagos, Oluwakayode continues to use FriendnPal. One day, she hopes to afford in-person therapy, but for now, the bot is her companion.\n\n“I know it’s not a real human,” she says. “But at 2am, it feels like someone is there for me. And that’s enough to keep me going.”",

    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

    "description": "Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that people in tech \"aren't making predictions. We're telling you what already occurred in our jobs.\"",
    "fullText": "It's never a good sign when a CEO warns something more disruptive than COVID is heading our way.\n\nIn an essay titled \"Something Big Is Happening,\" Hyperwrite CEO Matt Shumer said AI can now do all of his technical work — and he thinks your job could be next.\n\n\"I'm writing this for the people in my life who don't... my family, my friends, the people I care about who keep asking me 'so what's the deal with AI?' and getting an answer that doesn't do justice to what's actually happening,\" Shumer wrote in his nearly 5,000-word post published Tuesday on X.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, his post had 40 million views and 18,000 retweets. Shumer is a cofounder of OthersideAI, which features Hyperwrite, an AI-assisted writing tool.\n\nShumer said that the reason people in tech \"are sounding the alarm\" is that they have already experienced what's coming for everyone else.\n\n\"We're not making predictions,\" he wrote. \"We're telling you what already occurred in our own jobs, and warning you that you're next.\"\n\nShumer said that many people outside tech wrote off AI years ago after a clunky experience with an early edition of ChatGPT.\n\n\"The models available today are unrecognizable from what existed even six months ago,\" he wrote. \"The debate about whether AI is 'really getting better' or 'hitting a wall' — which has been going on for over a year — is over.\"\n\nIt's not the time to panic, Shumer said. Instead, the best thing to do is to become deeply familiar with AI. \"This might be the most important year of your career,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I don't say that to stress you out. I say it because right now, there is a brief window where most people at most companies are still ignoring this,\" he wrote. \"The person who walks into a meeting and says 'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days' is going to be the most valuable person in the room.\"\n\nHe's far from alone in sounding the alarm. Despite disagreement from other tech leaders, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei remains adamant that AI could wipe out up to half of white collar, entry-level jobs in the next one to five years.\n\nxAI CEO Elon Musk and others have warned that if your job doesn't involve physical labor, it's likely to be replaced by AI much more quickly, a view that dovetails with a growing base of economic research.\n\nShumer's essay struck a chord, especially with those in tech. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian replied, \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\n\"Great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now,\" A16z general partner David Haber wrote.\n\nGreat advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\n\n“I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days\" is going to be the most valuable person in the room. Not eventually. Right now. Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's… https://t.co/cBq5s1AH4Y\n\nWhile the response to the post has been overwhelmingly positive, some X users pointed out the limitations still present in many current AI products, like hallucinations and general inaccuracies.\n\nShumer said that this moment feels like February 2020, when in a short span of time, news of a spreading pandemic gave way to a worldwide upheaval unseen in modern times that continues to reverberate to this day.\n\nThe potential of what AI will change, he wrote, is \"much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nFor Shumer, this moment of realization came with the recent dueling releases of Anthropic's Opus 4.6 and OpenAI's GPT-5.3 Codex. Both models are primarily aimed at software engineering. OpenAI said in its release notes that GPT-5.3 Codex \"is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\n\n\"It wasn't just executing my instructions,\" Shumer wrote of his experience with OpenAI's latest Codex model. \"It was making intelligent decisions. It had something that felt, for the first time, like judgment. Like taste. The inexplicable sense of knowing what the right call is that people always said AI would never have.\"\n\nAI is now so intelligent, Shumer said, that he can tell the agent what he wants and \"walk away from my computer for four hours, and come back to find the work done. Done well.\"\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn Wednesday morning, Shumer addressed his viral X post.\n\n\"Every time someone asks me what's going on with AI, I give them the safe answer,\" he wrote on Wednesday. \"Because the real one sounds insane. I'm done doing that.\"",

    "description": "Meta's Threads introduces Dear Algo, an AI feature for personalized feeds, as it surpasses 400 million monthly users and outpaces X in daily usage.",
    "fullText": "Threads, Meta's X-like social network, rolled out a feature that lets users tell the app's algorithm what they want to see more or less of in their feed.\n\nThe feature, called Dear Algo, works like this: you write a public Threads post starting with \"Dear Algo,\" followed by a request, such as asking to see less about a TV show you're not caught up on yet, for instance, or more about your favorite basketball team during a live game. The algorithm then adjusts your feed for three days based on what you asked for, and you can delete that request if you want. You can also repost someone else's Dear Algo request to try out their preferences.\n\n\"We think we can do a better job by going deep with individuals on what they want to see more and less of,\" said Connor Hayes, Meta's head of Threads.\n\nIn a blog post about the announcement, Meta described Dear Algo as \"an AI-powered feature that gives you more control over what you see by letting you tell Threads what's important to you in the moment.\"\n\nHayes also said that Threads will reject queries that don't meet Meta's recommendation guidelines or content principles.\n\nThreads teased the feature back in December, framing it as a response to a trend Meta had noticed: people were already posting to ask their algorithms to change what showed up in their feeds.\n\nFor years, people have blamed algorithmic timelines for pulling users into echo chambers, rewarding rage bait over substance, and turning a quick scroll into doomscrolling. Dear Algo could give users back some agency.\n\n\"The best algorithms are personalized,\" Hayes said, adding that what works for one user won't work \"at scale.\"\n\nDear Algo arrives at an interesting moment for Threads. The app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, and on its latest earnings call, Meta said time spent on it jumped 20% in the fourth quarter of 2025. A recent report from analytics firm Similarweb found that Threads had edged out X in daily mobile usage. And in January, Meta started running ads, a sign it sees Threads as a real business.\n\nThe feature also provides a glimpse into the company's broader AI ambitions. On Meta's latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is working on merging large language models with the recommendation systems that power Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and its ad system.\n\nThe company's recommendation systems are \"already driving meaningful growth,\" Zuckerberg said on the call. He added that \"the current systems are primitive compared to what will be possible soon.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact Pranav Dixit via email at pranavdixit@protonmail.com or Signal at 1-408-905-9124.

    "title": "Death isn't the end: Meta patented an AI that lets you keep posting from beyond the grave",
    "description": "Meta was recently granted a patent for tech to keep your social media accounts running using AI if you take a break or die.",
    "fullText": "Does Meta want to make our social media accounts immortal?\n\nThe company was granted a patent in late December that outlines how a large language model can \"simulate\" a person's social media activity, such as responding to content posted by real people.\n\n\"The language model may be used for simulating the user when the user is absent from the social networking system, for example, when the user takes a long break or if the user is deceased,\" the patent says.\n\nAndrew Bosworth, Meta's CTO, is listed as the primary author of the patent, which was first filed in 2023.\n\n\"We have no plans to move forward with this example,\" a spokesperson for Meta told Business Insider.\n\nIn the patent, Meta lays out why it thinks people might need this.\n\nIf you're no longer posting online — whether that's because you need a break from social media or … you … die — your followers' user experience will be affected. In short, they'll miss you.\n\n\"The impact on the users is much more severe and permanent if that user is deceased and can never return to the social networking platform,\" the document says.\n\nTo fill that void, Meta would essentially create a digital clone of your social media presence, training a model on \"user-specific\" data — including historical platform activity, such as comments, likes, or content — to understand how you would (or rather, did) behave.\n\nThat clone can then respond to other people's content by liking and commenting, or responding to DMs. For influencers or creators who make their livelihoods on Meta's platforms and need to take a break from social media, such a tool could be useful.\n\nMeta's patent also references tech that would allow the LLM to simulate video or audio calls with users.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said that while it files patents to disclose concepts, a granted patent does not always mean the company will pursue, develop, or implement that tech.\n\nStill, it opens up many questions about the nature of tech — and grief. An AI bot that acts as your understudy while you're on a digital detox is one thing, but imitating people who've died?\n\nEdina Harbinja, a UK-based professor at the University of Birmingham's Law School, has concerns.\n\n\"It does affect not just legal issues, but a lot of very important social, ethical, and deeply philosophical issues as well,\" Harbinja, who specializes in digital rights and post-mortem privacy, told Business Insider.\n\nMeta has thought about managing digital legacies for years.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Facebook launched tools that let people designate a \"legacy contact\" to manage their accounts if they died. And back in the company's metaverse days, in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Mark Zuckerberg discussed virtual avatars for deceased people.\n\n\"If someone has lost a loved one and is grieving, there may be ways in which being able to interact or relive certain memories could be helpful,\" Zuckerberg said at the time.\n\nThere are a lot of names for this broader category of tech — death bots, ghost bots, grief tech — that are aiming to help people face the loss of loved ones with eternally memorialized digital versions of them.\n\nSeveral startups have launched around this premise, and many have emerged from founders' own experiences with grief. Replika, an AI chatbot startup, was founded in 2015 by Eugenia Kuyda after the loss of her friend. Then there's You, Only Virtual (YOV), which was founded in 2020 by Justin Harrison when his mother was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\"Everybody in the tech world has been thinking about this for a while, as soon as we started having breaks in generative AI,\" Harrison said.\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft patented an AI chatbot that could simulate a deceased person (as well as fictional characters or celebrities).\n\nMeta's patent signals that the technology category is moving more into the mainstream, Harbinja said.\n\nHarrison isn't surprised to see bigger tech companies dipping their toes in the space, and sees it as a sign that people are beginning to \"feel more comfortable with doing this.\"\n\n\"We can only improve on what we offer people,\" Harrison said, adding that the resources for grieving are \"horrible\" to begin with.\n\n\"I think we have a moral obligation, if we have the potential, to do more for those folks than we should be,\" he said.\n\nAI, death, and grief are not easy topics to digest, however. The intersection of all three is a potent brew of taboos ripe for a philosophical debate on ethics, digital rights, and privacy for any dinner table.\n\nMeta has more than helping people process grief as an incentive to pursue the tech it lays out in its patent, especially for accounts taking a break.\n\n\"It's more engagement, more content, more data — more data for the current and the future AI,\" Harbinja said. \"I can see the business incentive for that. I'm just curious to see how they would, when, and if they will implement this innovation.\"\n\nDepending on how a product like this is rolled out, different questions could come up.\n\nFor instance, would this apply across all of Meta's apps? Would it understand the nuance of your WhatsApp presence vs. the candor you have in the Instagram comment section?\n\nJoseph Davis, a sociology professor at the University of Virginia, said he was concerned with the impact that tools like a Meta bot could have on how humans experience grief.\n\n\"One of the tasks of grief is to face the actual loss,\" Davis said.\n\n\"Let the dead be dead,\" Davis added. \"The idea of bringing them back, but you're not really doing that, but in fact, it looks like that. That's the confusion.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at sbradley@businessinsider.com or Signal at sydneykbradley.123.

    "description": "Moody's economist Mark Zandi doubts job growth will continue despite a strong January jobs report, due to healthcare reliance and AI risks.",
    "fullText": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a delayed January jobs report on Wednesday, beating economists expectations and showing the US economy added 130,000 jobs in the first month of 2026.\n\nMark Zandi says don't get comfortable with the upbeat data.\n\nThe figure is substantially higher than the 75,000 jobs that economists anticipated, but the Moody's Analytics economist isn't optimistic that the growth will continue.\n\nZandi has repeatedly warned that the US economy is on shaky ground, and could tumble into a recession. In a post on X on Wednesday, he said that the latest jobs data didn't do anything to ease his concerns.\n\n\"The job market remains fragile and highly vulnerable,\" he said. \"Yes, payroll employment increased by 130,000 in January, but given the big downward revisions to history, there has been no job growth since last April (Liberation Day).\"\n\nZandi also highlighted that almost all the January jobs growth came from the healthcare industry, something he doesn't think bodes well for the broader US economy.\n\n\"Without healthcare, the economy would be losing lots of jobs and unemployment headed higher,\" he told Business Insider. \"There are good reasons why healthcare is adding jobs, but it shows how vulnerable the job market and economy are if healthcare stumbled or even slowed its hiring.\"\n\nThat's not his only concern. Zandi also warned that a fragile labor market could be further compromised by the impact of AI, something he thinks is approaching quickly. While AI hasn't yet appeared in macro data, Zandi maintains that it is likely to change in the near future.\n\nThe economist added that he thinks rising layoffs will be the clearest indication that the labor market is starting to crack. Companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Pinterest have announced steep job cuts recently, and layoffs throughout the economy touched the highest level since 2009 last month.\n\n\"The best real-time measure of layoffs is weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance,\" Zandi added. \"They are running close to 225k per week, which is low. If they rise above 250k on a consistent basis, the job market is in trouble.\"",

    "fullText": "When Pete Srodoski meets with a new executive coaching client these days, he can do more in-depth work more quickly, thanks to ChatGPT.\n\nSrodoski, who founded the coaching firm Roll With the Punches in 2021, used to spend hours with clients discussing what should be included in strategic documents. Now, he uses ChatGPT to draft those documents alongside his clients in about 10 minutes.\n\nWith AI handling the initial framework, Srodoski and his clients can jump right into fine-tuning strategic plans and key job descriptions.\n\n\"That allows us to go deeper, go further, actually take those plans and make actionable items,\" he tells Business Insider.\n\nSrodoski is one of three solopreneurs who spoke with Business Insider about how they're using AI to streamline mundane decision-making — like writing initial drafts, formatting emails, or editing social media posts. The time and mental energy saved allows them to focus on the most critical decisions for their businesses and their clients, they say.\n\n\"We want to make the most impact for our time,\" Srodoski says — and AI can help.\n\nGeorgia Fort, founder of Stories by Georgia Fort, is an independent journalist in Minnesota who started using AI about 18 months ago. She uses ChatGPT to format her newsletters and social media posts, and OpusClip to edit videos for social media.\n\nShe estimates that using those services has freed five to ten hours in her workweek — time that she can now apply to the in-depth reporting she's known for.\n\nUltimately, \"the biggest impact is increased output,\" Fort says. With AI assistance, she's able to post more content on social media and release newsletters regularly, something she struggled with in the past.\n\nAn added bonus, she says, is that utilizing AI makes it just a bit easier to find the work-life balance that many solopreneurs struggle with.\n\n\"If nothing else, it's a meal I get to sit down and have with my kids,\" Fort says.\n\nDusti Arab, owner of The Reinvention Co., a boutique marketing firm, says AI is integrated into nearly every aspect of her workday. Because of that, \"I don't think I've put up so much high-quality content, ever,\" she says.\n\nFor Arab, who has ADHD, managing the constant decisions that a solopreneur must make was draining. She would often worry about missing a small detail, which distracted her from higher-level thinking.\n\nNow, she uses Wispr Flow to take voice notes throughout the day on topics like client communications and content ideas. Then, she imports those into Notion AI, which combines access to Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT to help her turn her notes into briefs.\n\n\"If you use AI to process the brain dump first, the deliverable comes out way better,\" Arab says.\n\nHer efforts with AI and being vocal about how she uses it are also paying off in a different way — clients now reach out to her specifically for advice on how to use it. She often guides them in using AI to delegate more effectively.\n\n\"Once the raw notes exist, you can use AI to turn the brain dump into a clear brief, a task list, and a handoff that someone else can actually execute,\" she says.\n\nLike Arab, Srodoski is often the one to introduce his clients to AI, specifically ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, the platforms he uses. Often, the response is \"awe,\" he says.\n\nLast week, for example, a client shared that the time involved with pricing jobs had become a major roadblock in his business. Using ChatGPT, Srodoski guided him in creating a price book based on the previous three years' sales data.\n\n\"He was smiling ear to ear, saying that this would have cost him a few thousand dollars and a few weeks of labor time to get this pulled off,\" Srodoski says.\n\nWhile clients are often enthusiastic about AI, part of Srodoski's coaching is now emphasizing the decisions that leaders shouldn't outsource to AI.\n\nRecently, he had a client who wanted to confront an underperforming vendor. The client was planning to draft an email using ChatGPT, but Srodoski stopped him.\n\n\"Get on the phone. See how they respond,\" he recalls saying. During the phone call, Srodoski's client was able to explain himself, empathize with the vendor, clarify a misunderstanding, and create a solution.\n\n\"That's a leadership decision you can't do with ChatGPT,\" Srodoski says.",

    "fullText": "Joshua Bonehill-Paine revealed as owner of X account known for videos depicting politicians such as Keir Starmer\n\nThe person behind an anonymous social media account that posts AI videos of UK politicians has been identified as a man who has spent time in prison for multiple hate crimes directed towards Jewish people.\n\nJoshua Bonehill-Paine was identified by Channel 4 News as the owner of Crewkerne Gazette, a satirical X account that created AI videos depicting politicians such as Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham apparently singing popular songs from artists such as Amy Winehouse, Barry Manilow and Elton John with altered, politically themed lyrics.\n\nBonehill-Paine, 33, who has previously described himself as a “nationalist, fascist, theorist and supporter of white rights”, has a long history of discriminatory behaviour. This has included perpetuating fake stories such as a pub in Leicestershire refusing to admit members of the armed forces so as to not offend immigrants, and a six-year-old being abducted by an Asian grooming gang in Croydon.\n\nBonehill-Paine told the Guardian he no longer held antisemitic views, providing proof that he had passed the government’s Prevent awareness course and that he had worked in counter-extremism education.\n\nHe has described himself online as now holding “a deep affection for Israel”.\n\nIn early 2015 Bonehill-Paine attempted to organise a mass protest in Stamford Hill, north London, to rally “against the complete Jewification of the borough”, and later in the year tried to organise another in Golders Green, an area of the city with a large Jewish population.\n\nHe promoted the latter with a cartoon image of Hitler and wrote that the event would be “an absolute gas”. He was sentenced to three years and four months in jail for inciting hatred against Jews.\n\nLater, in 2016, he was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment for abuse directed at the then Labour MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, which included posting messages to his blog calling Berger “a rodent”, “evil money-grabber” and “a dominatrix”, and uploading an image of a rat with Berger’s face superimposed over it. He was jailed for another two years, which was added to his existing sentence.\n\nBonehill-Paine said on Wednesday he was “extremely sorry for the pain and distress” he had caused Berger, and he hoped she could forgive him for his past actions, but had not reached out to her directly as he did not “want to alarm or distress her, even after a decade has passed”.\n\nThe Crewkerne Gazette’s work has been lauded by publications such as the Sun, which featured a video created by the account showing Rayner rapping to a grime beat during her tax scandal.\n\nThe Times called him the “Banksy of politics” and GB News interviewed Bonehill-Paine, who went by the online alias of Crewkerne Man, on air three days before his identity and past were uncovered.\n\nThe account’s work has also been highlighted by politicians including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who shared a video from it on X, and Adam Dance, the Liberal Democrat MP for Yeovil, where Crewkerne is based. Dance also said on an episode of BBC Sunday Politics West that Bonehill-Paine’s work was a positive example of engaging audiences with politics.\n\nWhen asked about Bonehill-Paine’s identity, Dance said he was not aware of who was behind the Crewkerne Gazette account at the time of his comments, which were “about the transparent use of AI in politics, not about endorsing any individual. I absolutely condemn antisemitism and harassment in all its forms, and I do not support the person now revealed to be behind that account.”.\n\nIn a YouTube video Bonehill-Paine posted on Tuesday he expressed regret for his past comments towards the Jewish community.. He said: “I felt very angry at how I had treated the Jewish community in this country. I wanted to do something to rectify it, so I began working in counter-extremism education.”\n\nHe added: “I went across the country to colleges, schools, universities, working with the probation service, the police service, to try to help prevent other people from following in my footsteps.”\n\nHe later told Channel 4 News: “What I am going to do is to continue doing what I’ve done for the last five years, six years, which is counter-extremism work, working to prevent people following in my footsteps, hopefully stopping people from making the same mistakes that I’ve done.”",

    "description": "Meta says it will build a new 1-gigawatt data center in Indiana, its second in the state.",
    "fullText": "Meta (META) on Wednesday said it is breaking ground on its latest data center as part of its massive AI infrastructure build-out.\n\nThe more than $10 billion data center will be located in Lebanon, Ind., and have a capacity of upwards of 1 gigawatt. That's enough energy to power several hundred thousand homes.\n\nAccording to Meta, the data center will handle both Meta's AI workloads as well as its core products and represents one of its largest infrastructure projects to date.\n\nDuring its Q4 earnings announcement, Meta said it plans to spend as much as $135 billion throughout 2026 as part of its AI expansion plans. The company spent $72.2 billion in 2025. The social media giant isn't the only tech company sending big on AI this year. Advertising rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) said it plans to spend $180 billion in 2026 during its own earnings report, while Amazon (AMZN) said it anticipates spending $200 billion.\n\nThe massive spending news spooked Google and Amazon investors and lifted shares of Meta more than 10% at the time, though they've since come back down to Earth.\n\nThe broader data center explosion is facing increasing criticism from residents in and around communities where they're being built, with complaints ranging from increasing utility costs to the irritating sounds of cooling systems.\n\nTo that end, Meta says it will pay the full cost of the energy the data center uses, provide $1 million each year for 20 years to the Boone REMC Community Fund to assist with energy bills, and fund emergency water utility assistance. The data center will also use a closed-loop water system that Meta says will use no water \"a majority of the year.\"\n\nThe company further says it will invest more than $120 million in water infrastructure for Lebanon, as well as make upgrades to roads, transmission lines, and area utilities.\n\nMeta isn't the only company looking to make concessions to win over local communities. Last month, Microsoft president Brad Smith announced that the Windows developer will work with local utilities to provide a better understanding of its data center electricity needs and “bear the cost” when electricity companies need to upgrade their transmission capabilities to meet data center demand.\n\nIn August, Google agreed to cut back on its electricity usage during periods of high demand in certain regions, Reuters reported.\n\nMeta's ambitious AI construction plans aren't limited to single-gigawatt data centers. In July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is set to build its enormous Hyperion facility in Louisiana, adding that the data center will be so large it would cover a large portion of Manhattan and will eventually scale up to support upwards of 5 gigawatts of capacity.",

    "description": "A new study found that AI in the workplace expanded tasks outside one's job description and blurred the line between work and time off.",
    "fullText": "If you think using AI means doing less at work, think again.\n\nIn a new eight-month study of how generative AI changed work habits at a US-based tech company with about 200 employees, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business found that employees' work intensified in three main ways.\n\nEmployees multitasked more, took on a broader range of responsibilities, and worked longer hours, often without being asked to do so.\n\nAruna Ranganathan, a professor in management at UC Berkeley, and Xingqi Maggie Ye, a Ph.D. student at the Haas School of Business, detailed their research in a Harvard Business Review story, writing that once AI tools became available, workers began to usurp each other's roles, feed information to AI during meetings, and correct each other's vibe coding projects.\n\nRanganathan and Ye said that workers \"described this as 'just trying things' with the AI, but these experiments accumulated into a meaningful widening of job scope. In fact, workers increasingly absorbed work that might previously have justified additional help or head count.\"\n\n\"Once the excitement of experimenting fades, workers can find that their workload has quietly grown and feel stretched from juggling everything that's suddenly on their plate. That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making,\" they wrote. \"The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work, turnover, and other problems.\"\n\nThe researchers wrote that many workers also send prompts to AI before leaving their desk for a meeting or for lunch break, so AI could continue to work without supervision.\n\n\"These actions rarely felt like doing more work, yet over time they produced a workday with fewer natural pauses and a more continuous involvement with work,\" Ranganathan and Ye added.\n\nIn an October 2025 interview with Rowan Cheung, who hosts the Rowan's Notes interview series, Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, also shared ways in which AI may have made his work more intense.\n\n\"It's almost like, I don't think I can come up with ideas fast enough anymore,\" Altman told Cheung.\n\n\"I really do have a hard time trying to reason through exactly what this is going to mean,\" Altman added. \"I think it will mean that stuff just happens faster and that you can try a lot more stuff and figure out the better ideas quickly.\"",

    "description": "As Nvidia's stock stagnates, betting markets and analysts increasingly favor GOOGL stock overtaking the AI chipmaker as the world's largest company by 2026's end.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia (NVDA) is currently valued at over $4.5 trillion, having become the world's most valuable company on June 18, 2024, when its market capitalization exceeded $3.3 trillion. It later hit $4 trillion in 2025 and briefly reached $5 trillion last October. Yet the stock has largely traded sideways since last August around its current price of $189.\n\nReasons include investor concerns over rising competition in AI accelerators from players like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), geopolitical constraints such as U.S. export restrictions to China, production delays on next-generation chips like Blackwell, slowing revenue growth momentum, and valuation fatigue after years of rapid gains.\n\nThe Shocking Reason This Analyst Says Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy Stock Will Take Bitcoin Prices to $0\n\nIs the Market Running on Borrowed Time?

In recent years, Alphabet has made significant strides in AI, launching Gemini 3 in 2025 as its most advanced model yet, requiring less prompting and delivering smarter responses.\n\nOther advances include the Ironwood AI chip (its seventh-generation TPU) for scaling large models, Gemma 3 for efficient open-source AI, SIMA 2 for AI agents in 3D worlds, and integrations like AI Mode in Search and Gemini Robotics for physical interactions. These innovations bolster its cloud and ad businesses amid the AI boom.\n\nAlphabet's stock is up 1% year-to-date (YTD), just slightly underperforming the S&P 500's ($SPX) 1.89% YTD gain, but over the past year, GOOGL has surged 69%, far exceeding the index's 15% return. Valuation metrics show a trailing P/E of 30.65, a forward P/E of 29.64, and a price/sales of 9.93. Compared to its 10-year historical average P/E of 27.69, it currently trades 7% higher, suggesting a premium. Versus peers (average P/E 31.5x), it's attractive but expensive relative to the interactive media industry average of 12x.",

Still, some roles are becoming obsolete: Citi CEO Jane Fraser said in a recent internal memo that some jobs \"will no longer be required\" as AI advances.\n\nFor their part, the financial services CEOs that EY surveyed are similarly bullish about AI's capacity to transform the workplace, and nearly half see AI and digital investment as the most important factor in their companies' ability to thrive and adapt this year.\n\nAround a quarter said their AI initiatives have significantly beaten expectations, and 57% said they've shown results faster than expected. Just more than half said they expect the biggest transformations to come from generative AI.\n\nWhen it comes to hiring for AI talent — itself a highly competitive market — 87% of CEOs in EY's survey are optimistic about their ability to attract and keep talent in 2026. The question of returns on the AI investment, for talent and in general, also seems top of mind for the financial services leaders. Seventy-six percent of boards in the survey said they'll review transformation ROI metrics as often as financial results.\n\nFirms of all sizes are being asked to justify their AI spends, as analysts and investors begin to wonder whether the sometimes billion-dollar bets will show up on balance sheets.",

    "description": "The tech giant's internal policy promotes an in-house tool called Kiro over Anthropic's Claude Code. Some Amazon engineers are unhappy about this.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing the startup's AI models and products to customers.\n\nInside Amazon, however, employees aren't allowed to use Anthropic's Claude Code for production work or for live products without formal approval.\n\nThat disconnect became more visible late last year, when Amazon rolled out internal guidance steering teams toward Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant, according to internal messages seen by Business Insider. The guidance encourages using Kiro over non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, for production code.\n\nThe policy prompted criticism across internal Amazon forums. In one discussion thread, roughly 1,500 Amazon employees endorsed the formal adoption of Claude Code, according to the messages.\n\nThe restrictions have been particularly awkward for engineers who help sell AWS Bedrock, Amazon's platform that offers customers access to third-party AI services, including Claude Code. Some questioned how they could credibly promote a product they are not permitted to use themselves in official work.\n\n\"Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,\" one employee wrote.\n\nThe episode highlights the complexity of Amazon's relationship with Anthropic. While Amazon is racing to build and promote its own AI tools, it is also marketing a partner's competing technology. Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors, with a stake valued at more than $60 billion. Anthropic, in turn, is a major AWS customer, committing to use Amazon's cloud services and at least one million of Amazon's Trainium chips.\n\n\"We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.\"\n\nAmazon maintains \"a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,\" and while there's no explicit ban on Claude Code, the company applies \"stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.\n\nAn Anthropic spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one of the internal forums, an Amazon sales engineer flagged the irony of being asked to sell Claude Code even though it isn't formally supported inside the company. The employee wrote that they need to be able to \"use, demo, and build\" with Claude Code to support Amazon's directive to get more customers to use it through AWS Bedrock.\n\nOther Amazon engineers also debated whether the emphasis on Kiro was hindering productivity. Some argued that Claude Code outperformed Amazon's in-house tool and warned that forcing adoption of a weaker product could slow development.\n\n\"A tool that can't keep pace with rivals offers no real innovation,\" one of the Amazon employees wrote. \"And without competitive strength, Kiro's only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.\"\n\nClaude Code has become one of the most widely used AI coding services, and it underpins many other similar offerings from other providers. An Amazon spokesperson said about 70% of the company's software engineers used Kiro at least once in January.\n\nIn one forum thread, a manager overseeing Amazon's internal developer tools said he understood the \"frustration\" and \"significant\" interest in Claude Code, citing about 1,500 internal endorsements calling for its formal adoption.\n\nSome employees said frustration deepened after Amazon had previously indicated that Claude Code had cleared security and legal review for production use, according to an internal guideline and messages reviewed by Business Insider. That language was later edited and removed, employees said.\n\nOthers criticized the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally adopt Claude Code, asking what data informed the decision.\n\n\"The trend is clear,\" one employee wrote internally. \"More and more people would like to start using Claude Code and be officially supported by Amazon.\"\n\nHave a tip?
