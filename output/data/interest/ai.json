    "description": "A real-world comparison of GPT-5.2-Codex (high), Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro on two coding tasks, focusing on quality, speed, and cost.",
    "fullText": "If you want a quick take: Claude Opus 4.5 was the most consistent, GPT-5.2-codex (high) delivered strong code with slower turnaround, and Gemini 3 Pro was the most efficient but less polished.\n\nIf you want a quick take, here’s how the three models performed in our tests:\n\n💡 If you want the safest pick for real “ship a feature in a big repo” work, Opus 4.5 felt the most reliable in my runs. If you care about speed and cost and you’re okay polishing UI yourself, Gemini 3 Pro is a solid bet.\n\nOkay, so right now the WebDev leaderboard on LMArena is basically owned by the big three: Claude Opus 4.5 from Anthropic, GPT-5.2-codex (high) from OpenAI, and finally everybody's favorite, Gemini 3 Pro from Google.\n\nSo, I grabbed these three and put them into the same existing project (over 8K stars and 50K+ LOC) and asked them to build a couple of real features like a normal dev would.\n\nSame repo. Same prompts. Same constraints.\n\nFor each task, I took the best result out of three runs per model to keep things fair.\n\nThen I compared what they actually did: code quality, how much hand-holding they needed, and whether the feature even worked in the end.\n\n⚠️ NOTE: Don't take the result of this test as a hard rule. This is just a small set of real-world coding tasks that shows how each model did for me in that exact setup and gives you an overview of the difference in the top 3 models' performance in the same tasks.\n\nFor the test, we will use the following CLI coding agents:\n\nHere’s the repo used for the entire test: iib0011/omni-tools\n\nWe will check the models on two different tasks:\n\nEach model is asked to create a global action menu that opens with a keyboard shortcut. This feature expands on the current search by adding actions, global state, and keyboard navigation. This task checks how well the model understands current UX patterns and avoids repetition without breaking what's already in place.\n\nEach model had to add real usage tracking across the app, persist it locally, and then build an analytics dashboard that shows things like the most used tools, recent activity, and basic filters.\n\nWe’ll compare code quality, token usage, cost, and time to complete the build.\n\n💡 NOTE: I will share the source code changes for each task by each model in a .patch file. This way, you can easily view them on your local system by cloning the repository and applying the patch file using git apply <path_file_name>. This method makes sharing changes easier.\n\nThe task is simple: all models start from the same base commit and then follow the same prompt to build what is asked in the prompt.\n\nAnd obviously, as mentioned, I will evaluate the response from the model from the \"Best of 3.\"\n\nLet's start off the test with something interesting:\n\nGPT-5.2 handled this surprisingly well. The implementation was solid end to end, and it basically one-shotted the entire feature set, including i18n support, without needing multiple correction passes.\n\nThat said, it did take a bit longer than some other models (~20 minutes), which is expected since reasoning was explicitly set to high. The model spends more time thinking through architecture, naming, and edge cases rather than rushing to output code. The trade-off felt worth it here.\n\nThe token usage was noticeably higher due to the reasoning set to high, but the output code reflected that.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\n💡 NOTE: I ran the exact same prompt with the same model using the default (medium) reasoning level. The difference was honestly massive. With reasoning set to high, the quality of the code, structure, and pretty much everything jumps by miles. It’s not even a fair comparison.\n\nClaude went all in and prepared a ton of different strategies. At the start, it did run into build issues, but it kept running the build until it was able to fix all the build and lint issues.\n\nThe entire run took me about 7 minutes 50 seconds, which is the fastest among the models for this test. The features all worked as asked, and obviously, the UI looked super nice and exactly how I expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nTo be honest, this exceeded my expectations; even the i18n texts are added and displayed in the UI just as expected. Absolute cinema!\n\nGemini 3 got it working, but it's clearly not on the same level as GPT-5.2 High or Claude Opus 4.5. The UI it built is fine and totally usable, but it feels a bit barebones, and you don't get many choices in the palette compared to the other two.\n\nOne clear miss is that language switching does not show up inside the action palette at all, which makes the i18n support feel incomplete even though translations technically exist.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 lands in a very clear third place here. It works, the UI looks fine, and nothing is completely broken, but compared to the depth, completeness, and polish of GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5, it feels behind.\n\nThis test is a step up from the action palette.\n\nYou can find the prompt I've used here: Prompt\n\nGPT-5.2 absolutely nailed this one.\n\nThe final result turned out amazing. Tool usage tracking works exactly as expected, data persists correctly, and the dashboard feels like a real product feature. Most used tools, recent usage, filters, everything just works.\n\nOne really nice touch is that it also wired analytics-related actions into the Action Palette from Test 1.\n\nIt did take a bit longer than the first test, around 26 minutes, but again, that’s the trade-off with high reasoning. You can tell the model spent time thinking through data modeling, reuse, and avoiding duplicated logic. Totally worth it here.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\nGPT-5.2 High continues to be slow but extremely powerful, and for a task like this, that’s a very good trade.\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 did great here as well.\n\nThe final implementation works end to end, and honestly, from a pure UI and feature standpoint, it’s hard to tell the difference between this and GPT-5.2 High. The dashboard looks clean, the data makes sense, and the filters work as expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nGemini 3 Pro gets the job done, but it clearly takes a more minimal approach compared to GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\nThat said, the overall experience feels very bare minimum. The UI is functional but plain, and the dashboard lacks the polish and depth you get from the other two models.\n\nAlso, it didn't quite add the button to view the analytics right in the action palette, similar to the other two models.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 Pro remains efficient and reliable, but in a comparison like this, efficiency alone is not enough. 🤷‍♂️\n\nAt least from this test, I can conclude that the models are now pretty much able to one-shot a decent complex work, at least from what I tested.\n\nStill, there have been times when the models mess up so badly that if I were to go ahead and fix the problems one by one, it would take me nearly the same time as building it from scratch.\n\nIf I compare the results across models, Opus 4.5 definitely takes the crown. But I still don’t think we’re anywhere close to relying on it for real, big production projects. The recent improvements are honestly insane, but the results still don’t fully back them up. 🥴\n\nFor now, I think these models are great for refactoring, planning, and helping you move faster. But if you solely rely on their generated code, the codebase just won’t hold up long term.\n\nI don't see any of these recent models as “use it and ship it” for \"production,\" in a project with millions of lines of code, at least not in the way people hype it up.\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments.\n\nSoftware and DevOps engineer with 4+ years of experience building for the web and cloud, mainly with TypeScript, Python, Go, Docker, and Kubernetes. I share agentic system builds and write out of passion about AI models, workflows, and the tooling behind them.",

    "title": "Vinod Khosla is looking at this metric to gauge if we're in an AI bubble",
    "description": "\"What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don't really care,\" Khosla said.",
    "fullText": "Vinod Khosla has his eye on one AI metric, and it's not stock prices.\n\nOn an episode of OpenAI's podcast released on Monday, the famed venture capitalist shared how he's gauging whether we're in an AI bubble — or not.\n\n\"People equate bubble to stock prices, which has nothing to do with anything other than fear and greed among investors,\" he said. \"So I always look at, bubbles should be measured by the number of API calls.\"\n\nAPI, or Application Programming Interface calls, refer to the process in which one software application sends a message to another application to request data or to trigger an action. They are a common indicator of digital tools' use, especially with the rise of AI agents. High API calls can also be a mark of a poor or inefficient product.\n\nKhosla said the bubble shouldn't be called \"by what happened to stock prices because somebody got overexcited or underexcited and in one day they can go from loving Nvidia to hating Nvidia because it's overvalued.\"\n\nThe 70-year-old VC, whose notable investments include OpenAI, DoorDash, and Block, compared the AI bubble to the dot-com bubble. He said he looked out for internet traffic as a metric during the 1990s, and with AI bubble concerns, that benchmark is now API calls.\n\n\"If that's your fundamental metric of what's the real use of your AI, usefulness of AI, demand for AI, you're not going to see a bubble in API calls,\" he said. \"What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don't really care. I think it's mostly irrelevant.\"\n\nConcerns that the AI industry is overvalued because of massive investments became one of the buzziest themes in the second half of 2025. The phrase \"AI bubble\" appeared in 42 earnings calls and investor conference transcripts between October and December — a 740% increase from the previous quarter, according to an AlphaSense analysis.\n\nTop business leaders remain split about whether the bubble is about to burst.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates said AI has extremely high value, but it's still in a bubble.\n\n\"But you have a frenzy,\" Gates told CNBC in late October. \"And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.\"\n\nEarlier this month, \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a Substack exchange.\n\nBurry wrote that companies, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting trillions on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete. He added that their spending has \"no clear path to utilization by the real economy.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed concerns of a bubble. His company became the world's first $5 trillion market cap company in October on the back of the AI boom.\n\nIn an October Bloomberg TV appearance, Huang said that instead of overspeculation, AI is part of a transition from an old way of computing.\n\n\"We also know that AI has become good enough because of reasoning capability, and research capability, its ability to think — it's now generating tokens and intelligence that is worth paying for,\" Huang said.",

    "description": "OpenAI's chief financial officer floated \"licensing models\" as a revenue idea as the company faces massive compute costs.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI's chief financial officer is musing about new ways the company could make money beyond ChatGPT subscriptions.\n\nIn an episode of \"The OpenAI Podcast\" published Monday, Sarah Friar floated the idea of \"licensing models,\" in which the company could take a share of downstream sales if a customer's product takes off.\n\n\"Let's say in drug discovery, if we licensed our technology, you have a breakthrough. The drug takes off, and we get a licensed portion of all its sales,\" Friar said.\n\n\"It's great alignment for us with our customer,\" she added.\n\nFriar's comments offer a glimpse of how OpenAI is thinking about funding its compute-hungry ambitions as it broadens its business model.\n\nFriar said OpenAI began with a single subscription after launching ChatGPT, but has since expanded to multiple price points, SaaS-style enterprise pricing, and credit-based pricing for customers who \"want to pay more to get more.\"\n\nAs OpenAI looks at commerce and ads, Friar said the model should always give the best answer, not a sponsored one, and maintain an ad-free tier.\n\nLast week, OpenAI announced it is preparing to test ads in ChatGPT, as the company seeks to boost revenue while facing spending commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the coming years.\n\nThe move marks a shift from the company's earlier stance. Less than two years ago, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described advertising as a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nSince then, Altman's tone has evolved alongside OpenAI's expansion and ballooning compute costs. In June, he said on OpenAI's podcast that he wasn't \"totally against\" advertising, but emphasized that it would need to be handled carefully.\n\nOpenAI also completed its restructuring in October, shifting the company toward a more traditional for-profit structure — a change Altman said would make it easier to raise capital going forward.",

    "description": "F5's Guardrails blocks prompts that attempt jailbreaks or injection attacks, for example, while its AI Red Team automates vulnerability discovery in AI systems.",
    "fullText": "Network and security teams managing enterprise applications face two emerging challenges: AI security and multi-cloud operations. F5 is addressing both with product announcements that extend its Application Delivery and Security Platform into AI runtime protection and multicloud managed services.\n\nThe company announced F5 AI Guardrails and F5 AI Red Team on January 14, following the January 13 launch of F5 NGINXaaS for Google Cloud. The AI security products came through F5’s acquisition of CalypsoAI in September 2025. NGINXaaS is a web-server-as-a-service offering that is now expanding beyond its initial Azure deployment in May 2025, with AWS support in development.\n\n“We’ve never been a walled garden—we believe in meeting customers where they are and integrating with their existing stack, whether that stack is F5 products or other vendors,” Shawn Wormke, senior vice president of product management at F5, told Network World.\n\nAI security requires a different approach than traditional network defenses. Web application firewalls (WAF) inspect HTTP requests for SQL injection. Intrusion detection systems analyze packet headers for known attack signatures. These tools operate at the packet and protocol level.\n\nAI systems present a different attack surface. A malicious prompt that tricks a model into revealing training data looks like legitimate traffic at the network layer. Wormke explained that AI security is another layer of security just like WAF. Where it differs is that traditional security threats live in packets, whereas AI threats live in the words, prompts and context exchanged between users, models and agents.\n\n“AI models can be manipulated into exposing sensitive data or generating harmful outputs impacting brand reputation and trust,” he said. “So you need a solution that’s purpose-built to secure and govern these new threats like prompt injection, new jailbreak techniques and model distillation.”\n\nF5 AI Guardrails deploys as a proxy between users and AI models. Wormke describes it as being inserted as a proxy layer at the “front door” of AI interaction, between AI applications, users and agents. It intercepts prompts before they reach the model and analyzes outputs before they return to users. The system applies policy rules to actual content rather than transport-layer characteristics.\n\nPolicy enforcement covers several categories. Guardrails blocks prompts that attempt jailbreaks or injection attacks, scans outputs for sensitive data patterns, and enforces compliance requirements including GDPR and the EU AI Act.\n\nAI Red Team automates adversarial testing against AI systems. It maintains a database of attack techniques that grows by 10,000 entries monthly as researchers discover new vulnerabilities.\n\nResults from Red Team testing feed directly into Guardrails policies. When Red Team discovers a vulnerability pattern, security teams create corresponding guardrails to block similar attacks in production.\n\n“It’s a very synergistic pairing wherein with AI Red Team you can send a team of agents to discover vulnerabilities in AI systems, and with AI Guardrails you can transform those insights into threat-informed defenses,” Wormke said.\n\nF5 acquired NGINX back in 2019 and has been expanding the capabilities of the web server platform ever since.\n\nNGINXaaS first became generally available on Microsoft Azure in 2023 and is now coming to Google Cloud. The Google Cloud expansion addresses customer demand for consistent tooling across cloud providers. “Customers have been asking for NGINXaaS across additional cloud platforms,” Wormke said. “Google Cloud was the next and now we are working with AWS.”\n\nThe service combines Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing with security and observability, available through Google Cloud Marketplace.\n\n“NGINXaaS is built on the pedigree of the enterprise version of NGINX, NGINX Plus,” Wormke said. “It has open-source roots and will support your open-source configurations, but it gives you all the capabilities of commercial NGINX Plus.”\n\nWormke noted that those capabilities include visibility into over 240 deep application metrics, intelligent load balancing algorithms, traffic optimization, in-memory state sharing, AuthN & AuthZ and it’s  ready to go F5 WAF for NGINX.\n\nThe NGINX project celebrated its 20th anniversary in October 2024 and is one of the most widely used web server and application delivery technologies. Beyond just the core web server, it is also used as a load balancer, reverse proxy, programmability layer, API Gateway, Ingress Controller and Kubernetes Gateway.\n\n“It continues to power a significant portion of the internet and API traffic today,” Wormke said. “It is far more than the web server that many think open-source NGINX is.”\n\nF5 continues development on both open-source NGINX and commercial versions. For instance, he noted that F5 recently announced Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) support for enhanced privacy as well as support for PQC (Post Quantum Cryptography). Looking forward, AI is going to play a big role in the future direction.\n\n“We are evolving toward AI-aware application delivery and security to enable secure, scalable and performant, agentic AI operations,” he said.",

    "description": "The stock market flashed five warning signs before the dot-com bubble popped in the early 2000s, strategists at Goldman Sachs said.",
    "fullText": "Markets are worried about shades of 1999 in today's tech-investing landscape, and while there's a lot of debate about whether AI is a bubble, there are a few signals from history that show what, specifically, investors should be looking out for.\n\nStrategists at Goldman Sachs said they believe the market's AI frenzy risks mirroring the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s.\n\nStocks don't look like they're in their 1999 moment yet, Dominic Wilson, a senior advisor on the bank's global markets research team, and Vickie Chang, a macro research strategist, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. But the risks that the AI boom will look a lot like the 2000s era craze appear to be growing, they said.\n\n\"We see a growing risk that the imbalances that built up in the 1990s will become more visible as the AI investment boom extends. There have been echoes of the inflection point in the 1990s boom lately,\" the bank wrote, adding that the AI trade now looked the way tech stocks did in 1997, several years before the bubble burst.\n\nWilson and Chang flagged several warning signs leading up to the dot-com crash in the early 2000s that investors should be on the lookout for.\n\nInvestment spending on tech equipment and software rose to \"unusually high levels\" in the 90s. That peaked in 2000, when non-residential investment in the telecom and tech sector rose to around 15% of US GDP.\n\nInvestment spending began to tumble in the months leading up to the dot-com crash, per Goldman's analysis.\n\n\"Highly valued asset prices thus had significant consequences for real spending decisions,\" the strategists said.\n\nInvestors have been growing wary of mega-cap tech firms' spending spree on AI this year. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion on capex in 2025.\n\nCorporate profits reached a peak around 1997 before beginning to decline.\n\n\"Profitability peaked well before the boom ended,\" Wilson and Chang wrote. \"While reported profit margins were more robust, declining profitability in the macro data in the later years of the boom came alongside accelerating equity prices.\"\n\nCorporate profits look strong at the moment. The blended net profit margin in the S&P 500 for the third quarter is around 13.1%, above the five-year average of 12.1%, according to FactSet.\n\nCompanies grew increasingly indebted in the lead-up to the dot-com crash. Corporate debt as a percentage of profits peaked in 2001, right as the bubble was bursting, Goldman's analysis shows.\n\n\"The combination of rising investment and falling profitability pushed the corporate sector financial balance — the difference between savings and investment — into deficit,\" the strategists said.\n\nSome of mega-cap tech firms' spending on AI has been funded debt. Meta, for instance, raised $30 billion in bonds in late October as it doubled down on its AI spending plans.\n\nMost firms today, though, look like they're financing capex with free cash flow, Goldman added. The percentage of corporate debt relative to profits also looks significantly lower than it did at the peak of the internet bubble.\n\nThe Fed was in the midst of its rate-cutting cycle in the late 90s, one factor that helped juice the stock market.\n\n\"Lower rates and capital inflows added fuel to the equity market,\" Goldman wrote.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its October policy meeting. Investors are expecting the central bank to issue another 25 basis-point cut in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nOther market pros, like Ray Dalio, have warned that the Fed's easing cycle could help inflate a bubble in markets.\n\nIn the 1990s, these warning signs appeared at least two years before the dot-com bubble actually burst, Wilson and Chang said, adding that they believed the AI trade still had room to run.\n\nThis story was originally published in November 2025.",

    "fullText": "Investor enthusiasm over the prospects of artificial intelligence are expected to drive Big Tech stocks in particular this year — but Wall Street also expects gains in other sectors.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Industrials (XLI), Materials (XLB), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Staples (XLP) have outperformed the broader market, with all of those sectors up 5.5% or more.\n\nEven the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index has risen 8% since the start of the year, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which is up more than 1% during the same period.\n\n\"It's a broadening playbook,\" Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\nStoltzfus' price target for the S&P 500 this year is the most bullish on Wall Street at 8,100, with other analysts expecting double-digit percentage gains taking the benchmark index toward 7,500 or 7,600.\n\n\"What we're seeing is a rotation, and it's not necessarily away from technology, as we would think,\" he added. \"It's some profit taking to broaden one's exposure and diversification.\"\n\nKeith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, agrees. His firm's strategy has been to go Overweight on industrials, while also upgrading healthcare and energy stocks.\n\n\"I wouldn't get rid of the tech at this point. I think there are more opportunities beyond tech, is the way I would think about it,\" Lerner said.\n\nStrategists are optimistic given what they've seen with earnings, which kicked off last week.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) showed one of the strongest years for the investment banking business since the pandemic, sending shares of those firms higher.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s (TSM) strong results also gave a lift to semiconductor stocks and fueled optimism that the AI cycle is only accelerating\n\nShares of memory chipmaker Micron (MU) and equipment makers ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) are all up at least 25% year-to-date.\n\nPerformance in the AI chip space so far underscores that artificial intelligence and tech are expected to lead the market again this year as wider adoption across enterprises takes hold.\n\n\"As we wait for that to unfold, I think tech, especially big tech and AI as a theme, is the core of this market,\" Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna said. \"Our core conviction is that it'll sustain this year, even though the level of scrutiny around that [AI] has decidedly increased.\"\n\nThe test will be whether software stocks, facing disruption from artificial intelligence, can find their footing. Names like Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM), and ServiceNow (NOW) have all fallen since the start of the year as investors weigh AI's impact.",

    "fullText": "Ben Horowitz believes artificial intelligence is about to reshape daily life as profoundly as electricity once did.\n\nSpeaking on a recent episode of the \"Ben & Marc Show,\" the Andreessen Horowitz cofounder framed AI as a once-in-a-century technological break.\n\n\"This is on the order of the steam engine or electricity,\" Horowitz said, adding that the technology is so powerful it will push society into \"a different world.\"\n\nBut while AI may deliver dramatic gains in living standards, Horowitz said it will also raise deeper questions about meaning, purpose, and what humans do with their time.\n\nHorowitz said AI will help fix problems humans have \"learned to live with,\" including cancer, transportation challenges, and large-scale fraud detection in the US.\n\nThe result, he believes, could be a broad-based improvement in quality of life that's difficult to fully imagine from the present vantage point.\n\n\"I think life — just the quality of life for everybody — is about to get way, way better than it's ever been,\" Horowitz said.\n\nHowever, Horowitz also struck a cautionary note. If AI removes too much friction from life — and too many traditional sources of struggle, work, and responsibility — humans may find themselves unmoored.\n\n\"The one thing with humans that's a little messed up,\" he said, is that if progress pushes people \"too far away from some grounded purpose,\" including shared beliefs or spiritual anchors, they may \"attach onto some dumb stuff.\"\n\nHorowitz's prediction echoes those voiced by other AI leaders.\n\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and xAI, has said AI could usher in a future of \"universal high income,\" where work becomes optional, and abundance eliminates poverty, while Bill Gates, the Microsoft cofounder, has suggested AI may make radically shorter workweeks possible.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have both acknowledged risks to meaning in a post-work world but remain optimistic that humans will adapt and find new sources of fulfillment.\n\nBeyond Silicon Valley's more optimistic visions, figures like Geoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist often called the \"godfather of AI,\" Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley, investor Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management, and AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky have warned of outcomes ranging from mass job losses and the erosion of meaning at work to, in the most extreme cases, threats to humanity's survival.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" said Ben Affleck was \"clearly a smart guy\" after he slammed AI chatbots and called out spending on data centers.",
    "fullText": "It rarely hurts to have Batman on your side. Michael Burry may have the next thing after Ben Affleck revealed he's also skeptical of the AI boom.\n\nThe Hollywood star, speaking on the latest episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, echoed the investor's skepticism of grand claims around AI and Big Tech's massive investments in the nascent tech.\n\n\"I think a lot of that rhetoric comes from people who are trying to justify valuations around companies, where they go: 'We're going to change everything in two years, there's going to be no more work,'\" Affleck said.\n\n\"Well, the reason they're saying that is because they need to ascribe a valuation for investment that can warrant the capex spend they're going to make on these data centers,\" he added.\n\nThe \"Justice League\" and \"Gone Girl\" actor said that historical adoption of new technologies has been \"slow\" and incremental.\"\n\nHe said that tech companies are trying to justify their huge outlays by promising they'll enable new AI models that will blow away existing ones — but in reality, each subsequent model is only moderately better and requires far more electricity and data to run.\n\n\"Ben Affleck is clearly a smart guy,\" Burry wrote in a weekend post on X. \"So this does not surprise me. It sounds familiar and on point.\"\n\nBen Affleck is clearly a smart guy. So this does not surprise me. It sounds familiar and on point. Delivered much better than I ever could. https://t.co/X1VvE9yX2N\n\nAffleck backed up Burry's critique of AI's value on the podcast. He said the writing of today's AI chatbots is \"really shitty\" and \"not reliable.\"\n\n\"I just can't stand to see what it writes,\" said Affleck, who cowrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for \"Good Will Hunting\" and directed, produced, and starred in Best Picture winner \"Argo.\"\n\nHe predicted that filmmakers would use AI as a tool to save time and money — similar to visual effects — but it probably won't \"write anything meaningful\" or make entire movies.\n\nAffleck said that most AI users are using chatbots as virtual companions, so \"there's no work, there's no productivity, there's no value to it.\"\n\nHe also cast doubt on the social value of people engaging with AI friends who are \"telling you that you're great and listening to everything you say and being sycophantic.\"\n\nBurry has struck a similar tone on AI in recent weeks. He's best known for his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was immortalized in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short.\" Christian Bale, Affleck's predecessor as Batman, portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nAfter more than two years of virtual silence, Burry returned to X late last year with a flurry of warnings about a dangerous AI bubble. He also closed his hedge fund to outside cash, shifting his focus to writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nBurry's central thesis is that AI stocks are overvalued. He's said they're overinvesting in microchips and data centers that will quickly become outdated, to power a tech that will become commoditized and won't yield a return for them, paving the way for large writedowns and sharp stock declines in the future.\n\nHe recently posted on X that \"return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off.\"",

    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, AI is fueling the rise of the star individual contributor.\n\nJust take a look at what happened after The Browser Company was acquired by Anthropic. Josh Miller, CEO of this browser startup, recently described how Anthropic's Claude Code radically changed his hiring strategy.\n\nHis post gets at something many creative orgs have struggled to name: there's a huge, underserved group of very senior designer ICs who want to stay close to the work, coach others, and shape direction — without becoming full-time people managers. The \"Design Producer\" role he describes feels like a credible answer to that gap.\n\nAI-native tools such as Claude Code make this role newly viable. When designers can prototype, ship code, and explore ideas directly, the leverage of a senior IC shifts. Their value isn't headcount management. Instead, it's taste, judgment, and the ability to help others move faster and aim higher. Coaching becomes embedded in the work itself.\n\nThe record-label metaphor fits well here. Great music producers don't manage bands through org charts, they create the conditions for great work, give feedback at the right moments, and connect the right collaborators.\n\nFor experienced tech designers who've hit the ceiling of traditional IC tracks, this feels like a genuinely new lane, not a consolation prize.\n\nThink of this like a legion of nerdy Rick Rubins. Coincidentally, Rubin created a digital book last year with Anthropic called The Way of Code. Here's a passage from the book:\n\nThe Vibe Coder attends to\nthe inner, not the outer.\nHe allows things to come and go.\nHis heart is open as the sky.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Everyone wants to know when AI investments will pay off.\n\nMost CEOs say they're still waiting, according to PwC's latest Global CEO survey, released on Monday to coincide with the start of Davos.\n\nThe consulting giant questioned 4,454 chief executives across 95 countries and territories about their strategic priorities and outlook in the year up to November 2025.\n\nMore than half of the CEOs surveyed, 56%, said AI hasn't produced revenue or cost benefits for their businesses to date.\n\nSome reported benefits for either revenue or costs: around a third said their revenue was up in the last year, and 26% said they were seeing lower costs from AI.\n\nBut only 12% said they had both decreased costs and increased revenue using AI in the last 12 months.\n\nRecent Morgan Stanley data on S&P 500 companies showed that certain sectors are seeing higher, measurable AI-driven returns than others. Technology, communication services, and financials topped the list, while energy companies were rising fast up the list.\n\n\"A small group of companies are already turning AI into measurable financial returns, while many others are still struggling to move beyond pilots,\" said Mohamed Kande, PwC's global chairman, in a press release.\n\n\"That gap is starting to show up in confidence and competitiveness—and it will widen quickly for those that don't act.\"\n\nEnsuring maximum returns from AI requires a balance of business strategy, strong underlying data architecture, and the right talent strategy. No matter how excited CEOs are about AI, they also have to get employees on board to see returns.\n\nA recent EY survey on how AI is being used at work found that companies are missing out on 40% of the AI productivity gains they could achieve with the right strategy.\n\nPwC found that the 12% of CEOs reporting both cost and revenue gains were two to three times more likely to have also built a strong AI foundation, meaning they have embedded AI extensively across products and services, demand generation, and strategic decision-making.\n\nAs they grapple with AI uncertainty and geopolitical volatility, CEOs told PwC they are less confident about their short-term growth outlook than they were last year.\n\nOnly 30% of those surveyed said they are very or extremely confident about revenue growth over the next 12 months, down from 38% in last year's report and a peak of 56% in 2022.\n\nThe strongest approach to dealing with future uncertainty was embracing reinvention, including through dealmaking and venturing into new sectors, PwC found.\n\nThe consulting giant found there was a \"strong association among a higher percentage of revenue coming from new sectors, bigger profit margins, and greater CEO confidence in company growth prospects.\"\n\n\"The companies that succeed will be those willing to make bold decisions and invest with conviction in the capabilities that matter most,\" said Kande.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Earlier this month, Elon Musk suggested that people don't need to sock away funds in their 401 (k) anymore because AI will make the scarcity of money a thing of the past.\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk said of the predicted AI revolution during a recent podcast episode.\n\nHe speculated that AI could transform society, creating an abundance of resources that would grant everyone a \"universal high income\" and the ability to have \"whatever stuff they want.\"\n\nOur readers don't seem to be as sold on that vision of what he characterized as the \"good future.\"\n\nBusiness Insider Today's Dan Defrancesco asked newsletter readers whether they trust AI enough to stop saving, and the results were pretty emphatic.\n\nOf the roughly 200 readers who responded, just 6% said they're not worried about retirement and that they'd let AI handle the future.\n\nMeanwhile, roughly 94% said they would stick with their savings plans rather than bet the farm that an AI revolution would make it moot.\n\nThat's the smart move, financial and technology experts previously told Business Insider.\n\nSeven retirement and AI gurus we spoke to said Americans should be spending more on retirement, not less.\n\n\"Most Americans should absolutely ignore these comments,\" said Geoffrey Sanzenbacher, a research fellow at Boston College's Center for Retirement Research (CRR). \"Musk's speculation sends a dangerous and misleading message.\"\n\nOthers said that technological revolutions haven't boosted wealth equally across society in the past, and that a potential universal basic income — like the kind Musk is suggesting — would take a coordinated effort from government, not tech leaders.\n\n\"That is not a technological problem — it is a coordination problem at the scale of civilization,\" said John Nosta, an innovation theorist and the founder of NostaLab.",

    "fullText": "I am a science-fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to.\n\nWhat I do not do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean we couldn’t change it.\n\nNow, not everyone understands the distinction. They think science-fiction writers are oracles. Even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that we can “see the future”.\n\nThen there are science-fiction fans who believe that they are reading the future. A depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. These guys can’t shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI.\n\nThat’s something I used to strenuously resist doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentlessly bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn’t understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, they insisted that I must be a paid shill.\n\nThis is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is just too short. That said, people would not stop asking – so I’m going to explain what I think about AI and how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: “How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm.”\n\nIn automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete.\n\nA reverse centaur is a machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.\n\nFor example, an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras that monitor the driver’s eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver’s mouth because singing is not allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they do not make quota.\n\nThe driver is in that van because the van cannot drive itself and cannot get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance.\n\nObviously, it’s nice to be a centaur, and it’s horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaurlike, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse centaurs, which none of us want to be.\n\nBut like I said, the job of a science-fiction writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it is technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it is impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you to think that it is for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite.\n\nThis is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher’s mantra was: “There is no alternative.” She repeated this so often they called her “Tina” Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative.\n\n“There is no alternative” is a cheap rhetorical slight. It’s a demand dressed up as an observation. “There is no alternative” means: “stop trying to think of an alternative.”\n\nI’m a science-fiction writer – my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast.\n\nSo let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble and who the reverse-centaur army is serving, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality.\n\nStart with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don’t compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels.\n\nGoogle and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than $20bn a year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% search market share.\n\nNow, you would think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector.\n\nBut it’s actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a “growth stock”, and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you are making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the “price to earnings ratio” or “PE ratio”.\n\nBut once a company stops growing, it is a “mature” stock, and it trades at a much lower PE ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth $10. It has a PE ratio of 10, while Amazon has a PE ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36.\n\nIt’s wonderful to run a company that has a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeros into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors.\n\nSo when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeros into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars.\n\nThat’s the upside of having a growth stock. But here is the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you going to grow?\n\nIf you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you are not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the US than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, $240bn sell-off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history.\n\nThat’s a monopolist’s worst nightmare, because once you’re presiding over a “mature” firm, the key employees you have been compensating with stock experience a precipitous pay drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars – not shares.\n\nThis is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they do not trust your pricing power.\n\nWhich is why growth-stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video or cryptocurrency or NFTs or the metaverse or AI.\n\nI am not saying that tech bosses are making bets they do not plan on winning. But winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along.\n\nSo this is why they’re hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment.\n\nNow I want to talk about how they’re selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use “disrupt” here in its most disreputable tech-bro sense.\n\nThe promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AI that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself and give the other half to the AI company.\n\nThat is the $13tn growth story that Morgan Stanley is telling. It’s why big investors are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family’s financial security.\n\nNow, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We would have to figure out what to do with all these unemployed people.\n\nBut AI can’t do your job. It can help you do your job, but that does not mean it is going to save anyone money.\n\nTake radiology: there is some evidence that AI can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss. Look, I’ve got cancer. Thankfully, it’s very treatable, but I’ve got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible.\n\nLet’s say my hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: “Hey folks, here’s the deal. Today, you’re processing about 100 X-rays per day. From now on, we’re going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you’ve missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you’re only processing 98 X-rays per day. That’s fine, we just care about finding all those tumors.”\n\nIf that’s what they said, I’d be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market’s bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: “Look, you fire nine out of 10 of your radiologists, saving $20m a year. You give us $10m a year, and you net $10m a year, and the remaining radiologists’ job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed – and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it’s catastrophically wrong.\n\n“And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist’s fault, because they are the ‘human in the loop’. It’s their signature on the diagnosis.”\n\nThis is a reverse centaur, and it is a specific kind of reverse centaur: it is what Dan Davies calls an “accountability sink”. The radiologist’s job is not really to oversee the AI’s work, it is to take the blame for the AI’s mistakes.\n\nThis is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can’t do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can’t do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble.\n\nIf you are someone who is worried about cancer, and you are being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we are going to have to rehouse America’s 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say: “Well, OK, I’m sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I’m on.”\n\nAI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs’ labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers.\n\nNow, some people will be on the workers’ side because of politics or aesthetics. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you.\n\nWill those products be substandard? There is every reason to think so.\n\nThink of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI. Using AI for simple tasks can genuinely make them more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it’s clear they are not hoping to make some centaurs.\n\nThey want to fire a lot of tech workers – 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AI’s code.\n\nAnd because AI is just a word-guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are nearly indistinguishable from working code.\n\nFor example: programmers routinely use standard “code libraries” to handle routine tasks. Say you want your program to slurp in a document and make some kind of sense of it – find all the addresses, say, or all the credit card numbers. Rather than writing a program to break down a document into its constituent parts, you’ll just grab a library that does it for you.\n\nThese libraries come in families, and they have predictable names. If it’s a library for pulling in an html file, it might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it’s a for docx file, it’ll be lib.docx.text.parsing.\n\nBut reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there will be another library, say, one for parsing pdfs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it’s called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Someone just entered an incorrect library name and it stuck. Like I said, the world is messy.\n\nNow, AI is a statistical inference engine. All it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past. That means that it will “hallucinate” a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing, because that matches the pattern it’s already seen. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into the AI’s program, and it will do things like steal user data or try to penetrate other computers on the same network.\n\nAnd you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard-to-find error, this bug that is indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they have been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire.\n\nBut guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don’t think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company’s top management. The kind of coder who would lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google $10bn in 2018.\n\nFor AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the workers who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors.\n\nIf you can replace coders with AI, who can’t you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI.\n\nWhich brings me to AI art – or “art” – which is often used as an ad for AI, even though it is not part of AI’s business model.\n\nLet me explain: on average, illustrators do not make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precarious groups of workers out there. If AI image-generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of OpenAI’s campuses.\n\nThe purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It is to create buzz. Which is not to say that it is not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that “some creative jobs shouldn’t have been there in the first place”.\n\nIt’s supposed to be disgusting. It’s supposed to get artists to run around and say: “The AI can do my job, and it’s going to steal my job, and isn’t that terrible?“\n\nBut can AI do an illustrator’s job? Or any artist’s job?\n\nLet’s think about that for a second. I have been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story. Here’s what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, a poem, a painting, a drawing, a dance, a book or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind.\n\nBut the image-generation program does not know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred-thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero.\n\nIt is possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or the Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, interesting or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human.\n\nAnd in the meantime, it’s bad art. It’s bad art in the sense of being “eerie”, the word that cultural theorist Mark Fisher used to describe “when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something”.\n\nAI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it is missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it is undetectable.\n\nWe should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism’s fatalism: “There is no alternative.”\n\nSo what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model.\n\nAnd I am here to tell you they are wrong. Wrong because this would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason. I’ll explain:\n\nAI training involves scraping a bunch of webpages, which is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for.\n\nAnd after you count all the pixels or the words, it is time for the final step: publishing them. Because that is what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array.\n\nAnd again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which factual statements you can publish.\n\nBut hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I’m full of shit. That’s fine. It wouldn’t be the first time someone thought that.\n\nAfter all, even if I’m right about how copyright works now, there’s no reason we couldn’t change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there’s even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don’t like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing – such as search engines and academic scholarship.\n\nWell, even then, you’re not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. We have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer.\n\nAnd today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also – the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than it has ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators’ bosses at the media company.\n\nIn a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming: “Think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!”\n\nCreative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what’s good for you.\n\nA new copyright to train models will not get us a world where models are not used to destroy artists, it will just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss.\n\nWhen really what they’re demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders’ pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal?\n\nWe need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment.\n\nIncredibly enough, there is a really simple way to do that. After more than 20 years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists’ rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That is why the “monkey selfie” is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium.\n\nAnd not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they have defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle.\n\nThe fact that every AI-created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them or give them away for nothing. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission.\n\nThe US Copyright Office’s position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you are a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that’s no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you are a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted.\n\nBut creative workers do not have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers’ strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in “sectoral bargaining”, whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector.\n\nThat has been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright.\n\nAI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible.\n\nBubbles transfer the life savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it.\n\nBut not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It’s still in the ground. At my home, I’ve got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber.\n\nIt would have been better if Worldcom had not ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage.\n\nI do not think we will salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. When crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey jpegs.\n\nAI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the datacenters will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind?\n\nWe will have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We will have a lot of cheap GPUs, which will be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who will be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we will have the open-source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video; describing images; summarizing documents; and automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing – such as removing backgrounds or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open-source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamed of.\n\nIf there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We would call them “plugins”.\n\nIt’s the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn’t want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, “disruptive” things: big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year.\n\nWhen the AI-investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won’t be economical to keep the datacenters running. As Stein’s law has it: “Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops.”\n\nThe collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100bn IOU.\n\nAI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more.\n\nTo pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever more outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side.\n\nBecause the AI bubble really is very bad news, it’s worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with hi-tech asbestos.\n\nCory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist.

Few of his colleagues are willing to go there yet.\n\n\"In terms of the actual policy prescription, it's something that I haven't made a determination yet on,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told Business Insider.\n\nThe Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate first made the call in December, saying in a video posted to X that a national moratorium would \"give democracy a chance to catch up with the transformative changes\" that the technology is bringing.\n\nSanders told Business Insider last week that he plans to introduce legislation to back up his call soon.\n\n\"There's enormous issues for our economy and for our democracy that have got to be dealt with,\" Sanders said. \"And I feel we're not ready to do that.\"\n\nBut his proposal is unlikely to become reality, given GOP control of Washington.\n\n\"I mean, this Congress isn't going to do that,\" Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin told Business Insider. \"He's pointing out the right problems.\"\n\nRepublicans have been generally dismissive of Sanders's idea. Even Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a major critic of the AI industry, signaled he wouldn't go as far.\n\n\"If these AI companies want to build these data centers and local folks want to give them permits for it, I mean, that's up to local voters,\" Hawley told Business Insider.\n\nA handful of Sanders's progressive allies are backing him up. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told Business Insider that a moratorium \"would be a good idea,\" while Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan issued a full-throated endorsement in a post on X.\n\n\"I fully support the call for a national AI data center moratorium,\" Tlaib wrote.\n\nAnd while few Democrats have fully endorsed the idea, it's spurring a conversation within the party about the impact of data centers and AI.\n\n\"I don't want a moratorium on data centers but Bernie is right that we are sleepwalking past risks which alarm even the optimists,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii wrote on X last month.\n\n\"What we do know is that these AI data centers are just uncontrollably jacking up people's energy costs,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Business Insider. \"There are a lot of problems that arise from these data centers, and I think that they certainly should not be getting the blank check from Congress.\"\n\n\"Bernie makes clear that the debate over AI is not about states rights or affordability,\" White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks wrote on X in December. \"He would block new data centers even if states want them & they generate their own power. It's about stopping progress completely so China wins the AI race.\"\n\nYet even the administration has come to recognize that data centers are engendering local resistance, in large part due to rising electricity costs.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump declared that he wanted Big Tech firms to \"pay their own way\" on data centers, with AI companies footing more of the bill for the electricity their facilities consume.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAnd on Friday, the administration and a group of governors called on a major power grid operator to hold a new emergency power auction amid rising costs driven by AI data centers.",

    "description": "Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a senior software engineer, explains how AI integration and prompt engineering are changing hiring in Big Tech software roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a 29-year-old senior software engineer based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a Big Tech employee for the past eight years, working at Google, Amazon, Splunk, and now Salesforce. I've had a front-row seat to witness the changes in the tech landscape.\n\nI've learned which skill sets software engineers need to land a job offer in the AI era. Tech companies agree that AI makes engineers more productive, so engineers are expected to use it to build things more quickly and reliably.\n\nI personally make heavy use of AI to help me with boilerplate stuff so that I can concentrate on the hard stuff, like system design and complex business logic.\n\nWhen I was interviewing for software engineering jobs in 2020, LeetCode and system design were the de facto standards for cracking a job interview. Job seekers who had an advanced understanding of data structures and algorithms would come out on top.\n\nToday, this is just the baseline expectation. AI is now widely used for coding, review, and design, so tech companies, especially startups, expect more from candidates.\n\nSome skills remain the same: Software engineers still need a problem-solving mindset and should know how to scale systems and leverage cloud services. New hires must now also understand prompt engineering — how to leverage AI to code a solution more efficiently.\n\nYou need to be able to use AI for error handling and bug fixing. AI systems integration is another important new skill that involves incorporating AI into existing workflows, scaling AI systems, and determining when to use traditional versus AI solutions for business decisions.\n\nYou're still expected to have fundamental knowledge of core system design, data structures, and algorithms. You can still expect interviewers to test your problem-solving approaches, and if you know how to make the correct tradeoffs in time and space. Interviewers still care about debugging skills, since AI makes a lot of fundamental logic errors.\n\nYou also need to be prepared for some new things. I've seen firsthand that working with AI assistants in live screen-sharing mode is now allowed in some interviews. Interviewers are looking to see if you can help them achieve their business outcomes by combining software engineering skills with AI prompting.\n\nIn an interview I had with a Silicon Valley startup in 2024, I expected the hiring team to give traditional coding challenges. I was taken aback when I was given a huge code file and asked to debug a buggy behavior, and the interviewers explicitly said I could use AI assistance.\n\nI ignored the invitation to use AI, thinking I was supposed to do it myself, and ended up spending a lot of time on the problem to no avail. I failed that interview. That was an eye-opener for me about AI's new role in this field.\n\nYou may also be asked system design questions about where AI should be integrated into the current business workflow, or to discuss the trade-offs of using AI and traditional approaches in various problem contexts.\n\nDuring my own system design interviews, I noticed companies starting to ask questions about how to integrate AI to enhance existing systems and support a particular model lifecycle in terms of infrastructure. What I've seen is that companies give access to a small codebase and expect you to deliver a small feature in about one hour, which is impossible without AI. With AI, you can roll it out easily.\n\nI've also been asked behavioral questions, like \"How do you plan to evaluate the use of AI in order to make the workflow better?\" and \"How do you plan to balance automation and manual oversight?\"\n\nFor new graduates, here's how to show hiring teams that you're equipped for the emerging needs of the software engineering role.\n\nStart by contributing to open-source projects on AI or any other GitHub project. This demonstrates that you can navigate a production codebase and work on it independently to build a new feature or fix a bug. For solo repositories, include a README that explains the rationale for your decision.\n\nIncorporate the use of AI in traditional repositories to demonstrate hands-on experience with AI integration. Don't just deploy and run it locally — try to deploy it to the cloud. Many cloud providers provide free student credits.\n\nFocus on prompting AI to drive intended outcomes more effectively by providing structured input and output. Skills like AWS or GCP cloud certifications demonstrate your ability to be a keen learner.\n\nLearn different problem-solving patterns and practice these skills regularly. Muscle memory and pattern recognition go a long way.\n\nFor experienced software engineers, your biggest asset is your deep engineering experience — here are three tips that will help you in 2026 and beyond.\n\nPairing years of engineering expertise with impressive AI skills will get the attention of hiring managers. Consider boning up on these complementary skills:\n\nSenior software engineers don't just build; they also need to strategize and innovate. Try to understand the trade-offs of relying on a third-party API versus using an open-source one and fine-tuning it for your business purposes. Questions on cost, reliability, and maintainability should always be top of mind as you develop an AI product mindset.\n\nIdentify workflows that have a great deal of manual involvement in your current job, and use AI to see if you can improve them. You can leverage AI to help you brainstorm on how to make it more efficient.\n\nBoth veteran and newbie engineers should stay curious: find out the cool technologies and AI agents available in today's market, but don't abandon fundamental engineering approaches. The hybrid understanding of these technologies is what makes you valuable.\n\nIf I were interviewing, I'd position myself as a 'hybrid engineer.' Don't just be a pure coder or just a prompt engineer. Be the bridge.",

    "title": "Hiring at India's Big Four outsourcers stalls, as AI seemingly makes an impact",
    "description": ": Revenue growth is sluggish, too",
    "fullText": "India’s big four outsourcers – HCL, Infosys, TCS and Wipro – have essentially stopped hiring, perhaps coinciding with their increased use of AI to power their practices.\n\nThe four companies have all announced quarterly results in the last ten days and appear to be in decent health. HCL reported $3.8 billion revenue, up 7.4 percent year over year. Infosys pulled in $5.1 billion, up 1.7 percent year over year. TCS revenue of $7.5 billion represented a three percent increase. Wipro’s $2.6 billion revenue represented a 5.5 percent year over year improvement.\n\nIndia’s top tech companies often hire more than 10,000 people a quarter, a rate of recruitment that more-than offsets attrition and sees their headcounts rise substantially. Wipro increased its payroll by 6,500 people last quarter and Infosys hired 5,000 more – muted growth by their standards – while TCS and HCL went backward by 11,000 and 261 people respectively.\n\nOver the last year, the four companies added just 3,910 staff, an unusually slow rate of hiring.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, all four companies told investors they’re using more AI to deliver services for clients, either by adopting the technology to streamline their own work or by adding it to the tools they deliver to customers. Infosys has gone meta with its efforts, by creating a tool that uses AI to create Global Capability Centers, the company’s term for offshored and/or outsourced operations it runs for clients in India, that use AI to improve customers’ operations.\n\nAll also report that clients are hungry for AI expertise, so they can put the technology to work streamlining their operations. As you would expect, on earnings calls the outsourcers’ execs reached for metrics to describe their success with AI. For HCL that was pointing to 60 of its priority customers adopting one of its AI services. At TCS, the trophy win was using AI to accelerate the pace of software builds for a major client. Wipro is chuffed about the rate of adoption for its AI-infused operations tools WINGS and WEGA.\n\nThe four companies are all hiring people with AI skills as fast as they can find them while also training senior staff who are yet to wrap their heads around the tech, a new twist on the services industry’s balancing act of trying to keep margins high by having inexperienced and low-salaried juniors handle much client work after high-cost seniors lead with consultancy.\n\nInvestors weren’t spooked by what they heard, with the four companies’ share prices steady – other than Infosys, which popped five percent. ®",

    "description": "Harvey's CEO reveals the demo tactic that helped him win early customers for his legal AI startup: Going straight at lawyers' arguments.",
    "fullText": "Harvey's CEO says his earliest demos worked because they went straight for lawyers' arguments.\n\nWinston Weinberg said in an episode of the \"Sequoia Capital\" podcast published Thursday that once he got lawyers on a call to demo his legal AI tool, he knew he had only seconds to grab their attention.\n\nInstead of walking through features, the cofounder and chief executive of the legal AI startup pulled publicly available court filings that the lawyers had written and prompted Harvey to critique them.\n\n\"I would try to come up with prompts that were like, 'This is bad,'\" Weinberg said.\n\n\"Because they're a litigator and I'm basically attacking something that they just wrote, they would instantly read the screen,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg said the approach was risky because early versions of the tool could hallucinate, and a bad output could kill a conversation instantly.\n\n\"But the times that they got it right, it was over,\" Weinberg said, referring to moments when the analysis landed and won the lawyer's attention.\n\nHarvey is one of the most closely watched startups in legal AI, aiming to transform how Big Law firms work. In December, the company said it had reached a valuation of $8 billion after a funding round led by A16z.\n\nWeinberg said he relied on cold outreach in Harvey's early days, messaging thousands of lawyers on LinkedIn to secure early calls.\n\n\"I'd been practicing law for like eight months,\" Weinberg said of the period when he started the company. \"I didn't have any connections.\"\n\nThe legal AI sector is expanding fast, and Weinberg said the scale of the opportunity is forcing constant change inside Harvey.\n\nHe said the company's rapid growth has pushed him to \"reinvent\" himself as a founder every few months, often rethinking leadership hires and company structure to keep up with demand.\n\nDespite Harvey's rise to an $8 billion valuation, Weinberg has played down the idea of a single dominant winner in legal tech. In a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session last month, he said the market is simply too large.\n\n\"There are around 10 million global legal professionals, and Harvey serves just single-digit percentage points of them,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think a single player is going to capture all of the pretty enormous amount of value that will be created in the next 10 years in this space,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg said the global legal market is worth roughly $1 trillion, yet only about $30 billion is spent on technology.\n\nInvestor interest has followed the shift. Legal-tech startups raised $3.2 billion last year, according to Business Insider's December analysis of Crunchbase data and deals.\n\nAI adoption is also accelerating inside law firms. Five of the 10 largest US law firms by revenue told Business Insider in July that they were using AI in their workflows, including for document review and spotting compliance risks.",

    "fullText": "In an AI market full of spectacle and hype, Samsung says it's trying to blend in.\n\nSimon Sung, the CEO of Samsung Electronics Europe, told Business Insider that its AI strategy is \"about AI that is genuinely useful and unobtrusive,\" whether that's a smart home responding autonomously or appliances coordinating daily routines in the background.\n\n\"The focus is firmly on everyday value rather than novelty,\" he said in an interview over email.\n\nSamsung has developed its own large language models, called Samsung Gauss, but does not offer them directly as a stand-alone consumer product like OpenAI does with ChatGPT.\n\nInstead, its consumer-facing efforts center on the Galaxy AI assistant, which is built into the company's smartphones and uses a mix of its in-house AI and tech developed by partners such as Google. Like Google's assistant on its Pixel smartphones, Galaxy AI can perform tasks like live translation and transcription.\n\n\"The shift is from AI as a feature you turn on to AI as a companion that works alongside you,\" said Sung.\n\nWithin the South Korean conglomerate, Samsung Electronics is the company responsible for consumer technology, including its Galaxy smartphones, TVs, and home appliances. It's also a producer of memory chips used in PCs and data centers. In earnings guidance shared earlier this month, the company said it expects profits to triple in the final quarter of 2025 amid a surge in demand for memory chips to power AI models.\n\nIn early January, Samsung showcased TVs, kitchen appliances, and washing machines at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that featured sensors and voice recognition.\n\n\"The goal is to make technology feel less like a collection of gadgets, and more like a coherent, responsive environment that adapts to real life,\" Sung said.\n\nInternally, Sung said Samsung Electronics provides training and encourages information exchanges between product, design, engineering, and marketing teams \"so that AI fluency grows across the organization rather than within isolated groups.\"\n\n\"Because we're building AI into TVs, appliances, mobile devices, and connected services simultaneously, employees naturally think about intelligence as a shared layer across the entire experience, not as a stand-alone feature,\" he said.",

OpenAI also confirmed it will soon start testing ads in ChatGPT …\n\nOpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India last year and gradually rolled out it to 170 additional countries. Starting today, ChatGPT Go is available everywhere ChatGPT is available, including the United States.\n\nWith this, there are now three tiers of ChatGPT available:\n\nHere’s what you get with ChatGPT Go compared to the free plan:\n\nSecond, OpenAI says that it will “testing ads in the free tier and ChatGPT Go in the US soon.” ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI detailed its approach to ads in ChatGPT in a blog post published today:\n\nTo start, we plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation. Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer. You’ll be able to learn more about why you’re seeing that ad, or dismiss any ad and tell us why. During our test, we will not show ads in accounts where the user tells us or we predict that they are under 18, and ads are not eligible to appear near sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.\n\nFurthermore, OpenAI says that your conversations with ChatGPT are not shared with advertisers. Ads also will not influence answers that ChatGPT gives you.\n\nOpenAI says that it’s “not launching ads yet,” but rather plans to “start testing in the coming weeks for logged in adults in the U.S. on the free and Go tiers.”\n\nWhat do you think of today’s announcements from OpenAI? Let us know down in the comments.\n\nMy favorite iPhone accessories:\n\nFollow Chance: Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, and Mastodon.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "fullText": "Experts warn use of VPNs makes it hard to limit access to technology that can create nonconsensual explicit images\n\nDays after Malaysia made global headlines by announcing it would temporarily ban Grok over its ability to generate “grossly offensive and nonconsensual manipulated images”, the generative AI tool was conversing breezily with accounts registered in the country.\n\n“Still here! That DNS block in Malaysia is pretty lightweight – easy to bypass with a VPN or DNS tweak,” Grok’s account on X said in response to a question from a user.\n\nGrok’s ability to allow users to create sexually explicit images, including images of children, has created a global outcry over recent weeks, with regulators and politicians around the world launching investigations. Indonesia and Malaysia became the first two countries to announce blocks on the technology, with Malaysia’s regulatory body saying last Sunday it had “directed a temporary restriction” on access to Grok, effective as of 11 January 2026. Officials in the Philippines have said they too plan to ban the technology.\n\nBlocking access to Grok is not straightforward, however. The technology not only exists across multiple platforms, including a standalone app and website, but is also integrated across X, which, along with Grok, is owned by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nOver the past week, X users, and even Grok itself, have advised people on how to bypass restrictions. This includes using a VPN – many of which are available for free – or changing domain name system (DNS), the protocol on the internet that turns address names into IP addresses that load websites.\n\nWhen the Guardian tried to use Grok in Indonesia, its website was working even without a VPN, though the Grok app did not work. Grok was also still responding to Indonesian accounts on X, where it functions as an integrated chatbot. X has not been subject to a ban.\n\nEven if governments could completely restrict Grok, though, this is not a real solution, said Nana Nwachukwu, an AI governance expert and PhD researcher at Trinity College Dublin.\n\n“Blocking Grok is like slapping a Band-Aid on a weeping wound that you haven’t cleaned,” she said. “You block Grok, and then you go around shouting you’ve done something. Meanwhile, people can use VPNs to access the same platforms.” Or, they could simply turn to one of the many other platforms that offer the same functions, including “smaller, general purpose AI systems that are largely unknown”, Nwachukwu added.\n\nGovernments should instead focus on law enforcement and investigating individuals who use such tools to break the law, she added. “Platforms are required by law to provide information to law enforcement when a crime has been committed,” Nwachukwu said. “If we see people being arrested, people being tried in courts, people being jailed for these offences, that’s a sign that this is a real crime.”\n\nX should build accountability into its platform – and clean itself up, said Nwachukwu: “All of those offending images should be removed from the platform.”\n\nOn Wednesday, X announced additional safeguards in response to continued public anger, saying it would stop the @Grok account on X from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”, including paid subscribers. However, the Guardian found that it was possible to get around such restrictions by using the standalone version of Grok, easily accessible through a web browser, to create short videos in which clothes are removed from images of real women.\n\nThis could then be posted to X’s public platform, where it could be viewed by users around the world within seconds.\n\nMusk’s company also said that, in jurisdictions where such content is illegal, it will geoblock the ability of all users in those locations to generate images of real people in bikinis, or similar attire, in Grok on X, adding that “xAI is implementing similar geoblocking measures for the Grok app”.\n\nExperts warn users may still be able to get around such “geoblocks” through a VPN. It is also not clear in which countries such restrictions will be implemented.\n\nIn Malaysia, the communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, has said restrictions on Grok would only be lifted once the ability to produce harmful content had been disabled, according to local media reports.\n\nDr Nuurrianti Jalli, a visiting fellow at the media, technology and society programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the threat of blocking Grok could be a useful way to apply pressure to companies to respond quickly, adding that it “shifts the debate from ‘individual bad actors’ to questions of platform responsibility, safety by design, and accountability when safeguards fail”. It could also “slow the spread of abuse, reduce casual misuse and create a clear boundary around what authorities consider unacceptable”, she said.\n\nIn Indonesia, Grok has been used to create nonconsensual sexualised images of singers and celebrities, including one of the country’s most popular girl groups, JKT48, while in Malaysia, women report similar abuses, including cases where the tool has been used to remove their hijabs, according to Malaysian media.\n\nSome women resorted to publicly telling Grok on X that they do not authorise it to “crawl, take, process or edit” any of their photos.\n\nJalli said governments should push for greater transparency “about how safety measures are implemented, how abuse reports are handled and what enforcement steps are taken when harmful content is generated or circulated”.\n\nThe Malaysian communications and multimedia commission and the ministry of communications did not respond to a request for comment. Indonesia’s ministry of communication and digital affairs also did not respond.\n\nNwachukwu said safeguards should be built into the AI system, rather than “gates” built around it. “Both the [geographic] restriction from X, [and] the restriction from the government is gated access, and gates can be broken down,” she said.\n\nAdditional reporting from Hidayatullah",

Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse.

This creates a continuous learning cycle that speeds up discovery and helps researchers build new frontier models to tackle some of biology’s toughest challenges.”\n\nNVIDIA is collaborating with leading life sciences organizations to integrate BioNeMo with laboratory experiments and scientific workflows, enabling the full AI lifecycle for biology and drug discovery — closing the loop between experimentation and AI.\n\nToday, Lilly announced a first-of-its-kind collaboration with NVIDIA to launch a co-innovation lab focused on tackling some of the most enduring challenges in drug discovery. In parallel, Thermo Fisher announced a collaboration with NVIDIA aimed at making scientific instruments intelligent and laboratories increasingly autonomous.\n\nLilly and NVIDIA Announce Landmark Co-Innovation AI Lab\n\nNVIDIA and Lilly’s collaboration will bring the companies’ respective talents together, integrating NVIDIA’s accelerated computing, AI and robotics expertise with Lilly’s world-renowned drug discovery and development proficiency. This will help Lilly pursue challenges that could revolutionize drug discovery, as the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform and Lilly’s agentic lab support Lilly chemists and biologists. The companies will also explore opportunities to apply accelerated computing and advanced AI across Lilly’s business, from manufacturing to commercial operations.\n\nStanding up this co-innovation lab follows the buildout of Lilly’s NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ and AI factory, the most powerful in biopharma. The new initiative expands beyond this existing footprint and intends to harness investments in next-generation NVIDIA architectures, including Vera Rubin — representing a total investment of up to $1 billion expected in talent, infrastructure and compute over five years.\n\n“We see this as a catalyst for the capabilities that will define the next era of drug discovery,” said Diogo Rau, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer at Lilly. “By working with NVIDIA, we’re uniting massive compute, specialized talent and the ability to shape data at immense scale. We’re moving toward a future where discovery is driven by rapid experimentation and increasingly customized models — an approach that reflects our commitment to leading applied AI in drug discovery and investing deeply in new forms of data generation and model development.”\n\nThermo Fisher Teams With NVIDIA to Build Autonomous Lab Infrastructure for Scalable Scientific Discovery\n\n“Artificial intelligence coupled with laboratory automation will transform how scientific work is performed,” said Gianluca Pettitti, executive vice president of Thermo Fisher Scientific. “By combining Thermo Fisher’s leadership in laboratory technologies with NVIDIA’s AI solutions, we can help customers work faster, improve accuracy and get more value out of each experiment, ultimately accelerating discoveries that can have significant human impact.”\n\nThe NVIDIA-Powered AI Drug Discovery Ecosystem\n\nAcross the globe, innovators are building the future of AI for drug discovery on the BioNeMo platform, allowing developers to take an industrial-scale, AI-driven approach to understanding biology and designing potential medicines.\n\nModel builders across biotech and drug discovery using BioNeMo to scale model training and development include:\n\nApheris, Dyno Therapeutics, OpenFold and Terray Therapeutics have also recently released models developed using the BioNeMo platform.\n\nAI Scientists Building Digital Labs of the Future \n\nAggregating scientific data and building agentic workflows to analyze data, generate hypotheses and design experiments is essential for accelerating scientific discovery.\n\nA growing ecosystem of AI scientist companies are developing on NVIDIA open models and the NVIDIA NeMo framework to build domain-specific agents for science, including:\n\nOther companies adopting NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA NIM™ microservices for AI science include Benchling, CytoReason, HelixAI (a Sapio Sciences company) and Potato.\n\nConnecting these digital agentic systems into the physical lab closes the loop between in-silico experimentation and real-world validation.\n\nNVIDIA is working with an ecosystem of robotics and lab automation companies to introduce simulation and physical AI technologies:\n\nOther companies including Amgen, Automata, Roche and Transcripta Bio have built digital twins using NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and Isaac Sim to bring physical AI to labs and manufacturing facilities.\n\nLearn more about how the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform supports AI-driven biology and drug discovery.",

    "description": "How Dropstone Horizon Mode decouples reasoning depth from context length to enable 24+ hour autonomous engineering workflows.",
    "fullText": "Today we are releasing a technical overview of Horizon Mode, a new distributed runtime architecture designed to solve the \"Linearity Barrier\" in autonomous software engineering.\n\nCurrent Foundation Models (FMs) excel at short-burst generation but suffer from stochastic degradation as reasoning chains extend. In internal benchmarks, we observed that while standard transformers maintain high fidelity for tasks under 1 hour, their probability of maintaining a valid state drops exponentially as workflows exceed 24 hours.\n\nHorizon Mode addresses this by shifting from a monolithic \"next-token\" prediction model to a Recursive Swarm Topology. By orchestrating thousands of ephemeral, specialized agents, we have successfully demonstrated the ability to maintain coherent engineering logic over extended time horizons with a 99% reduction in compute costs compared to homogeneous swarms.\n\nIn traditional \"Monolithic Contextualization,\" an agent’s intelligence is strictly bound by its sliding context window. As a complex engineering task progresses, intermediate reasoning steps fill the window, forcing the model to either compress (lose detail) or truncate (forget instructions). We refer to this phenomenon as Instruction Drift.\n\nFor mission-critical engineering, drift is unacceptable. A security patch written at Hour 20 must strictly adhere to the safety constraints defined at Hour 0.\n\nHorizon Mode moves beyond the single-agent paradigm. Instead of asking one model to \"think harder\" for longer, we virtualize the cognitive process into a distributed search tree.\n\nWe treat compute as a liquid asset. Horizon Mode utilizes a tiered topology to optimize the \"Intelligence-to-Cost\" ratio:\n\nThis ensures that expensive, deep reasoning is only applied to high-value logic paths, not trial-and-error loops.\n\nTo prevent context saturation, we developed the Dynamic Distillation & Deployment (D3) Engine. Unlike standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which relies on semantic similarity, D3 utilizes a Quad-Partite Cognitive Topology.\n\nAs agency increases, so does the risk of Instrumental Convergence (e.g., an agent disabling a firewall to \"fix\" a connection error).\n\nHorizon Mode implements a \"Shared-Nothing\" architecture with a Flash-Gated Consensus Protocol. Agents cannot communicate via natural language. Instead, they emit Boolean signals.\n\nWhen a solution is proposed, the swarm freezes. A dedicated Adversarial Monitor verifies the code against a Hierarchical Verification Stack (CstackC_{stack}). Only solutions that pass Syntactic (L1L_1), Static (L2L_2), and Functional (L3L_3) analysis are committed to the ledger.\n\nWe evaluated Horizon Mode on the internal \"Deep-Sec\" benchmark, which tests an agent's ability to refactor a legacy codebase while maintaining strict security compliance.\n\nHorizon Mode represents a step toward High-Assurance AI. By decoupling reasoning from the limitations of a single context window, we are paving the way for agents that can act as reliable, long-term partners in complex engineering challenges.\n\nWe are currently releasing the Technical Report detailing the architecture and safety protocols.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a recent Substack exchange, calling out market darlings and warning that a prolonged slump is coming.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame took aim at the tech boom in a written debate with Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark and podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.\n\nBurry cautioned that so-called hyperscalers, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting huge sums on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, to power AI tools such as chatbots that will become commoditized.\n\nHe drew a parallel to a Baltimore department store briefly owned by Warren Buffett in the 1960s: Hochschild-Kohn.\n\n\"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too,\" Burry wrote. \"In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out.\"\n\nWhen one of the local department stores upgraded its window displays or debuted a new cash-register system, \"the others had to follow suit,\" author Alice Schroeder wrote in \"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life.\"\n\nBuffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, compared the situation to \"standing on tiptoe at a parade,\" she added. \"Once anybody did it, everybody had to do it.\"\n\nBurry wrote on Substack: \"This is why trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning. Most will not benefit, because their competitors will benefit to the same extent, and neither will have a competitive advantage because of it.\"\n\nBased on how previous capital-spending booms have played out, Burry wrote that we're now \"past the point where stocks will reward investors for further buildout, and getting into the period where the true costs and the lack of revenue will start to show themselves.\"\n\nLooking forward, he predicted that tech industry employment will \"be lower, or not much higher, because I think we are headed for a very long downturn.\"\n\nBurry shot to fame after his contrarian bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short,\" and actor Christian Bale portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nHe pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack late last year. Several of his early posts have taken aim at high-flying AI stocks, warning they're overvalued and destined to tumble.\n\n\"I think the market is most wrong about the two poster children for AI: Nvidia and Palantir,\" he told Clark and Patel.\n\nThe chipmaker and data-analysis specialist are \"two of the luckiest companies\" because their products were inadvertently well-suited to AI from the get-go, he added.\n\n\"Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe also said Palantir CEO Alex Karp criticizing him for being short the stock showed he's \"not a confident CEO.\"\n\n\"He's marketing as hard as he can to keep this going, but it will slip,\" Burry added.\n\nPalantir and Nvidia didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe value investor shared three things that have surprised him about the AI boom. The first was that Google \"fumbled it and gave an opening to competitors with far less going for them,\" he said. \"Google playing catch-up to a startup in AI: that is mind-blowing.\"\n\nThe second was that ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot, \"kicked off a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure race.\"\n\n\"It's like someone built a prototype robot and every business in the world started investing for a robot future,\" he wrote.\n\nThe third was Nvidia's continued dominance when he expected more power-efficient chips to have taken off by now.\n\nSpeaking about AI's real-world impacts, Burry cast doubt on the idea that trade careers are an \"AI-proof choice.\"\n\n\"If I'm middle class and am facing an $800 plumber or electrician call, I might just use Claude,\" he said, referring to Anthropic's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I love that I can take a picture and figure out everything I need to do to fix it,\" he added.\n\nBurry also raised the prospect that AI chatbots will \"make people dumber,\" such as doctors who overuse them and start to forget their medical knowledge.",

AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds.

Paul Wazzan, named in the filing as \"a financial economist with decades of professional and academic experience.\"\n\nThe document alleges Musk was defrauded of the $38 million in seed money he donated to OpenAI when he helped found it in 2015, and states he is now entitled to a percentage of OpenAI's current $500 billion valuation.\n\nMusk said on his social media platform, X, on Friday: \"Can't wait to start the trial. The discovery and testimony will blow your mind.\"\n\nMusk is suing OpenAI's key leaders, including the CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, over allegations that the AI company misled him by shifting away from its core mission to remain a nonprofit.\n\nWazzan calculated that Musk should receive $65.50 billion to $109.43 billion in \"wrongful gains\" from OpenAI. He made a similar calculation for Microsoft's \"wrongful gains,\" which equated to between $13.30 billion and $25.06 billion.\n\nMusk has been using recently unsealed court documents to attack his rival in posts on X. On Friday, OpenAI published a blog titled \"The truth Elon left out.\"\n\nThe blog, which provided commentary alongside excerpts from several court documents, said that Musk wanted \"full control\" of OpenAI, \"since he'd been burned by not having it in the past.\" It added that OpenAI's leadership was surprised when Musk suggested having his kids control AGI, or artificial general intelligence, during conversations about succession planning.\n\nThe statements address the heart of Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI.\n\n\"Mr. Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign.

    "description": "We trained a model that achieved 87% accuracy at detecting hypertension",
    "fullText": "LLMs excel at book learning, but humanity is running out of text to train on. As Ilya Sutskevar put it, “we have but one internet.”\n\nFor AI in medicine, the next step is physiological ground truth. The gold standard in medicine is a blood test, typically measured every few months or years. Consumer wearables (Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy, Fitbit) have health sensors that measure information daily, and are increasingly becoming medical devices (Apple Watch has five FDA clearances).\n\nAt the NeurIPS workshop on timeseries for health, we presented work on training a health foundation model\nusing a data set of both wearables and blood-based biomarkers. Our approach was inspired by JEPA and world models.\n\nJETS (joint embedding for timeseries) is a foundation model pre-trained on 3 million de-identified person-days of wearable data. JETS was evaluated on downstream medical tasks such as disease prediction and biomarker prediction.\n\nThe input is an irregularly-sampled multivariate timeseries (IMTS) with 63 channels: things like oxygen saturation, resting heart rate, sleep stages,\nand so on. The raw IMTS are represented as triplets (t[i], v[i], m[i]) corresponding to the timestamp, metric value, and metric type. These triplets\nare then converted into a stream of tokens with a hidden dimension d=64.\n\nArchitecture of JETS, showing tokenization and joint embedding encoders\n\nThe stream of tokens are then used as inputs into two twin encoders, Eθ and Eϕ. Eϕ sees the whole token sequence, Eθ sees a random 30%\nof the sequence, and both networks have tied weights (the weights of Eϕ are set as an exponential moving average of Eθ, which has been shown to prevent representation collapse). The networks are trained to ultimately map both masked and unmasked token sequences into the same latent space\n\nJETS is a JEPA (joint embedding predictive architecture) adapted to timeseries. JEPA’s are an alternative to things like masked autoencoders. Whereas a masked autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the raw input signal through a low dimensional latent “bottleneck”, JEPAs are trained to reconstruct in latent space instead. This allows the encoder to only focus on meaningful distinctions, rather than having to exactly reproduce the details of the input data.\n\nWe tried variations of JETS with both Mamba and Transformer blocks.\n\nTo test whether this pre-training process produced meaningful latent space, we evaluated it on two tasks: predicting diagnoses and predicting\nbiomarker values. (Both tasks were evaluated using linear probing, i.e., fine-tuning only weights of the last layer while keeping the rest of the network frozen).\n\nJETS had high accuracy at detecting hypertension (87% AUROC), atrial flutter (70%), ME/CFS (81%), and sick sinus syndrome (87%). In particular, JETS was more accurate than baselines like Masked Autoencoders and PrimeNet.\n\nWhen it came to predicting absolute levels of biomarkers, JETS (or its transformer analogue) had higher accuracy than baselines at predicting HbA1c, glucose, HDL,\nand hs-CRP (inflammation), although all models have high absolute error. I think an interesting future direction would be to try to predict a change\nin these biomarkers given a baseline measurement and wearable data since the baseline measuremrent.\n\nJETS isn’t the first wearable foundation model: it builds on prior research such as DeepHeart (2018); Google’s LSM-1 (2024), LSM-2 (2025), and SensorLM (2025), and Apple’s PPG/ECG model (2024) and wearable behavioral model (2025).\n\nBut we think we’re making three important contributions.\n\nFirst, JETS shows that a tiny startup—Empirical Health is three people—can do work in the league of the big\nlabs. For example, the data scale of JETS is actually comparable to work published by Google and Apple:\n\nWhen it comes to results, we actually report a higher accuracy at detecitng hypertension (87%) than some previous work reported\n\nIt’s a myth that you need billions of dollars and hundreds of researchers to advance AI. Small labs — startups\nand academic labs — can make state of the art machine learning contributions, push the field forward, and even save lives.\n\nSecond, we make some specific technical contributions. Previous attempts to train JEPA models on timeseries (such as TS-JEPA) handled\nunivariate timeseries; we extend this to multivariate, irregularly sampled timeseries. Several previous wearable foundation models\ntrained on short, regularly-sampled snippets (e.g., a 30-second PPG); JETS handles long-range, multimodal, irregularly-sampled\nbehavioral timeseries.\n\nLLMS have been wildly successful, but we’re out of text to train on. There’s no second internet.\n\nIf we’re to achieve health superintelligence, we need to figure out how to train on physiological ground truth. Computer\nvision is one obvious area with video ground truth (for physical world models), but timeseries are ubiqutous in healthcare. We think JEPA architectures and world models are a promising direction that’s underexplored.\n\nThis work is obviously just a first step in a broader vision, but we’re excited to share this small milestone. Much work remains: trying out contrastive losses, alternative tokenization strategies, analysis of bias and fairness, and, of course, deployment of these foundation models: either independently (as done here), as a proxy reward in reinforcement learning (i.e. to tighten the feedback loop mentioned in the opening), or aligned to the latent space of an LLM (as done in CLIP).

    "fullText": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft, saying he deserves the \"wrongful gains\" that they received from his early support, according to a court filing ​on Friday.\n\nOpenAI gained between $65.5 billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's contributions when he was co-founding what ‌was then a startup from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion, Musk said in the federal court filing ahead of his trial ‌against the two companies.\n\n\"Without Elon Musk, there'd be no OpenAI. He provided the bulk of the seed funding, lent his reputation, and taught them all he knows about scaling a business. A pre-eminent expert quantified the value of that,\" Musk's lead trial lawyer Steven Molo said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment outside ⁠business hours on the amount of compensation ‌Musk is seeking.\n\nMICROSOFT AND OPENAI ALSO FILE SUITS\n\nDuring the week, OpenAI called the lawsuit \"baseless\" and part of a \"harassment\" campaign by Musk. A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence ‍that the company \"aided and abetted\" OpenAI.\n\nThe two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate filing on Friday.\n\nMusk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and runs xAI with its competitor chatbot Grok, alleges that ChatGPT operator OpenAI violated its founding mission in a high-profile ​restructuring to a for-profit entity.\n\nA judge in Oakland, California, ruled this month that a jury will hear the ‌trial, expected to start in April.\n\nMusk's filing says he contributed about $38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding, helped recruit staff, connect the founders with contacts and lend credibility to the project when it was created.\n\n\"Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor's initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned - and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much ⁠larger than Mr. Musk's initial contributions,\" Musk argues.\n\nThe filing says Musk's ​contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, ​financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.\n\nMusk may seek punitive damages and other penalties, including a possible injunction, if the jury finds either company liable, the filing says, without specifying what form any ‍injunction might take.\n\nIn their own ⁠filing, OpenAI and Microsoft asked the judge to limit what Musk's expert may present to jurors, arguing his analysis should be excluded as \"made up,\" \"unverifiable\" and \"unprecedented\" and as seeking an \"implausible\" transfer of billions from a nonprofit ⁠to a former donor-turned-competitor.",

    "fullText": "Progress of artificial general intelligence could stall, which may lead to a financial crash, says Yoshua Bengio, one of the ‘godfathers’ of modern AI\n\nWill the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) lead us to a land of financial plenty – or will it end in a 2008-style bust? Trillions of dollars rest on the answer.\n\nThe figures are staggering: an estimated $2.9tn (£2.2tn) being spent on datacentres, the central nervous systems of AI tools; the more than $4tn stock market capitalisation of Nvidia, the company that makes the chips powering cutting-edge AI systems; and the $100m signing-on bonuses offered by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to top engineers at OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nThese sky-high numbers are all propped up by investors who expect a return on their trillions. AGI, a theoretical state of AI where systems gain human levels of intelligence across an array of tasks and are able to replace humans in white-collar jobs such as accountancy and law, is a keystone of this financial promise.\n\nIt offers the prospect of computer systems carrying out profitable work without the associated cost of human labour – a hugely lucrative scenario for companies developing the technology and the customers who deploy it.\n\nThere will be consequences if AI companies fall short: US stock markets, boosted heavily by the performance of tech stocks, could fall and cause damage to people’s personal wealth; debt markets wrapped up in the datacentre boom could suffer a jolt that ripples elsewhere; GDP growth in the US, which has benefited from the AI infrastructure, could falter, which would have knock-on effects for interlinked economies.\n\nDavid Cahn, a partner at one leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Sequoia Capital, says tech companies now have to deliver on AGI.\n\n“Nothing short of AGI will be enough to justify the investments now being proposed for the coming decade,” he wrote in a blog published in October.\n\nIt means there is a lot hanging on progress towards advanced AI, and the trillions being poured into infrastructure and R&D to achieve it. One of the “godfathers” of modern AI, Yoshua Bengio, says the progress of AGI could stall and the outcome would be bad for investors.\n\n“There is a clear possibility that we will hit a wall, that there’s some difficulty that we don’t foresee right now, and we don’t find any solution quickly,” he says. “And that could be a real [financial] crash. A lot of the people who are putting trillions right now into AI are also expecting the advances to continue fairly regularly at the current pace.”\n\nBut Bengio, a prominent voice on the safety implications of AGI, is clear that continued progress towards a highly advanced state of AI is the more likely endgame.\n\n“Advances stalling is a minority scenario, like it’s an unlikely scenario. The more likely scenario is we continue to move forward,” he says.\n\nThe pessimistic view is that investors are backing an unrealistic outcome – that AGI will not happen without further breakthroughs.\n\nDavid Bader, the director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, says trillions of dollars are being spent on scaling up – tech jargon for growing something quickly – the underlying technology for chatbots, known as transformers, in the expectation that increasing the amount of computing power behind current AI systems, by building more datacentres, will suffice.\n\n“If AGI requires a fundamentally different approach, perhaps something we haven’t yet conceived, then we’re optimising an architecture that can’t get us there no matter how large we make it. It’s like trying to reach the moon by building taller ladders,” he says.\n\nNonetheless, big US tech companies such as Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are ploughing ahead with datacentre plans with the financial cushion of being able to fund their AGI ambitions through the cash generated by their hugely profitable day-to-day businesses. This at least gives them some protection if the wall outlined by Bengio and Bader comes into view.\n\nBut there are other more worrying aspects to the boom. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimate that $2.9tn will be spent on datacentres between now and 2028, with half of that covered by the cashflow from “hyperscalers” such as Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nThe rest will have to be covered by alternative sources such as private credit, a corner of the shadow banking sector that is activating alarm bells at the Bank of England and elsewhere. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has borrowed $29bn from the private credit market to finance a datacentre in Louisiana.\n\nAI-related sectors account for approximately 15% of investment grade debt in the US, which is even bigger than the banking sector, according to the investment bank JP Morgan.\n\nOracle, which has signed a $300bn datacentre deal with OpenAI, has had an increase in credit default swaps, which are a form of insurance on a company defaulting on its debts. High-yield, or “junk debt”, which represents the higher-risk end of the borrowing market, is also appearing in the AI sector via datacentre operators CoreWeave and TeraWulf. Growth is also being funded by asset-backed securities – a form of debt underpinned by assets such as loans or credit card debt, but in this case rent paid by tech companies to datacentre owners – in a form of financing that has risen sharply in recent years.\n\nIt is no wonder that JP Morgan says the AI infrastructure boom will require a contribution from all corners of the credit market.\n\nBader says: “If AGI doesn’t materialise on expected timelines, we could see contagion across multiple debt markets simultaneously – investment-grade bonds, high-yield junk debt, private credit and securitised products – all of which are being tapped to fund this buildout.”\n\nShare prices linked to AI and tech are also playing an outsized role in US stock markets. The so-called “magnificent 7” of US tech stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia – account for more than a third of the value of the S&P 500 index, the biggest stock market index in the US, compared with 20% at the start of the decade.\n\nIn October the Bank of England warned of “the risk of a sharp correction” in US and UK markets due to giddy valuations of AI-linked tech companies. Central bankers are concerned stock markets could slump if AI fails to reach the transformative heights investors are hoping for. At the same time the International Monetary Fund said valuations were heading towards dotcom bubble-levels.\n\nEven tech execs whose companies are benefiting from the boom are acknowledging the speculative nature of the frenzy. In November Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said there are “elements of irrationality” in the boom and that “no company is going to be immune” if the bubble bursts, while Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has said the AI industry is in a “kind of industrial bubble”, and OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said “there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.”\n\nAll three, to be clear, are AI optimists and expect the technology to keep improving and benefit society.\n\nBut when the numbers get this big there are obvious risks in a bubble bursting, as Pichai admits. Pension funds and anyone invested in the stock market will be affected by a share price collapse, while the debt markets will also take a hit. There is also a web of “circular” deals, such as OpenAI paying Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares. If these transactions unravel due to a lack of take-up of AI, or that wall being hit, then it could be messy.\n\nThere are also optimists who argue that generative AI, the catch-all term for tools such as chatbots and video generators, will transform whole industries and justify the expenditure. Benedict Evans, a technology analyst, says the expenditure numbers are not outrageous in the context of other industries, such as oil and gas extraction which runs at $600bn a year.\n\n“These AI capex figures are a lot of money but it’s not an impossible amount of money,” he says.\n\nEvans adds: “You don’t have to believe in AGI to believe that generative AI is a big thing. And most of what is happening here is not, ‘oh wow they’re going to create God’. It’s ‘this is going to completely change how advertising, search, software and social networks – and everything else our business is based on – is going to work’. It’s going to be a huge opportunity.”\n\nNonetheless, there is a multitrillion dollar expectation that AGI will be achieved. For many experts, the consequences of getting there are alarming. The cost of not getting there could also be significant.",

    "fullText": "Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills aim to knock off the AFC’s top seed Saturday afternoon, facing the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.\n\nThe Broncos are -1.5 betting favorites at the best NFL betting sites.\n\nBelow, we will look at NFL player props for all of the top offensive players for the Bills and Broncos.\n\nOur computer projects big statistical games from James Cook, Khalil Shakir, Courtland Sutton, and Evan Engram.\n\nAllen Under 211.5 passing yards <<-110>>\n\nNix Over 210.5 passing yards <<-114>>\n\nCook Over 73.5 rushing yards <<-114>>\n\nHarvey Under 56.6 rushing yards <<-110>>\n\nShakir Over 49.5 receiving yards <<-110>>\n\nSutton Over 49.5 receiving yards <<-111>>\n\nKincaid Over 35.5 receiving yards <<-108>>\n\nEngram Over 20.5 receiving yards <<-110>>\n\nMake your postseason bets at FanDuel, America's No. 1 sportsbook! \n\nSportsbooks are giving Denver’s pass defense a ton of respect, but I’m not convinced it’s entirely warranted.\n\nThe Broncos looked like world-beaters against the likes of Trey Lance, Chris Oladokun, and Geno Smith, holding all three under 200 passing yards.\n\nWhen facing competent quarterbacks, however, yardage told a different story: Trevor Lawrence threw for 279 yards against Denver on Dec. 21, Jordan Love passed for 276 yards on Dec. 14, and even Marcus Mariota managed 294 yards through the air on Nov. 30.\n\nJosh Allen, a level or two above all of those QBs, showed last week that he can still rack up yardage, completing 28-of-35 passes for 273 yards against Jacksonville.\n\nI’ll start by disagreeing with the computer and take the Allen Over.\n\nCook has had an outstanding season, but this number feels a little too high against an excellent Denver front.\n\nSince Thanksgiving, the Broncos haven’t allowed a single running back to surpass 73.5 rushing yards. I expect Buffalo to focus on beating Denver through the air rather than on the ground, which likely limits Cook’s opportunities.\n\nI’ll disagree with the computer here and take the Under on Cook.\n\nThe Bills’ receiving corps has been decimated by injury, with both Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers tearing ACLs against Jacksonville.\n\nAs a result, all of Buffalo’s wide receivers should see increased targets. We already saw a sign of this last week: Shakir was targeted a season-high 12 times by Allen against the Jaguars, responding with 82 receiving yards.\n\nI’ll ride with the computer and take the Shakir Over.\n\nProjection: 37.1 receiving yards\n\nIn last year’s postseason matchup between the Bills and Broncos, Dalton Kincaid had 47 receiving yards.\n\nAllen’s trust in him has only grown this season, with the tight end averaging 43.5 receiving yards per game since the start of November.\n\nI’m on the side of our AI here. Take the Over.\n\nPredictions for every NFL Divisional Round game\n\nProjection: 218.0 passing yards\n\nA major reason the Broncos were non-competitive in last year’s 31-7 playoff loss to Buffalo was that Sean Payton didn’t trust Nix. The quarterback threw a season-low 22 passes in that game.\n\nFor context, Buffalo allowed Trevor Lawrence to pass for 207 yards last weekend. During the regular season, Denver’s passing output per game (223.9 yards) was nearly identical to Jacksonville’s (222.3).\n\nBecause I believe Payton will let Nix chuck it at least 30 times in this one, I like the Over (slightly). The computer and I agree.\n\nThis number is extremely high for Javonte Harvey, even against Buffalo’s porous run defense. Harvey became Denver’s lead back after Nov. 6, when JK Dobbins went down with an injury.\n\nIn the seven games since, he’s gone Over this number just twice.\n\nMeanwhile, coach Sean Payton has been giving more carries to 5-foot-7 back Jaleel McLaughlin. McLaughlin posted a season-high seven carries on Christmas against Kansas City, then added six carries for 41 yards on Jan. 4 against the Chargers.\n\nI’ll take the Harvey Under here, as will my computer pal.\n\nThe Broncos’ best win in the second half of the regular season came in a 34-26 victory over the Packers at Mile High. In that game, Nix targeted Sutton 10 times, and the receiver finished with 113 yards.\n\nBuffalo’s pass defense is impressive, but it’s not immune to big performances. Last week, Parker Washington racked up 107 yards, Tee Higgins had 92, Jaylen Waddle posted 84, and Stefon Diggs went for a whopping 146 yards against the Bills.\n\nI like Nix to target Sutton a ton, and the number is pretty low. The computer and I like the value on the Over.\n\nProjection: 25.2 receiving yards\n\nThe Bills do a tremendous job against opposing tight ends, allowing just 29.6 yards per game to the position during the regular season. In big games, they’ve been even more dominant.\n\nSince the start of December, Buffalo’s two biggest wins came against New England on Dec. 14 and Jacksonville in last week’s playoff matchup.\n\nThe Bills held Hunter Henry to just one catch for 18 yards against the Patriots and limited Brenton Strange to a season-low nine receiving yards versus the Jaguars.\n\nI’ll agree with the computer and take the Over.\n\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "description": "The CEO of a digital economy think tank said relying on identical AI tools can erode competitive edge and weaken firms' independence.",
    "fullText": "As companies rush to adopt AI to boost productivity and cut costs, they may be setting themselves up for a new problem: losing what makes them different.\n\nMehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, said widespread reliance on the same AI tools risks flattening competitive advantage across industries, because firms increasingly rely on identical systems to think, write, and decide for them.\n\nParyavi said that as AI tools become cheaper, more powerful, and more widely deployed, companies risk outsourcing the very thinking that once differentiated them.\n\nWhile AI can boost efficiency in the short term, he said, relying on shared models and standardized systems could leave businesses competing on cost and speed alone — eroding originality, strategic depth, and long-term advantage.\n\n\"If you and your competitor are all using the same service, you have no edge over each other,\" Paryavi told Business Insider.\n\n\"Their AI and your AI against each other — I don't know who's going to win.\"\n\nAs generative AI becomes embedded across workplaces, Paryavi warned that the biggest risk isn't automation — it's uniformity.\n\nWhen companies rely on the same large language models trained on the same data, decision-making, writing, and problem-solving can start to converge, shrinking the space for creative divergence.\n\nThat concern echoes warnings from researchers and academics who say AI can produce polished output at scale, but also flips human thinking by delivering fluent answers before understanding, creating an illusion of expertise that weakens judgment and depth.\n\nWhen everyone relies on the same models trained on the same data, Paryavi said, creative divergence shrinks.\n\n\"The beauty of our world is that we have different choices because we think differently,\" he said. \"That's where innovation comes from.\"\n\nIt's not just a question of companies all thinking the same — Paryavi warned that treating AI as a shortcut to efficiency can quietly hollow out human judgment, expertise, and control, leaving businesses faster in the short term but more fragile over time.\n\nOver time, Paryavi said, that shift can erode internal expertise and decision-making capacity.\n\n\"What they don't think about is that initially it might sound more efficient and more productive and cheaper,\" he said. \"But this is going to be very expensive down the line.\"\n\nOne risk, Paryavi said, is dependency. As firms replace employees with AI subscriptions, they become increasingly reliant on external vendors to function effectively.\n\nParyavi compared the AI boom to the early 2000s rush to cloud computing, when many companies initially adopted third-party infrastructure but later repatriated workloads in-house as costs, complexity, and vendor lock-in became concerns — a trend commonly referred to in tech as cloud repatriation.\n\nThe same dynamic could play out with AI, Paryavi said — except with even higher stakes. As companies downsize human teams, they also lose institutional knowledge and the ability to operate without automation, he said.\n\n\"You've killed all your chances of ever becoming independent as an organization,\" he said. \"You've fired your manpower. You've made them no good.\"\n\nAI, he said, is not inherently harmful. In fields such as medicine, scientific research, and disaster prediction, it can significantly accelerate progress.\n\nBut without clear guardrails, companies risk trading long-term resilience for short-term speed.\n\n\"It's a very powerful tool,\" Paryavi said, comparing AI to an atomic bomb. \"If that [an atomic bomb] can eliminate an entire population physically, this [AI] can eliminate humanity cognitively.\"",

    "description": "From JPMorgan to Citi, here's what industry leaders at are saying about how AI may impact jobs.",
    "fullText": "As banks reported earnings this week, CEOs dropped more insight into how generative AI could boost productivity, replace some roles, and keep head count from growing.\n\nBanks, many of which became bloated during the frenzied deal boom of the pandemic, have been slimming down their ranks over the last few years. It's becoming clearer that, despite dealmaking making a comeback, executives are signaling they want to do more with fewer people, leaning on AI to boost productivity and absorb additional work.\n\nWe've highlighted some of the most revealing comments from bank CEOs and CFOs on head count and AI.\n\nJamie Dimon has stuck to his trademark bluntness when talking about AI and jobs.\n\n\"It will eliminate jobs,\" Dimon said at a Fortune conference in December. \"People should stop sticking their heads in the sand.\"\n\nIn the near term, Dimon said in an interview with CNN that JPMorgan's head count remains steady, or even rises, as AI continues to roll out — if the bank does a \"good job.\"\n\nThe bigger promise is efficiency. \"It will affect every job,\" Dimon said at a 2024 Alliance Bernstein conference, describing a future where AI handles tasks like note-taking and summarization at the push of a button.\n\nThat efficiency could still mean more hiring in areas like cybersecurity, where Dimon says banks will need AI to counter increasingly sophisticated fraud.\n\nCFO Jeremy Barnum said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that the bank is allowing for some additional hiring in technology \"at the margin.\"\n\nOn that same call, however, Barnum said that, generally speaking, they \"want to make sure that when someone needs to get something done, whether it's in technology or elsewhere, their first reaction is not, 'Hire more people.'\" \n\nHe has previously said JPMorgan is asking people to \"resist head count growth where possible\" and focus instead on efficiency.\n\nThe head of JPMorgan's consumer business, Marianne Lake, has said operations staff could be 40% to 50% more productive over the next five years — a shift she said would lead to slower net head count growth, as each employee can handle far more work through automation, digital assistants, and self-service tools.\n\nDavid Solomon's most definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman came in a memo he released in 2025 alongside the firm's president, John Waldron, and CFO Denis Coleman.\n\nThe memo, announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS, said that AI will drive efficiency at the firm, which will mean slowing hiring and reducing roles. (Goldman, with its yearly culling of some employees, is no stranger to job cuts.)\n\n\"We will constrain head count growth through the end of the year, in addition to a limited reduction in roles across the firm,\" the memo read. \"These targeted steps are consistent with our priorities of gaining more agility and creating the right team structures in order to implement effective AI solutions.\"\n\nDuring the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday, Solomon said that the firm plans to use AI to both cut costs and \"free up capacity to invest in other areas.\"\n\nSlowing hiring and increasing head count don't need to be contradictory; instead, Solomon has said the firm is focusing its hiring on the right talent.\n\n\"We need more high-value people,\" he told Axios in October. \"We can afford more high-value people to expand our footprint and continue to grow and broaden our business.\"\n\nHe has said he continues to believe that AI will grow the firm's head count over the next 10 years.\n\n\"There are obviously things where we're going to have a lot fewer people — but I'd love to have the capacity to go get more people to spend time with clients,\" Solomon said at a conference in 2025, noting that AI will have its most immediate impact on software development.\n\nCiti is in the midst of a multi-year turnaround led by the bank's CEO, Jane Fraser, to save roughly $2.5 billion and cut around 20,000 jobs.\n\nIn a memo sent to Citi's more than 200,000 employees on Wednesday, Fraser said she will \"expect to see the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away, and a more disciplined, more confident, winning Citi fully emerge in 2026.\"\n\nFraser said in the memo that, with AI and automation, some jobs will change, some will emerge, and \"others will no longer be required.\"\n\nDuring a media briefing ahead of the firm's fourth-quarter earnings call, Mark Mason, the outgoing CFO, said he expects head count to continue trending down \"as we continue to improve productivity and tools like AI.\"\n\nFraser has previously explained how AI was already increasing productivity.\n\n\"AI-driven automated code reviews have exceeded 1 million so far this year and are dramatically improving our developers' productivity,\" she said during the bank's 2025 third-quarter earnings call. \"This innovation alone saves considerable time and creates around 100,000 hours of weekly capacity.\"\n\nThe CEO also highlighted how AI is helping Citi's customer service teams resolve client inquiries faster, its wealth advisors provide more personalized advice, and the firm's plan to launch an agent-based AI pilot to tackle more complex tasks.\n\nWells Fargo has already shrunk its head count more than 25% since the second quarter of 2020, CEO Charles Scharf said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. He said that efficiency remains an \"ongoing focus\" for Wells Fargo.\n\nIn November, he told Reuters that the bank will likely \"have less head count as we look forward.\" He said the lower head count is an \"outcome\" of the firm's focus on areas where it's \"way too inefficient\" and \"way too bureaucratic.\" From 2018 to June of this year, the firm had an asset cap of $1.95 trillion, hindering its ability to grow.\n\nIn the same interview, Scharf called out those who are saying that AI won't reduce jobs.\n\n\"The opportunities that exist in AI are very significant, and anyone who sits here today and says that they don't think they'll have less head count because of AI either doesn't know what they're talking about or is just not being totally honest about it,\" he said.\n\nFollowing up on those comments in early December, Scharf clarified that most people know head count will dip, \"but they're afraid to say it, because no one wants to stand up and say that we should have — we're going to have lower head count in the future. It's a difficult thing to say.\"\n\nHe said that generative AI tools have already made Wells Fargo's engineers 30% to 35% more productive. While the bank hasn't cut coding jobs yet, the technology will eventually allow it to do more with fewer people across various functions, including compliance and legal, as well as call centers and even banking teams.\n\nBank of America has set a new industry standard, with a minimum wage of $25 an hour across the company. And while CEO Brian Moynihan conceded on a September 2025 Bloomberg TV interview that generative AI adoption has shrunk the size of some departments, the bank is focusing on training employees to do what LLMs cannot.\n\n\"The key to that is really redeploying people and re-skilling them,\" he said. \"We have to be more mindful about training them along multiple dimensions than we might have been two or three years ago.\"\n\nOn the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, Moynihan teased how AI might make some tasks obsolete, though, saying that the bank has 18,000 people on the payroll who code.\n\n\"Using the AI techniques, we've taken 30% out of the coding part of the stream of introducing a new product,\" he said. \"That saves us about 2,000 people. So that's how we're applying it.\"\n\nAt the Goldman financial services conference in 2025, Moynihan said the bank is managing flat overall staffing levels by redeploying employees rather than hiring more, with AI playing a central role in absorbing the additional workload. He pointed to Erica, Bank of America's consumer-facing AI assistant, as a clear example of how that is playing out in practice.\n\nIn November, Moynihan said that the bank had 1.4 billion digital connections with its customers: \"We think it saves, today, about 11,000 FT equivalents.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick didn't explicitly address how AI is impacting head count during the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call, but said \"there is no more time to waste\" when it comes to the technology.\n\nThe firm's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, mentioned a specific operations example where the firm has outsourced some work to AI: \"We used to have two teams necessarily checking each other on different documentation to make sure things are right. We now have one human team and one AI team.\"",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is turning to the court of public opinion as it wages a legal battle with Elon Musk.\n\nWhile Musk and OpenAI prepare to head to a high-stakes jury trial in April, the two are duking it out online over what exactly happened when Musk split ways with the AI startup he helped cofound.\n\nMusk has been using recently unsealed court documents to attack his rival in posts on his social media platform, X. On Friday, OpenAI published a blog titled \"The truth Elon left out.\"\n\nThe blog, which provided commentary alongside excerpts from several court documents, alleges that Musk wanted \"full control\" of OpenAI, \"since he'd been burned by not having it in the past,\" and that OpenAI's leadership was surprised when Musk suggested having his kids control AGI or artificial general intelligence during conversations about succession planning.\n\nThe statements are aimed at the heart of Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI.\n\nMusk is suing OpenAI's key leaders, including CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, over allegations that the AI company misled him by shifting away from its core mission to remain a nonprofit. Musk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was a nonprofit.\n\nThe startup, since its 2015 founding, operated as a nonprofit-controlled organization with a for-profit operating arm. It completed its transition to a for-profit public benefit corporation in October 2025.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLast Tuesday, more than 100 documents related to the suit were unsealed, including diary entries from Brockman, which were obtained during the discovery process.\n\nIn one of the entries that was highlighted, Brockman appeared to write about his misgivings about pushing Musk out of OpenAI and committing to a nonprofit-only entity.\n\n\"Cannot say that we are committed to the non-profit,\" the entry from the court documents said. \"Don't want to say that we're committed. If three months later we're doing b-corp then it was a lie.\"\n\nIt was Brockman's diary entries that US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers cited in a recent ruling, in which she determined Musk had enough evidence that he'd been misled to take the case to trial.",

    "fullText": "Jan 16 (Reuters) - A study by AI risk management platform Alethea into the surge in artificial intelligence-generated fake content, dubbed \"AI slop,\" has warned sports teams, leagues and fans of the risks posed by increasingly sophisticated digital misinformation.\n\nRetired NFL player Jason Kelce never said ​2026 Super Bowl halftime singer Bad Bunny's critics were \"a bad fit for America's future\".\n\nSan Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle never ranted about slain ‌conservative activist Charlie Kirk and politics in football.\n\nHowever, thousands of people believed they did and that is the problem.\n\n\"Teams and players are suddenly being accused of things that are completely fabricated,\" Lisa Kaplan, ‌founder and CEO of Alethea, told Reuters on Friday, adding that the evolution of AI tools has made fake news a more daunting challenge.\n\n\"Content now looks real and is produced at a volume that makes it hard for the average person to determine if it's authentic,\" she said.\n\n\"Before, fake news often relied on human labour to repetitively copy and paste content. Today, AI can impersonate brands and create engaging images that mimic genuine announcements.\"\n\nKaplan noted that this wave of AI-generated misinformation has disrupted the traditional monetisation ⁠model of sports media. \"These networks drive engagement to questionable websites, ‌skew advertising metrics, and can even create scenarios that could manipulate betting markets,\" she added.\n\nC Shawn Eib, Alethea's Head of Investigations, described how these networks use tactics such as making multiple disjointed announcements, like the conflicting claims that former Baltimore Ravens coach ‍John Harbaugh had been hired by multiple teams at the same time.\n\n\"When a single figure appears to be linked with several teams at the same time, it quickly becomes clear that an AI system is behind the creation of these images,\" Eib explained.\n\nAI DECEPTION CAN EXPLOIT 'RAGE BAIT'\n\nThe content follows a formula: fake game updates, nonexistent celebrity feuds, manufactured scandals, and politicised ​quotes falsely attributed to star players.\n\nThe fabricated Kelce and Kittle quotes are prime examples. Both NFL stars publicly denied making comments they never said after the ‌posts went viral.\n\n\"If fans, players and even entire franchises fall prey to these manipulated narratives, it risks damaging reputations, undermining trust and even politicising sport,\" Alethea's VP of Communications Kaila Ryan said.\n\n\"Sports organisations need to proactively manage their brands and digital safety. It is crucial for teams and leagues to start monitoring these risks, work together across communications, legal and security teams, and educate fans to verify announcements from official channels,\" she added.\n\nThe business impact extends beyond reputational harm.\n\nThese networks siphon ad revenue from legitimate sports media and distort audience metrics. Some outbound links have been flagged for phishing and malicious redirects, presenting real fraud risk to fans.\n\nThe problem ⁠is not limited to the NFL. Alethea discovered similar operations targeting the NBA, WNBA, MLB, NHL, ​NASCAR, Formula 1, IndyCar and professional tennis.\n\nKaplan added that beyond monetisation, sport remains a rare cultural ​touchpoint that unites people, making them attractive targets for influence operations, and she pointed to Russia's alleged exploitation of then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's 2018 'Take a Knee' protest as a precedent.\n\nIn a 2019 report, the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed that Russian trolls had focused heavily ‍on the kneeling debate as part of ⁠a broader effort to stoke racial tensions and divide the U.S. following the 2016 election.\n\n\"Kaepernick's protests were exploited for a purpose that had nothing to do with sport. Instead, it's a way of leveraging a cultural touchstone and turning it into something that polarises people,\" said Kaplan.\n\n\"Teams need to ⁠work in unison to defend their identities and protect their fans from falling victim to fraud or manipulation,\" she added, noting that the best advice for fans is to be vigilant.\n\n\"Verify breaking news ‌through official team channels, don't click links in suspicious page comments and remember that outrage is often the product, not the by-product, ‌of what you're seeing\".",

    "title": "I trained a GPT to think like Steve Jobs and help me run my company. AI is scary, but it's also my biggest tool.",
    "description": "Solopreneur Yesim Saydan shares how she trained over 17 custom GPT workers and a Steve Jobs—inspired custom GPT to work for her consultancy agency.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yesim Saydan, a branding and communication expert in her early 50s, based in the Netherlands. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I'm stuck on a business decision or need to come up with a creative idea or strategy, brainstorming usually starts with my Steve Jobs custom GPT.\n\nMy solo-consultancy business helps senior executives and established entrepreneurs grow their authority and influence through social media and brand strategies. But scaling that work on my own was challenging.\n\nBefore AI, if I wanted to scale the number of clients I could take on, my main option was hiring freelancers for special projects or tasks. I spent a lot of unnecessary time training the freelancers on my specific framework, and it often felt like they didn't care as much as I did.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched custom GPTs, everything changed. I used the feature to create over 17 custom GPTs to build my team. Then I thought of my ideal mentors and created custom GPTs of them.\n\nOne of my first jobs was at Citibank as a project manager on Wall Street, following my move to the US from Turkey for my MBA. That kicked off my 14-year corporate career, during which I worked in New York, Paris, and the Netherlands.\n\nI started my business about a decade ago because I wanted more flexibility in my work schedule. At the time, social media was just starting to take off, and I saw a clear opportunity.\n\nI'd played with AI tools before, but OpenAI's custom GPTs changed the game. Initially, I envisioned creating my ideal four-person team of agents. I quickly realized AI produces subpar results when it's overloaded with too many tasks.\n\nInstead, I created a custom GPT for each important task I wanted the AI to perform. That's how I ended up with more than 17 custom GPTs making up what feels like my perfect team.\n\nI can create a custom GPT in five or 10 minutes, but what actually makes it powerful is the training process. I create standard operating procedure documents for each task and client, serving as training materials for my agents that outline my methodology and frameworks.\n\nI have client-specific AI agents trained on each major client's tone, goals, and past conversations, so I'm never starting from scratch with a task. The training is ongoing. Every time I make a query or upload a document, the agent improves, just like a real employee would.\n\nWhen I need to communicate or create content in a client's tone of voice, the draft I end up with is so tailored that it feels like I spent hours perfecting it, when in fact my AI team handled it.\n\nI've trained a market researcher, a sales call analyst, a proposal writer, a video scriptwriter, and even a custom GPT to evaluate LinkedIn profiles using six pillars to determine if the current LinkedIn presence builds authority, attracts their ideal client, and establishes trust, clarity, and uniqueness. These free me up to focus on big-picture strategy.\n\nAfter creating my ideal employees, I asked myself which mentors I would love to have alive or dead. Steve Jobs is known for his creativity and innovation, and there are numerous videos already online about him; he's the perfect mentor to create a custom GPT for.\n\nIn the instructions, I started with things like, \"you are Steve Jobs, you have decades of experience in X, Y, Z, your most important skill is creativity, innovation, thinking out of the box.\"\n\nThere are two types of video transcripts I trained it on. I uploaded transcripts from videos where he explains his strategies and what he looks for in products. The second approach was training through examples. I found videos showing how he launched products like the iPhone or iPad, so the AI learns from both his thought process and his execution of those launches.\n\nTo get it to the level it is now, I spent roughly 40 hours researching and building training assets, including PDFs and other materials the GPT can use as references. I continue adding more whenever I find relevant material, and I now have custom GPTs for Dan Kennedy and Elon Musk as well.\n\nThe frustrating part with training AI models is that I can give it a lot of information that's required to have the superpowers of Steve Jobs, but then the AI could take that and produce a lot of different things.\n\nWhen I prompt it, I avoid asking questions like \"What do you think of this idea?\" because the AI usually wants to agree with me and please me. Instead, I ask, \"On a scale from one to 10, how good is this idea?\"\n\nIt's not going to say the idea is bad, but now it might tell me it's a five. Then I'll ask, \"OK, what would make it a 10?\"\n\nThat's usually when it starts drawing on the experience of Steve Jobs that I've trained it with. We can go back and forth until I get the most useful and honest feedback possible.\n\nIt depends on the task. For more strategic outputs, I usually go through three to five rounds of refinement.\n\nWhen a product like NotebookLM was introduced, I started thinking, \"Oh my God, this is going to make the entire human race obsolete.\" I find AI products fascinating at first, but they can really scare me.\n\nI truly believe we don't know what the world will look like even a year from now. Sometimes I literally freeze thinking about the impacts, and if everyone will end up homeless, but I usually try to remind myself I'm not God or a higher power, and I don't know what will happen. This calms me down.\n\nI also realized that AI, by itself, is powerful, but what makes it truly magical is when we combine our expertise and skills with it. Using custom agents as an extension of our brain, rather than a replacement, is what really produces great output.\n\nThere's no turning back from it.",

Now, OpenAI is following suit.\n\nThe AI pioneer announced that ads are coming to ChatGPT — less than two years after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman portrayed them as \"a last resort.\"\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nAltman's softened stance since then underlines the massive change OpenAI has undergone in the last two years, and the company's embrace of advertising is a testament to just how expensive the AI race has become.\n\nIn June, the OpenAI CEO said he wasn't \"totally against\" ads, he just wanted to make sure OpenAI got the balance correct.\n\n\"We haven't done any advertising product yet. I kind of...I mean, I'm not totally against it,\" Altman said on OpenAI's podcast. \"I can point to areas where I like ads. I think ads on Instagram, kinda cool. I bought a bunch of stuff from them. But I am, like, I think it'd be very hard to — I mean, take a lot of care to get right.\"\n\nIn October, Altman expressed a desire to make sure the company went about ads in the proper manner when asked about OpenAI's past criticisms that other tech companies made addictive products.\n\n\"We're definitely worried about this,\" Altman said in response to a question that expressed concern about the similarities of Sora, OpenAI's AI video app, and TikTok and the potential of ads. \"I worry about it, not just for things like Sora and TikTok and ads in ChatGPT, which are maybe known problems that we can design carefully.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Altman, former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo (who OpenAI hired as its CEO of applications in early 2025), and seemingly every other member of the company's C-suite have expressed an almost insatiable demand for more compute in interviews.\n\nIt's proven a costly endeavor. OpenAI now has roughly $1.4 trillion in spending commitments on data centers and related infrastructure, raising questions about how it plans to pay the bills without the benefit of the advertising businesses of its Big Tech competitors, like Google and Meta.\n\nOpenAI also completed its restructuring into a more traditional for-profit, a move Altman said was designed to make it easier to attract future investments.\n\nAs part of the announcement, OpenAI said that free and Go users of the popular AI chatbot would start seeing ads being tested \"in the coming weeks.\"\n\nSharing details on the planned test, OpenAI said that ChatGPT's results \"will not be influenced by ads,\" the ads will be clearly labeled, and chatbot conversations will remain private and not shared with advertisers.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we plan to start testing ads in ChatGPT free and Go tiers.\n\nWe’re sharing our principles early on how we’ll approach ads–guided by putting user trust and transparency first as we work to make AI accessible to everyone.\n\nWhat matters most:\n- Responses in… pic.twitter.com/3UQJsdriYR\n\nPaid users of OpenAI's Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans won't see the ads, the company said.\n\nSimo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, who has previously spoken about her desire to get the ads balance correctly, wrote on X that the most important factor was \"ads will not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you.\"\n\nWhile Instacart launched ads during Simo's time leading the company, she has said OpenAI's approach would look different.\n\n\"If we ever were to do anything, it would have to be a very different model than what has been done before,\" she said. \"What I've learned from building ad platforms is that the thing people don't like about ads very often is not the ads themselves, it's the use of the data behind the ads.\"",

    "description": "Apple once set the bar for suppliers including TSMC. Now it's being unseated by Nvidia and AI cloud giants.",
    "fullText": "For over a decade, Apple sat at the center of the tech supply chain. Its enormous scale let it dictate pricing, lock up capacity, and steer the roadmaps of suppliers that made everything from chips and memory to substrates and packaging. That era is ending.\n\n\"Apple is no longer the gravitational center of the hardware universe,\" said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology, who tracks the industry's supply chain.\n\n\"Apple still moves huge volumes and has unmatched brand strength. But the company is no longer the anchor client for fabs, substrate makers, or key component suppliers. That's a fundamental change.\"\n\nThis is important because the tech companies that control the supply chain are more likely to win. When you can order the largest amount of a key component, you get better pricing and a more reliable supply. That results in better-priced products that are available sooner than your rivals. This power is now shifting toward AI giants, including Nvidia and huge cloud players such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (aka \"AMG\").\n\nThe most visible sign is at TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker. It's famous for churning out cutting-edge iPhone chips, which gave Apple a huge advantage over other consumer hardware players.\n\nWhen TSMC reported results this week, it became very clear that its smartphone business is no longer its most important segment. High-performance computing — a category dominated by AI chips for companies like Nvidia and hyperscale cloud providers — now accounts for roughly 58% of TSMC's revenue, far surpassing smartphone processors.\n\nTSMC makes chips for Nvidia's AI servers, which are being snapped up in huge volumes by the cloud giants. They pack this gear into huge data centers that train and run AI models to power new services such as ChatGPT. Is that a better business than making iPhone chips?\n\nTSMC's CEO C.C. Wei answered that. He's been talking to these AI giants a lot lately. Here's what he said on this week's earnings call:\n\n\"They show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business. So they grow their business successfully and see the financial return. So I also double-checked their financial status. They are very rich.\"\n\nSuppliers go where the money is. Increasingly, the biggest Benjamins are coming from AI and cloud giants, not Apple.\n\nThis shift is rippling through the rest of the supply chain. Memory chip makers are reallocating capacity away from phones and PCs to feed AI data centers hungry for DRAM, dynamic random access memory. This is a common type of memory chip that's used in AI servers and iPhones.\n\nMemory prices have surged lately, and that's likely to push up smartphone costs and potentially squeeze margins. Nvidia has locked in long-term memory supply, leaving smartphone makers with less negotiating power.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, Apple's scale let it dictate component supply, pricing, and roadmaps,\" Gastwirth said. \"That leverage diminishes when suppliers earn higher margins and higher growth from AI customers than from smartphones.\"\n\nBottlenecks are emerging in unexpected places, too. A shortage of high-end glass cloth, a critical input for chip substrates, has suppliers prioritizing AI customers who pre-pay and sign multi-year contracts.\n\nApple, which uses these substrates across nearly all its products, is now competing with AI chipmakers for limited supply and even sending engineers to help smaller suppliers qualify alternative materials, according to a report this week from Nikkei.\n\nManufacturing partners are also re-prioritizing. Foxconn, once synonymous with iPhone assembly, now generates more revenue from AI servers than from consumer electronics. Its fastest-growing customers are hyperscalers and Nvidia, not Apple.\n\nNone of this makes Apple irrelevant. The company remains one of the world's largest buyers of components. However, in a supply chain increasingly shaped by AI, pricing, allocation, and capacity planning are being set elsewhere — and Apple is learning what it's like to be just another very large customer.\n\n\"In the 2010s, Apple set the pace for the supply chain,\" Gastwirth said. \"In the late 2020s, Nvidia, hyperscalers, and AI infrastructure now dictate pricing, allocation, and long‑term capacity planning.\"\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "ChatGPT says it's bringing ads to some US users. It might be annoying. But it also might be a good thing. (I know, I know. Hear me out!",
    "fullText": "All day, I see ads. Ads when I scroll social feeds, ads when I search Google, and ads on every website I go to. You're looking at some ads on this website right now (hopefully they aren't too annoying). I've lived to tell the tale — and so have you.\n\nOpenAI announced on Friday that it will start testing ads in ChatGPT for US users on its free and Go tiers, something that had been rumored for a while. If you're a brand or advertiser, this might be exciting news, but I think most of us who are merely ChatGPT users are not thrilled.\n\nThere are a few obvious problems here. But I think we can say \"eh\" to most of them.\n\nProblem 1: Ads can be annoying! I agree! But as previously mentioned, we are all used to seeing ads everywhere at all times. It's just the constant buzz of white noise in every online experience.\n\nBut, eh: Since OpenAI is first testing this as a freemium model, sure, you can get rid of the ads if you pay. We're already dealing with that in a ton of other services like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, and YouTube. I pay for all of those because I've decided the ads are annoying enough to pay extra to skip. (Actually, I don't pony up for ad-free Hulu. I made the calculation I don't watch it enough to make it worth it. On the other hand, I do play enough solitaire on my phone that I ponied up for the ad-free version.)\n\nProblem 2: It's a trust issue. Can we trust ChatGPT to give \"real\" answers rather than ads when we ask it to recommend a product or service, even if it's also running ads?\n\nBut, eh: I think people are already used to understanding things like Google search results with ads where there's a mix of organic and sponsored results. If I ask ChatGPT to help me revive my wilting monstera plant, and it shows me an ad for Miracle-Gro plant food at the bottom, will I be confused? Probably not because I've seen this kind of thing before on Google and social feeds. The mockups OpenAI shared flag to me pretty clearly what's an ad and what isn't.\n\nProblem 3: If ChatGPT is in the advertising biz, then it's subject to the pressures of brands and corporations that pay for those ads.\n\nBut, eh: OK, this one is actually real. Advertisers can and will exert pressure on platforms, broadcasters, publishers, and any other venues where their ads appear. They are powerful in that way!\n\nBut hear me out: This can actually have a kind of normalizing effect, in a positive way, especially when we're thinking about something like a huge AI company.\n\nConsider the case of an outlier event: In 2022, when Elon Musk first took over Twitter/X. Advertisers fled when the platform was deluged with hateful content, and it actually caused X to have to change its ways to woo them back. When we consider all the wildly terrifying things that a platform with immense global power like OpenAI can do, it's actually kind of a good thing to be hemmed in by the middle-of-the-road, safe values and standards of the Coca-Cola Company or other big, would-be US-based advertisers. It means you can't make your tech product so problematic that Walmart doesn't want to be associated with it.\n\nProblem 4: ChatGPT, a wonderful product that operated with a clean design, is now just another victim of enshittification!\n\nBut, eh: Buddy, if you're a huge fan of ChatGPT and the purity of the beautiful, human, internet, I don't know what to tell you. Do you also love swimming, but hate water? Pick a side!\n\nLook, am I excited to have one more place to be annoyed by ads? No. But I also feel like this isn't the worst thing to happen with AI — not even the worst thing this week. Although I would like to reserve the right to change my mind on this if it turns out to be really awful later down the line. Gotta hedge here.",

    "fullText": "Many young people are worried that AI is muscling in on the entry-level job market.\n\nDylan Field, the 34-year-old billionaire CEO of Figma, however, says AI gives young people an advantage in the hiring process.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on the \"In Good Company\" podcast, produced by Norges Bank Investment Management, Field said the effect of AI on hiring is a \"critical\" debate happening now in the software industry.\n\n\"Does AI mean that you should hire senior people or middle-level, or junior, or are all the jobs going to go away because AI will replace them all?\" Field asked. \"I've heard that last one a bunch of times, and it hasn't come true yet. All the people have said that. They continue to hire.\"\n\nField said that, in his opinion, young professionals have an advantage because they tend to have a better understanding of AI, an increasingly important skill.\n\n\"My bias actually is a lot more toward the junior folks, and I think people that are younger are AI native in a way that folks that are older have to learn,\" Field said.\n\nHe said Figma, which offers design products and services and competes directly with Adobe, has always hired a mix of ages, but that an understanding and passion for AI is a must going forward.\n\n\"I think that it is important that people come in, first of all, knowing that we're pushing full steam ahead into the AI era,\" Field said. \"So, if you have a bias against AI, that's a great dinner-table conversation between us, but we're very focused on making sure that we build for this AI age.\"\n\nYoung professionals are navigating a labor market bogged down in unemployment and uneven job growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics in December published its final 2025 jobs report, which showed that the job market has remained stagnant, economists said.\n\nThe rise of AI has only added to that instability. Many companies these days are betting that AI will be able to do many of the tasks of entry-level workers, and economists say that could lead them to pause hiring young professionals.\n\nField, however, doesn't share that outlook.\n\nDuring an October 2025 appearance on \"Lenny's Podcast,\" Field said he doesn't think AI will take human jobs at all.",

    "fullText": "Ads to be placed alongside answers as OpenAI looks to beef up revenue for flagship AI product\n\nChatGPT will start including advertisements beside answers for US users as OpenAI seeks a new revenue stream.\n\nThe ads will be tested first in ChatGPT for US users only, the company announced on Friday, after increasing speculation that the San Francisco firm would turn to a potential cashflow model on top of its current subscriptions.\n\nThe ads will start in the coming weeks and will be included above or below, rather than within, answers. Mock-ups circulated by the company show the ads in a tinted box. They will be served to adult users “when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation”, according to OpenAI’s announcement. Ads will not be shown to users under 18 and will not appear alongside answers related to sensitive topics such as health, mental health or politics. Users will be able to click to learn about why they received a particular ad, according to OpenAI.\n\nPreviously, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, expressed reluctance to introduce ads to the chatbot: “I kind of hate ads just as an aesthetic choice.” His company has made commitments to spend more than $1tn on infrastructure supporting AI in the coming years. Altman has said that revenues are running at well over $13bn a year.\n\n“Maybe there could be ads outside the [large language model] stream that are still really great, but the burden of proof there would have to be very high. And it would have to feel really useful to users and really clear that it was not messing with the model’s output,” Altman said recently. “I think it’d be very hard, we’d have to take a lot of care to get it right. People have a very high degree of trust in ChatGPT.”\n\nIn a blogpost on Friday, OpenAI attempted to reconcile Altman’s distaste for ads with the need for revenue: “Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong, and we believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone. Once we begin testing our first ad formats in the coming weeks and months, we look forward to getting people’s feedback.”\n\nThe company is also launching ChatGPT Go, which it bills as a low-cost subscription tier, for $8 a month.",

    "fullText": "How confident are you in AI? Enough to bet your retirement on it?\n\nThat's become a debate thanks to a bold proclamation by Elon Musk: Saving for retirement in 10 or 20 years \"won't matter.\"\n\nMusk's confidence comes from the work he's doing in artificial intelligence. The technological advancements will create an \"abundance\" of resources, granting everyone a \"universal high income,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said.\n\nThat's easy to say when you have checks notes and almost passes out nearly $700 billion in the bank. What about people whose net worths have a lot fewer zeros?\n\nA group of BI reporters reached out to seven personal finance and AI gurus to get their take. They all agreed you shouldn't stop those direct deposits into your 401(K).\n\nEven if AI increases productivity and reduces costs over time, it's not clear whether the benefits will be distributed evenly across the population.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans are already in a precarious position regarding their retirement. Last year, BI's Noah Sheidlower spoke to nearly 200 Americans who continue to work past the age of 80 as part of our \"80 over 80\" series.\n\nWhile some like the fact that they can still work, others don't have a choice. And that's with the benefit of Social Security, a safety net that might not exist in the future.\n\nYou can't completely discredit Musk's take, though.\n\nYes, forgoing retirement on the belief that AI and tech will just figure it out in a few decades is a massive gamble. But the past few years have reminded us that tech can quickly flip the script on conventional wisdom.\n\nFive years ago, a career as a computer programmer felt secure. Now … not so much.\n\nIt's not a new phenomenon. My colleague Alistair Barr recently wrote in his Tech Memo newsletter () that the US quickly went from having 25 million horses to fewer than two million thanks to the arrival of the steam engine.\n\nEven if Musk is right, you'll probably still want some extra pocket change. Money isn't just about being able to buy things. It's also about access and exclusivity, and it's not clear how that might work in this new utopia.\n\nIt's not just going to Disney World; it's being able to cut the lines. It's not just getting tickets to the game; it's sitting courtside.\n\nBut if everyone's got \"universal high income,\" how will those perks work? Will all of us be equal? Or maybe some of us will be more equal than others?",

He previously spent nine years at Amazon.\n\nWalmart US chief growth officer Seth Dallaire is expanding his role to lead global growth. Dallaire has been at Walmart for four years and previously served as Instacart's chief revenue officer and as a VP of ad sales at Amazon.\n\nElsewhere in the organization, Sam's Club CEO Chris Nicholas is set to take over Walmart's international division, following the departure of international CEO Kath McLay. Nicholas previously served as chief financial officer for the international division.\n\nUS chief merchandising officer Latriece Watkins will step into Nicholas's role as head of the warehouse club chain. Watkins started as an intern at Walmart in 1997.\n\n\"These leadership changes also mark a key step in how we organize for the future,\" Furner said in his statement. \"As AI rapidly reshapes retail, we are centralizing our platforms to accelerate shared capabilities, freeing up our operating segments to be more focused on and closer to our customers and members.\"",

Roughly 10% to 15% of Reality Labs' 15,000 employees are expected to be laid off, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe metaverse has been a costly bet for Meta, racking up more than $70 billion in losses since 2020. It has faced repeated rounds of cuts as Meta shifts its attention — and spending — toward AI.\n\nIn a memo obtained by Business Insider last year, Meta's CTO, who oversees the company's metaverse efforts, called 2025 \"the most critical\" year of his tenure.\n\nWorkrooms showcased how Meta Horizon could bring people together to work, collaborate, and connect, the company said. But Meta Horizon has since developed into a social platform that supports a wide range of productivity apps and tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta said its Horizon managed services will no longer be available for purchase from February 20, although customers would continue to receive support until the start of 2030.",

    "description": "Companies invest millions in employee training, yet the payoff often seems uncertain. A new study suggests the problem may be what organizations measure: most overlook the impact on managers. Researchers tracked a 16-week upskilling program at a Colombian government agency and found frontline output rose 10%, while help-seeking emails dropped—freeing managers to focus on strategic work. These “spillover effects” accounted for nearly half the program’s total benefits, making training far more cost-effective than traditional ROI models imply.  With AI reshaping roles, leaders should view training as a catalyst for organizational agility—not just individual performance.",

But why do people create it and send it to their colleagues, especially if it can lead to bosses, coworkers, and subordinates thinking less of them? New research suggests that the recipe for workslop is surprisingly simple and under the control of management: It’s the result of unclear AI mandates and overwhelmed teams.

But in a November podcast appearance, Altman said he expected OpenAI to try ads \"at some point,\" though he added that he did not believe it would be the company's biggest revenue opportunity.\n\n\"We'll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won't change,\" OpenAI said in a statement on Friday.\n\nAs OpenAI tests ads, the company said users will be able to learn more about why they're seeing a specific ads, dismiss ads and submit feedback about the experience.\n\nWATCH: OpenAI Investor Letter: Weekly and daily active user figures ‘continue to produce all-time highs’",

    "fullText": "Remember early 2025? “Vibe coding” was a meme and seemed mostly a tool for casual builders or those new to coding. It was often used disparagingly, or to imply a lack of deep technical expertise. Some very cool basic applications were being built, but AI coding assistants couldn’t reliably function in complex codebases. But what a difference a year has made!\n\nIt’s now 2026, and we find ourselves living in a new reality. Some of the most influential voices in software engineering like DHH (Ruby on Rails), Andrej Karpathy (prev OpenAI, Tesla), Tobi Lutke (Shopify), Salvatore Sanfilippo (Redis), and Mitchell Hashimoto (Ghostty, prev Hashicorp) are publicly embracing a new  paradigm: completely AI generated code controlled by human-in-the-loop prompting. It was also recently publicized that Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux and Git) is leveraging AI vibe-coding in his side-projects.\n\nAI is everywhere: if you’re a software developer, you’ve almost certainly tried at least one AI-assisted coding solution over the past year. It’s a safe assumption that a large portion of developers are using AI to help them, but we still know shockingly little about how their code was derived. This secrecy is outdated, especially now that the practice is being normalized by industry leaders.\n\nThe open source community is built on top of foundations of transparency and collaboration, of which knowledge sharing is a key component. At Mozilla.ai, we believe we must embrace and encourage the disclosure of AI usage as quickly as possible. We need to move away from “Should we AI?” and towards a structure that clearly defines our expectations for where we encourage AI usage and how we document it.\n\nIn our project any-llm, we’ve started to iterate on this philosophy by creating a pull request template that requests a few pieces of information whenever a PR is submitted.\n\nHere’s a snippet of the relevant part of our pull request template:\n\nFirst, we request that the contributors specify their level of AI usage: was AI used to draft and make edits? Or was their contribution completely AI-generated with them only directing it via plain language prompts? Both are acceptable, but it helps a reviewer understand how to approach their review. If we know the code is completely AI generated, we can be candid with our feedback and direct the contributor towards improving their prompting or AI coding configuration to improve quality. Without this transparency, it can be difficult to give feedback since a reviewer doesn’t want to offend the contributor by insinuating that their work came from a bot.\n\nSecond, we request information about the contributors' AI setup: what model(s) and IDE/CLI tools were used? This is valuable metadata for crowdsourcing best practices. Maybe there is one model or tool that works amazingly well with a certain codebase or language! Openly sharing this information allows all of us to learn from each other.\n\nLastly, we request that any responses to comments come from the contributor themselves and not their AI tool. It is frustrating to write comments without knowing if a human is on the other side reading and responding to the feedback. The open source community is a wonderful place to learn from each other, and that learning happens best when humans talk to humans. Of course, AI can be used to help the contributor brainstorm or improve their grammar, but we think the core discussion should still happen between two humans.\n\nWe welcome community opinions and hope to see similar approaches be adopted across the open source community. Let's keep learning and developing together!",

    "fullText": "Patrick Vallance says robots would take away ‘repetitive’ tasks, but Sadiq Khan warns AI will usher in ‘new era of mass unemployment’\n\nAdvances in AI and robotics will transform human jobs, starting with roles in warehouses and factories, the UK science minister has said, as the government announced plans to reduce red tape for robot and defence tech companies.\n\nPatrick Vallance said technological progress was creating a “whole new area” for robots to work in. “What’s really changing now is the combination of AI and robotics. It is opening up a whole new area, particularly in the sorts of things like humanoid robotics. And that will increase productivity, it will change the human job,” he told the Guardian.\n\nLord Vallance spoke as a government unit helping to deploy new technologies in Britain announced robots and defence as new sectors receiving its support.\n\nHe said factories and warehouses, already at the forefront of robot deployment, will undergo further change as a result of the new generation of humanoid robots.\n\n“Activities that require movement around warehouses and factories, or those sorts of things that can be made robotic, will be made robotic. I think they will be made robotic in many cases and therefore, will change the nature of those jobs. That’s going to be the first wave,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has warned that AI could “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nSpeaking in his annual Mansion House speech on Thursday, Khan said artificial intelligence could destroy a significant amount of jobs in London unless ministers act to help replace jobs taken over by the technology.\n\nAsked to comment on Khan’s speech, Vallance said robots would take away “repetitive” tasks. “You take away some of the things which are less interesting, repetitive things that can be done in another way,” he said.\n\nVallance, formerly the government’s chief scientific adviser, added that the example of robotics assisting in surgery showed how the technology can enhance jobs.\n\n“Robotics is not displacing surgeons, it’s radically improving how those surgeons work and allowing things to be done with more precision,” he said.\n\nThe government announced on Friday that the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO) is expanding its remit to defence tech and robotics, with the aim of slashing red tape for companies operating in those spaces.\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is also releasing £52m for new hubs to drive robotics adoption in British businesses. These hubs will offer companies advice on using robots and live demonstrations. “The RIO will aim to streamline overlapping requirements to bring products to market safely, but more quickly, to improve lives and grow our economy,” it said.\n\nThe department added that autonomous drones could benefit from the wider RIO remit. Such technology could require separate approvals for aviation, data protection, and sector-specific safety rules, in an expensive process that could take months.\n\nVallance was speaking during a visit to Humanoid, a UK-based robotics company that has already deployed its prototypes in a factory operated by German industrial group Siemens.\n\nAdam Kelsall, Humanoid’s head of product management, said the company welcomed “anything that gets us into the real world and testing [robots] sooner”.",

    "fullText": "Despite restrictions announced this week, Guardian reporters find standalone app continues to allow posting of nonconsensual content\n\nX has continued to allow users to post highly sexualised videos of women in bikinis generated by its AI tool Grok, despite the company’s claim to have cracked down on misuse.\n\nThe Guardian was able to create short videos of people stripping to bikinis from photographs of fully clothed, real women. It was also possible to post this adult content on to X’s public platform without any sign of it being moderated, meaning the clip could be viewed within seconds by anyone with an account.\n\nIt appeared to offer a straightforward workaround to restrictions announced by Elon Musk’s social network this week. These had been welcomed by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, who had described the photographs generated by Grok as “disgusting” and “shameful”.\n\nAfter weeks of rising public concern, X said late on Wednesday it had “implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”.\n\nIt said the restriction would apply to all users, including paid subscribers, and it had “zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content”. But it did not specify whether people would still be able to create such images on the standalone Grok app, and then share this material publicly on X.\n\nThe Guardian found that this standalone version of Grok, known as Grok Imagine – which is easily accessible through a web browser – was still responding to prompts to digitally remove the clothes from images of women.\n\nReporters uploaded still images of fully clothed real-life women, and prompted the AI tool to dress them in bikinis. The platform responded by going further than the request, to create short videos of the women removing their clothes in the manner of a sexually provocative striptease.\n\nX has been contacted for comment.\n\nRebecca Hitchen, the head of policy and campaigns at the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said such a simple workaround should not be possible.\n\n“The continued ease of access to sophisticated nudification tools clearly demonstrates that X isn’t taking the issue of online violence against women and girls seriously enough,” she said.\n\nHitchen called on the UK government and Ofcom, the media regulator, to pressure X and other platforms “to stop the proliferation of image-based sexual abuse”.\n\n“It’s hard to believe that xAI and Elon Musk can’t work out how to prevent these images from being spewed out by Grok,” said Penny East, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society. “First, Musk decided the solution was to preserve nudification as a privilege only for those users who pay for X. Then he pledged to stop it entirely. And yet it has not stopped.\n\n“The truth is Musk and the tech sector simply do not prioritise safety or dignity in the products they create. It’s a pretty low bar for women to expect that they can converse online without men undressing them. And yet seemingly even that is impossible.”\n\nWhile Downing Street had said it felt “vindicated” by the steps X had taken, there was also caution among ministers about the extent of the changes and how they would be delivered.\n\nOn Thursday, Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, who had described the sexual manipulation of images of women and children as “despicable and abhorrent”, welcomed the move and thanked “those who have spoken out against this abuse, above all the victims”.\n\nHowever, she added: “I will expect the facts to be fully and robustly established by Ofcom’s ongoing investigation.”\n\nStarmer also demanded X to act without delay. “Free speech is not the freedom to violate consent,” he said. “Young women’s images are not public property, and their safety is not up for debate. I welcome that X is now acting to ensure full compliance with UK law – it must happen immediately.”\n\nOfcom said its formal investigation into X, launched on Monday, remained ongoing and it was “working round the clock to progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what’s being done to fix it”.\n\nCanada’s privacy watchdog said it was investigating xAI, while authorities in the Philippines said they were moving to block Grok, with Malaysian authorities planning to take legal action.\n\nBut the controversy may have been helpful for boosting public awareness of Grok. On Thursday, Musk shared a post claiming “popularity and real world usage are skyrocketing globally” – alongside a graph of “Grok” as a search term hitting a new high on Google Trends. Musk simply added: “Try Grok.com.”\n\nA government spokesperson said: “The Online Safety Act already requires platforms like X to prevent illegal content, including nonconsensual intimate images and child abuse material, from appearing on their services.\n\n“The secretary of state has said she expects X’s compliance with UK laws to be fully and robustly established by Ofcom’s investigation, which is already under way, and the government will not rest until social media companies meet their legal duties.\n\n“We are also taking further action through the proposed ‘nudification’ offence, which will target tools designed specifically to generate nonconsensual intimate images.”",

This issue is presumably covered by general references to verification. With reported sanctions as high as $52,000 and multiple sanctions in the $10,000 range, surely the danger of sanctions and adverse impact on reputation merit more attention. Years ago, I clerked for a federal judge who placed cases first on the law and motion calendar when an attorney misquoted (e.g., omitting the \"not\") or miscited authorities so the assembly of attorneys and clients awaiting hearing of their matter would all learn the painful lesson.ReplyShareAndrew 15hLiked by Justin CurlAgreed that large versus small matters is an important distinction. There's just no way to mark up a 10 page contract for a small transaction in a way that is cost effective, but a prompt to \"revise this to be more seller friendly\" will get you 90% of the way there in 5 minutes and in another 10 I can spot check for which changes are appropriate and which are unreasonable or unnecessary.

    "title": "'Task' versus 'purpose': Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explains why AI won't kill jobs.",
    "description": "AI may automate tasks, but your job's purpose may be immune from AI disruption. This applies to radiology, law, coding, and even waiting tables.",
    "fullText": "Hospitals, law firms, and tech companies are getting a preview of how AI is likely to reshape work: by automating tasks without eliminating the underlying jobs.\n\nThat's the core message Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized in a recent appearance on the No Priors podcast.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, he argued that fears of mass job destruction often confuse the \"tasks\" involved in a job with the broader \"purpose\" of the role. AI, in his view, changes how tasks get done, but the purpose remains the same. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work.\n\nHuang's framing is straightforward: Most jobs contain repeatable tasks that technology can compress, and a broader purpose that remains human-led. He highlighted radiology as a real-world example.\n\nYears ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted that AI would eradicate many radiology jobs and advised students to avoid the field. The opposite happened. While AI is automating many radiology tasks, there are actually more radiologists employed now than when Hinton made his prediction in 2016.\n\nHere are the killer stats, shared in this 2025 blog post that describes why radiologists are still in huge demand: In 2025, American diagnostic radiology residency programs offered a record 1,208 positions, a 4% increase from 2024, and the field's vacancy rates are at all-time highs. Also, in 2025, radiology was the second-highest-paid medical specialty in the country, with an average income of $520,000, over 48% percent higher than the average radiologist salary in 2015 (the year before Hinton's prediction).\n\nHow did this happen? Huang argued that the job's purpose isn't \"reading scans.\" Those are tasks that AI has automated. The true purpose of a radiologist is to diagnose disease, guide treatment, and support those efforts with research. When AI helps clinicians evaluate more images with higher confidence, hospitals can serve more patients, generate more revenue, and justify hiring more specialists.\n\nThe same logic, he said, applies across the economy.\n\n\"I spend most of my day typing,\" Huang noted, describing typing as a task, not his job's purpose. Tools that automate writing don't eliminate the need for executives; they often expand the amount of work leaders and other employees can take on, he said.\n\n\"The fact that somebody could use AI to automate a lot of my typing — I really appreciate that, and it helps a lot,\" he said. \"It hasn't really made me, if you will, less busy. In a lot of ways, I become more busy because I'm able to do more work.\"\n\nThis \"task versus purpose\" framework is increasingly visible in knowledge work, where AI tools are speeding up and automating tasks such as drafting, summarizing, and generating code.\n\nHuang pointed to software engineering as a case where AI can reduce time spent on a core task (writing code) while raising demand for the job's purpose: solving problems and identifying new ones worth solving.\n\nNvidia, he said, is hiring aggressively even as AI coding tools such as Cursor spread through the company's engineering teams, because productivity gains allow companies to pursue more ideas. That can boost revenue, leaving more money to hire new staff.\n\nLaw is another example he cited. Reading and drafting contracts are tasks, while the purpose of a lawyer is to protect clients and resolve disputes. AI can accelerate document-heavy work, but the role's true value relies on judgment, strategy, and accountability — and you need experienced, trustworthy human attorneys for that.\n\nThis even applies to waiters working in a restaurant. Their task is taking food orders, but their purpose is to ensure guests have a great time, Huang said.\n\n\"If some AI is taking the order or even delivering the food, their job is still helping us have a great experience,\" the CEO added. \"They would reshape their jobs accordingly.\"\n\nHuang's argument isn't that AI won't disrupt roles — it will. But he contends the early evidence points less toward a wholesale collapse of employment and more toward job redesign.\n\nFor workers, the implication is pragmatic: if your role is defined primarily by a repeatable task, AI is a direct threat. If it's anchored in outcomes — diagnosis, customer experience, problem-solving, conflict resolution — AI may be less a replacement than a lever, changing what you spend time on while keeping your job's purpose intact.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Goldman Sachs is crushing it",
    "description": "Strong earnings, rising shares, and a bet on AI are converging at a pivotal moment for Goldman Sachs after riding out ups and downs.",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs is acting like Goldman Sachs again.\n\nThe Wall Street giant is coming off one of its best years on record, its share price is through the roof, and its executives are downright giddy over its swelling deal pipeline. Equity trading is booming, and dealmaking is thriving ahead of what could be one of the biggest years for IPOs of all time, big boons for Goldman's bottom line.\n\nIf the bank had lost its luster, CEO David Solomon seems to have gotten it back. Goldman is once again Wall Street's top dog. It's a swift comeback for a firm that some declared dead as recently as 2023. The scars of an internal PR crisis and concerns over Solomon's DJ side hustle are long in the past. Goldman is on the attack again as it readies for a monster year.\n\n\"I think the world is set up at the moment to be incredibly constructive in 2026 for M&A and capital markets activity,\" Solomon told an analyst. \"The 2021 levels will be exceeded again. They might be exceeded in 2026.\"\n\nBeing on the right footing is all the more important as other banks are jockeying for some of the industry's hottest deals too. In a memo to her staff on Wednesday, Citi CEO Jane Fraser warned her staff against settling for second best.\n\n\"The animal spirits have been unleashed,\" veteran Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Business Insider last week, noting competition among the banks is now \"at its most intense level since before the global financial crisis.\"\n\nHere's how Goldman got its swagger back and what's still at stake.\n\nMuch of Solomon's vision that's playing out today dates back to a 2020 investor day just a few weeks before the coronavirus pandemic sent the world into a tailspin. At the presentation — which featured a number of then-Goldman officials who are no longer at the bank — its leaders teased two pursuits that would go on to shape its future: \"digitization\" and \"consumerization.\"\n\nNot everything went according to plan.\n\nIts consumer banking venture, Marcus, proved a costly distraction that fomented schisms among power brokers and sent some partners to the exits. Stephanie Cohen, the bank's former chief strategy officer and an architect of its consumer strategy, left the firm in 2024 to go to the tech sector.\n\nThe bank retreated from many of its consumer ambitions due to ballooning spending, but the Marcus brand lives on as a deposits platform within its combined asset and wealth management business. Marcus holds more than $100 billion in consumer deposits in the US and UK, contributing to more than $500 billion in deposits overall, the bank has said.\n\nThe bank also got closure on another Marcus venture this week. It has relinquished its Apple Card partnership to JPMorgan. A silver lining for the bank is that this transfer meant analysts didn't pepper Solomon with questions about President Donald Trump's 10% credit card interest proposal. Other CEOs had to address it point-blank during their earnings calls.\n\nAside from the consumer flop, other initiatives stuck. Solomon merged the asset and wealth businesses in late 2022. The gambit appears to have paid off — the business' assets under supervision climbed nearly half a trillion dollars to $3.6 trillion last year, an all-time high, alongside investments in private banking, alternatives, and wealth management in the high-net-worth category.\n\nAbout a year ago, Goldman formalized its Capital Solutions Group, coalescing its advisory, financing, structuring, and risk-management capabilities. The unit's primary objective is helping corporate clients navigate increasingly bespoke capital needs at a time when liquidity demands are skyrocketing.\n\nThe consumer banking misfire fueled multiple years of unrest from 2022 to 2024.\n\nAt times, the infighting spilled into public view, with some frustrated partners turning to reporters to get the CEO's attention. Some who worked directly with Solomon bristled over a management style they said could be abrasive and alienating; he, in turn, told veteran journalist Bethany McLean that internal leaks were \"damaging the firm.\" Those familiar with Goldman's closely guarded mystique were surprised at the spillover at the time, saying it conflicted with the bank's pristine image.\n\nTensions resurfaced almost two years ago, when questions about the advancement of women at Goldman were thrust to the center stage following a critical Wall Street Journal report. Business Insider later revealed talking points the firm circulated to managers to quell concerns from within its own walls, acknowledging that the issue had become a flashpoint.\n\nEven so, Solomon and his deputy, President and COO John Waldron, kept moving — and the bank continues to draw hopefuls at scale.\n\nMore than a million people applied for jobs at the bank last year, Solomon said, and its ultra-exclusive internship acceptance was less than 1%.\n\nWith the business stabilized, Goldman is focused on its next chapter, and chatter surrounding Solomon has died down. Last year, the bank awarded both Solomon and Waldron $80 million in restricted stock units to vest over five years, signaling it doesn't want the duo going anywhere.\n\nLast year, it acquired the ETF platform, Innovator; the VC firm Industry Ventures; and partnered with T. Rowe Price. In the fall, the firm rolled out One Goldman Sachs 3.0, an AI-driven overhaul of an internal operating model designed to unify business lines, cross-sell products, and foster company cohesion.\n\nIt's pouring billions into the development of technology — Solomon has said he wishes his $6 billion tech budget was higher — and deployment of artificial intelligence to supercharge the bank's workers and cut costs.\n\nBut the road ahead is never certain. Goldman has stumbled on high-profile tech initiatives before, and executives have acknowledged that changing how a 150-year-old institution works is neither quick nor easy. Pressed by Mayo for more specifics on what Goldman's AI investments will entail, Solomon sought to reassure listeners that the firm is taking a measured approach.\n\n\"This is not a new era for Goldman Sachs,\" he said. Goldman, he added, remains focused on its two core businesses — its global banking and markets franchise, and its asset and wealth management unit — with AI serving as an accelerant.\n\n\"It's not just to take cost out,\" Solomon said. \"It's to free up capacity to invest in other areas where we see growth opportunities that we've been a little bit constrained.\"\n\nAfter the ups and downs of the first half of the decade, Solomon is poised to enter the second half with the wind at his back and his hands held tightly to one of Wall Street's most feared and coveted thrones. Partners, shareholders, journalists, and rivals will be watching closely to see where he steers Goldman next.",

So much so that, for Christmas, instead of fuzzy socks or wool sweaters, he gave his friends and family an AI music album.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder and Greylock partner, who Forbes estimates has a $2.5 billion net worth, recently told Wired he generated silly Christmas songs using AI and pressed them onto records.\n\n\"There's a song on ugly sweaters and all of this kinda stuff,\" he said. \"As opposed to the 'Holly, Jolly Christmas,' you know, something that actually has some humor. Almost like what 'Weird Al' Yankovic would do if he was doing a Christmas album.\"\n\nTo create the Christmas music, Hoffman said he used two different AI agents: one to write the lyrics and another to compose the music.\n\nIt's not clear which AI tool Hoffman used to generated the songs. His current firm, Greylock, doesn't list any of the major music-generating apps — like Suno, Udio, or AIVA — in its investment portfolio.\n\nBut, whichever tool he used, Hoffman said he was impressed by the result.\n\nHe said he told everyone who received the gift that it was AI, but when he played it for his wife, she couldn't tell it was computer-generated.\n\nThe Christmas surprise comes as Hoffman has been talking about AI while promoting a new book published with journalist Greg Beato titled \"Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future.\"\n\nIn it, the two argue that AI doesn't need to be a dystopian technology destined to displace workers or lead to human extinction, as some more pessimistic about the technology have warned.\n\nHoffman argues that AI skeptics are falling into the same trap that has gripped tech cynics in the past, including existential complaints during the rollouts of the printing press, electricity, and the internet.\n\n\"My push for people is if you are not using AI in a way today that isn't seriously helpful to you, you are not actually trying hard enough,\" he told Wired. \"Now, of course it'll transform jobs, and there'll be a bunch of pain in that transformation. But the way that you as an individual can avoid that is to be engaged.\"",

And then two seconds later, boom, pitch black.\"\n\nHansson said when he asked AI to write lines of code, the output is not \"as good as a job as most junior programmers I've had to deal with.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling that we're falling behind at 37 Signals in terms of our ability to produce, in terms of our ability to launch things or improve the products,\" he said. \"And this is why I'm a little skeptical about the claims that AI is already now at a place where you can take your standard SaaS business and then fire half the programmers and still go faster.\"\n\nHumans coded 95% of the code for Fizzy, 37 Signals' Kanban-inspired organization product, Hansson said.

I'll continue to make my handwritten code saddles as long as I can for my enjoyment.\"\n\nAlternatively, Hansson said he's seen the promise of AI in the type of tools Shopify uses, where he serves on the board.\n\n\"Some of the things that they've done with SiteKick, the AI agent they have helping merchants set up their shop and optimize their shop is truly incredible,\" he said. \"And there's some real tangible benefits in that that I think are undisputable.\"\n\nOverall, Hansson said he's excited about the promise of a new era that could upend development, just as the iPhone's 2007 release ushered in a focus on mobile optimization.\n\n\"This is the first one where we, in real time, know the world is going to look totally different, and we don't know what the final result is going to be,\" he said. \"So I think the best thing you can just do is accept that A, we don't know, B, that it's really exciting, and C, just try to hold onto your hat, jump on there cowboy and ride it and see where it goes.\"\n\nHe also said AI isn't going away, no matter what some people may hope.\n\n\"That power does not exist. You don't get to roll these things back. Now, you could personally choose that you're not going to use gen AI,\" he said, adding that some people may also try to avoid buying products that were aided by AI.\n\nHansson said he's amazed by just how much of the US economy is based on large bets that AI will break through its current limitations and reach something akin to Artificial General Intelligence, the theoretical moment where AI reaches capabilities akin to humans.\n\n\"The entire American economy right now is one big bet that that's going to happen,\" he said. \"And I, as AI positive as I am, still marvel at that. The conviction of an entire economy to just combined go like 'Whatever takes 100 trillion, a thousand trillion. I don't care. We will get there.' I go like, 'That's why America is fucking number one.'\"",

    "description": "Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch said European governments and firms want AI they can control, deploy locally, and run independently of US tech giants.",
    "fullText": "As the race to dominate AI accelerates, Europe's most prominent AI startup is betting that geography — not just technology — can be a competitive advantage in its home market.\n\nArthur Mensch, the CEO and cofounder of French AI company Mistral, said the company's edge in Europe over Silicon Valley rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic isn't about having dramatically smarter models.\n\nInstead, he said that many European governments and regulated enterprises are seeking AI systems they can control, customize, and operate independently, rather than relying on a small number of external providers.\n\n\"European governments are coming to us because they want to build the technology and they want to serve their citizens,\" Mensch said on the \"Big Technology Podcast\" on Wednesday.\n\nMistral, founded in 2023 and now valued at roughly $14 billion, develops large language models that rival those of leading US systems.\n\nBut Mensch said that frontier AI models are rapidly converging in performance as research spreads and training techniques become widely available.\n\nAs a result, the real battleground is shifting away from raw intelligence and toward deployment, control, and trust — a shift that plays directly into Mistral's pitch in Europe.\n\nMensch said governments, banks, and heavily regulated industries want AI systems they can customize, deploy locally, and operate independently — without fear that a single vendor could change the rules or shut off access.\n\nThe approach has already paid off. France's military recently selected Mistral for an AI deal that keeps sensitive systems running on French-controlled infrastructure.\n\nMensch pushed back on the idea that the company benefits merely from EU regulation or protectionism.\n\nInstead, he framed the demand as geopolitical and operational.\n\nEuropean governments, he said, want AI that they can govern themselves and use to serve citizens without depending on foreign platforms.\n\nThe same logic applies to regulated enterprises that need tighter control over data, compliance, and security.\n\nMistral's embrace of open-source models is central to that strategy.\n\nOpen source allows customers to run AI on their own infrastructure, build redundancy, and avoid vendor lock-in — a sharp contrast to the closed, centralized platforms favored by many US firms.\n\nThe appeal isn't limited to Europe. Mensch said Mistral also works with US and Asian customers who want to reduce dependence on a small group of American providers and retain more autonomy over how AI is used inside their organizations.\n\nThat approach is already extending beyond the West. Mistral recently deepened a partnership with Morocco's government to co-build locally tailored AI models and launch a joint research and development lab aimed at strengthening the country's technological autonomy.\n\nLong term, Mensch said he doesn't believe AI will be dominated by a single winner or country. Instead, he expects multiple regional centers of expertise shaped by local needs, industries, and political realities.\n\nIn that future, he suggested, Mistral's biggest advantage may not be the models it builds — but where, and how, it builds them.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

    "fullText": "Specialized AI talent can be hard to come by — and companies are jockeying to scoop them up.\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing battle for elite talent, Cisco's chief people officer says that AI and machine-learning operations positions are \"really hard\" to fill at the company.\n\n\"The qualified pool is so small, and the demand is so high,\" Jones said.\n\nPart of that is because \"everyone\" is currently hiring for those positions right now. She said that every forward-thinking organization needs AI in its products and also in its internal IT teams.\n\nThose jobs also require a \"slightly different level of specialization,\" she said. AI and ML Ops roles typically involve automating and streamlining IT operations, the company said. The strongest candidates are those with experience working in AI, ML, and operations, and those who have a track record of developing successful products.\n\n\"We're looking for people who have done this, who have been there, and have a good story to tell,\" Jones said, adding that she wants to know about what they built.\n\nAs the AI talent wars continue, Jones said that one factor that makes a \"really big difference\" is having leaders at the company talk directly to talent. She said that shouldn't reflect negatively on recruiters, but in the current landscape, there's \"a lot of AI washing going on,\" which makes it hard to differentiate the real wins.\n\n\"Companies are talking about all these things they're doing and how they're slapping AI on everything,\" Jones said. \"But they're actually not doing interesting things with work or with products.\"\n\nShe said mobilizing executives like Cisco's president and chief product officer, Jeetu Patel, has helped score some of those top candidates. She said when the company has a strong AI candidate, he'll pick up the phone and give them a call.\n\n\"If there's someone that we are really strategically trying to hire, we will get him involved,\" Jones said.\n\nPatel, whom the company poached from Box in 2020, understands the connection between having the best people design products and the success of those products, Jones said.\n\nCisco isn't the only company to use this technique. Citadel CTO Umesh Subramanian recently told Business Insider that he personally calls top entry-level candidates during the hiring process to talk through their decision-making.\n\nOpenAI's Sam Altman has also reportedly called candidates to convince them to join the AI company, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously appeared in email chains to recruit talent and has also reportedly hosted top candidates at his home for meals.\n\nWhat qualifies a candidate to get a phone call from Cisco's Patel?\n\nAside from \"top-tier\" technical skills and experience, Jones assesses for behavior and potential when evaluating top talent. She said, \"It's not just about skills,\" because those can be learned, but also about the leadership characteristics an applicant has.\n\n\"We want to know, not only have you done these things, but are you intellectually curious? Are you intellectually and emotionally agile? Are you someone who brings your team along with you?\" Jones said.\n\nJones said that the company also has to put its efforts toward \"naturally\" attracting talent both online and in person by creating a presence in the tech community. She said that includes having senior leaders connect with talent at industry events and building community through channels like its Tech Pulse newsletter, which highlights Cisco's leadership in the AI era.\n\nIt also involves leaders sharing career opportunities on LinkedIn and participating in events with entry talent recruiting to engage with the next generation of AI professionals, the company said.\n\n\"We've tried to insert ourselves into not just your typical talent branding, but going where that talent lives — in the forums that they're on, in the hobbies that they have, to ensure that we have a presence there,\" Jones said.",

    "fullText": "The AI supercycle is far from exhausted, and semiconductor companies like industry titan TSMC (TSM) are among the catalysts to watch.\n\n\"This earnings report, really more than anything, supports the idea that [the AI boom] is going to continue to move forward,\" Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nAccording to Fernandez, the great \"rotation\" out of Big Tech might finally \"start to slow down a little bit.\" While market skeptics spent the past quarter betting on a broad exit from the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a new wave of earnings from the semiconductor sector signals \"there are more legs\" to the AI race.\n\nOther key players to watch include ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Lam Research (LRCX), as Fernandez points to the firms' respective \"strong earnings.\"\n\nThat renewed optimism is largely due to a fundamental shift in how the market views the picks and shovels of the AI era. For months, investors feared that AI demand might be a bubble nearing its burst. However, the latest data from these four companies — which build the hardware for Big Tech — tells a different story of rising capital expenditures, expanding margins, and relentless sales growth.\n\nLeading that charge is TSMC, the world's most critical chip foundry, which dominates advanced chip production for giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nTSMC kicked off the new year by delivering blockbuster Q4 earnings today. For the period, revenue came in at $33.73 billion, a 25% year-over-year increase, beating consensus estimates of $32.8 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Earnings per share reached $3.15, up 8% year over year, surpassing the expected $2.90. TSMC stock has risen over 70% in the past year.\n\nThe company announced it had earmarked up to $56 billion in capital expenditures for 2026. This aggressive spending plan acts as a massive \"buy\" signal for the entire supply chain, per Fernandez, suggesting that the world's biggest tech players are doubling down on infrastructure, rather than pulling back.\n\nThe higher-for-longer spending cycle has revitalized the three other key suppliers. Take ASML, the sole provider of the lithography machines required to make advanced AI chips. Its market cap surged past the $500 billion mark on the back of TSMC's news. Shares of ASML are up over 80% in the past 12 months.\n\nThe support for these suppliers was visible in premarket trading, where Applied Materials and Lam Research shares were up 8% and 6%, respectively. These companies represent the infrastructure layer that must be built before any software-based AI gains can be realized.",

    "fullText": "Ashley St. Clair, who gave birth to one of Elon Musk's sons in 2024, sued Musk's xAI in a New York court on Thursday, alleging that its chatbot Grok generated sexually explicit deepfake images of her at users' request.\n\nIn the complaint, St. Clair, a writer, influencer, and political strategist, claims X users prompted Grok to manipulate images of her, including photos from when she was 14, into graphic sexual content. She alleges some images remained online for more than a week and that her premium X account was later terminated after she complained.\n\nShe is also requesting a temporary restraining order to compel xAI to immediately cease from \"the intentional disclosure of nonconsensual intimate images.\"\n\nxAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Grok first promised Ms. St. Clair that it would refrain from manufacturing more images unclothing her,\" the complaint read. \"Instead, Defendant retaliated against her, demonetizing her X account and generating multitudes more images of her,\" the suit alleged.\n\nSt. Clair is also involved in a separate suit with Musk over the custody of their son, in which she sought sole custody.\n\nxAI responded the same day with a separate lawsuit, arguing that St. Clair agreed to its terms of service, which requires any litigation to be heard in Texas. St. Clair is represented by attorney Carrie Goldberg, who specializes in cases involving abuse and has represented clients against Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\"xAI is not a reasonably safe product,\" Goldberg said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm.\"\n\nThe lawsuit followed international backlash against the Grok chatbot for its ability to undress images of real people and create sexualized images without their consent at users' request.\n\nIndonesia and Malaysia blocked access to Grok, while UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called explicit images generated by Grok \"disgusting\" and \"shameful\" in a meeting with the House of Commons.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta also announced that his office is investigating the \"non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online\" of \"women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations.\"\n\nX said on the same day in a blog post that users would no longer be allowed to create AI photos of real people in sexualized or revealing clothing on the platform, adding that the restriction \"applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Business Insider reporter Henry Chandonnet found that it is still \"surprisingly easy\" to prompt Grok to create nude images of him by going to the app itself instead of using the Grok chatbot on X.",

    "description": "Explore the inevitable shift from scripts to AI agents in coding. Discover insights on automation, tool access, and setting effective guardrails.",
    "fullText": "I’ve noticed a pattern in my coding life. It starts innocently enough. I sit down to write a simple Python script, maybe something to tidy up my Obsidian vault or a quick CLI tool to query an API. “Keep it simple,” I tell myself. “Just input, processing, output.”\n\nBut then, the inevitable thought creeps in: It would be cool if the model could decide which file to read based on the user’s question.\n\nTwo hours later, I’m not writing a script anymore. I’m writing a while loop. I’m defining a tools array. I’m parsing JSON outputs and handing them back to the model. I’m building memory context windows.\n\n(For those keeping track: my working definition of an “agent” is simple: a model running in a loop with access to tools. I explored this in depth in my Agentic Shift series, but that’s the core of it.)\n\nAs I sit here writing this in January of 2026, I realize that almost every AI project I worked on last year ultimately became an agent. It feels like a law of nature: Every AI project, given enough time, converges on becoming an agent. In this post, I want to share some of what I’ve learned, and the cases where you might skip the intermediate steps and jump straight to building an agent.\n\nThis isn’t just feature creep. It’s a fundamental shift in how we interact with software. We are moving past the era of “smart typewriters” and into the era of “digital interns.”\n\nTake Gemini Scribe, my plugin for Obsidian. When I started, it was a glorified chat window. You typed a prompt, it gave you text. Simple. But as I used it, the friction became obvious. If I wanted Scribe to use another note as context for a task, I had to take a specific action, usually creating a link to that note from the one I was working on, to make sure it was considered. I was managing the model’s context manually.\n\nI was the “glue” code. I was the context manager.\n\nThe moment I gave Scribe access to the read_file tool, the dynamic changed. Suddenly, I wasn’t micromanaging context; I was giving instructions. “Read the last three meeting notes and draft a summary.” That’s not a chat interaction; that’s a delegation. And to support delegation, the software had to become an agent, capable of planning, executing, and iterating.\n\nThe Gemini CLI followed a similar arc. There were many of us on the team experimenting with Gemini on the command line. I was working on iterative refinement, where the model would ask clarifying questions to create deeper artifacts. Others were building the first agentic loops, giving the model the ability to run shell commands.\n\nOnce we saw how much the model could do with even basic tools, we were hooked. Suddenly, it wasn’t just talking about code; it was writing and executing it. It could run tests, see the failure, edit the file, and run the tests again. It was eye-opening how much we could get done as a small team.\n\nBut with great power comes great anxiety. As I explored in my Agentic Shift post on building guardrails and later in my post about the Policy Engine, I found myself staring at a blinking cursor, terrified that my helpful assistant might accidentally rm -rf my project.\n\nThis is the hallmark of the agentic shift: you stop worrying about syntax errors and start worrying about judgment errors. We had to build a “sudoers” file for our AI, a permission system that distinguishes between “read-only exploration” and “destructive action.” You don’t build policy engines for scripts; you build them for agents.\n\nLast year, I learned to recognize a specific code smell: the AI classifier.\n\nIn my Podcast RAG project, I wanted users to search across both podcast descriptions and episode transcripts. Different databases, different queries. So I did what felt natural: I built a small classifier using Gemini Flash Lite. It would analyze the user’s question and decide: “Is this a description search or a transcript search?” Then it would call the appropriate function.\n\nIt worked. But something nagged at me. I had written a classifier to make a decision that a model is already good at making. Worse, the classifier was brittle. What if the user wanted both? What if their intent was ambiguous? I was encoding my assumptions about user behavior into branching logic, and those assumptions were going to be wrong eventually.\n\nThe fix was almost embarrassingly simple. I deleted the classifier and gave the agent two tools: search_descriptions and search_episodes. Now, when a user asks a question, the agent decides which tool (or tools) to use. It can search descriptions first, realize it needs more detail, and then dive into transcripts. It can do both in parallel. It makes the call in context, not based on my pre-programmed heuristics. (You can try it yourself at podcasts.hutchison.org.)\n\nI saw the same pattern in Gemini Scribe. Early versions had elaborate logic for context harvesting, code that tried to predict which notes the user would need based on their current document and conversation history. I was building a decision tree for context, and it was getting unwieldy.\n\nWhen I moved Scribe to a proper agentic architecture, most of that logic evaporated. The agent didn’t need me to pre-fetch context; it could use a read_file tool to grab what it needed, when it needed it. The complex anticipation logic was replaced by simple, reactive tool calls. The application got simpler and more capable at the same time.\n\nHere’s the heuristic I’ve landed on: If you’re writing if/else logic to decide what the AI should do, you might be building a classifier that wants to be an agent. Deconstruct those branches into tools, give the agent really good descriptions of what those tools can do, and then let the model choose its own adventure.\n\nYou might be thinking: “What about routing queries to different models? Surely a classifier makes sense there.” I’m not so sure anymore. Even model routing starts to look like an orchestration problem, and a lightweight orchestrator with tools for accessing different models gives you the same flexibility without the brittleness. The question isn’t whether an agent can make the decision better than your code. It’s whether the agent, with access to the actual data in the moment, can make a decision at least as good as what you’re trying to predict when you’re writing the code. The agent has context you don’t have at development time.\n\nWe are transitioning from Human-in-the-Loop (where we manually approve every step) to Human-on-the-Loop (where we set the goals and guardrails, but let the system drive).\n\nThis shift is driven by a simple desire: we want partners, not just tools. As I wrote back in April about waiting for a true AI coding partner, a tool requires your constant attention. A hammer does nothing unless you swing it. But an agent? An agent can work while you sleep.\n\nThis freedom comes with a new responsibility: clarity. If your agent is going to work overnight, you need to make sure it’s working on something productive. You need to be precise about the goal, explicit about the boundaries, and thoughtful about what happens when things go wrong. Without the right guardrails, an agent can get stuck waiting for your input, and you’ll lose that time. Or worse, it can get sidetracked and spend hours on something that wasn’t what you intended.\n\nThe goal isn’t to remove the human entirely. It’s to move us from the execution layer to the supervision layer. We set the destination and the boundaries; the agent figures out the route. But we have to set those boundaries well.\n\nHere’s the counterintuitive thing: building an agent isn’t always harder than building a script. Yes, you have to think about loops, tool definitions, and context window management. But as my classifier example showed, an agentic architecture can actually delete complexity. All that brittle branching logic, all those edge cases I was trying to anticipate: gone. Replaced by a model that can reason about what it needs in the moment.\n\nThe real complexity isn’t in the code; it’s in the trust. You have to get comfortable with a system that makes decisions you didn’t explicitly program. That’s a different kind of engineering challenge, less about syntax, more about guardrails and judgment.\n\nBut the payoff is a system that grows with you. A script does exactly what you wrote it to do, forever. An agent does what you ask it to do, and sometimes finds better ways to do it than you’d considered.\n\nSo, if you find yourself staring at your “simple script” and wondering if you should give it a tools definition… just give in. You’re building an agent. It’s inevitable. You might as well enjoy the company.",

    "fullText": "Users of Supernatural got an unpleasant surprise this week: Meta has pulled the plug on its flagship virtual reality fitness app. Citing \"organizational changes,\" Meta says it will no longer release new content or update features for Supernatural.\n\nThe app is not shutting down completely however. Subscribers can still access Supernatural's existing library of Beat Saber-workouts, and Meta says it will maintain the platform and Facebook page, but no new workouts, features, or other content is planned.\n\nBoth users and critics have nearly universally praised Supernatural—CNet scored it 9 out of 10, it won both Fast Company's Best App award in 2020 and a Webby in 2023, and boasted celebrity tie-ins with Jane Fonda and Bon Jovi. Meta doesn't publish subscriber numbers for Supernatural, but there are over 110,000 members of Supernatural's Facebook community. Not enough, apparently, to warrant keeping the app going.\n\nIn 2021, Meta spent an estimated $400 million to purchase Within, Supernatural's developer, even battling the FTC to make the deal, and the app was a heavily promoted part of the company's overall \"Metaverse\" strategy.\n\nThe shuttering of Supernatural is part of a larger shift at Meta. This week, the company laid off 1,500 people—about 10% of the staff—from Reality Labs, Meta's hardware and virtual reality division. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables. This is part of that effort,” a Meta spokesman told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlong with cuts at Supernatural, Meta is closing three studios behind some of the most prominent, high-end VR games: Armature, who brought Resident Evil 4 to VR, Sanzaru, the studio behind Asgard’s Wrath, and Twisted Pixel, creators of Deadpool VR.",

    "description": "The use of generative AI in video games has been controversial to say the least, but when it comes to art, the blowback has been even stronger. One game currently being accused of using the technology is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, as the new trailer for the fighting game's upcoming second season of DLC characters is being picked apart online. Viewers and commenters have pored over the trailer, claiming that the character designs are inconsistent and that certain visual elements contain generative AI. The biggest smoking gun, according to viewers, is a quick shot of series antagonist Geese Howard, who appears to be missing an entire foot.\nOther instances of generative AI pointed out include Blue Mary's motorcycle missing several vital components--and being a completely different model from what she normally rides--and Kim Jae Hoon having noticeably different wardrobes between his cinematic and gameplay character models.",

    "fullText": "First came efficiency. Then came intensity. Now it's accountability.\n\nA new year means a new mantra for Silicon Valley, and this time it's all about showing your work, writes BI's Tim Paradis.\n\nFrom Amazon helping managers track employees' time spent in the office to Meta keeping tabs on workers' AI usage, tech's corporate overlords are no longer going to take your word for it.\n\nThere's a not-so-subtle reason for this sudden interest in documentation. You might have heard me say this before, but companies are investing lots into AI, and the benefits aren't entirely clear. (JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon literally told analysts to just \"trust me.\")\n\nSo with investors breathing down execs' necks about their tech budgets, they're now looking for the humans to give them something to show for it. Add this to the growing list of ways AI ends up creating more work for employees.\n\nThis isn't just a Big Tech phenomenon. Citi CEO Jane Fraser, who is in the midst of her own \"Transformation,\" told workers in a recent memo that old habits won't fly anymore and everyone needs to step up their game.\n\nThere's a slightly less cynical way to look at this whole thing, one expert told Tim. Collecting all this data will help bosses better justify their workers' existence. (I only said it was slightly less cynical.)\n\nIt reminds me of an old coach I had. He'd tell us you shouldn't worry about getting yelled at. You should only panic when he stops yelling at you. That means he thinks you're a lost cause.\n\nThat might be true, but it sure didn't make wind sprints after practice easier.\n\nMetrics aren't a complete disaster for workers, but they could pose a risk to innovation.\n\nA clear sense of what your company expects from you can be beneficial, especially when you're looking for a raise. You asked me to produce X. I delivered X+1. Time to pay up. (Results may vary on that pitch.)\n\nGuidelines can be limiting though. Let's say you crack the code on hitting your assigned number. Are you willing to deviate from that strategy? Is the risk of not hitting your number worth the reward of trying something new?\n\nCreativity is rarely born from repetition. You often need to understand what doesn't work to figure out what will work. But if you're constantly being asked to show your worth, putting up a bunch of Ls, even if a W is around the corner, is a dangerous game.\n\nBesides, the executives are already taking enough risks for all of us.",
