    "fullText": "Joshua Bonehill-Paine revealed as owner of X account known for videos depicting politicians such as Keir Starmer\n\nThe person behind an anonymous social media account that posts AI videos of UK politicians has been identified as a man who has spent time in prison for multiple hate crimes directed towards Jewish people.\n\nJoshua Bonehill-Paine was identified by Channel 4 News as the owner of Crewkerne Gazette, a satirical X account that created AI videos depicting politicians such as Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham apparently singing popular songs from artists such as Amy Winehouse, Barry Manilow and Elton John with altered, politically themed lyrics.\n\nBonehill-Paine, 33, who has previously described himself as a “nationalist, fascist, theorist and supporter of white rights”, has a long history of discriminatory behaviour. This has included perpetuating fake stories such as a pub in Leicestershire refusing to admit members of the armed forces so as to not offend immigrants, and a six-year-old being abducted by an Asian grooming gang in Croydon.\n\nBonehill-Paine told the Guardian he no longer held antisemitic views, providing proof that he had passed the government’s Prevent awareness course and that he had worked in counter-extremism education.\n\nHe has described himself online as now holding “a deep affection for Israel”.\n\nIn early 2015 Bonehill-Paine attempted to organise a mass protest in Stamford Hill, north London, to rally “against the complete Jewification of the borough”, and later in the year tried to organise another in Golders Green, an area of the city with a large Jewish population.\n\nHe promoted the latter with a cartoon image of Hitler and wrote that the event would be “an absolute gas”. He was sentenced to three years and four months in jail for inciting hatred against Jews.\n\nLater, in 2016, he was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment for abuse directed at the then Labour MP Luciana Berger, who is Jewish, which included posting messages to his blog calling Berger “a rodent”, “evil money-grabber” and “a dominatrix”, and uploading an image of a rat with Berger’s face superimposed over it. He was jailed for another two years, which was added to his existing sentence.\n\nBonehill-Paine said on Wednesday he was “extremely sorry for the pain and distress” he had caused Berger, and he hoped she could forgive him for his past actions, but had not reached out to her directly as he did not “want to alarm or distress her, even after a decade has passed”.\n\nThe Crewkerne Gazette’s work has been lauded by publications such as the Sun, which featured a video created by the account showing Rayner rapping to a grime beat during her tax scandal.\n\nThe Times called him the “Banksy of politics” and GB News interviewed Bonehill-Paine, who went by the online alias of Crewkerne Man, on air three days before his identity and past were uncovered.\n\nThe account’s work has also been highlighted by politicians including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who shared a video from it on X, and Adam Dance, the Liberal Democrat MP for Yeovil, where Crewkerne is based. Dance also said on an episode of BBC Sunday Politics West that Bonehill-Paine’s work was a positive example of engaging audiences with politics.\n\nWhen asked about Bonehill-Paine’s identity, Dance said he was not aware of who was behind the Crewkerne Gazette account at the time of his comments, which were “about the transparent use of AI in politics, not about endorsing any individual. I absolutely condemn antisemitism and harassment in all its forms, and I do not support the person now revealed to be behind that account.”.\n\nIn a YouTube video Bonehill-Paine posted on Tuesday he expressed regret for his past comments towards the Jewish community.. He said: “I felt very angry at how I had treated the Jewish community in this country. I wanted to do something to rectify it, so I began working in counter-extremism education.”\n\nHe added: “I went across the country to colleges, schools, universities, working with the probation service, the police service, to try to help prevent other people from following in my footsteps.”\n\nHe later told Channel 4 News: “What I am going to do is to continue doing what I’ve done for the last five years, six years, which is counter-extremism work, working to prevent people following in my footsteps, hopefully stopping people from making the same mistakes that I’ve done.”",

    "title": "Meta announces plans to build 1-gigawatt data center in Indiana as part of AI build-out",
    "description": "Meta says it will build a new 1-gigawatt data center in Indiana, its second in the state.",
    "fullText": "Meta (META) on Wednesday said it is breaking ground on its latest data center as part of its massive AI infrastructure build-out.\n\nThe more than $10 billion data center will be located in Lebanon, Ind., and have a capacity of upwards of 1 gigawatt. That's enough energy to power several hundred thousand homes.\n\nAccording to Meta, the data center will handle both Meta's AI workloads as well as its core products and represents one of its largest infrastructure projects to date.\n\nDuring its Q4 earnings announcement, Meta said it plans to spend as much as $135 billion throughout 2026 as part of its AI expansion plans. The company spent $72.2 billion in 2025. The social media giant isn't the only tech company sending big on AI this year. Advertising rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) said it plans to spend $180 billion in 2026 during its own earnings report, while Amazon (AMZN) said it anticipates spending $200 billion.\n\nThe massive spending news spooked Google and Amazon investors and lifted shares of Meta more than 10% at the time, though they've since come back down to Earth.\n\nThe broader data center explosion is facing increasing criticism from residents in and around communities where they're being built, with complaints ranging from increasing utility costs to the irritating sounds of cooling systems.\n\nTo that end, Meta says it will pay the full cost of the energy the data center uses, provide $1 million each year for 20 years to the Boone REMC Community Fund to assist with energy bills, and fund emergency water utility assistance. The data center will also use a closed-loop water system that Meta says will use no water \"a majority of the year.\"\n\nThe company further says it will invest more than $120 million in water infrastructure for Lebanon, as well as make upgrades to roads, transmission lines, and area utilities.\n\nMeta isn't the only company looking to make concessions to win over local communities. Last month, Microsoft president Brad Smith announced that the Windows developer will work with local utilities to provide a better understanding of its data center electricity needs and “bear the cost” when electricity companies need to upgrade their transmission capabilities to meet data center demand.\n\nIn August, Google agreed to cut back on its electricity usage during periods of high demand in certain regions, Reuters reported.\n\nMeta's ambitious AI construction plans aren't limited to single-gigawatt data centers. In July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is set to build its enormous Hyperion facility in Louisiana, adding that the data center will be so large it would cover a large portion of Manhattan and will eventually scale up to support upwards of 5 gigawatts of capacity.",

    "description": "A new study found that AI in the workplace expanded tasks outside one's job description and blurred the line between work and time off.",
    "fullText": "If you think using AI means doing less at work, think again.\n\nIn a new eight-month study of how generative AI changed work habits at a US-based tech company with about 200 employees, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business found that employees' work intensified in three main ways.\n\nEmployees multitasked more, took on a broader range of responsibilities, and worked longer hours, often without being asked to do so.\n\nAruna Ranganathan, a professor in management at UC Berkeley, and Xingqi Maggie Ye, a Ph.D. student at the Haas School of Business, detailed their research in a Harvard Business Review story, writing that once AI tools became available, workers began to usurp each other's roles, feed information to AI during meetings, and correct each other's vibe coding projects.\n\nRanganathan and Ye said that workers \"described this as 'just trying things' with the AI, but these experiments accumulated into a meaningful widening of job scope. In fact, workers increasingly absorbed work that might previously have justified additional help or head count.\"\n\n\"Once the excitement of experimenting fades, workers can find that their workload has quietly grown and feel stretched from juggling everything that's suddenly on their plate. That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making,\" they wrote. \"The productivity surge enjoyed at the beginning can give way to lower quality work, turnover, and other problems.\"\n\nThe researchers wrote that many workers also send prompts to AI before leaving their desk for a meeting or for lunch break, so AI could continue to work without supervision.\n\n\"These actions rarely felt like doing more work, yet over time they produced a workday with fewer natural pauses and a more continuous involvement with work,\" Ranganathan and Ye added.\n\nIn an October 2025 interview with Rowan Cheung, who hosts the Rowan's Notes interview series, Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, also shared ways in which AI may have made his work more intense.\n\n\"It's almost like, I don't think I can come up with ideas fast enough anymore,\" Altman told Cheung.\n\n\"I really do have a hard time trying to reason through exactly what this is going to mean,\" Altman added. \"I think it will mean that stuff just happens faster and that you can try a lot more stuff and figure out the better ideas quickly.\"",

In recent years, Alphabet has made significant strides in AI, launching Gemini 3 in 2025 as its most advanced model yet, requiring less prompting and delivering smarter responses.\n\nOther advances include the Ironwood AI chip (its seventh-generation TPU) for scaling large models, Gemma 3 for efficient open-source AI, SIMA 2 for AI agents in 3D worlds, and integrations like AI Mode in Search and Gemini Robotics for physical interactions. These innovations bolster its cloud and ad businesses amid the AI boom.\n\nAlphabet's stock is up 1% year-to-date (YTD), just slightly underperforming the S&P 500's ($SPX) 1.89% YTD gain, but over the past year, GOOGL has surged 69%, far exceeding the index's 15% return. Valuation metrics show a trailing P/E of 30.65, a forward P/E of 29.64, and a price/sales of 9.93. Compared to its 10-year historical average P/E of 27.69, it currently trades 7% higher, suggesting a premium. Versus peers (average P/E 31.5x), it's attractive but expensive relative to the interactive media industry average of 12x.",

    "description": "Of the 240 financial services CEO that EY surveyed, more than half said AI investments have shown results faster than expected.",
    "fullText": "Banks' analyst classes probably won't swap fresh-faced college grads for bots — at least not this year.\n\nSome 60% of the 240 financial services CEOs that EY surveyed for its Quarterly CEO Outlook Survey said they think investing in AI will maintain or even increase their current head count in 2026. Only 28% of those surveyed predicted head count would drop this year.\n\nLeaders at some of the biggest banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have said that they're resisting hiring growth where it makes sense to prioritize efficiency. They, along with some other bulge-bracket leads, have predicted that AI could grow head count in the long run, though. Still, some roles are becoming obsolete: Citi CEO Jane Fraser said in a recent internal memo that some jobs \"will no longer be required\" as AI advances.\n\nFor their part, the financial services CEOs that EY surveyed are similarly bullish about AI's capacity to transform the workplace, and nearly half see AI and digital investment as the most important factor in their companies' ability to thrive and adapt this year.\n\nAround a quarter said their AI initiatives have significantly beaten expectations, and 57% said they've shown results faster than expected. Just more than half said they expect the biggest transformations to come from generative AI.\n\nWhen it comes to hiring for AI talent — itself a highly competitive market — 87% of CEOs in EY's survey are optimistic about their ability to attract and keep talent in 2026. The question of returns on the AI investment, for talent and in general, also seems top of mind for the financial services leaders. Seventy-six percent of boards in the survey said they'll review transformation ROI metrics as often as financial results.\n\nFirms of all sizes are being asked to justify their AI spends, as analysts and investors begin to wonder whether the sometimes billion-dollar bets will show up on balance sheets.",

    "description": "The tech giant's internal policy promotes an in-house tool called Kiro over Anthropic's Claude Code. Some Amazon engineers are unhappy about this.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors and a key partner in bringing the startup's AI models and products to customers.\n\nInside Amazon, however, employees aren't allowed to use Anthropic's Claude Code for production work or for live products without formal approval.\n\nThat disconnect became more visible late last year, when Amazon rolled out internal guidance steering teams toward Kiro, its in-house AI coding assistant, according to internal messages seen by Business Insider. The guidance encourages using Kiro over non-approved third-party tools, including Claude Code, for production code.\n\nThe policy prompted criticism across internal Amazon forums. In one discussion thread, roughly 1,500 Amazon employees endorsed the formal adoption of Claude Code, according to the messages.\n\nThe restrictions have been particularly awkward for engineers who help sell AWS Bedrock, Amazon's platform that offers customers access to third-party AI services, including Claude Code. Some questioned how they could credibly promote a product they are not permitted to use themselves in official work.\n\n\"Customers will ask why they should trust or use a tool that we did not approve for internal use,\" one employee wrote.\n\nThe episode highlights the complexity of Amazon's relationship with Anthropic. While Amazon is racing to build and promote its own AI tools, it is also marketing a partner's competing technology. Amazon is one of Anthropic's largest investors, with a stake valued at more than $60 billion. Anthropic, in turn, is a major AWS customer, committing to use Amazon's cloud services and at least one million of Amazon's Trainium chips.\n\n\"We are seeing incredible improvements in efficiency and delivery from Kiro, our customer growth is rapidly accelerating, and we want to make sure our internal employees all take advantage of this capability to deliver faster for our customers,\" an Amazon spokesperson said. \"While we continue to support existing tools in use today, we do not plan to support additional, third-party AI development tools.\"\n\nAmazon maintains \"a strong strategic partnership with Anthropic,\" and while there's no explicit ban on Claude Code, the company applies \"stricter requirements for the tools used to develop production code specifically,\" the spokesperson said, noting that Amazon provides a process for seeking exceptions.\n\nAn Anthropic spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one of the internal forums, an Amazon sales engineer flagged the irony of being asked to sell Claude Code even though it isn't formally supported inside the company. The employee wrote that they need to be able to \"use, demo, and build\" with Claude Code to support Amazon's directive to get more customers to use it through AWS Bedrock.\n\nOther Amazon engineers also debated whether the emphasis on Kiro was hindering productivity. Some argued that Claude Code outperformed Amazon's in-house tool and warned that forcing adoption of a weaker product could slow development.\n\n\"A tool that can't keep pace with rivals offers no real innovation,\" one of the Amazon employees wrote. \"And without competitive strength, Kiro's only survival mechanism becomes forced adoption rather than genuine value.\"\n\nClaude Code has become one of the most widely used AI coding services, and it underpins many other similar offerings from other providers. An Amazon spokesperson said about 70% of the company's software engineers used Kiro at least once in January.\n\nIn one forum thread, a manager overseeing Amazon's internal developer tools said he understood the \"frustration\" and \"significant\" interest in Claude Code, citing about 1,500 internal endorsements calling for its formal adoption.\n\nSome employees said frustration deepened after Amazon had previously indicated that Claude Code had cleared security and legal review for production use, according to an internal guideline and messages reviewed by Business Insider. That language was later edited and removed, employees said.\n\nOthers criticized the lack of transparency around the decision not to formally adopt Claude Code, asking what data informed the decision.\n\n\"The trend is clear,\" one employee wrote internally. \"More and more people would like to start using Claude Code and be officially supported by Amazon.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Aspiring computer science student Alex Seungyong Yang sees AI as both a challenge and opportunity as he enters university as a freshman in the fall.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Alex Seungyong Yang, an 18-year-old high school senior, based in Seoul. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs an incoming university freshman and the founder of an AI research startup, AI feels like a double-edged sword.\n\nI started my AI research and development startup with other students around the world, and AI has been amazing for us. It's allowed us to push further and think about achieving things we couldn't have imagined. On the other hand, I'm pursuing a computer science major this fall, and I keep hearing that computer science jobs are being replaced by AI.\n\nNo one has explicitly told me that pursuing computer science is a complete waste of time, but many people around me have expressed concerns about the risks it entails. I think those concerns point to something valid.\n\nSimply learning how to code no longer guarantees a stable or well-defined career path, but there are still many opportunities by staying within what I would call the \"eye of the typhoon\" and studying these machines, even if they are increasingly unpredictable.\n\nFrom 2025 to 2026, the tech industry changed so much. Last year, there was still a broad sense of expansion and experimentation, startups, new tools, and huge model launches. Now, what feels dominant is resource concentration in capital, compute, and top talent, along with a narrowing focus on AI infrastructure.\n\nThis kind of acceleration makes it so that one year doesn't feel like just a single year anymore. I think that computer science, engineering, and very technical majors are the only majors that can fully understand how this industry is changing and the direction of that change.\n\nI think the important part of studying computer science isn't about basic coding or programming; it's understanding the logic behind it and the framework that can be applied anywhere, anytime, wherever we are with technology. It's all about solving the problem, and I think that kind of talent is most relevant in the AI era.\n\nStudying computer science will help me adapt more flexibly and with greater urgency in my career. I want to use the knowledge from my degree to develop a niche kind of talent rather than simply following a very conventional pathway and becoming another factory-made worker.\n\nBeing unemployed or unable to find a job used to be the most obvious failure. Now, given how frequently unemployment is already happening around us, I don't think it can even be considered the greatest failure anymore. To me, the biggest failure would be an inability to adapt, and if we become irrelevant as technology advances.\n\nA small number of people or companies can now build and deploy things at a scale that used to require much larger organizations. Rather than only preparing for predefined roles, I spend time now and will continue to during my degree, building real systems, contributing to research, and working on projects where the constraints are unclear and the outcomes are uncertain.\n\nI see my computer science degree as a way to build depth, judgment, and adaptability rather than just technical skills.\n\nI don't see this as a guaranteed strategy, and I'm still learning what truly matters, but I hope that developing this ability in specific domains matters the most. I'm in competition with AI, but it's equally a competition with other people. I want to become an irreplaceable person, not just with AI, but also relative to other people.\n\nMany peers around me who are pursuing computer science and working on startups believe this is actually the easiest era to start something and succeed. Some majors naturally keep people closer to the frontier of change. I believe studying computer science, engineering, or mathematics trains you to reason from first principles, work with abstraction, and stay comfortable with uncertainty.\n\nThose habits matter more than any specific technical skills, which may quickly become outdated. Because the underlying skills are transferable, people in these fields may be better positioned to adapt when conditions change, even if the direction of change is unclear.\n\nI'm excited to pursue computer science, even though it might be uncertain how it will turn out. Things may become more complex, demanding, and challenging than I can anticipate, but I still believe there will be abundant opportunities for those who are willing to adapt, go deep, and continuously redefine their value.\n\nDo you have a story to share about higher education and AI?

    "description": "Some bigger firms are using AI to embrace a classic startup mentality to quickly identify what works — and cast aside what doesn't.",
    "fullText": "For some companies building with AI, failure isn't a setback. It's the strategy.\n\nOkta, Salesforce, Snowflake, Blackstone, and others are rapidly launching AI products, fully expecting that not all of them will pan out. Executives say they can't afford to meticulously test ideas in isolation if they want to outpace their competitors, and AI makes it easy to deploy new offerings at scale anyway.\n\n\"It's increased the pace of what's possible,\" said Eric Kelleher, president and chief operating officer of digital-identity company Okta, which has rolled out around 120 AI pilots and features over the past two years, keeping half and scrapping the rest. \"You can spin up a lot more pilots at the same time.\"\n\nThis so-called fail-fast method isn't new, as tech startups have been doing it for decades. It's now gaining traction among larger, established businesses due to the AI boom.\n\nLeaders say they're under pressure from their boards and shareholders to justify their AI spending, and that the fail-fast approach is helping them meet the moment.\n\n\"The stakes are higher, the risks are bigger, and to keep pace with the innovation churn, we need to fail faster than ever,\" Cisco's senior vice president and global innovation officer, Guy Diedrich, told Business Insider.\n\nFor some companies, fail fast isn't just a mindset — it represents a new reality driven by AI efficiency gains.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said the cloud-data platform company has rolled out numerous pilot programs, often moving from a planning meeting on Monday to a demo by Friday. With its agentic support system, he said, many cases that once took hours to debug can now be resolved in about 20 minutes.\n\nSimilarly, something like preparing a customer briefing for an executive used to take hours. Now, Ramaswamy said, it can be done in a minute by asking a sales agent.\n\nJohn Stecher, the chief technology officer at Blackstone, told Business Insider that the \"fail fast\" mindset has long been a mainstay in the engineering world, but AI tools have enabled companies to accelerate development timelines.\n\n\"Our software engineers, by quantifiable metrics, are about 2x more effective than they were in 2024 with writing code,\" Stecher said, adding that they now have the ability to deliver faster and higher quality work.\n\nHe said the \"blocking-and-tackling part of software development and engineering,\" including tasks like writing unit tests and higher-quality code, allows engineers to \"deploy more robust,\" reliable, and secure code, so that workers spend less time fixing bugs and more time building. That increase in productivity allows teams to build prototypes more quickly and launch them to users faster.\n\nRamaswamy similarly said that a lot of the heavy lifting on engineering teams for tasks like boilerplate code, tests, and migrations happens much faster. That frees workers to spend more time on tasks that require judgment, architecture, and design, he said.\n\nMoving at warp speed comes with risks, however.\n\nLast year, Salesforce launched an AI agent designed to answer customer queries, and it recommended a competitor's application to a user. The user then wrote about the snafu on LinkedIn, said Joe Inzerillo, president of enterprise and AI at the software company.\n\nAnother time, one of Salesforce's newly released AI agents provided a customer with false information gleaned from old web pages that had been removed from its website but were still crawlable by search engines. The error was discovered during a review of conversations the agent was having with users.\n\nThough both incidents exposed early-stage gaps to users, Inzerillo said they also revealed important insights into how users interact with the products and how experiences can be improved. \"We're going into every single deployment as an experiment to try to learn something,\" said Inzerillo.\n\nThe consequences of failing fast, however, can be worse if companies overlook important security measures.\n\nStecher said companies in general shouldn't necessarily deploy more products just because they can now do so more easily. He said firms need a \"robust checks and balances\" system and have data privacy and security controls in place from the get-go, or they'll pay the price with outages or cyber issues.\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy said that while the \"fail fast\" concept is reappearing, the current version is \"less about recklessness and more about shortening the feedback loop.\" He said the phrase \"iterating rapidly\" is a more accurate way to describe the company's approach to building with AI.\n\n\"We identify areas that we know are going to be generally positively impacted by AI, but set up small, almost weekly, goals,\" Ramaswamy said. \"This way, we can adjust and know when things are working well and when we need to course correct.\"",

    "description": "AI agents could eventually take on a lot of tasks done by humans. Yet hallucinations present a challenge currently, says a former Google exec.",
    "fullText": "Despite some CEOs' enthusiasm, AI agents aren't always up to the task.\n\nAgents are software programs that can perform tasks independently, such as reconciling an invoice, so that a person doesn't have to. Sounds great, right? That's why companies are plugging agents into tasks across sales, finance, supply chains, and engineering.\n\nYet while agentic systems can be effective at completing discrete tasks, they can be fragile at scale.\n\nErrors can quickly become a bottleneck if hallucinations multiply when agents interact, said Nicolas Darveau-Garneau, a former Google executive and author of the book \"Be a Sequoia, Not a Bonsai.\"\n\nIf a single agent has a 5% hallucination rate, then it's hard to daisy-chain multiple agents without a high risk of errors. That's because the risk increases exponentially, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The only way we get massive productivity gains is the day that we can trust that the AI is not hallucinating a lot,\" Darveau-Garneau said.\n\nFor now, he said, that's why general-purpose, autonomous agentic AI is largely aspirational.\n\nNevertheless, hallucinations are something that Darveau-Garneau expects will be \"mostly solved\" five years from now.\n\nIf that happens, he said, the productivity gains of 10% to 30% that some companies are getting from AI could be far greater — perhaps on the order of 10x to 100x.\n\nThose gains matter because the bigger they get, the more likely it becomes that companies will reorganize their operations, including the possibility of needing fewer employees.\n\nEven if companies don't cut staff, many roles — especially desk jobs — are likely to change.\n\nThe challenge of scaling agents and AI broadly is one reason Darveau-Garneau expects companies to still need some humans in jobs that sometimes appear to be endangered, like coding.\n\nAn excellent software engineer, he said, might be 30% to 40% more productive with AI. It's a nice lift, Darveau-Garneau said, but not a reason for a company to get rid of all its engineers.\n\nWorkers are understandably fearful of losing their jobs to AI, especially when leaders emphasize productivity gains, he said.\n\nDarveau-Garneau said that the CEO's primary job when it comes to AI is to create the right environment for adoption — including training and making sure that employees feel \"psychologically safe.\"\n\nThat's why, he said, leaders would be wise to reframe the conversation to say they want to double a company's size, for example, while increasing the employee base by 30%, rather than suggesting they deploy AI and cut 20% of the staff.\n\nOne challenge for many leaders has been understanding what new roles will look like thanks to AI, Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of strategy at Accenture, told Business Insider.\n\nThat is proving difficult, at least in part, because some current job descriptions may change, and other jobs may become redundant. Still others will have to be \"radically redefined,\" he said.\n\n\"What companies have been doing, by and large, is putting AI in the hands of people in their existing roles with existing tasks,\" Ashraf said.\n\nThat might mean automating some tasks or using AI to supercharge how someone searches for information or how quickly they can conduct a competitive analysis.\n\n\"But how does that fundamentally change my day?\" he said.\n\nCompanies have struggled, Ashraf said, if they've tended to think about adopting AI within their current ways of working, rather than redesigning the organization with an eye toward future jobs.\n\n\"It's not about layering AI on existing roles. It's about rethinking all of these processes and activities,\" he said.\n\nDespite the challenge of redesigning how companies are set up, Ashraf said it's encouraging that many C-suite leaders recognize the need to help their workers build the skills needed to prepare for the changes stemming from companies' decisions to prioritize AI.\n\nAI might still have limitations, but its rapid pace of improvement means workers themselves also need to prioritize staying current. Otherwise, they risk falling behind, Alex Salazar, cofounder and CEO of the AI infrastructure startup Arcade, told Business Insider.\n\nA year ago, the coding agents that the company's software engineers now use couldn't do any of what they can do today, he said.\n\n\"What does that mean for your job as an engineer?\" Salazar said. \"It's got to evolve.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "A few weeks ago, I was staring at a system prompt that was 127,000 tokens long. One hundred and twenty-seven thousand tokens - just the system prompt. Most of it was, you guessed it, tool schemas: JSON definitions for every possible thing the agent could do, most of which it would never touch in any given run.\n\nMy solution? I propose AgentScript: a code-first execution language where the LLM can only interact with the outside world by writing programs. No tool schemas, no function calling, no MCP, no multi-modal response gymnastics. The model writes code, a sandboxed runtime executes it, and the return value is the response. As simple as that.\n\nHere’s how tool calling works today: you define a bunch of tools as JSON schemas, stuff them into the system prompt, and hope the model picks the right one. Each tool needs a name, a description, parameter definitions, and examples. A single tool can easily consume hundreds of tokens. A production-grade system might have tens, sometimes hundrends, of tools.\n\nAnd the tools the model never uses still consume tokens - they’re sitting in the context window like furniture in a storage unit you’re paying rent on but never visiting (I would know something about that). As systems grow, you get this compounding problem: context inflation drives up latency and reduces alignment, both in turn drive up costs, and costs scale non-linearly because you’re paying for all those schema tokens on every single inference call.\n\nSince many agent tasks require iteration, filtering, branching, retries, and aggregation, when you encode these behaviors through repeated LLM calls or chained tool invocations, you’re effectively using natural language as a programming language. You’re asking the model to be both the thinker and the doer, when decades of CS have taught us that these should be separate concerns.\n\nIn the last few months, I’ve seen this become an exciting idea space: Program-of-thought prompting, code interpreter systems, Anthropic’s work on code execution with MCP - they all point to the same conclusion: models are better planners than executors, and deterministic computation belongs outside the model.\n\nAgentScript takes that insight to its logical conclusion.\n\nAgentScript enforces a code-only contract between a language model and its execution environment. In this world, the LLM is not an API client, not it is a conversational participant; it’s a program author that can only emit AgentScript code. So there is only one execution entry point, and all interaction with the world happens through code.\n\nThis collapses tool calling, function responses, and structured outputs into a single universal abstraction: program execution.\n\nThe execution model is deliberately boring:\n\nIntermediate data never enters the model’s context unless the program explicitly reads the persisted logs from the file system. This is my main insight: pull-based data access instead of push-based context stuffing.\n\nThe API surface can be intentionally tiny, for example:\n\nThe model already knows JavaScript. The API is small enough to learn once and never forget.\n\nAnd the safety model is simple: constraints are enforced by the runtime, not the model. The model can write whatever code it wants. The sandbox decides what actually executes, like only mounting the working directory, allowlisted commands, or network access.\n\nTo start with, a backwards-compatible model would be to force a tool call from LLM responses and only give it a single tool: execute_agentscript, and stop the loop based on the execution of the code.\n\nThere are also a few extensions I’m thinking about:\n\nWhen systems become too complex to reason about in prose, you re-found them on code. This has happened repeatedly in computing history, and it’s happening again now to agents.\n\nWritten on a flight from Amsterdam to New Delhi",

    "description": "As AI job losses rise in the professional sector, many are switching to more traditional trades. But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?",
    "fullText": "As AI job losses rise in the professional sector, many are switching to more traditional trades. But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?\n\nCalifornia-based Jacqueline Bowman had been dead set on becoming a writer since she was a child. At 14 she got her first internship at her local newspaper, and later she studied journalism at university. Though she hadn’t been able to make a full-time living from her favourite pastime – fiction writing – post-university, she consistently got writing work (mostly content marketing, some journalism) and went freelance full-time when she was 26. Sure, content marketing wasn’t exactly the dream, but she was writing every day, and it was paying the bills – she was happy enough.\n\n“But something really switched in 2024,” Bowman, now 30, says. Layoffs and publication closures meant that much of her work “kind of dried up. I started to get clients coming to me and talking about AI,” she says – some even brazen enough to tell her how “great” it was “that we don’t need writers any more”. She was offered work as an editor – checking and altering work produced by artificial intelligence. The idea was that polishing up already-written content would take less time than writing it from scratch, so Bowman’s fee was reduced to about half of what it had been when she was writing for the same content marketing agency – but, in reality, it ended up taking double the time.\n\n“I now had to meticulously fact-check every single thing in the articles. And at least 60% of it would be completely made up,” she says. “I would just end up rewriting most of the article. So something that would take me two hours when I was writing it by myself now took me four hours, making half the money.”\n\nTo add insult to injury, Bowman’s few remaining clients have sometimes accused her of using AI to create her work. “I never use AI to write anything,” she says, but she has noticed that AI-produced copy can sometimes seem eerily similar to her own writing – which she suspects is due to large language models being trained on some of her previous work. She can’t afford to take any of the Silicon Valley giants to court – though she is grateful for the authors, like George Saunders and Ta-Nehisi Coates, who have done so.\n\nShe remembered a psychology elective she had enjoyed in college, and wondered if she might be able to make a more secure living by becoming a therapist. “It’s not AI-proof” – Bowman admits that some people will be happy to use AI-powered therapy services, which already exist. “But there’s another subsection of people who are going to say: ‘Hey, AI took my job, AI ruined my life. I’m not going to go to an AI therapist,’” she says. “So in that way, I do think that there’s still going to be an audience who wants a human therapist.”\n\nBowman decided to take action and retrain, “while I still do have a little bit of work”, and is now back at university studying to become a marriage and family therapist. She counts herself “incredibly lucky” because she is able to rely on her husband, and on any writing work she can still get, to make ends meet – but has still had to take out loans. She’s enjoying the course, and is “glad she has the opportunity to do it”, but it is not something she would have considered if her writing work hadn’t become untenable.\n\nJanet Feenstra, an academic editor turned baker based in Malmö, Sweden, also has mixed feelings about her career change, a choice she similarly made because of fears that AI would make her old job void. “It’s complicated because, in a way, I maybe should be grateful to AI for prompting this change,” she says. Feenstra now works at “a really cute bakery”, where she and her colleagues “roll out the dough by hand and it feels amazing”.\n\n“We listen to music and we dance and sing whenever we want,” she adds. “I have a lot more fun now, but I don’t want to be grateful to AI for this – I’m still a little bit bitter.” It felt like a forced career change, rather than one she was choosing on her own terms, she explains – not to mention the fact that she now gets paid less, travels farther to work and does a much more tiring job.\n\nSince 2013, the 52-year-old, who is originally from the US, had been working as a freelance editor alongside a part-time job at Malmö University doing what is called “language editing”: tidying up texts written by researchers whose first language isn’t English.\n\n“The standard of English here in Sweden is very, very high, so this was very specialised academic editing,” she says. “The international journals are very picky, so it required a certain expertise that we could offer.” However, in recent years, she began to hear people within the university talking about wanting to use AI. “It was scary. I felt like the writing was on the wall a bit,” Feenstra says. She began to realise that if a manuscript “is already quite good”, then an AI system prompted to meet academic journal requirements might be able to do the work she had been doing.\n\n“I didn’t want to wait until it was too late,” she says. “I felt scared … I’m divorced, I have two children to look after and I need financial security.” So she decided to retrain in something she “was fairly sure that AI would not replace anytime soon”, and enrolled in culinary school.\n\nIt wasn’t an easy transition. “I had to move out because I wasn’t able to afford my rent any more,” she says, which meant that her sons, who had previously lived between their parents’ two homes, had to live full-time with their father. While Feenstra embarked on her year-long training, she moved in with her partner, whose flat was too small to house her sons as well. Now, having worked in the bakery for five months, she has recently signed a contract on a new flat, which will have room for her sons. “I’ve had to work really hard: I’ve had to retrain, I’ve had to accept lower pay and conditions that are physically challenging,” Feenstra says. But securing the flat “is really exciting because it’s a goal realised”.\n\nFeenstra says it has been “an interesting journey” to go from a job typically associated with middle-class people to one seen as working-class. “White-collar work isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, I’ve realised,” she says. “But it requires an adjustment. We’re so defined by our jobs and our class.”\n\nPerhaps those definitions of what counts as a “good” or “middle class” job will begin to change: a 2023 report on the impact of AI on jobs and training in the UK by the Department for Education concluded that: “Professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly those associated with more clerical work and across finance, law and business management roles.” And, rightly or wrongly, Feenstra is not alone in deciding that learning a trade is a relatively safe bet.\n\nAngela Joyce, the CEO of Capital City College, a further education provider in London, says: “We’re seeing a steady growth in students of all ages coming to us to do trades-based qualifications,” in subjects such as engineering, culinary arts and childcare. There is “definitely a shift” away from traditional academic routes, she says, which she attributes to the high numbers of unemployed young people – and “a good proportion of those are graduates”, she notes. That shift towards seeking vocational training is “in part linked to AI”, Joyce thinks, because people are looking for “jobs that AI can’t replace”.\n\nThat was certainly the case for Richard, a Northampton-based chartered occupational health and safety professional. After working his way up the career ladder for 15 years, the 39-year-old decided to jump ship and retrain as an electrical engineer.\n\n“Health and safety isn’t going to disappear any time soon because organisations can’t name AI as a responsible person or a duty holder for businesses legally,” he says. But a few years ago, he started to hear “mumblings of AI” within the industry, and saw organisations start to experiment with automating certain systems and procedures. He watched as AI began to be used for writing policies and safe systems of work, and realised that if a large portion of practitioners’ workload could be done by AI, then there might only be a need for “highly specialised managers. The rest of it’s probably going to go.”\n\nThough he decided to “pre-empt that” and pursue a different path, his main worry about AI taking over health and safety roles wasn’t actually that people like him would lose jobs – he finds aspects of AI “exciting” and accepts that it will inevitably shake up the way we work. His primary concern was that the implementation of AI might be “more of a cost-cutting exercise than it is about safety”. Richard cares deeply about the health and safety industry, which he entered after his friend was killed in a gas explosion at work.\n\nHe has taken “a huge cut” financially since he has been working as an electrical engineer over the past year, but his new job does at least still have keeping people safe at its core. And there is the potential to make the kind of money he earned in his old job once he has more experience under his belt, he says, but “I’m a good five, 10 years off”. And that’s if automation hasn’t come for electrical work by then – Richard mentions BMW’s testing of a humanoid robot as an example of how AI could affect trade jobs. Currently, though, the trades, in the UK at least, are “the most resilient to the levels of automation that AI is bringing in”, Richard believes. “Companies are capitalising on AI to remove one of their biggest costs, which is human overheads,” he says. “You need to pick something which has resilience. So, statistically, that is not your roles that are bureaucratic by nature, heavy in data and are just a bunch of processes which you repeat end on end. It needs to be something with high dexterity and some high problem-solving skills.”\n\nCarl Benedikt Frey, an associate professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, agrees that manual work “is going to be harder to automate”, but predicts that AI will have an impact “across a very wide range of industries” – trades included. “If the dishwasher breaks down in my home, I can take a picture and I can quiz the large language model of my choice, and I’m more likely to be able to fix it myself these days without calling an engineer,” he says. That’s not to say tradespeople are “doomed” – he cautions against making too many decisions based on “some hypothetical future scenario … We have to go by what’s actually happening in the labour market.” Which, now, is not a lot. “We’re beginning to see some studies suggesting more of an impact on entry-level work,” Frey says, but a reduction in entry-level job opportunities could also be attributed to higher interest rates, or post-pandemic recovery, he says.\n\n“As AI gets better, and its capabilities improve, I think it’s likely that we will see it on a bigger slice of the labour market. But we’re not seeing it yet.” In fact, Frey has now reassessed his earlier claim that 47% of roles were at risk of being replaced by computerisation, made in The Future of Employment, the 2013 paper he co-authored with Prof Michael Osborne. “In that study, a lot of the jobs that we deem are highly exposed to automation are jobs in transportation and logistics because of autonomous vehicles,” he says. “It’s fair to say that it’s taken much longer for that technology to materialise.” As self-driving cars do begin to hit our streets, “we will see a lot of jobs being replaced in trucking and even in taxi services”, Frey believes. But his message seems to be don’t panic – at least not yet. “It might be a good idea if you are, say, in the early days of your professional career, to take the time that you still have to invest in training and figuring out other more viable career paths,” particularly if you work as a translator – one profession where “we’re already seeing that AI is having an impact, although we’re not seeing mass displacement by any means”. But if you are reaching the end of your working life, “you can probably ride the wave for a few more years”, he says.\n\nThe most significant AI-caused declines in employment and wages will be in jobs like software engineering and management consultancy, according to a King’s College London study published in October 2025. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that there aren’t going to be new jobs that will be created,” Dr Bouke Klein Teeselink, who authored that study, notes. Historically, whenever there have been technological advances people have worried about mass unemployment, but it hasn’t happened, he says. “So there’s a part of me that is a little bit sceptical that all the jobs will disappear, but at the same time there is a reason to think that this technology might be different, in the sense that humans always maintained some type of absolute advantage over technology in certain domains. And that may no longer be true.”\n\nFor now, while we can’t yet know the full impact AI will have on workers, “becoming really good at working with AI is probably going to be a skill that will pay off”, Klein advises. Which is what the Birmingham-based entrepreneurs Fayyaz Garda and Arun Singh Aujla, both 25, are attempting to do. Garda, who works in procurement, and Singh Aujla, who runs a social media marketing business, are in the process of setting up an AI consulting business, educating themselves about AI via YouTube. “It’s a growing market, and there’s definitely a space for it. So I’m hoping to try and get in there early,” Garda says. The plan is to employ a number of engineers to create AI systems that will answer phone calls, respond to mail and fulfil other tasks businesses need doing, he explains.\n\n“The AI consulting business is one way I’m upskilling to move with the times,” Singh Aujla adds. “AI won’t replace me, but it may take a large market share out of my business. So it’s always good to make an extra stream of revenue.” There are certain roles Singh Aujla would never replace with AI, though: “I would not replace my management team. You need that human interaction with your team,” he says. “But roles the team don’t want to do, like email outreach and cold calling, we can get AI agents to do that.”\n\nFor some, it may well prove true that AI improves their work life by removing tasks they find tedious or difficult, giving them more time to focus on the more fulfilling aspects of their job. For others, though, it is the reason they have given up on their dream career. Paola Adeitan, 31, had her heart set on being a solicitor, and obtained an undergraduate degree and a master’s in law. She had planned to do the legal practice course, the final stage of training needed to qualify as a solicitor, “but I decided not to pursue that path because I felt like, with the change in technology, the AI, that might not be a viable path for me to carry on with,” she says. Friends of hers had struggled to get entry-level law roles, which she believed to be partly due to the increased use of AI at law firms.\n\nAdeitan still volunteers as a legal adviser, but her day job is in the health sector – although even that role could be affected by AI, she thinks, so she is remaining open to the idea that she might end up retraining again. “I do feel a sense of disappointment,” she says, “but the nature of work is changing. It’s very difficult now to decide what you want to do; you have to think carefully. It’s not about what you want any more; it’s about what is going to be there, what’s going to work.”\n\nIf you’re lucky, what ends up working best could be something you really enjoy – as is the case for Faz, 23, who took a break from his geography degree at the University of Manchester in 2023 because of a family matter. Afterwards, it didn’t make sense to him to return to his degree. “I had to think about what was future-proof, I had to think about what was AI-proof. And it seemed like a lot of entry-level roles in the corporate sector were being taken over by AI. And because AI is so unpredictable, you never know if those more specialised roles will also become obsolete,” he says. So he has instead been training for a Level 2 qualification in electrical installation since September 2025. “I thoroughly enjoy it,” he says. Though he might go back to university at some point – his “ideal setup” would be a combination of working part-time for a council or a charity, while doing electrical work on the side – “right now, a tradie job is 100%, God willing, the correct choice. I’m fairly certain it will be future-proofed against AI.”\n\nBethan, 24, from Bristol, also enjoys her AI-proof job, working in a local cafe. But it comes at a cost: she has hypermobility spectrum disorder, which gives her severe joint pain and makes it hard for her to move around. “I can’t work long hours now because I’ve pushed my body past the point,” she says.\n\nBethan’s old job, at a university IT helpdesk, “was the first job that I didn’t come home in pain from”, she says. But only a couple of months after she was hired, she and her colleagues were told the helpdesk was being closed down and replaced with an AI kiosk. “It was awful,” she says. The helpdesk staff tried to defend their roles, arguing that for students who didn’t speak English as a first language, or older students who weren’t computer-literate, having humans behind the desk may still be necessary. “It felt like we were getting completely ignored. They went ahead with it because they said they had to get a certain number of cuts to the budget.”\n\nHospitality was the only other sector in which she had experience, so she ended up at her cafe job. “Feeling like I had to go back to hospitality, which was so bad for my body, was a horrible feeling,” she says. She is now on the lookout for an office job, but has struggled to find anything entry-level. “Those are the jobs that are vanishing because they’re the easiest to replace,” she says – but it also means it is impossible to get the experience needed for higher-up roles. Bethan worries that even if she does get an office job, she could lose it to AI again. “Is it worth all the effort of applying, getting my CV up to date, and potentially doing a couple of rounds of interviews just to find out at the end we’re going to be replaced again?”\n\nWith more physically demanding jobs making up the bulk of what is now considered “AI-proof”, those who have made the switch from white-collar roles are having to adapt to the toll it takes on their bodies. The electricians Richard works with are typically in their late teens and early 20s. “Their recovery rates are a hell of a lot quicker than mine. So if I pick up an injury, for example, it takes me far longer to recuperate. Also, they can work far longer hours than I can,” he says.\n\nAnd though Feenstra enjoys the physicality of working in a bakery, she has been thinking about how sustainable this kind of job will be as she gets older. “That’s why I’ve been taking note of how the owners run the business,” she says, in case there is a possibility of running her own bakery one day. She is proud of how she is continuing to adapt to the changing world around her: “I want my sons to feel a little bit inspired by that,” she says. Yet she doesn’t feel she can offer them career advice. “How am I supposed to advise them when I don’t even really know if what I’m doing is the right path?” she says. “It’s really unsettling when you can’t advise them. If they have a passion for something and they want to do something, immediately you think, OK, is this even going to exist in the next 10, 20 years? That just kind of sucks.”\n\nBallerinas will still exist, says Klein. “No one is going to go to the ballet to see a robot do really good ballet,” the academic says. “Same for theatre, same for football, same for many other things where it matters that there’s a human.” He doesn’t think people will be wanting to confess to robo-priests any time soon either, or leave children in the care of AI. “There are just categories where we prefer to interact with humans, right?” For that reason, social skills will remain important, Klein and Frey agree. And though it might seem as if AI could make expert knowledge useless, Klein disagrees. “I have students who use AI naively, and therefore they have no idea whether the reports they produce are good or bad,” he says. “You need to have that expertise to be able to guide the AI to get it to do what you need it to do. So in that sense, I think the value of expertise might actually go up.”\n\nHow such expertise will be developed, if entry-level jobs are being ditched in favour of AI systems, is a question that remains as yet unanswered, as is who will actually be able to buy a ticket to the ballet should large swathes of the population be put out of work. But Frey doesn’t think it is worth spending too much time worrying about that potential future – yet. “It could well arrive, but it matters a great deal if that happens in five years or 20.” While he acknowledges “there are reasons to be concerned”, Frey doesn’t think it’s time to “paint a scenario where everybody’s going to be out of work five years from now, and we need to rethink everything”.",

    "description": "Dan Ives says Wall Street is underestimating software's role in the AI boom, calling the skepticism \"disconnected.\"",
    "fullText": "Wall Street may be getting the AI trade wrong, says Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and longtime tech bull.\n\nIves said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" published Tuesday that the recent investor pessimism toward software companies is 'the most disconnected call that I've ever seen.\"\n\nWhile much of the AI excitement has centered on data centers, chips, and GPUs, Ives said software will be the \"heart and lungs of the AI revolution.\"\n\nThe infrastructure buildout is still in its early innings and could stretch over the next decade. But software is where the real use cases and monetization will emerge, he added.\n\nIves said it is wrong to assume that big software companies like Salesforce and ServiceNow are \"structurally broken\" or set to be replaced by AI-native tools.\n\nThese companies are deeply embedded in enterprise stacks, with hundreds of thousands of customers, Ives said, adding that their AI use cases could unlock incremental revenue over the next six to 18 months that investors are not yet pricing in.\n\nLarge, entrenched platforms should not be compared to smaller players that serve small and medium-sized businesses. \"You cannot paint all of them with the same brush,\" Ives said.\n\nIves also defended Microsoft's role in the AI revolution. While acknowledging near-term concerns around capital spending and Azure growth, Ives said the broader AI rollout cannot succeed without Microsoft's software and cloud ecosystem.\n\nIves' comments came after software stocks tumbled last week amid investor fears that AI could disrupt large swaths of the industry.\n\nNot all tech and finance leaders think AI will replace traditional software companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed that idea at a Cisco AI event last week.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI,\" Huang said. \"You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself,\" he added.\n\nHuang said AI depends on the tools software offers and pointed to ServiceNow, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis as examples of software firms well-positioned in the AI era.\n\nIves also wrote in an industry note published last week that the \"software armageddon\" can be regarded as a tech stock \"garage sale.\"\n\n\"We believe the market is baking in a doomsday scenario for software companies in the near-term, which we believe is extremely overblown, as many customers won't be willing to put their data at risk to capitalize on AI implementation strategies until there is less risk with these migration projects,\" Ives and his analysts wrote.\n\nIves has long urged investors to buy tech dips, even as critics caution that AI enthusiasm may be running ahead of earnings and real-world adoption.",

    "fullText": "Rules of mysterious ancient Roman board game decoded by AI\n\nA Roman stone board game has been unplayable since its discovery more than a century ago, but AI might have just worked out the rules\n\nJoin Our Community of Science Lovers!\n\nIt was the summer of 2020, and researcher Walter Crist was wandering around the exhibits inside a Dutch museum dedicated to the presence of the ancient Roman empire in the Netherlands. As a scientist who studies ancient board games, one exhibit stuck out to Crist: a stone game board dating to the late Roman Empire. It was about eight inches across and etched with angular lines that roughly formed the shape of an oblong octagon inside a rectangle.\n\n“I thought to myself, ‘Well, that’s very interesting,’ because the pattern on it—it’s not something I had ever seen in the literature before,” Crist says.\n\nWhat the game was called and how it was played were a mystery, too.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nCrist contacted the museum curators to get a closer look. And now he and his colleagues believe they’ve decoded the game in a first-of-its-kind study using a combination of more traditional archaeological methods and artificial intelligence. According to the analysis, the object appears to be a sort of “blocking game.” In these types of games, one player tries to block another from moving; one example is tic-tac-toe.\n\nThe research was published on Monday in the journal Antiquity.\n\nCrist, now a guest lecturer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, recalls that when he and his team started investigating the board game, they didn’t have a ton of details to work with. They knew that the game board had been found around the late 1800s or early 1900s in the southeastern Netherlands’ city of Heerlen—which would have been the city of Coriovallum in Roman times. The board was made out limestone that was imported from France. And the game was likely played casually and may not have been particularly notable, in part because there is no known documentation of it in written texts from the time.\n\nTo decipher the rules, Crist’s team programmed two AI agents to play the game over and over again using more than 100 different sets of rules taken from other known European games, both ancient and modern. As the AI agents played—1,000 games per set of rules—the researchers tracked how the pieces moved. Then they compared the moves with the levels of wear on areas of the board, tracing which gameplay seemed to replicate grooves on the stone.\n\nThe team found nine rule sets that appeared “consistent” with the wear on the board. “And they were all variations of this same kind of blocking game,” Crist says.\n\nThis type of game was played in the 19th and 20th centuries in Scandinavia, and researchers thought it dated to early medieval times. But the Roman game is the earliest example of such a game in Europe, Crist says. He and his team called the game Ludus Coriovalli, Latin for “the game from Coriovallum.” (You can play it online here.)\n\nCrist hopes the study will help researchers solve other ancient board games. Such games offer a way to connect the ancient past to our own lives, he says. Indeed, they haven’t changed much over the centuries. The ancient Egyptian board game Senet, for example, might not have been all that different from Sorry! Chess, meanwhile, is thought to have originated in ancient India, and nobody really knows when or where backgammon originated.\n\nUnderstanding how ancient games might’ve been played, Crist says, “can lead us to new insights on how people in the past enjoyed their lives.”\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.

He ran a large portion of the company until late last year, when several of his responsibilities were split between two other cofounders, Tony Wu and Guodong Zhang, people with knowledge of the move told Business Insider.\n\nBa also previously ran the team that oversaw more than a thousand AI tutors, according to an org chart from earlier last year. That role was given to Diego Pasini in September, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nBa is the second cofounder to depart the company in less than 48 hours. Wu announced he'd resigned from the AI startup on Monday night. Wu's Slack account was deactivated shortly before the announcement, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nAhead of Wu's departure, xAI underwent another restructuring, and several of his responsibilities were shifted under Zhang.\n\nMusk launched the AI company in 2023 with 11 other founders. Six have now left the company — five of them within the last year.\n\nIn addition to his work at xAI, Ba is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto in the computer science department. He received his Ph.D. from the school while studying under Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the \"godfather of AI.\"\n\nMusk has said he built xAI as an alternative to what he's called \"woke\" chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Over the past year, the company has become known for pushing the envelope. Last July, xAI launched a sexy digital avatar called \"Ani,\" and its Grok chatbot went on an antisemitic rant.\n\nMost recently, xAI has come under fire after Grok began generating nonconsensual sexual images of real people in response to X user prompts. The backlash eventually prompted the company to restrict Grok's image-generation features on X.\n\nLast week, Musk announced that xAI would merge with his rocket company, SpaceX. The company is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value SpaceX at $1.5 trillion.\n\nBa and xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "The CEO of StackBlitz, Eric Simons, says the web development startup has \"gone all in\" on AI agents.",
    "fullText": "StackBlitz CEO Eric Simons aims to have more AI agents than human employees working at the startup this year, a milestone he sees as emblematic of a broader shift underway across the software industry.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Business Insider, Simons said StackBlitz has \"gone all in on agents,\" deploying internally built AI systems across business intelligence, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\nAI has become increasingly good at writing software code, to the point where the technology is beginning to change how companies are run. OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage, is an early example of digital agents communicating and coordinating with one another without direct human involvement.\n\n\"To me, this is a crystal ball into the wildness of the inevitable future,\" Simons told Business Insider. \"Your AI agents will talk to other people's agents on your behalf, negotiating pricing for a product you want to buy, inquiring about availability for a restaurant, arguing your political viewpoints.\"\n\n\"Agents are an extension of yourself,\" he added. \"People will generally trust their agents with whatever they recommend them to buy, reserve, believe, or otherwise.\"\n\nSimons's comments come as software and SaaS stocks have slumped in recent weeks, a move he attributes to growing investor recognition that AI can now build software autonomously. As AI tools become more capable, he said, long-standing competitive moats based on specialized knowledge are eroding.\n\nHe compared the shift to the transformation of manufacturing over the past century. Craft knowledge once protected businesses, he said, but automation and digital design ultimately displaced many incumbents. \"Today, it's a CAD file you can 3D print,\" Simons said.\n\n\"While every individual does not use these profound new powers directly (like 3D printing a chair), there's an entire new generation of companies that do — and they have replaced the previous era of companies,\" Simons explained. \"They disrupted those incumbents by leveraging automation that made it far cheaper and at a massive scale not possible previously when moats were just knowledge and bare hands.\"\n\nFor businesses, the implications are stark. Even traditionally \"safe\" enterprise software may be vulnerable if AI agents can migrate or rebuild systems rapidly.\n\n\"What does it mean when all of software can be written, rewritten, migrated, or otherwise, 100x or 10,000x faster than it could've ever been done before, by a workforce that does not sleep, and can be parallelized near infinitely?\" Simons said. \"It's daunting and mind-bending, and I think the repricing of SaaS in public markets more accurately reflects this today.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Another week, another round of jitters caused by fears of widespread AI disruption.\n\nOn Tuesday, financial firms and brokerages saw their shares fall as tech firm Altruist boasted its new Hazel AI tool could assist with tax planning for clients \"within minutes.\"\n\nHere were the big moves on Tuesday:\n\nThe iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF was down 4%.\n\nThe fear isn't explicitly tied to the tax services these companies provide, but rather that cheap AI tools will soon be more widely available for a range of financial services offered by big companies, eating into margins.\n\nIt's a nearly identical fear that shook the software space last week. After Anthropic rolled out new tools for its Cowork agent aimed at professionals in the legal space, the entire sector sold off as investors eyed the potential for wider disruption.\n\nOther brokerage stocks, such as Interactive Brokers and Morgan Stanley, fared slightly better on Tuesday. The fact that both firms cater to institutional traders implies that Wall Street is more concerned about retail-facing brokerage stocks.\n\nCompanies in the accounting space, such as QuickBooks owner Intuit, fell about 3%. Accounting software makers SAP SE and Xero rose 1% and 2% respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI approved the integration of an AI application on ChatGPT to enable users to receive direct insurance quotes on the platform.\n\nNeither platform directly offers users the ability to trade stocks, but for the market, the key concern is that AI disruption is poised to upend the financial sector, as it did the legal technology field last week.\n\nMarkets have largely recovered from the tech plunge last week, with multiple analysts saying this week that the event represents a buy-the-dip moment. Still, markets are on edge as new disruptive tools continue to emerge.",

Since August 2025, Riverside County’s new Occupancy Detection System has been quietly documenting every solo driver pretending their gym bag is a passenger, recovering over $1 million in unpaid tolls and fees.\n\nThe technology reads like something from a dystopian Netflix series, except it’s scanning your morning commute. Cameras positioned at the end of the expressway capture multiple photographs of vehicle interiors. AI software flags potential violations before human reviewers at the Riverside County Transportation Commission confirm whether you actually have three people aboard. Get caught? You’ll pay the full toll plus a $5 “correction fee” — their polite term for getting busted.\n\nThis isn’t your typical red-light camera — the system spots fake passengers with unsettling accuracy.\n\nRCTC spokesperson Ariel Alcon reports catching drivers using “hats on headrests, putting items in baby car seats and even using mannequins” to fool the old enforcement system. The ODS isn’t impressed by your creativity. The technology distinguishes between actual humans and decoy passengers, even identifying properly installed car seats as legitimate occupants.\n\nConsider the scale: 400,000 cars use the 91 daily, with more than 100,000 breaking HOV rules. That’s roughly one in four drivers thinking they’re smarter than the system. Spoiler alert: they’re not.\n\nOfficials promise face-blurring and privacy compliance, but your driving habits are now permanent data.\n\nThe system protects privacy by blurring faces and storing images according to state and federal privacy laws. If you dispute a violation, you can call customer service at (800) 600-9191 or file online appeals through your 91 Express Lanes account. According to RCTC staff, most people don’t bother challenging charges once they learn about the cameras. That quiet acceptance speaks volumes about our collective resignation to surveillance infrastructure.\n\nThe 91’s success virtually guarantees expansion to other California carpool lanes. Your morning commute just became a case study in how automation transforms enforcement from occasional human oversight to constant digital monitoring.

    "description": "Artificial intelligence can write you a passable love poem and some people even have romantic feelings towards it. But is the feeling mutual?",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence can write you a passable love poem and some people even have romantic feelings towards it. But is the feeling mutual?\n\nPeople are falling for AI. Really. Take the man in Canada, for example, who recently proposed to an avatar called Saia. He says he is in love with it. And last year, a young American woman using the pseudonym Ayrin confessed to having a love affair with a chatbot named Leo.\n\nThere are millions of users now actively using Replika, a popular AI companion app, and, according to a 2024 study, about 40% of them are in a romantic relationship with their chatbot. However, while some people might feel as though AI can love them back, a chatbot's responses are nothing more than text generated by algorithms designed to imitate human interactions. Most experts agree that such systems are far from sentient. They're currently just mimicking emotion, but some experts believe the machines might be able to manage \n\n\"Nowadays, a lot of AI chatbots are pretending to be human and that really bothers me,\" says Renwen Zhang, an assistant professor in the department of communications and new media at the National Institute of Singapore. \"It's a strategy to drive user engagement and to increase trust.\"\n\nPut like that, the tugging of human emotions by a product created by technology companies begins to look like a cynical tactic. Certainly, no AI at present is ever going to feel the same way about you as you might about it, experts say.\n\nWhile the large language models (LLMs) behind widely-used chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude might be comparable to humans when it comes to understanding emotions, that doesn't mean that an AI can actually feel anything. Zhang's research, which examined excerpts from conversations between more than 10,000 users and their Replika companions, suggests that people often form an emotional attachment to AI. But they are also, somewhat tragically, reminded that they are interacting with just a machine whenever it breaks down or freezes, for example. Sadly, such people often get hurt.\n\n\"I think AI chatbots need to clearly convey to users that they are just machines: they don't have genuine emotions and experiences,\" says Zhang.\n\nIn other work examining human relationships with AI, Zhang and her colleagues noticed that people often experienced an eerie feeling as well as a mix of positive and negative emotions when an AI responded as though it were a self-aware human during intimate encounters. She says it is similar to people sometimes finding robots creepy when they look too human, called the uncanny valley effect.\n\nIt's not easy to define love. But it's worth celebrating what we do know about this incredible human experience. Many poems, books, songs and so on help people process and express some of the most powerful feelings they'll ever experience. Humans came up with all of that. AI can of course write poems and even entire novels in just seconds, drawing on the entire breadth of human-generated material they have been trained on. But expecting AI to truly understand and experience love, with all of its mystery and depth, is a big ask.\n\nWhile the concept of romantic love may mean somewhat different things to different people, in recent decades scientists have examined the biology of reproduction and the brain processes involved in choosing a sexual partner.\n\nIn a research paper published in 1998, biological anthropologist Helen Fisher came up with a leading theory of romantic love, describing it as three independent drives affected by chemicals in our bodies. Lust, governed by sex hormones, is one. The other two, attraction and attachment, are influenced by the release of chemicals in our brain. Dopamine, for example, triggers excitement towards a love interest while oxytocin, dubbed the cuddle hormone, helps to promote a long-term bond.\n\n\"Love has a strong chemical component,\" says Neil McArthur, a professor of philosophy specialising in ethics and technology at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. \"We really feel it in our bones, in our chemistry.\"\n\nDifferent parts of the brain are involved in love and brain scans of people in the throes of love have captured this.\n\nPrimitive brain regions linked to pleasure, such as the ventral tegmental area, for example, are activated along with the amygdala, which is responsible for emotional responses and the hippocampus, which processes emotions and helps form memories. Being in love can also impact other cognitive abilities, for example when we end up thinking about someone obsessively during the early stages of a romance.\n\nThe closest AI might get to love is replicating some of the thought processes involved, such as wanting to frequently contact a person with whom we are in love, suggests McArthur.\n\n\"An AI that goes through a cognitive process that ties them to someone in a bond of loyalty is not going to be exactly like human love,\" says McArthur. \"But maybe we could call it, in some kind of scare quotes at least, an emotion.\"\n\nWhile some researchers believe emotion will be a vital aspect to build into AI in the future, others are highly sceptical that any machine will truly be able to experience emotions in anything approaching our own experience of them.\n\nSince computers running software don't experience love the way we do, the feelings involved in human-AI relationships are inevitably one-sided. The dynamics of these romances are therefore much more limited than those that occur between humans.\n\nChatbots are typically designed to engage users and agree with their viewpoints, which often results in AI romantic partners being submissive. This appeals to some, though Zhang finds the dynamic concerning, since it can affect a person's ability to build and sustain meaningful relationships with other – perhaps less-submissive – humans.\n\n\"People can temporarily escape from the messiness of human relationships and find some comfort from AI – but in the long run it's not helpful in developing communication skills and the skill to maintain relationships in the real world,\" she says.\n\nFundamentally, to love someone as we do probably requires consciousness, meaning a subjective awareness – our thoughts, perceptions and mental imagery. Conscious experiences are central to being human and can range from perceiving a smell, to reflecting on why we might feel embarrassed. Researchers have different views on how such consciousness emerges and there are still many mysteries to solve, making it difficult to replicate in a machine.\n\n\"No one has any clue about getting any specific conscious experience out of an AI,\" says Donald Hoffman, a professor of cognitive sciences at the University of California, Irvine. \"It's not like we're almost there: we don't know how to start.\"\n\nA leading theory developed by neuroscientists Giulio Tonini from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Christof Koch from the Allen Institute in Seattle, Washington suggests that consciousness arises from the interconnection of different parts of the brain, and how they influence each other. Although it could apply to computers too, Koch argues that level of interconnectedness would never happen in existing machines since their architecture is not complex enough.\n\nHoffman, on the other hand, says that conscious experiences such as love don't necessarily originate from circuitry in the brain. There is yet to be any definitive proof of that, he adds.\n\nSome experts say that AI systems could become conscious in the future. Koch, for example, suggests that neuromorphic computing, a novel approach to AI that mimics the structure and function of the human brain, could be a candidate since it would have a higher degree of integration than current systems.\n\nConscious machines are plausible agrees Patrick Butlin, a philosopher of mind and cognitive science, who is a researcher at the University of Oxford's Global Priorities Institute. He and colleagues examined leading theories of consciousness and selected 14 properties that developers of AI systems could try to replicate. No existing AI system has incorporated more than a few of them, Butlin says, but all could theoretically be met using current technologies.\n\n\"I do think that there's a realistic possibility that if somebody who was efficiently well-resourced, skilful and motivated set out to build a conscious AI system, then they could achieve it,\" he says.\n\nAmong those properties Butlin and his colleagues identified for achieving consciousness was the need for a body. This is something that many current AI systems lack.\n\nBeing able to experience beliefs and desires also seems key for our ability to love someone. But researchers are currently divided over whether AI systems can be said to believe anything, says Butlin.\n\n• Is there something special about the human voice?\n\n• The riddles humans can solve but robots cannot\n\nEven if AI were to become conscious, Butlin thinks that people would ultimately have to come up with some objective standards when trying to decide whether they can experience love. Since machines are not human, they could never love us back in the same way. Butlin compares it to determining whether non-human animals, which have a wide range of social structures and cognitive capacities, are capable of love.\n\n\"There are probably going to be some examples where we intuitively feel like it's pretty plausible and other examples where we don't but it's hard to draw the line exactly,\" says Butlin. \"Whether we think AI [can experience love] is also going to depend on a bit of line-drawing: they're inevitably going to be different from humans.\"\n\nFor more technology news and insights, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "fullText": "We still don't know what OpenAI's mysterious hardware device is — but now we have a better idea of when we might get our hands on it.\n\nThe company just revealed it doesn't expect to ship the product it's building with legendary Apple designer Jony Ive before February 2027.\n\nThe admission came in a Monday court filing by OpenAI amid a dispute with the startup Iyo, which sued OpenAI last year over the \"io\" trademark.\n\nThe previously known public timeline for the OpenAI device, shared by the company's chief global affairs officer at Davos last month, was a product reveal in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe Monday filing contained a sworn statement from Peter Welinder, the vice president and general manager at OpenAI, stating that the company expects its \"first hardware device will not ship to customers before the end of February 2027.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether OpenAI still plans to unveil the new device later this year before shipping it in 2027. An OpenAI spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOpenAI announced last year that it would acquire Ive's hardware company, io Products, in a deal valued at nearly $6.5 billion.\n\nIn June last year, after Iyo sued OpenAI, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing OpenAI from using the \"io\" trademark. OpenAI then scrubbed mentions of its partnership with Ive from its website, as well as a promotional video.\n\nIn the Monday filing, OpenAI's lawyers said the company no longer planned to use the \"io\" name for its product. The company had \"reevaluated the branding of their forthcoming hardware products in light of OpenAI's existing brands,\" they wrote in the filing, adding that the name would not be used for marketing or \"sale of any artificial intelligence-enabled hardware products.\"\n\nThe lawyers argued that an April 2026 preliminary injunction hearing, which had been scheduled by the court, would therefore be \"both unnecessary and impractical.\"\n\nWired previously reported on elements of Monday's court filing.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Ive and OpenAI's first hardware product has sparked much speculation, including whether it will take the form of earbuds, a pen, glasses, or something else.\n\nA video purporting to tease the new device circulated over the weekend, which OpenAI said was \"totally fake.\" A now-deleted Reddit post claimed the video was a shelved ad teasing earbuds with actor Alexander Skarsgård.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "If you're starting your career at PwC, deciding where you'll do it has gotten a lot easier.\n\nThe Big Four firm cut the number of US locations where entry-level consultants can start working to just 13, BI's Polly Thompson exclusively reports.\n\nLimiting the options — new hires could previously choose any of the 72 US offices — is about building a greater sense of community among junior employees early in their careers, Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, told Polly.\n\nIt's an example of how PwC is evolving in the AI era. Polly previously reported on the firm's launch of a learning initiative to train workers in specific skills necessary for AI. It also created a new career path aimed at engineers.\n\nIt's not just PwC. Polly has done a fantastic job covering consulting firms and their attempt to use AI without upending their business. AI agents are still falling short of outright replacing human consultants, but the CEO of one AI training giant told BI the models are learning fast.\n\nIn the meantime, AI use by entry-level employees remains a key issue.\n\nOn the one hand, the tech can automate a lot of the mind-numbing work that juniors get bogged down with early on. On the other hand, skipping that initial work means losing foundational knowledge that is crucial down the road.\n\nThe AI-for-juniors issue isn't specific to consulting.\n\nThe risks posed by training young workers on AI are universal. And with so much emphasis on benefiting from AI, companies can't delay their decision much longer.\n\n\"What differentiates outperformers in 2026 won't be strategy; it will be execution,\" Paul Griggs, CEO of PwC US, told me last month when discussing big themes for the year.\n\nLeaders need to be \"hyper intentional around discipline, around road maps, around building teams that are measured based on what they execute,\" Griggs added.\n\nTwo senior bankers I spoke with last month raised questions about how to use AI efficiently early in your career. They debated the benefits of expediting a junior's path toward more impactful work, alongside the risks of creating a knowledge gap by skipping early steps.\n\nIt's a tricky balance. Forgoing it entirely means you risk falling behind your competitors. Leaning in too heavily risks losing the attribute your clients still pay you big bucks for: human judgment.\n\n\"You're missing some of this basic training that's actually a very important underpin and foundation to your more sophisticated evaluation and judgment of things at a later stage in your career,\" one of the bankers said about outsourcing early work to AI.",

    "fullText": "New York-based cybersecurity startup Reco has raised $30 million in Series B funding as companies rapidly expand their AI use.\n\nOfer Klein, Gal Nakash, and Tal Shapira founded Reco in 2020 to fill the gap between a company's existing cybersecurity protections and the other tech tools employees use, which is often AI.\n\n\"AI adoption has accelerated exponentially, and companies that blocked AI access a year ago cannot block it anymore,\" Klein told Business Insider. \"And I'm not talking about small mom-and-pop shops; I'm talking about the biggest banks, insurance, healthcare, pharma, and hospitals.\"\n\nZeev Ventures led its latest round, with participation from all existing investors, which includes Insight Partners and Boldstart Ventures. New corporate investors for this round include Workday Ventures, TIAA Ventures, S Ventures, and Quadrille Capital.\n\n\"My investment strategy has always been to double down on what's working,\" Oren Zeev, the famed seed investor behind Zeev Ventures, said in a statement. \"I've seen this pattern with successful companies like Navan and Tipalti, and I'm seeing it again with Reco. The signals we see show rapidly growing market demand for AI SaaS security, and we are experiencing exceptional growth.\"\n\nWhile software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks have recently plunged amid concerns about AI disruption, Zeev sees a \"massive\" opportunity in AI for security.\n\nAfter growing 500% year-over-year in 2024, Reco said it grew an additional 400% in 2025, driven by a sharp increase in business AI adoption.\n\nCybersecurity startups also raised nearly $14 billion in 2025, according to Pinpoint Search Group. That represented a 47% increase from 2024 and the most funding since 2021.\n\nKlein said Reco began pulling in far larger companies than expected, repeatedly beating internal plans as AI went from blocked to mandatory.\n\n\"We built a plan, and we overachieved, and we updated the plan, and we overachieved again,\" said Klein. \"We said, 'OK, enough is enough, let's take more money and double down on AI SaaS.\"'\n\nKlein said the biggest challenge for Reco now is keeping up with demand.\n\n\"The business is driving this huge traction into AI enablement,\" he said. \"Our biggest challenge right now: how we grow fast enough to meet this market need.\"\n\nKlein's cofounders also bring in experience from working with the government. Nakash previously headed research at the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel, while Shapira holds a machine learning Ph.D. and also worked at Israel's Office of the Prime Minister.\n\nReco faces competition from Torq, backed by Insight Partners and now valued at $1.2 billion, according to PitchBook.

    "description": "At a financial services conference in Miami, David Solomon cited a backlog of private equity spending and AI as key capital-generating drivers.",
    "fullText": "David Solomon is officially done playing defense.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs CEO has steered the bank through several grueling years for the industry, including a multi-year drought in private equity spending and extreme trading volatility. But after a booming 2025, Solomon told investors at a UBS financial services conference on Tuesday that the firm is entering 2026 with the wind at its back.\n\nSolomon praised policymakers in Washington for spurring acquisitive appetites. \"You have a massive deregulatory trend in the United States after a very tough regulatory period in the United States, across all industries,\" Solomon said.\n\nThe receptive comments about the government's heightened support for M&A came just months after President Donald Trump lashed out at Solomon on Truth Social in August, mocking his former side gig as a DJ and encouraging him to step down from the CEO throne. Trump's rebuke came after a Goldman Sachs economist suggested that tariff policies could cost consumers.\n\nDespite that dustup, Solomon is now leaning into the administration's growth-oriented agenda, arguing that the friction of the past has been replaced by a \"constructive\" new reality for the banking sector.\n\nHere are the three factors Solomon named on Tuesday that have left him feeling bullish about 2026's dealmaking forecast.\n\nSolomon thinks that, coming off strong results last quarter, 2026 will represent an inflection point for the global mood toward M&A. For the past five years, he said, strategic buyers had encountered a \"different regulatory regime,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, the answer was no.\"\n\n\"Now, whatever the question is, the answer's maybe,\" he told UBS Erika Najarian, who hosted the discussion.\n\nThat, too, he said, could drive a resurgence in the IPO market, which has been expected to return this year. And in terms of mergers and the kind of corporate dealmaking that is Goldman's bread and butter, \"this could be a top decile\" year, Solomon said.\n\nAnd one major driver he pointed to is cash-rich, asset-heavy private equity sponsors.\n\nA key pipeline for Goldman has been banking for the world's top private equity sponsors, many of whom held assets longer than their own investors would like while waiting out a period of lackluster valuations and uncomfortably high interest rates.\n\nThat's left limited partners hungry for capital returns to reinvest in future deals, the secondaries and continuation vehicles markets booming, and banks praying that 2026 is the year that their private equity clients finally indicate they're ready for action.\n\nSolomon said the pressure for sponsors to return capital to their investors has reached a breaking point.\n\n\"We're reaching a point in time where that unlock\" is starting to occur, Solomon said. He pointed to mounting \"pressure from the LP community and the cycle life of fundraising has reached a point in time for most of these firms that they can't get into the valuation debate as much. They've got to move forward.\"\n\nSolomon has been on a mission to make Goldman AI-ready and has pointed to the massive investment in the space. \"The need for capital to continue on this technology cycle is going to have an impact on the overall capital-raising cycle, so I see all this stuff accelerating, and I feel pretty good about it,\" he said. He cited mega-tech names that have turned to the debt market to raise liquidity for AI-related projects.\n\nIt won't always be smooth sailing, Solomon conceded, framing Trump's governing style as something of an open question for markets. \"He also has a tendency in policy to move from policy action to policy action,\" he said. \"I'd still say there's uncertainty around trade. There is uncertainty around inflation, and there's uncertainty on geopolitics.\"\n\nBut, he concluded, \"I think the likely outcome in 2026 is we're going to have a pretty constructive year for capital markets, a pretty constructive year for M&A — particularly large-cap, strategic M&A — and the result of that should be very favorable for the people in this room.\"",

(They took some work to put together, too.) Digital music sort of killed mixtapes, but, in their place, came playlists. You could easily put together a collection of your favorite songs, and either burn them to a CD, or, as streaming took over, let the playlist itself grow as large as you wanted.\n\nAnyone can make a playlist, but there's an art to it. Someone with a keen ear for music can build a playlist you can let play for hours. Maybe you have a friend who's good at making playlists, or maybe you're that friend in your group. They can be a fun way to share music, and find some new music to add to your own library.\n\nNow, generative AI wants to replace human intervention altogether. Rather than you or a friend building a playlist, you can ask AI to do it for you. And YouTube Music is the latest service to give it a try.\n\nYouTube announced its new AI playlist generator in a post on X on Monday. If you To try it out, open YouTube Music, then head to your Library and tap \"New.\" Next, choose the new \"AI Playlist\" option, then enter the type of music you're looking for. You could ask YouTube Music to generate a playlist of pop-punk songs, or to make something to play when focusing on work. Really, it's whatever you want, and if the AI gets it wrong, you can try it again.\n\nIt's pretty straightforward, and nothing revolutionary. Other music streaming services have their own AI playlist generators too. Spotify, for example, has had one for a couple of years, but recently rolled out Prompted Playlist as well, which lets you generate playlists that update with time, and takes your listening history into account. With this update, however, YouTube is likely trying to drum up some interest in its streaming service and encourage users to pay for it. Just this week, the company put lyrics—once a free feature—behind the Premium paywall. I suppose it thinks that if you can't read what your favorite artists are singing, and you'd like to have a bot make your playlists for you, you might just \n\nThis could be a good change in the long run for YouTube Music subscribers. I'm on Apple Music, so I don't really use AI-generated playlists. I like the Apple-curated playlists, as well as the ones my friends and I make and share. But who knows: Maybe human-generated playlists are going the way of the mixtape.",

    "description": "External memory systems are pivotal for enabling Large Language Model (LLM) agents to maintain persistent knowledge and perform long-horizon decision-making. Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy.",

    "description": "Tired of AI’s high costs and limits? Discover how a home server and graph theory outperformed GPT-5.2 for deep research, saving $550/month while owning your ...",
    "fullText": "I recently had a problem that could be solved with money, which is the worst kind of problem.\n\nI am building a new venture called eh-trade.ca. To make it work, I needed deep financial research on 11,000 different stocks.\n\nThe \"Enterprise\" solution is to buy an API subscription. I looked into this. For my usage, the pricing is somewhere between \"$200/month\" and \"Contact Sales\". If you are a micro-preneur like me, \"Contact Sales\" means \"You cannot afford this.\"\n\nThe \"AI\" solution is to ask an LLM to research each stock, which works really well. But 11,000 requests at $0.05 per research session is still $550. Plus, I don't like renting intelligence. I prefer to own it.\n\nSo I decided to use the hardware I already had: a home server with four RTX 3090s. It’s a 96GB VRAM beast that heats my basement and scares my birds.\n\nThere was just one problem. The models I can run locally (like qwen3 or phi4) have small context windows. Yes, on the model card they theoretically support 40k+ of context, but they would run very slowly on my hardware, so really, it's 4K -- enough for a few screenfuls of text. Moreover, even if I enabled the long contexts, the models struggle to reason over them. If you try to feed them ten search results about a company's balance sheet, the 'needle in the haystack' effect kicks in. They'll get confused and start hallucinating dividends that don't exist.\n\nMost \"AI Agents\" are built on a simple loop, often called ReAct (Reason + Act). It looks like this:\n\nThe problem is the Context Window. By step 3, your prompt looks like a Walmart receipt. By step 5, you have exceeded 8,000 tokens, and the model forgets what it was doing and starts making stuff up.\n\nSure, it works fine if you are OpenAI and have infinite GPUs. It does not work if you are running on a consumer card in a closet.\n\nA few months ago, I read a paper called GraphReader. It proposed a different way to think about long contexts. Instead of dumping everything into a chat log, why not treat information as a graph?\n\nThe core insight is that you don't need to remember everything. You only need to remember the Atomic Facts.\n\nAn Atomic Fact is a single, indivisible truth.\n\nIf we extract these facts and throw away the rest, we can compress megabytes of web pages into a few kilobytes of JSON.\n\nI built a library called laconic to implement this. I wrote it in Go, because the rest of my projects are all in Go. Plus, my python environments always end up as a tangled mess of pip install errors.\n\nLaconic doesn't keep a chat history. It keeps a Notebook. The context window size is O(N), where N is the number of facts, not the number of words.\n\nLaconic uses a specific strategy called graph-reader.\n\nThe beautiful part? The LLM never sees the full history. It only sees the current Notebook and the current search result. This means I can run complex, multi-step research tasks on a model with a tiny 4k context window, and it never forgets a thing.\n\nHere is the code to run a research agent on my home server using Ollama:\n\nTo really test if this strategy works on constrained hardware, I ran a research question using qwen3:4b—a tiny 4-billion-parameter model.\n\nWithout the agentic loop, the model cannot answer this question. If you ask it directly, it responds that \"the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has not been announced.\"\n\nHowever, with the agent, it autonomously searches, extracts atomic facts, and synthesizes this:\n\nAnswer: The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to David Baker (University of Washington, Howard Hughes Medical Institute), Demis Hassabis, and John M. Jumper (Google DeepMind). David Baker was recognized for computational protein design. Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were awarded for protein structure prediction using AlphaFold2.\n\nThe agent found all three laureates, their exact affiliations, and their distinct contributions — information entirely outside the model's training data — by exploring multiple search queries and accumulating verified facts in a structured notebook.\n\nIf you hang out in the parts of the internet where people try to make AI write code without hallucinating, you might have heard of the Ralph Loop.\n\nPopularized by Geoffrey Huntley, the Ralph Loop (often named after Ralph Wiggum) is a brute-force solution to the context problem. You write a bash script that:\n\nThen it starts over. Fresh context. Zero memory leak. The \"memory\" is the file system.\n\nLaconic is essentially a Ralph Loop for reading.\n\nInstead of a bash script, it's a Go loop. Instead of git commit, we update a JSON Notebook. But the philosophy is identical: The Context Window is a liability.\n\nMost frameworks try to manage the context window like a precious resource. Ralph and Laconic treat it like a disposable napkin. Use it once, wipe the slate clean, and grab a fresh one.\n\nIt turns out that if you treat an LLM like a goldfish with a notepad, it becomes significantly smarter.\n\nI am currently running this loop on 11,000 tickers that I'm missing basic information on. It will take a week, and cost some power, but I would have left the machine on anyway because I am running a few other things on it.\n\nAnd if you want to find stocks that are going up, keep an eye on eh-trade.ca. My customers tell me I should brag more, so I'm up 280% in seven months following momentum strategies that it's showing on the main page.\n\nI'll have the data soon, assuming my basement doesn't catch fire.",

He said he's not against AI, he just wants people, including software engineers like himself, to find a more sustainable way to use the technology.\n\nThe issue, Khare wrote, is that AI creates a paradox of productivity that falls almost entirely on the user to solve by reducing the cost of production but increasing \"the cost of coordination, review, and decision-making.\"\n\nHis typical day is no longer devoted to deep focus on a single design problem, Khare wrote, but rather to context switching between as many as six different problems.\n\n\"Each one 'only takes an hour with AI.' But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain,\" he wrote. \"The AI doesn't get tired between problems. I do.\"\n\nEarly reactions show Khare isn't alone. Fellow engineers have shared their thoughts on X, Hacker News, and Lobsters. Their experiences echo what Khare wrote: vibe coding can lead to burnout vibes.\n\n\"I joke that I'm on the 'Claude Code workout plan' now,\" one user wrote on Hacker News. \"Standing desk, while it's working I do a couple squats or pushups or just wander around the house to stretch my legs. Much more enjoyable than sitting at my desk, hands on keyboard, all day long. And taking my eyes off the screen also makes it easier to think about the next thing.\"\n\nOthers make their day sound like the \"C'mon do something meme\" as they wait for a coding agent to respond with results, which they will then have to edit and refine.\n\n\"I used to lose myself in focused work for hours,\" another user wrote. \"That's changed. Now I'm constantly pulled away, and I've noticed the pattern: I send a prompt, wait for the reply, and drift into browsing.\"\n\nOn Monday, Harvard Business Review published a report on an eight-week study at a US tech company with 200 employees that \"discovered that AI tools didn't reduce work, they consistently intensified it.\"\n\n\"Once the excitement of experimenting fades, workers can find that their workload has quietly grown and feel stretched from juggling everything that's suddenly on their plate,\" the report continued. \"That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making.\"\n\nKhare said another struggle he has had is keeping up with the number of updates from OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies as they push their popular models and agents.\n\n\"Once you open your laptop, your phone either you go to Slack, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, and these are all things that are like 'Look at me,'\" Khare said.\n\nThe companies need to keep innovating to stay apace in the AI race, but for programmers like himself, Khare said, the updates create a sense of panic about missing out on what could be the next greatest thing.\n\n\"I was spending weekends evaluating new tools,\" he wrote. \"Reading every changelog. Watching every demo. Trying to stay at the frontier because I was terrified of falling behind.\"\n\nUltimately, Khare wrote that the scariest thing was how AI was changing him. He said he struggled when someone asked him \"to reason through a concurrency problem on the whiteboard\" with no laptop or AI.\n\n\"It's like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes,\" he wrote. \"After years of GPS, you can't navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.\"\n\nAndrej Karpathy, Tesla's former AI head and the engineer who coined the term \"vibe coding\" last year, recently wrote that while the industry was seeing a \"phase shift\" among increasingly impressive AI coding tools, he'd also begun to notice skill atrophy.\n\n\"I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually,\" Karpathy wrote.\n\nDetermined to help himself, Khare wrote that he had come up with a list of ground rules to rein in his AI use.\n\nHe's still struggling to hold himself to it. He said almost completely ignoring the AI conversation over his 14-day holiday break was a start. Khare said that while he wrote that having a 30-minute timer on AI use is helpful, it wasn't intended to be a strict limit.\n\nThe engineer also said that AI companies themselves could help as well. He compared the feeling of being just one prompt away from a perfect answer to the way addictive games try to keep users playing.\n\n\"You need to keep some sort of guardrails for the humans, so they don't self-distruct themselves,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI's next funding round could be good news for four Big Tech stocks with links to the ChatGPT creator, DA Davidson says.\n\nOpenAI isn't publicly traded — at least not yet — but DA Davidson says a fresh wave of hype is coming on the heels of its next fundraising round, and it could could boost four stocks in its orbit.\n\n\"We have been very critical on OpenAI overpromising, asking for government handouts and being spread too thin,\" DA Davidson analysts, led by Gil Luria, wrote about the AI company.\n\n\"We believe OpenAI's behavior led to the underperformance in shares of NVDA, MSFT, CRWV and especially ORCL over the last 5 months.\"\n\nOpenAI is reportedly closing in on another fundraising round, with recent reports suggesting a $50 billion investment from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds is in the works.\n\nFuturum CEO and analyst Daniel Newman told Business Insider that they expect the next funding round will bring OpenAI's valuation to $750 billion to $850 billion.\n\nThe analyst described the appetite for OpenAI in his conversations with investors to be \"pretty insatiable.\"\n\nDA Davidson analysts wrote that they expect that yet another multibillion-dollar OpenAI funding round will reignite enthusiasm for the company and lift some connected AI stocks.\n\n\"Since the market is currently assigning the OpenAI relationship a negative value, we believe the fundraise will serve as a catalyst for outperformance,\" they wrote of Oracle, CoreWeave, Nvidia, and Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI has come under fire for its reliance on debt and growing competition challenging its dominant position.\n\nThe company is partnered with Oracle to build $500 billion of data centers as part of its Stargate project. OpenAI has yet to turn a profit.\n\nAnother concern weighing on OpenAI is the notion that Alphabet's Google Gemini has caught up in the AI race.\n\n\"We believe that a revamped OpenAI will return to its position as Google's top challenger and with a fresh stack of capital be able to live up to its obligations this year, including to Oracle,\" they said.\n\nThe analysts upgraded Oracle to Buy from Neutral on their expectation that new funding for OpenAI will be a positive catalyst for the stock as well as general sentiment about OpenAI and the connected players.\n\n\"We expect that as investors go back to seeing OpenAI as a winner, the public companies in its orbit could re-rate significantly. Most importantly that should drive outperformance in NVDA and MSFT, but also in CRWV, and even ORCL, which we are upgrading today based on our updated view on OpenAI,\"\n\nTheir more bullish stance on OpenAI comes after the company corrected course.\n\n\"OpenAI has started focusing on its core frontier model and ChatGPT, while de-emphasizing some marginals initiatives. This includes going down the path of turning on ads, which will be critical for increased monetization and reduced cash burn.\"\n\nThey also noted a shift in the company's management that suggests they see a need to align with Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, rather than compete.",

    "fullText": "Some jobs will be moved offshore in wake of telco’s $700m partnership with tech consultancy Accenture\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nMore than 200 Telstra jobs are expected to be cut, as the telco rolls out AI capabilities and sends some jobs to India.\n\nTelstra and the technology consultancy Accenture announced a $700m joint venture (JV) in 2025 to drive efficiency, modernisation and productivity.\n\nA JV spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday that the team had been notified “about proposed changes to its workforce, including reducing roles where work is no longer needed, and moving some work to the JV team in India”.\n\nIf the changes proceed, the spokesperson said, affected team members would be helped to find new jobs either at Telstra or at Accenture, or have “access to our leading career transition program and retrenchment benefits”.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\n“These changes would see the JV use Accenture’s global capabilities, advanced AI expertise and specialist hub in India to deliver Telstra’s data and AI roadmap more quickly.\n\n“We anticipate that over time this would result in improved cost efficiencies and bring an enhanced experience to Telstra’s customers.”\n\nIt is understood 209 jobs face the axe.\n\nIn 2024, Telstra announced it would cut 2,800 jobs from its enterprise business, which services businesses and government agencies. The cuts wouldn’t affect retail customers, it said.\n\nIn May 2025, Telstra said “AI efficiencies” would allow it to shrink its workforce by 2030.\n\nTelstra’s chief executive, Vicki Brady, said AI would “be a significant unlock when it comes to enabling our workforce”.\n\nAgentic AI – which can work autonomously – would be working alongside Telstra staff, she said.\n\nOptus has previously said AI would have a big role to play in telecommunications but that humans would remain central.\n\nAnnouncing the JV, Telstra said it would drive productivity and growth, “build on Telstra’s work creating a world-class data and AI ecosystem, modernising its data and AI platforms, and embedding responsible AI by design”.\n\n“We are entering a new era of AI-driven reinvention,” the Accenture chair and chief executive officer, Julie Sweet, said at the time.",

    "description": "A super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and other tech leaders has targeted New York Assembly member Alex Bores' congressional campaign, marking its first attack against a lawmaker supporting AI regulation.",
    "fullText": "A pro-AI super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman has chosen New York Assembly member Alex Bores — and his congressional bid — as its first target.\n\nThe PAC, dubbed Leading the Future, formed in August with a more than $100 million commitment to support policymakers with a light-touch — or a no-touch — approach to AI regulation. And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\n\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\n\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature.\n\nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley.\n\nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\n\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\n\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works.\n\n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\n\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act.\n\nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.\n\n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”",

    "description": "AI language models excel in medical exams – but when real people ask them for advice, collaboration fails.",
    "fullText": "Large language models like GPT-4o are now achieving near-perfect results in medical knowledge tests. They pass the US medical licensing exam, summarize patient records, and can classify symptoms. Health authorities worldwide are therefore examining whether AI chatbots could serve as the first point of contact for patients – a kind of \"new gateway to the healthcare system,\" as stated in a strategy paper by the UK's NHS.\n\nHowever, the study \"Reliability of LLMs as medical assistants for the general public: a randomized preregistered study\" by researchers from the University of Oxford significantly dampens these hopes. The work is published in the journal Nature Medicine, and a pre-print version is available on arXiv. The central finding: the clinical knowledge of the models cannot be transferred to interactions with real people.\n\nFor the randomized, controlled study, the researchers recruited 1298 participants from Great Britain. Each subject was presented with one of ten everyday medical scenarios – such as sudden severe headaches, chest pain during pregnancy, or bloody diarrhea. The task: to assess what illness might be present and whether a doctor's visit, the emergency room, or even an ambulance was necessary.\n\nThe participants were randomly divided into four groups. Three groups had access to one AI model each, which was current at the start of the study – GPT-4o, Llama 3, or Command R+. The control group was allowed to use any aids, such as an internet search.\n\nThe results reveal a remarkable discrepancy. Without human involvement, even the language models, which are no longer current, identified at least one relevant illness in 94.9 percent of cases. When asked for the correct course of action – self-treatment, GP, emergency room, or ambulance – they were correct on average in 56.3 percent of cases.\n\nHowever, as soon as real people queried the models, the values plummeted. Participants with AI support recognized relevant illnesses in only a maximum of 34.5 percent of cases – significantly worse than the control group with 47 percent. When choosing the correct course of action, all groups performed equally: around 43 percent accuracy, regardless of whether a chatbot assisted or not.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the chat logs between users and AI models to understand the causes. They identified two central weaknesses: Firstly, participants often provided incomplete information to the models. Secondly, users did not correctly understand the AI's responses – even though the models named at least one correct diagnosis in 65 to 73 percent of cases, participants did not reliably adopt them.\n\nDr. Anne Reinhardt from LMU Munich sees a fundamental gap here: \"Many people quickly trust AI answers to health questions because they are easily accessible. They also sound very convincing linguistically – even when the content is actually medically completely wrong.\"\n\nThe researchers compared the performance of the models on the MedQA benchmark – a standard test with questions from medical exams – with the results of the user study. In 26 out of 30 cases, the models performed better on multiple-choice questions than in interactions with real people. Even benchmark values of over 80 percent sometimes corresponded to user results below 20 percent.\n\nProf. Ute Schmid from the University of Bamberg critically assesses the high performance of the models \"alone\": \"I find the statement that the performance of the language models is significantly higher 'alone' than with users somewhat misleading. In this case, the queries were likely formulated by individuals with expertise and experience with LLMs.\"\n\nThe experts agree that specialized medical chatbots would need to be designed differently from current all-purpose models. Prof. Kerstin Denecke from the Bern University of Applied Sciences outlines the requirements: \"A medically specialized chatbot would need to provide evidence-based, up-to-date information. Furthermore, it would need to reliably recognize emergencies, consider individual risk factors, and transparently communicate its limitations. It should conduct a structured anamnesis to reliably triage. And it should not be tempted to make a diagnosis.\"\n\nHowever, the hurdles for such use are considerable, according to Denecke: \"Major hurdles are, on the one hand, regulation – depending on the function as a medical device or high-risk AI. On the other hand, there is liability, data protection, and technical integration into care processes.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the Oxford researchers is clear: Before AI systems are deployed in healthcare, they must be tested with real users – not just with exam questions or simulated conversations. Schmid advocates for a differentiated approach: \"Quality-assured chatbots could, for example, be offered through statutory health insurance funds and recommended by general practitioners' offices as a first point of access. However, people should not be forced to use these services.\"\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "description": "The Meta founder’s donation to Sacramento State will help build “state-of-the-art STEM facilities” and a dedicated AI center.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI and STEM with his philanthropic efforts. Late last year, he and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, announced they would shift the majority of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute to biomedical AI research. And late last month, the Meta founder and CEO pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to fuel state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the gift on Jan. 28, tying it to a major redevelopment of three vacant state office buildings on Sacramento’s Capitol Mall into a downtown campus. The gift from Zuckerberg and Meta will fund abatement, demolition, and initial construction of the campus, enabling new student housing alongside new academic spaces, including STEM facilities and an AI center.\n\nMeta’s donation also comes at the heels of an interesting corporate and financial dynamic in California: Billionaires may soon be subject to a one-time 5% tax on their wealth. Many billionaires, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, have already moved their permanent residences out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nZuckerberg hasn’t made any public statements about the billionaires tax, and is instead doubling down on California investments and legacy.\n\n“These investments will help strengthen our communities and support the next generation of leaders and innovators,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. The Meta CEO also owns a compound of 11 properties in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood, valued at more than $110 million. Minutes from his home, Meta has its sprawling 57-acre headquarters campus and also more than 400,000 square feet of office space nearby in Menlo Park.\n\nNewsom said Zuckerberg’s gift allows the Sacramento-based school to continue to build its talent pipeline for tech jobs.\n\nThe donation “[opens] doors for students to succeed and for our communities to prosper,” Newsom said. “Making sure students can actually afford to live where they learn is essential to that work.”\n\nWhile this recent donation comes directly from Meta and Zuckerberg, it also fits into the playbook they recently rewrote. Launched in 2015 with a pledge to give away 99% of their fortune, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has recently refocused on science, AI, and biomedical research, shifting emphasis away from its initial education and social justice priorities (although they say they’ll continue making other local donations).\n\nIn 2025, Zuckerberg and Chan laid the groundwork to recalibrate their philanthropic organization toward AI-powered biomedical research, with a particular focus on their flagship Biohub network. Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes, aims to “cure or prevent all disease,” according to Zuckerberg and Chan.",

Why be at any university at all? Isn't the point of pursuing higher education to expand our minds and become better communicators?\n\nAs I progressed through my studies, I would hear ChatGPT mentioned more and more often, with some college professors even adding an AI clause to their syllabi. Some instructors would allow students to use ChatGPT for assistance (a murky definition) while others wouldn't allow it at all.\n\nI refused to use the AI tool in any way.\n\nI didn't care if instructors allowed students to use ChatGPT. I deliberately chose not to use it at all.\n\nSure, studying and studying literature in particular was difficult, but this was why I'd chosen the major; it was challenging, and I wanted to become better with words.\n\nI chose to become an English major because I wanted to improve my writing. I lacked confidence in my writing because I didn't know how to use words when I first entered college. I didn't have that finesse.\n\nApart from wanting to become a better writer, I also wanted to defend my opinions and thoughts with flair. I wanted to articulate sentiment precisely and formulate strong arguments. I wanted to write strongly worded emails. I wanted to think and speak freely.\n\nI wouldn't have been able to achieve any of that if I used ChatGPT.\n\nWhenever I'd hear a peer say they just used ChatGPT for their homework assignments, I'd often think about the many deserving students who hadn't been offered a seat at the university — students who, in a heartbeat, would've happily done these assignments themselves.\n\nI had the privilege of studying words at a strong English literature department with so many fine writing instructors. I leaped at opportunities to have my very own work critiqued by great writers. I still can't fathom having \"my\" writing, either partially or entirely synthetic, reviewed by instructors.\n\nAfter all, I was writing in and walking about the same grounds that writing legends once did — writers like bell hooks, John Steinbeck, Karen Zacarías, and David Henry Hwang. With this writing pedigree in mind, I was inspired and motivated to write myself.\n\nNot a day goes by without me putting my English degree to good use. Not a day goes by without me being grateful to my past self for putting in the work to earn the degree herself — without ChatGPT.",

The ads will show up for some of ChatGPT's free users, as well as some users who've subscribed to ChatGPT Go, a new $8-a-month tier the company rolled out last month.\n\nOpenAI says it will serve ads to you based on the conversation you're currently having with ChatGPT, as well as previous queries and chats.

    "description": "The recent tech sell-off spooked Wall Street, sparking a rerating of AI stocks. One analyst shares his criteria for picking winners in the AI race.",
    "fullText": "The tech stock sell-off that rattled Wall Street last week served as a reminder to investors that AI hype works both ways, and endless enthusiasm is no longer lifting all boats.\n\nThe dramatic downturn hit software stocks hardest, but it also spilled into the broader tech sector. Major indexes have broadly recovered from last week's sell-off, but investors are still on edge about what could be the next shoe to drop.\n\nAccording to Futurum Group CEO and chief analyst Daniel Newman, the sell-off was a \"healthy, overdue rotation and a market demanding receipts.\"\n\n\"Ignore hype and look at growth and constraints,\" he told Business Insider. The analyst also shared some tips for picking AI stocks.\n\nHere is the framework Newman says he's using to spot winners and losers as the AI trade evolves.\n\nNot all companies spending on AI are seeing it pay off. While many on Wall Street chalk this up to the early innings of the emerging tech, companies that are seeing AI drive revenue are ones to look for.\n\n\"Companies need to show that the $470+ billion the hyperscalers are spending this year is generating returns. Those that do will be rewarded,\" Newman said.\n\nHe highlights Amazon and Microsoft as examples of AI spending fueling revenue real growth, through the tech giant'' respective cloud businesses, AWS and Azure.\n\nCompanies creating their own silicon chips are better positioned to compete. Capacity constraints control the AI race, with chip demand outpacing supply.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all working on their own custom AI chips.\n\nNewman highlighted that companies with in-house chips benefit from capacity advantages and vertical integration, which set them up for better margins.\n\nCompanies that have been successful in seeing a return on their AI spending have been largely focused on enterprise offerings. These include the cloud hyper scalers, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as Palantir, a favorite among retail traders.\n\nSome software companies are seeing enterprise monetization, despite the worries that sparked this week's sell-off. Newman highlights ServiceNow and IBM as \"companies driving agentic AI workflows and token consumption.\"\n\nElon Musk told Tesla investors on the company's most recent earnings call that its humanoid robot, Optimus, could generate up to $10 trillion in long-term revenue.\n\nNewman said that physical AI is the next multi-trillion-dollar market outside of data centers. He called out Amazon and Tesla as companies bringing AI to the physical world.\n\nThe market zeroed in on the software space for good reason, Newman said. \"I don't believe the AI will eat all software, but AI will eat some software,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe analyst explained that software companies with data running core business applications can survive in an AI era, but they will have to adapt to meet the needs of enterprise customers who want AI insights to fuel productivity gains.\n\nSome software companies partnering with AI factories include Salesforce and ServiceNow.\n\nAs AI-disruption concerns continue to fuel market skittishness, investors should be wary of companies without a clear narrative for how capex will deliver tangible results.\n\nAnother sign that an AI stock is risky may be that a company is using debt to finance AI infrastructure buildouts. Newman clarified that while debt isn't always a bad thing and can be a way to invest in critical growth, it can make a stock more of a risk-on play.\n\nIn a risk-off environment, Newman told Business Insider that there are a couple of things investors should be watching for.\n\n\"Look at the companies that can really afford to keep investing, for businesses that are going to basically create the cash flow that do it with the least risk.\"",

    "description": "A researcher had free access to messages sent on the app Chat & Ask AI.",
    "fullText": "Have you ever used an application called Chat & Ask AI? If so, there's a good chance your messages were exposed last month. In January, an independent researcher was able to easily access some 300 million messages on the service, according to 404 Media's Emanual Maiberg. The data included chat logs related to all kinds of sensitive topics, from drug use to suicide.\n\nChat & Ask AI, an app offered by the Istanbul-based company Codeway that is available on both Apple and Google app stores, claims to have around 50 million users. The application essentially resells access to large language models from other companies, including OpenAI, Claude, and Google, providing limited free access to its users.\n\nThe problem that lead to the data leak was related to an insecure Google Firebase configuration, a relatively common vulnerability. The researcher was easily able to make himself an \"authenticated\" user, at which point he could read messages from 25 million of the app's users. He reportedly extracted and analyzed around 60,000 messages before reporting the issue to Codeway.\n\nThe good news: The issue was quickly patched. More good news: there have been no reports of these messages leaking to the broader internet. Still, this is yet one more reason to carefully consider the kinds of messages you send AI chatbots. Remember, conversations with AI chatbots aren't private—by their nature, these systems often save your conversations to \"remember\" them later. In the case of a data breach, that could potentially lead to embarrassment, or worse—and using an reseller like Chat & Ask AI to access large language models adds another layer of potential security risks, as this recent leak demonstrates.",

    "description": "You don't have to see ads in ChatGPT, but you'll get less ChatGPT in return.",
    "fullText": "It finally happened. After months of speculation, ChatGPT officially has ads. OpenAI revealed the news on Monday, announcing that ads would roll out in testing for logged-in adult users on Free and Go subscriptions. If you or your organization pays for ChatGPT, such as with a Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, or Education account, you won't see ads with the bot.\n\nOpenAI says that ads do not have an impact on the answers ChatGPT generates, and that these posts are always clearly separated from ChatGPT's actual responses. In addition, ads are labeled as \"Sponsored.\" That being said, it's not exactly a church-and-state situation here. OpenAI says that it decides which ads to show you based on your current and past chats, as well as your past interactions with ChatGPT ads. If you're asking for help with a dinner recipe, you might get an ad for a meal kit or grocery service.\n\nThe company claims it keeps your chats away from advertisers. The idea, according to the company, is strictly funding-based so that OpenAI can expand ChatGPT access to more users. That's reportedly why ads are starting as a test, not a hardcoded feature: OpenAI says it wants to \"learn, listen, and make sure [it gets] the experience right.\" As such, advertisers don't have access to chats, chat histories, memories, or your personal details. They do have access to aggregate information about ad performance, including views and click metrics.\n\nOpenAI will only show ads to adults. If the service detects that you are under 18, it will block ads from populating in your chats. Ads also will not appear if you're talking to ChatGPT about something related to health, medicine, or politics. You can offer OpenAI feedback on the ads you do see, which should inform the ads you receive in the future. You can also delete your ad data and manage ad personalization, if you want to reset the information OpenAI is using to send you ads.\n\nThe thing is, you don't actually have to deal with ads, even if you use ChatGPT for free. That's not just by upgrading to a paid ChatGPT plan, though OpenAI does suggest that option in its announcement. In addition, OpenAI is offering Free and Go users a dedicated choice to opt out of ads here. There is, of course, a pretty sizable catch: You have to agree to fewer daily free messages with ChatGPT. OpenAI doesn't offer specifics here, so it's not clear how limited the ad-free experience will be. But if you hate ads, or if you simply don't want to see an ad for something irrelevant to your ChatGPT conversation, it's an option.\n\nIf you like that trade-off, here's how to opt out of ads. Open ChatGPT, then head to your profile, which opens your profile's Settings page. Here, scroll down to \"Ads controls,\" then choose \"Change plan to go ad-free.\" Select \"Reduce message limits,\" and ChatGPT will confirm ads are off for your account. You can return to this page at any time to turn ads back on and restore your message limits.\n\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "fullText": "Women’s Super League (WSL) Football, the organisation which oversees the top two tiers of women’s football in England, is monitoring developments with X’s artificial intelligence (AI) tool Grok due to concerns regarding its creation of sexualised images.\n\nSome WSL clubs are also monitoring Grok, and another has said it has provided updated guidance to players and staff on safe use of all platforms, including X. Other teams are monitoring the evolving social media landscape and will take action accordingly.\n\nSocial media company X, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, in January prevented Grok from being used to edit images of real people in revealing clothing after OFCOM, the UK’s independent regulator for the communications industries, launched an investigation in January. It follows concerns the AI tool was being used to create sexualised images, affecting women and children, including female athletes.\n\nSignify, an organisation that works across multiple sports and with several WSL clubs to collect, triage and assess the threat online abuse poses to players, says it has been active on the Grok AI image manipulation issue since it first started in late 2025 and has shared advice with WSL and Premier League clubs on how to mitigate harm. But even though X has taken action, the issue is bigger than X and Grok.\n\n“Similar off-platform image manipulation tools are available and we have seen them also being used to produce concerning images and videos,” Jonathan Sebire, co-founder at Signify, says. “This will be a live issue for some time to come.”\n\nOFCOM is not currently investigating the off-platform stand-alone version of Grok because they do not fall under the Online Safety Act in the same way as on-platform versions.\n\nAn OFCOM spokesperson told The Athletic: “We can only take action on online harms covered by the Online Safety Act, using the powers we have been granted. Any changes to these powers would be a matter for government and parliament. The Secretary of State has said that the Government will look at how AI services should be regulated and we are supporting that work.”\n\nSignify has since added a solution which specifically detects manipulated images and reports them to X for action. “Encouragingly, we have seen the platform take strong action when dealing with content,” Sebire added.\n\nIn January, the European Commission announced it was launching an investigation against X under the Digital Services Act over Grok, including “the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, such as manipulated sexually explicit images”.\n\nIn January, Arsenal deleted a video on X and turned comments off on an Instagram post of new signing Smilla Holmberg promoting ticket sales because of inappropriate, sexualised and misogynistic comments.\n\nTottenham Hotspur also turned comments off on their X post announcing the arrival of Matilda Nilden, 19, for the same reason. Some of the replies asked X’s artificial intelligence tool Grok to produce sexualised images of the player.\n\n“It is really worrying,” Fern Whelan, women’s football equality, diversity and inclusion executive for the Professional Footballers’ Association, told The Athletic in a special investigation. “It’s difficult to manage unless it is stopped at source.”\n\nThe public body Sport England decided to stop using X last month to stay true to its values of ensuring “sport and physical activity are safe and inclusive for everyone,” it said in a statement.\n\nWSL Football has already scaled back on the use of X, prioritising Instagram and TikTok instead and continues to monitor the situation regarding Grok.\n\n“Online abuse is one of our highest priorities at the moment,” WSL Football Nikki Doucet told the media last month, urging the need to be proactive. “We have seen the speed in which and the change in the type of abuse that is happening. Some content is not illegal but there is a lot that is awful but lawful.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSoccer, Sports Business, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Coming up with drug candidates isn’t the bottleneck on finding new treatments. Can AI help with the things that are?\n\nClara Collier: I’m very excited to be talking to Abhishaike Mahajan. He works for Noetik, a startup that uses AI to develop cancer therapies, and he’s also one of my favorite bloggers. I’m interested in the intersection of biology and machine learning, and I’m also very, very confused by it. Abhi's writing has been extraordinarily helpful for me in untangling this whole topic. So, to start:  Where do you think the real applications of the technology are? What excites you — and why?\n\nAbhishaike Mahajan: Maybe I can start with my own background. I spent two and a half years at Anthem, a U.S. health insurance company, on a research team applying machine learning to electronic health records to predict who is likely to develop chronic health conditions two years out — essentially,  risk stratification models. I also spent some time there doing causal inference work, trying to answer questions like: If you're on one antihyperglycemic medication and you're, say, a Hispanic male in his 50s, what should the second-line therapy be? Right now, it's very much based on \"vibes.\" All of this was done with a data set of 50 million U.S. clinical claims that the company  had access to.\n\nIn my second job, I spent two and a half years at Dyno Therapeutics, developing better viruses for genetic therapy delivery. This involved a lot of mucking around with AlphaFold and other protein structure prediction and design models.\n\nAnd now, my current role revolves around learning better representations of tumor microenvironments, in the hopes that we can predict which patient populations are most likely to respond to a specific drug.\n\nThe career trajectory I have encapsulates many of the individual fields that have popped up in biological machine learning. If you look at the life cycle of machine learning in applied biology, it can be preclinical, clinical stage or postclinical. My work at the health insurance company was postclinical, dealing only with approved drugs. My current work at Noetik is clinical stage, where most of our interest is in investigational cancer drugs in Phases 1 through 3, although most of the current machine learning in biology that you’ll see is focused on the preclinical stage. The preclinical stage is a very machine learning-shaped problem, since imagination is a very high priority. There is no ground truth. You need to come up with a molecule, a protein, whatever.\n\nMy work at Dyno Therapeutics was closest to preclinical. There are viruses that exist in nature which have coevolved alongside humans that are typically used when delivering genetic therapies. The founding of this company was based on a paper that applied saturation mutagenesis to this particular virus — exploring the mutational landscape, like single amino acid substitutions — to try and figure out whether we can improve this virus's ability to, say, infect the brain, where we may want to deliver the virus’ genetic payload. The answer is yes.\n\nNow the next question is: how much can this be scaled? Dyno was started on that premise. From there on, you are into unobserved territory. You are in evolutionarily divergent territory. You can’t really depend on there being other viruses that closely relate to your existing ones, so you place a very high premium on your models being able to generate new things entirely. I worked with a lot of protein structure generation models — if you have a particular target in mind, can you hallucinate something that will bind to that target and then graft that onto the virus? Or can you use the model to modify larger sections of the virus?\n\nAbhi: This is BindCraft, yes. But BindCraft exists on a continuum of many different binder generation models. It’s arguably the best one — perhaps the point where the field was kind of solved, though others have reasonable disagreements with that, especially given how good the most recent models are. That was mostly preclinical work, since we were primarily testing in monkeys or mice.\n\nClara: There was an essay that went semi-viral recently by Claus Wilke: We Still Can't Predict Much of Anything in Biology.\" He specifically talks about BindCraft there, arguing  that we've had many generations of predictive computational tools claiming that we can do these things with proteins. BindCraft, in this tradition, is very good at what it does, but it has many gaps. You  still need extensive testing and a lot of research taste to make use of it.\n\nAbhi: I can see the argument that it’s perhaps not good at designing binders for intrinsically disordered proteins or proteins that have never been experimentally characterized before. Still, for the set of targets that are experimentally well characterized, where you  just want to generate interesting binders,  I'm inclined to think that it’s  transformative.\n\nPrior to BindCraft, the state-of-the-art method was generating hundreds of thousands of random peptides, folding them with your target of interest using AlphaFold, and then picking the ones with the best confidence metric. To some degree, before BindCraft, your only alternative was pure computational brute force. In that sense, all BindCraft is doing is compressing the workload; it’s not unlocking brand new capabilities. But I would argue that compressing workload, especially at that scale, is pretty transformative.\n\nNow, if we’re to claim that BindCraft results are, at the end of the day, no better than simply doing phage display, then, yes, I can see that. But some recent work from earlier this year suggests that these models can also design binders for receptors that are  traditionally  very hard to design against — like GPCRs, which phage display struggles with. None of these approaches is  a silver bullet, but it does feel like we’re getting close!\n\nClara: I feel like there’s an archetype in this discourse: the crotchety computational biologist who has seen it all before and is very skeptical of the potential of these machine learning tools to make a difference in developing new, viable treatments, either because the technology itself isn’t good enough or because there are too many other bottlenecks. I know and respect a lot of these people! But I also know and respect many others who are incredibly excited. I’m trying clarify what heuristics I should be paying attention to when evaluating how people talk about these technologies.\n\nAbhi: Obviously, take my opinion with a grain of salt. The big reason I wanted to work at a company that is closer to clinical stage machine learning is that, ultimately, most of the problems with drug development relate to the clinical stage. It is very rare that we don't have enough interesting ideas at the very beginning. Rather, the problem is that testing each one of those ideas is enormously expensive. If your goal is to make drug discovery better, you can do one of two things. You can either improve the physical shot itself to begin with — by creating new and unique binders,  like BindCraft —  or you can improve your ability to shoot in the first place. I see clinical stage companies as very focused on the latter, which I think is of much higher importance.\n\nSo why isn't everyone trying to improve how well they can shoot? The answer is that no one really knows how to do it well; it’s a much harder problem. For example, Noetik, the company I work at now, has taken a bet on patient stratification being something that's deeply underappreciated in oncology. We have models that understand tumor microenvironments better than humans do, so we’re using those models to improve patient stratification. The current cancer drug failure rate is 95%; if we can drop that down to 70%, we’ve made it far more economical for pharmaceutical companies to throw far more shots. That’s success to me.\n\nClara: What are some concrete examples of clinical companies that are doing clinical stage work, in addition to Noetik? What does that look like in practice?\n\nAbhi: The most salient example I can think of is a startup called Unlearn.AI. They sell a purely computational platform that conducts synthetic control trials; essentially, they’re saying:  “We’ve run many patients with Alzheimer’s through controlled trials before. Do we really need to run one again? Or, can we use the hundreds of trials that have been run previously to create a synthetic version of the controlled trial population you would otherwise be creating?” They are selling that as a service. That’s an example of a clinical stage company.\n\nClara: How much data would you need for something like that to be feasible?\n\nAbhi: This is why most people don't do it — you need a lot of data points. Most worryingly of all, you need human data points, which are the hardest data points to gather. I think  the reason that there aren’t that many clinical stage machine learning biology companies is because it's such a capital intensive effort, and the people who have the legible pedigree necessary to raise for such a thesis are usually more curious about the preclinical stage stuff because it's more intellectually satisfying.\n\nClara: So, for companies that want to do clinical stage work, do they always need to collect all of the data themselves? If the whole draw is that an enormous number of Alzheimer's trials have already happened, how easy is it to actually collect all that  data from those trials and synthesize it? Do those trials even have all of the data points that you would need for a synthetic trial?\n\nAbhi: Moving away from Unlearn.AI —  because I don't know their data collection strategy — the historical issue with collecting data from prior clinical trials is that it’s really hard. Maybe the people behind the trial did collect some raw biological material from your sample of interest — for cancer that's a tumor resection, for inflammatory bowel disease that's an intestinal lesion —  but they usually care about one or two specific biomarkers, and that's all they extracted. The  sample itself may have since been discarded. Or, maybe, they stored the biological material, but it’s logistically complicated to access; , there isn’t exactly a marketplace for this.\n\nThere is a company I mention in my recent post, Artera AI, which got FDA approval for a black box biomarker that can stratify patients based on whether they will or will not respond to an anti-androgen therapy for prostate cancer. They developed that model based entirely on retrospective specimens from previous Phase 3 prostate cancer trials run by other companies. I know very little about the logistical nightmare of getting  those samples, but I imagine it was intense. The moat in creating models like this is being able to transact with many different companies at once, all of whom don't really want to share their data with you.\n\nClara: What are the class of problems that you think these models are good for, that the current system is doing a bad job addressing?\n\nAbhi: I would vaguely gesture at human simulation — can we predict which patients will respond to a particular drug? It’s obviously a very narrow slice of human simulation. But for all problems where you need to drug a human and observe whatever happens to them, there is some model that claims to model exactly that behavior such that you don't need the human at all. For example, Alzheimer's clinical trials can take decades  to reach their primary endpoint. But maybe there is some biomarker, which is not human legible, that could be gleaned from the patient data, say, a few months in. So there are companies popping up that claim that they can  create prognostic biomarkers during the course of a clinical trial, which they will then sell to other companies.\n\nClara: So it's a way of making the process of figuring out which drugs you should test in humans more efficient.\n\nAbhi: Yes, I would argue that this is the claim of most clinical stage machine learning companies.\n\nClara: This is central to the problem that people who are worried about drug R&D efficiency are concerned about — that actual clinical trials are too slow and too expensive.\n\nAbhi: They feel closely aligned. I know Jack [Scannell] is a historic skeptic of a lot of machine learning biology companies, and I would agree that what I've said so far is the story that has been sold. It feels very logical to me that, at some point, it will bear fruit. It is not obviously true that any of it has borne fruit yet.\n\nBut you can look at the mountain of papers that are published after clinical trials. A cancer trial goes on, ends up failing, and then there's a paper that comes out afterward that tries to figure out why. Usually, some small fraction of patients have responded to the drug, and the paper is trying to understand this. It’s always a complicated answer — maybe a particular cytokine group was super upregulated in the responder group and all of them are white males in their 30s. Useful insights rarely come out of this work, but you can see the inklings of a computational system that could predict all of this in advance. None of it is truly outside the bounds of knowledge. It is compressible; we just don't know how to compress it.\n\nGoing back to the question of how do you know whether you have enough data? I don't think anyone knows,  for any machine learning problem, how much data is enough. You just need to test it out and see what happens. That's an unsatisfying answer, but the realistic situation we're in is that the alternative is having no computational way to simulate a human at all, which is where we are today. I would argue that's worse.\n\nClara: What are the data sets that you most wish you had?\n\nAbhi: The gold standard in my head is whole proteome spatial proteomics. That is a type of data set that I don't think is possible to create today — if it is, it would cost a massive amount of money. This is very specific to cancer, but it would be the ability to take a tumor biopsy and visualize every single human protein that exists within the spatial context of the system. It's almost like an X by Y by 20,000 image of what is going on inside a tumor. Maybe even more than 20,000 if we’re considering isoforms. If I were to add more, I would like multiple biopsies from the same tumor, because within a tumor there exist multitudes.\n\nClara: Why is this impossible to get now?\n\nAbhi: My impression is that it is just incredibly expensive to generate the data; even if you could generate it, you could not do so at sufficient scale to  actually make sense of it. To be clear,  when I say spatial proteomics data would be useful for me, I am not saying it would be useful to me as a human with a human brain. It would be very useful for a model to ingest.\n\nClara: You've written a lot about why you think that cancer is an especially exciting field for machine learning applications; because there are so many different genes and interactions involved, it does not lend itself to a human manually figuring out a target.\n\nAbhi: I'm not sure I would go so far as to say cancer as a field is uniquely suited to machine learning. I would say that I work in cancer because it is a field where the emotional impact is quite high. Cancer is a terrifying disease. The truth is that if you solve cancer, in absolute numbers you don't actually improve human lifespan by all that much — something else gets you in the end. But dying from cancer is such a uniquely horrifying experience that it feels like a worthy life goal to spend at least a few years working on it.\n\nAs a field, cancer is nice because it  has had so much money infused into it. And rightly so, because it is a disease that affects a lot of people. This  has led to the realization  that the disease is so complicated that you need very smart academic oncologists to look over individual patients and recommend treatments, creating a  prebuilt culture of personalized medicine. Outside of oncology, and perhaps autoimmune disease, I don't think any other disease is given the same level of respect with regards to how extremely complicated it can be to treat.\n\nThere is also a lot of unmet need in cancer, and people are willing to accept big swings. In Type 2 diabetes, there's not a ton of unmet need — GLP-1s solve a significant fraction, as do insulin and metformin. But for pancreatic cancer, where everyone who gets the  diagnosis has a high chance of dying in the next six months, there's a strong argument to make that you can try crazier things. It feels like a natural fit for machine learning to play a role.\n\nClara: There’s more cultural willingness to experiment there.\n\nAbhi: Yes, that’s a better way of encapsulating it..\n\nClara: Do you think the structure of the problem biologically lends itself better to computational methods, or do you think it's just a factor of \"people really freaking want to cure cancer\"?\n\nAbhi: I think the second point is definitely the highest order bit. When I wrote the article you mentioned, many people made very valid points that cancer is certainly not alone in being an extremely complicated disease with a lot of patient heterogeneity — there’s inflammatory bowel disease, endometriosis.\n\nThe human body is complicated. Every disease is complicated. The flu is complicated. HIV is complicated. It would be hard to drive a stake in the sand and say this is more complicated than that. The only people who do that are people who want funding for their disease area. This is hand wavy, but a better way of conceptualizing whether a disease is hard or easy to cure is: how many \"knobs\" does biology give you access to for controlling that condition?\n\nIt turns out that for bacterial infections, you get this very nice set of knobs: foreign invaders have a completely different set of biology that you can uniquely interact with. The way at least a few antibiotics work is by jamming up cellular machinery that only exists in bacteria. On the other end of the spectrum, cancer has no unique cellular machinery and is largely identical to you. There are aspects of cancer that are unique, such as  its metabolism, but cancer also grows very fast so it can quickly evolve beyond whatever unique aspect it has. There is no knob that it gives you access to that it is not willing to evolve away from.\n\nHIV gives you a very nice knob in the sense that it's easy to jam up its ability to infect cells, but it doesn't give you access to the knob that allows it to sequester itself into cells for decades. That's why you can have chronic HIV — it doesn't do anything to you, but it just lives in your body because there's no lever you can pull to get it removed from every one of your cells.\n\nThe thesis of another article I'm writing is: If you look at all the crazy drugs that have come out — PrEP, CRISPR, CAR-T — they are all fundamentally reliant on taking advantage of existing biology that was already there. CRISPR is based on a bacterial immune system. CAR-T is based on reconfiguring existing T-cell receptors. The vast majority of medicines rely on conserved evolutionary biology. I would argue that a disease is harder or easier to cure depending on how many of those knobs are made available to you.\n\nClara: Where do you see this field in five years? Which things that people are doing now are going to yield real results?\n\nAbhi: I think those who are focusing on clinical stage stuff will be deemed particularly prescient. Right now, when I look out at the field, a lot of the companies starting up are clinical stage machine learning biology companies. People are realizing we don't need better preclinical research; we need to shift our aims to the clinical stage.\n\nThis is low conviction, but I think the focus on human data will grow larger and larger. People will be more willing to let go of the perfect ability to perturb everything in their system in exchange for working with human data.\n\nThere’s also something about temporality I’m curious about. I've written about Recursion Pharmaceuticals before. Since their founding, they have used this particular assay called \"cell painting\" to visualize things — applying dyes that bind to DNA (blue light) or cell membranes (red light). I wrote about a change they made recently where they dropped that entire assay. Now they are taking raw, “bright-field” images — literally shining a bright light on the cell and looking at it through a microscope.\n\nThey’re doing this because they noticed it made no difference to their models. Models are getting really good; they don't need human legible color labels. More interestingly, the application of those dyes usually required killing the cell first (“fixing it”). If you're just imaging the cells with light, you gain access to a temporal dimension where you can see how the cells react from hour to hour, from day to day, from week to week. There's a multibillion-dollar company generating petabytes of this sort of data month after month. I don't know what they'll do with it, but it feels to me like there is unique biology there that has never been explored.\n\nClara: If you're excited about clinical stage machine learning and the bottleneck is data, what could people be working on to resolve that  bottleneck?\n\nAbhi: Starting a company which generates that same sort of data but cheaply and better than everyone else. I think there is a lot of value in tool or service companies that take existing assays and make them much easier to run at scale.\n\nHave you heard of a company called Plasmidsaurus? I've written about them too. They are very famous in the biology world. All they do is sequence plasmids —  genetic material that you can shove into new cells. Traditionally, creating plasmids is an error prone process, so labs use error prone plasmids and the outcome of that research is pure garbage. This company popped up four or five years ago, and their claim is this: Send us your plasmids. We will sequence them for $15, make sure they're absolutely correct, and send you back the information.\n\nIt's an astronomical success story. I think they started with $100k in seed funding, and now it's a $40 million annual recurring revenue business. They took an existing workflow and rapidly automated it.\n\nClara: Wow. Why aren't there more companies like this?\n\nAbhi: It’s an interesting story. Plasmidsaurus primarily sequences via Nanopore sequencers, which are super cheap to run. Nanopore sequencing came out around 2010-2015. Oxford Nanopore, the company behind it, was filled with great scientific minds, but was terrible at teaching people how to use their machines. So, for a brief time, there was an arbitrage period where people who really understood how to use this machine could charge to run it for other people who had no idea how to work with it. The founder of Plasmidsaurus, Mark, was doing a postdoc at Caltech where he was running Nanopore sequencing all day. He knew better than almost anyone else on earth how to work with these sequencers and even worked with the company to establish good protocols. He just used his knowledge, performed that workflow for other people, and scaled it up.\n\nClara: Are there other areas like this, where a Mark could step in and make the whole process more efficient?\n\nAbhi: I think in an ideal world, more people would start up something in high-throughput proteomics. There’s Olink, there’s Nautilus Biotech. It’s just that you need a very specific skill set to build a company like that, and not many of those people are interested in starting a company. This is why I'm very happy that Focused Research Organization enthusiasts, like Convergent Research, have taken a strong dip into funding measurement companies. It’s a hard thing to make a business out of, but if they do their job well, it pays off civilizational dividends.\n\nClara: Didn’t FROs get started because Adam Marblestone was really interested in connectomics? He wanted that data set.\n\nAbhi: And now there’s E11 Bio. I think Adam has incredible taste in the types of companies that are best suited to funding via the FRO mechanism.\n\nClara: Why is it so difficult to build a data measurement company, then, if there's obviously a market?\n\nAbhi: There are distinct steps in the biology data life cycle. At the very beginning, there is raw academic research. You see that, for example, some particular biological interaction occurs when two peptides interlock together and one lights up. That's the true measurement signal. The second step is turning that into a company where you go out and say, “I can measure XYZ for you at scale.” That's where people get stuck, because for a lot of interesting data modalities, there's no clear market that exists in advance.\n\nFor example, Nautilus Biotech has  a bizarrely good biology podcast. In some episodes they ask, \"What is the utility of our high-throughput proteomics platform?\" And the answer they give is pretty honest: \"We’re still figuring it out, but here are some ideas.\" There isn't a clear use case for it today, but they argue that's because this type of data has not existed before. If you give a scientist a huge amount of proteomics data, all the way to the isoform level, they won't know what to make of it for at least the first year. It takes time for the field to catch up culturally.\n\nClara: So it’s a chicken and egg thing. The data could theoretically be useful, but it's hard to get the data because nobody supplies it, and nobody supplies it because there are no buyers, because people don't know what to do with it yet.\n\nAbhi: Exactly. I talked to someone at E11 Bio about this, with regards to connectomics. I asked, \"Why do connectomics? What do you get from this?\" They said, \"We don't know. No one has measured this before. We know it was kind of useful for a fruit fly brain, but we don't know if it's going to be useful for anything larger. But no one else is going to do it.\"\n\nClara: What is your opinion on Dario Amodei-style claims — that LLM-based architectures will be doing scientific ideation and this will have major impacts on the world?\n\nAbhi: I think it's directionally true in verifiable domains where these models have already demonstrated superhuman reasoning. For any strong AI scientist claim to be true, it is almost implicitly saying that humans are bad at building connections between the existing set of data. I think that is true. I don't think it's so true that we would naturally expect brand new fields to pop up overnight from an AI. I struggle to look at what Dario says and say, \"That's clearly incorrect,\" but I do think humans are actually really good at extracting useful insights from scientific data. We have hundreds of thousands of postdocs and PhD students poring over the literature. They come up with a lot of really crazy things.\n\nTo steelman this: I recently interviewed Ellen Zhong. Her research is about how to interpret cryo-EM particle images better. She developed a deep learning method to do this. Afterward, she went back to existing cryo-EM data that had been measured in the literature using classical methods, applied her method, and saw that she was able to extract proteins that they did not even think existed in the dataset. That is a case where an \"in silico Ellen Zhong\" would be able to measure things humans did not see. But cryo-EM in some sense is a verifiable field; there is a genuine ground truth. I think in biology generally, there are not a lot of verifiable ground truths.\n\nAbhishaike Mahajan has spent his career trying to use computation to improve human health.

    "description": "Laid-off tech workers are blaming AI for the loss of their jobs, but connecting the dots on how it led to their firing isn't always clear.",
    "fullText": "That's the question laid-off workers are grappling with in the aftermath of losing their jobs. The No. 1 suspect is often artificial intelligence, but connecting the dots on how that led to their firing isn't always clear.\n\nJacob Zinkula has spoken to dozens of laid-off workers who are trying to piece together why they were let go.\n\nSome might deem those efforts fruitless. (Congrats on figuring it out! You're still unemployed.)\n\nA better understanding helps inform the next career move, and plenty of people could use that. This January saw more layoffs than any January since 2009.\n\nFurther muddying the waters is companies' reluctance to say AI drives layoffs. When Amazon made its first round of deep cuts last fall, many speculated it was due to AI. But CEO Andy Jassy said it was about \"culture,\" not AI or costs.\n\nIt's one thing to lose your job because of tech. It's another to hear you don't have the personality for it.\n\nThe way I see it, AI impacts layoffs in three main ways.\n\nAI took my job: While the most direct, it's also the least common these days. There aren't many examples of AI doing everything a human can at work. In most cases, there's still a need for some human interaction.\n\nAs much as it stinks to lose your job this way, at least it's a clear sign you need to change what you're doing. AI isn't coming for your job. It's already here.\n\nAI makes my job a lot easier: This applies to just about everyone. AI can't automate everything you do, but it can sure carry a lot of the load. At first glance, that seems like a good thing. But if AI enables you to do more with less, your company has the same benefit.\n\nSure, some will position it as an opportunity to supercharge their employees to drive more business. The more likely outcome is that this is an opportunity to reduce headcount.\n\nThe silver lining is that your job is still needed. There are just fewer opportunities out there, and you need to get really good at managing AI to get them.\n\nWe need to pay for this AI somehow: The most frustrating of the three. AI isn't directly impacting your job at all, but those tech bills aren't going to pay themselves. If you fall into this bucket, chances are you weren't driving a ton of revenue for the firm. (After all, why kill a cash cow when money is tight?)\n\nIt's a hard pill to swallow. However, it could serve as a wake-up call for how you approach your next gig. Like it or not, AI is the way forward for most companies. So if you're not helping a business reach that goal, you might need to reconsider what you're doing in the first place.",

    "description": "BofA strategists flagged earnings growth, C-suite sentiment, AI spending, and layoffs among their top takeaways from the latest results.",
    "fullText": "Earnings season is winding down, and some key takeaways for investors have emerged from the results.\n\nThe latest batch of financials has been largely upbeat, though there's lingering caution around things like AI capex plans from the biggest tech firms. Amazon, for instance, saw shares plunge after earnings last week as its spending plans shocked investors.\n\nYet, for the most part, Bank of America says that results have largely delivered despite lingering background noise about the AI arms race.\n\nWith about 75% of S&P 500 companies reporting, here are what BofA analysts say are the big takeaways for investors from fourth-quarter earnings season.\n\nGrowth is stronger than expected and above historic averages, but has stumbled on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\nNearly 70% of companies delivered earnings per share that beat consensus estimates, compared to the historical average of 60%. In the prior quarter, the beat rate was 75%, the strongest figure since 2021.\n\nSales for the companies that have reported so far are also strong. Bank of America noted that revenue excluding the financials and energy sectors is on pace for the highest year-over-year growth since 2022.\n\nBank of America's predictive analytics team examined earnings calls to assess sentiment among company executives. They found that positive corporate sentiment hit a record high.\n\n\"Corporate sentiment is tracking at a record high in 4Q, just above its pre-Liberation Day level. \"Weak demand\" mentions ticked higher but are still well below 2023-2024 levels.\"\n\nThey highlighted the tech and healthcare sectors as having the strongest guidance, while real estate and consumer staples were the weakest.\n\nAs expected, AI was a key focus for Wall Street this earnings season, especially amid AI disruption fears that are fueling volatility and investors' concerns about the return on colossal capex.\n\nHyper scalers' AI spending guidance came in 35% above Wall Street's expectations. Amazon plans to spend $200 billion this year, while Alphabet and Meta expect to spend up to $185 billion and $135 billion, respectively.\n\nThe strategists said that hyperscalers' capex guidance is decelerating year over year, but noted that 2025 capex was revised up by a \"whopping\" 30% from initial guidance.\n\nAmazon was punished by investors after it revealed its spending plans, with the stock plummeting after earnings. Other Big Tech names, however, fared better. Meta's capex outlook was offset by strength in its ad business, proving that investors can get comfortable with high AI spending if they like what they see elsewhere.\n\nJob cuts in January hit the highest point since 2009. Despite some worrying headlines about layoffs at high-profile companies like Amazon, Bank of America highlighted some \"less pessimistic\" readings into the labor market.\n\nThe strategists said that the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) layoff rate holds low, though hiring has fallen off — a low-hire, low-fire state.\n\nThey also noted that \"layoff\" mentions did tick up, but they see minimal evidence that AI is meaningfully weakening labor demand.",

    "fullText": "First, there were collars, then there were microchips. Now, we're using doorbell cameras to track down lost dogs.\n\nRing, Amazon's smart doorbell security system, launched Search Party, an AI system that helps locate lost dogs, last fall. In its first three months, the feature has brought home 99 lost dogs in just 90 days, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\n\n\"Good example of real-world impact, and proud of what the Ring team has built here,\" Jassy wrote.\n\nRing ran a heartstring-tugging ad about Search Party during the Super Bowl. In it, a family finds their lost dog Milo, thanks to the company's tech.\n\nSome viewers didn't find the ad so heartwarming. Users on X and TikTok posted about how the ad made them feel overly surveilled. Others called it \"dystopian.\"\n\nSome of the online backlash also referenced Ring's recent partnership with Flock Safety. A May story from 404 Media alleged ties between Flock and ICE. Local law enforcement may access Ring videos, but they must submit requests that users can deny or ignore.\n\n\"Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them,\" the company wrote in an earlier statement to Wirecutter.\n\nSearch Party does require sign-offs from individual users to release footage. When a pet owner posts about their lost dog in the Ring app, local cameras begin searching. If your camera spots something that looks like the missing dog, you can approve (or deny) sharing the video.\n\n\"The AI is trained on tens of thousands of dog videos so it can recognize different breeds, sizes, fur patterns, body features, unique marks, shape, and color,\" Jassy wrote. \"And privacy stays in your control—you decide each time whether to help.\"\n\nJassy called it one of the \"compelling use cases of AI.\" Indeed, Amazon's Ring has gone all in on AI — both in its products and in the workplace.\n\nWhen founder Jamie Siminoff returned to lead the department in 2025, he mandated that staff show how they use AI when applying for promotions, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSiminoff later confirmed the change in an interview. \"We're going to promote based on AI. We're going to promote based on how you're integrating AI into your job,\" Siminoff told Business Insider.\n\nHe also said that the RBKS department — Ring, Blink, Key, and Sidewalk — asked about AI in hiring interviews. The department is looking to hire AI natives, he said.\n\nSearch Party is just one initiative in Siminoff's push to refocus Ring on security. One of his first moves was to replace Ring's socially driven mission (\"Keep people close to what's important\") with one emphasizing safety.\n\nRing's new mission: \"Make neighborhoods safer.\"\n\nAs for those dogs, Jassy shouted out some pups that had made their way home. One military veteran lost his service dog, Lainey. Ring found her later that day.\n\nNyx dug a hole under the fence. Ring found him within 15 minutes.",

    "fullText": "On first glance, a recent Reddit post looks like the sort of PR nightmare that would give any tech company cold sweats: a disgruntled employee leaks a shelved Super Bowl ad revealing some highly anticipated products and a big-name celeb.\n\nBut it's all a hoax, according to OpenAI.\n\nGreg Brockman, the AI company's cofounder and president, moved to quickly denounce a now-deleted viral Reddit post that claimed to have footage of a shelved Super Bowl ad featuring actor Alexander Skarsgård with fancy earbuds and a reflective metallic orb device called \"Dime.\"\n\n\"fake news,\" Brockman wrote on X on Sunday night.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson confirmed in a statement to Business Insider that the ad was not real.\n\n\"Totally false! Not OpenAI, not connected to us at all. Fake news,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAlexander Skarsgård stars in a mysterious #SuperBowl commercial for a product called 'dime' pic.twitter.com/xlgtsjPqIB\n\nThe Reddit post claimed that OpenAI opted to air its real Super Bowl ad featuring Codex instead of the device ad.\n\nOpenAI is working on AI devices, but it hasn't revealed much when it comes to details. But it did recruit a huge name to lead its efforts.\n\nLast year, CEO Sam Altman and former Apple design chief Jony Ive jointly announced that they had been collaborating for years. OpenAI also purchased Ive's AI hardware startup for roughly $6.5 billion.\n\nIn November, Ive said a device will be available in less than two years. Altman said during the same joint appearance that he wants the device's simplicity to cause people to say, \"That's it.\"\n\n\"Like it is so simple, but then it just does, as we were talking about, AI can do just so much for you that so much can fall away,\" Altman said during a panel with Ive moderated by Laurene Powell Jobs. \"And the degree to which Jony has chipped away at every little thing that this doesn't need to do or doesn't need to be in there is remarkable.\"\n\nMany users were duped by the supposedly \"leaked\" ad, including Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, who seemed to suggest the social media platform had once again gotten the scoop on major news.\n\n\"Oh, Reddit. You've done it again,\" Ohanian wrote on X. \"The ad is beautiful btw, they should've run this one.\"\n\n\"This is totally fake,\" OpenAI's Lindsay McCallum Rémy, who works in its communications department, responded.\n\nAI was front and center during what is historically the most-watched live televised event in the US, and thus the biggest day for advertising. In the days leading up to the big game, Altman criticized rival Anthropic for airing what he said was a \"deceptive\" ad that subtly poked fun at OpenAI's plans to add ads to lower tiers of ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI did air a Super Bowl ad. In its second-ever spot during the big game, the company touted Codex, its coding-focused agent, which has a new model and an accompanying Mac OS app.\n\nThe ad begins with a child's finger tracing a cobweb and intersperses images of a classroom, robot hands, someone loading a Linux disc into an old computer, and even the famous photo of Albert Einstein sticking his tongue, before culminating in the message: \"You can just build things.\"",

    "title": "Anthropic took aim at OpenAI with a snarky ad and won the AI Super Bowl",
    "description": "Early social listening data suggests Super Bowl viewers were more buzzed about Anthropic's ad than OpenAI's.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a stink about how Anthropic's Super Bowl ad that took aim at his company was \"dishonest\" — but viewers seemed to love it.\n\nSeparate data from two social media listening companies, Meltwater and Sprout Social, suggest Super Bowl viewers were more buzzed about Anthropic's spot than OpenAI's.\n\nAnthropic's 30-second spot roasted OpenAI over its decision to bring ads to ChatGPT. The ad didn't mention its competitor by name, but featured a scrawny man asking a buffed trainer, \"Can I get a six pack quickly?\" The trainer initially gives helpful information in the voice of an AI chatbot, but then quickly segues into an ad.\n\nAnthropic's Super Bowl spot signed off with the tagline: \"There is a time and place for ads. Your conversations with AI should not be one of them.\" (A previous version of the ad that the company teased pre-game appeared to be a more direct swipe at OpenAI: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\")\n\nAfter Anthropic released a series of Super Bowl ad teasers last week, Altman responded with a lengthy post on X.\n\n\"First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed,\" Altman wrote. \"But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest.\" He added more fuel to the fire in an interview with the tech news show TBPN, reiterating his views on Anthropic's campaign.\n\nOpenAI's Super Bowl ad was a more earnest play, which encouraged viewers to use its coding agent to build their dream projects.\n\nData from Meltwater found that OpenAI's ad drew more engagement across social media between February 8 and 9 (25,649 for OpenAI vs. 9,985 for Anthropic). The measure of engagement includes likes, reposts, replies, and comments. However, Anthropic won the battle for positive sentiment. Per Meltwater, 25.5% of the posts about its Super Bowl ad were positive, compared to 16.3% for OpenAI.\n\nPeople discussing Anthropic's ads were largely talking about how funny the ads were, whereas much of the discussion about OpenAI was critical about its plans to bring ads to ChatGPT, Anna Amarotti, Meltwater's global consumer and market insights lead, told Business Insider.\n\nMeltwater's data found that Altman was referenced in about 5.0% of the Anthropic ad mentions and 4.7% of the OpenAI mentions. Anthropic Dario Amodei was present in 0.4% of Anthropic's mentions, and none of OpenAI's ad mentions over the period Meltwater looked at.\n\nThe OpenAI ad itself faced scrutiny, with Meltwater data showing the top viral post pointed out an apparent production error: a Windows laptop displaying the macOS ChatGPT app.\n\nThe new @OpenAI ad from the Super Bowl shows a macOS app running on a Windows laptop pic.twitter.com/vELUHxCwwf\n\nOverall, both brands saw stronger visibility in the lead-up to the Super Bowl than during the live moment, suggesting their impact was driven more by pre-event discussions, Meltwater's Amarotti said.\n\nData from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company that uses a different methodology, showed that Anthropic's ad had driven 7,847 mentions on social media as of early Monday morning, compared with OpenAI's 7,040. Sprout's analysis covered January 27 to February 9.\n\nThe YouTube video of Anthropic's \"Can I get a six pack quickly?\" has drawn more than 402,000 views since it was posted on February 4. ChatGPT's \"You Can Just Build Things\" ad, which was posted to YouTube less than 24 hours ago, has notched up over 81,000 views.\n\nTV measurement platform iSpot found that almost a quarter (23%) of Super Bowl ads mentioned AI, or, in one case — the Swedish vodka brand Svedka — was created using AI.\n\nGoogle had a sentimental commercial about a mother and child designing a new home using its Gemini app. Meta enlisted a Rolodex of athletes and the influencer iShowSpeed to showcase its Oakley Meta Performance AI glasses. The Amazon Alexa spot, starring Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky, poked fun at dystopian fears about AI turning evil.\n\nElsewhere, AI.com — a new AI platform launched by the founder of Crypto.com — invited viewers to visit its website to create a handle and create their own agents. The rush of traffic initially caused the website to crash. EDO, a TV measurement company, said AI.com's ad was the most engaging ad of the entire Super Bowl, driving 9.1 times the median engagement this year. EDO scores ads based on whether they drove consumers to take an action online, such as searching for that brand on Google.\n\nAdvertisers on average paid $8 million for 30 seconds of airtime during this year's Super Bowl, with some 30-second slots reaching as much as $10 million. Many Super Bowl LX advertisers leaned heavily on comedy and A-list celebrities as brands sought to play it safe in a charged political environment.",

    "description": "Surging prices in a corner of the tech market are inflating AI capex. Without that, there could be a \"notable deceleration\" in spending growth: RBC.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech's latest capex projections have shocked investors. Look beneath the headline numbers, though, and spending may actually be growing far more slowly.\n\nThat's according to new research on Monday from analysts at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAmazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are expected to spend almost $600 billion this year on data centers, chips, networking, and other related gear to meet surging AI demand.\n\nOn the surface, this may look like a relentless acceleration, but RBC's analysis suggests these growth numbers are being flattered by an unusual culprit: runaway memory prices.\n\nThe RBC analysts found that soaring prices for data center memory chips — including DRAM, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and NAND flash — could account for about 45% of the dollar growth in cloud capital expenditures for 2026. Crucially, most of that increase isn't coming from companies buying dramatically more hardware, but from paying much more for the same components, the analysts said.\n\nRBC estimates that data center memory spending across the top 10 hyperscalers will jump from about $107 billion in 2025 to roughly $237 billion in 2026. That $130 billion increase would represent about 45% of total capex growth at those companies. Even more striking, around three-quarters of the memory spend increase — roughly $98 billion — is attributable purely to higher prices, not higher unit volumes.\n\nThe price shock is severe. TrendForce projections cited by RBC show DRAM prices more than doubling in 2026, while NAND prices are expected to rise more than 85%. Memory has become one of the most constrained inputs in AI infrastructure, as advanced GPUs require large amounts of high-performance DRAM and HBM, while AI data centers consume massive quantities of flash storage.\n\nWhen RBC strips memory out of the equation, Big Tech's spending surge looks meaningfully different. Excluding memory costs, capex growth is projected to drop to about 40% in 2026, down from roughly 80% growth in 2025. That's still a strong expansion, but far less explosive than the raw capex totals imply.\n\nThe analysts described this as \"a notable deceleration,\" while adding that \"it's not necessarily cause for alarm.\"\n\nRBC argued that underlying AI investment remains robust, but warned that memory pricing is now the biggest wild card for capex trends heading into 2027.\n\nIn effect, Big Tech may be spending vastly more on some equipment — without building proportionally more — as the AI arms race collides with an overheated memory market.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Many incumbent companies are adopting AI aggressively yet seeing only marginal gains, because they are using it to optimize existing work rather than to rethink how work itself is organized. The real advantage of AI lies in its ability to break work into smaller units and enable new forms of coordination, which can make some familiar strategies obsolete while unlocking entirely new ones. For leaders, the critical question is no longer how fast to deploy AI tools but whether their organization’s underlying architecture of work—its bottlenecks, roles, and coordination structures—still fits what AI now makes possible.",

But according to new research, AI tools don’t reduce work, they consistently intensify it: In the study, employees worked at a faster pace, took on a broader scope of tasks, and extended work into more hours of the day, often without being asked to do so. That may sound like a win, but it’s not quite so simple. These changes can be unsustainable, leading to workload creep, cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making.

    "description": "AI-powered add-ons may collect a lot of information about you.",
    "fullText": "Browser extensions, even ones from trustworthy sources, are not without privacy and security risks. I've written before about add-ons that manage to slip through official store safeguards and even some that \"wake up\" as malware after operating normally for several years, so it should come as no surprise that a host of AI-powered browser extensions—collectively installed by tens of millions of users—may also be invading your privacy.\n\nResearchers at data removal service Incogni looked at browser extensions available in the Chrome Web Store that included \"AI\" in their name or description and employed AI as part of their core functionality. By analyzing the data collected and permissions required, they assessed both how likely extensions are to be used maliciously and their potential to cause significant damage if compromised.\n\nIncogni found that website content, such as text, images, sounds, videos, and hyperlinks, was the most commonly collected data type (by nearly a third of AI-powered extensions). More than 29% of extensions investigated harvest personally identifiable information (PII)—name, address, email, age, identification number, for example—from users. Other forms of data collected include user activity, authentication information, personal communication, location, financial and payment information, web history, and health information.\n\nThe most invasive extensions fall in the programming and mathematical aid category (such as Classology AI and StudyX), followed closely by meeting assistants and audio transcribers. Writing and personal assistants also pose privacy risks—and many of these are also among the most downloaded AI-powered extensions in Chrome.\n\nIncogni also assigned \"privacy-invasiveness\" scores to the most downloaded AI-powered extensions, a combination of the amount of data collected and both general and sensitive permissions required:\n\nGrammarly: AI Writing Assistant and Grammar Checker App (tied for #1)\n\nQuillbot: AI Writing and Grammar Checker Tool (tied for #1)\n\nSider: Chat wiht all AI (tied for #3)\n\nAI Grammar Checker & Paraphraser — LanguageTool (tied for #3)\n\nWPS PDF — Read, Edit, Fill, Convert, and AI Chat PDF with Ease (tied for #4)\n\nMonica: All-in-One AI Assist (tied for #4)\n\nAI Chat for Google (tied for #4)\n\nImmersive Translate — Translate Web & PDF\n\nGrammarly and Quillbot were found to collect PII and website content as well as location data like region, IP address, and GPS coordinates. Grammarly also harvest user activity through network monitoring, clicks, mouse and scroll positions, and keystroke logging. While both also require sensitive permissions—such as the ability to inject code into websites and access active browser tabs—they have a relatively low risk of being used maliciously.\n\nBrowser extensions that use AI aren't inherently bad, but you should be aware of what information they are collecting and what permissions they are requiring. The most common type of sensitive permissions required are scripting, which allows the extension to interact with pages as you navigate online, as well as activeTab, which lets it read or modify the page for the current session.\n\nWhen adding an extension (or installing an app or program), carefully review the permissions requested. If they aren't essential to the extension's functionality–or if they are but don't seem justified—you may be putting your data or device at risk by allowing them. As Incogni points out, users have to decide how much privacy to sacrifice in order to use apps and services.",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on golf superstar Ian Poulter plus the BBC readers and AI with his predictions for this week's midweek Premier League fixtures.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal's mental strength was questioned when their previous Premier League title run-ins faltered under Mikel Arteta, but one of their most famous fans feels their mindset will not be an issue this season.\n\nGolf superstar Ian Poulter, renowned for his own rock-solid self-belief and dominant performances under pressure in the Ryder Cup, feels Arteta has that side of things under control.\n\n\"I definitely don't need to give them a pep talk about it,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Mikel has got that nicely covered and they are in the right place. He really backs them up 100%, even if they make mistakes.\n\n\"Some of them have got some scar tissue of not getting over the line in the past but, mentally, you would hope Mikel has got the players more together than ever just by saying 'look you know you are good enough and we now have a deep enough squad, so you have every reason to go into every game more confident than you were before'.\"\n\nYou can watch Poulter play for Majesticks GC, external at the LIV Golf event in Adelaide, Australia from 12-15 February on TNT Sports.\n\nHe is also taking on BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton - as well as the BBC readers and AI - by trying to predict the results of this week's midweek Premier League matches on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can pick your own below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nBefore turning to golf, 50-year-old Poulter was a keen footballer and had trials with Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham aged 13.\n\n\"I am so glad that never worked out!\" he explained. \"I had two left feet, and it turned out everyone else Spurs have signed since has got two left feet as well.\n\n\"As soon as I turned 16, my focus was 100% on golf, and every waking minute of the day was about me being my own boss and telling myself that if I worked hard enough I would achieve big things.\n\n\"But I do miss football. I miss the kind of team camaraderie it gave me and I think that's why I've always loved the Ryder Cup as much as I've loved it.\n\n\"It's because that's where I can get the team aspect, the bonding and learning to how to win as a team, as well as the disappointments that come with that as well - I've always loved the dynamic of that extra pressure.\n\n\"Obviously going out to play golf for yourself is fine and you can take the hit if it doesn't work out, but having that the extra weight of playing for your peers and your captain is nice - if you can deal with it.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Ian Poulter were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.\n\nLeeds turned Chelsea over at Elland Road in December but they are not the same force away from home and this game smells of Chelsea revenge to me.\n\nThe Blues have made a good start under new boss Liam Rosenior, with four wins out of four in the league. Cole Palmer has hit form too, and they should win this fairly comfortably.\n\nIan's prediction: We annihilated Leeds a few days ago, and could have scored way more than the four we got. Chelsea look pretty solid at the moment too. 3-0\n\nEverton did well to fight back to beat Fulham late on at the weekend, but they could have been more than just a goal down at the break, while Bournemouth were unlucky only to draw with Aston Villa. They peppered Villa's goal with shots.\n\nI am going to go a bit leftfield here because although Everton beat Bournemouth earlier in the season, it was only thanks to a late deflected effort by Jack Grealish.\n\nI usually back Everton at home, and I'm usually wrong... so I am going to do something different this time. I am backing Bournemouth to pinch it.\n\nIan's prediction: It will be close but Everton to take it. 1-0\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 19:30\n\nTottenham captain Cristian Romero let his manager down with his red card against Manchester United, and now he is facing a four-game ban.\n\nIt's fine for Romero to be a motor mouth on social media, calling the club's recruitment \"disgraceful\", but he clearly needs to concentrate on his own game because he has been wild in the challenge again.\n\nFor a manager like Thomas Frank, who is under pressure, that is the last thing you need.\n\nPoor old Eddie Howe is feeling the heat at Newcastle too, though. We had callers in to 606 at the weekend saying it is time for a change - my reaction was 'what!?'.\n\nI really don't get that thinking at all, and not just because Howe's the guy who ended their long wait for a trophy, less than a year ago.\n\nHis squad is stretched now because of the Champions League and their run to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, and he also had everything around Alexander Isak's exit to deal with at the start of the season, when it wasn't his doing.\n\nHowe just hasn't been able to replace Isak, either. Yoane Wissa has taken a while to get up and running and Nick Woltemade is very different to Isak in that he likes to come to the ball all the time.\n\nPeople are saying a change of voice might help, but what about backing the guy who has given you so much happiness? I don't understand why you'd want him out.\n\nThis is a very difficult game to predict for various reasons, but we do know Spurs are poor at home and Newcastle aren't great away.\n\nI still think someone will win it, but I am going to sit in the middle anyway, and go for a draw.\n\nIan's prediction: A point apiece. 1-1\n\nBoth of these teams have found a bit of form, and West Ham's victory over Burnley was huge for them in their fight against the drop.\n\nIt seems Manchester United can do no wrong under Michael Carrick, who has often been linked with the West Ham job down the years but goes back to his old club looking for a fifth straight win.\n\nI think he will get it, too. We had some callers into 606 thinking United would be Arsenal's biggest challengers from now on, which seems a stretch, but there is no doubt they are on a bit of a high.\n\nThis is the sort of game where idiots like me can get sucked in and get on the Carrick bandwagon... I am wary, but I am still going to be positive and jump on board too.\n\nIan's prediction: I don't like to say it but United have won their past four games and they have actually looked really good. They have got the bit between their teeth. 0-2\n\nBrighton have only won one of their past 12 league games so the worry for them has to be that they will get sucked into the relegation scrap.\n\nIt was a 4-3 home defeat by Aston Villa in December that was the start of this poor run for Fabian Hurzeler's side, and I don't see it ending at Villa Park.\n\nI'm surprised that the Seagulls are struggling. I looked at their bench against Crystal Palace at the weekend and thought 'blimey, they've got a good squad' but they are underperforming and the fans seem really split on Hurzeler, and have been for a while.\n\nVilla were lucky to get a point against Bournemouth at the weekend and I couldn't believe how Lucas Digne just let Rayan run past him for the Cherries equaliser. He seemed to give up and it was astonishingly bad defending.\n\nUnai Emery's side have lost their past two home league games, against Everton and Brentford, which worries me.\n\nWill it be a hat-trick of home defeats, or will they come good again? I've got to back my old team, so I am going with my heart here and saying Morgan Rogers will make the difference.\n\nIan's prediction: Villa might stumble again. 0-0\n\nCrystal Palace's win over Brighton was a huge result for them and the Eagles are definitely not short of firepower - if anything they have got too many centre-forwards now, but that's a good problem to have.\n\nBurnley have had it though - I thought that before they lost at home to West Ham on Saturday, but there can't be any doubt they are going down now.\n\nI don't think the Clarets will get anything here, either, but their fans seem to have turned on manager Scott Parker which I really don't like.\n\nThis is the guy who got them up but because the other promoted sides, Sunderland and Leeds, are having better seasons, that has gone against him.\n\nJust on the eyes, whenever I've watched them, Burnley have been competitive and have been in games.\n\nI just think there needs to be a bit of patience from their supporters, but of course they are entitled to their opinion.\n\nIan's prediction: Burnley really need a win but they won't get one. 1-0\n\nWas Sunday's late comeback to win at Anfield the game that will spark Manchester City's title bid?\n\nTime will tell, but I am not convinced. I still think the issues that saw City fall behind in the first place will still cost them in future games too.\n\nFair play to Pep Guardiola's side for turning things around with six minutes to go, because their record at Anfield was so poor and a point would not have been enough for them.\n\nBut I just don't see this City team controlling games any\n\nSunday was no different. They were getting mauled in the second half by wave after wave of Liverpool attacks, before the chaos at the end. Gianluigi Donnarumma's save was a big moment and I was delighted that Erling Haaland stuck his penalty away because he's captain of my fantasy team and that gave me a good score.\n\nAs a neutral, I hope the title race lasts until the final few weeks of the season but I just feel like City will drop too many more points before then.\n\nFulham are a good footballing side and almost got something from City at Craven Cottage in December - I was there, and City only just held on for a 5-4 win.\n\nMarco Silva's side have been hard done by in their past couple of games because they had plenty of chances in their defeat at Manchester United, then could have been well ahead at the break before they lost to Everton too.\n\nThis time? Well I think Fulham will score at Etihad Stadium too, and they are due a bit of a break. Maybe they will get it against City, but I am still going for a home win.\n\nIan's prediction: City will win this one. 2-0\n\nI was at Elland Road on Friday and Nottingham Forest were insipid in their defeat by Leeds - they were really flat.\n\nThis is a real pressure game for Forest, and in many ways it is the worst possible fixture for them. Wolves are hopeless so, if Forest win, their fans will say 'well we should be beating them, because they are rubbish'.\n\nLose or even drop points, however, then you can imagine the atmosphere and the mood of the fans, and the pressure that will put on the players.\n\nI don't mean pressure in terms of any calls to sack Forest boss Sean Dyche, but the negativity there will be around the team, when the mood of the fans can be massive when a team is fighting the drop.\n\nLeeds are a great example of that, actually. Just look at the positivity at Elland Road recently and how that has helped Leeds in the past few weeks. It was a very different story when the fans were unhappy earlier in the season.\n\nAs for Wolves, well they are not under any pressure any more.\n\nThey are playing for pride which is totally different to Forest's situation, where every point counts - and this is going to be a nervy night for the home fans at the City Ground.\n\nIan's prediction: Forest to edge it. 1-0\n\nThe Liverpool fans seem to have had enough of Arne Slot, which again makes no sense to me. Just because they aren't going to win the title again doesn't mean they aren't building anything.\n\nIt seems that making the Champions League places is like the title used to be now - as in, if you don't make the Champions League then the manager has got to go. It drives me potty.\n\nI know Sunderland lost at Arsenal on Saturday but I still enjoyed their performance.\n\nThat might sound odd because they were beaten 3-0 but I still thought the Black Cats were competitive, and they were really physical too. They matched Arsenal for long spells of the game.\n\nSo, Liverpool will know what to expect when they try to become the first team to win at Stadium of Light this season, and this is going to be a very difficult game for them.\n\nSlot needs a positive result here, for Liverpool to keep in touch with the teams above them in the race for the top four. My only concern about Sunderland is whether they can bring that same physicality again, but I still don't think Liverpool will win.\n\nIan's prediction: I just have a feeling Liverpool can sneak this one. 1-2\n\nCan Brentford produce another shock after beating Aston Villa and Newcastle in the past couple of weeks? No, they can't.\n\nKeith Andrews has done an incredible job as Bees boss and they will make life difficult for Arsenal because they are well organised and dangerous on the break.\n\nBut I still think Arsenal will win because of their sheer power that means they can run through anything.\n\nThis might not be the most entertaining game to watch, because Brentford will sit in and defend, and counter.\n\nArsenal will deal with that, and then find a way of scoring. A deflected goal will probably decide it.\n\nPeople might say the way they win games is not pretty but there is still a lot to admire about Arsenal and, in the end, no matter what anyone says, it is all about winning, isn't it?\n\nArsenal are very good at winning games, and I am expecting them to win this one too. In my opinion, they will go on and win the title too, because of the quality of their squad and how good they are defensively.\n\nAs much as you want beauty to triumph over a beast, City are still far too flaky for that to happen.\n\nIan on Arsenal's title hopes: I feel pretty confident, even with the couple of slip-ups we've had in the past month. We've got the strength in depth we need where other players can step up when we are missing players through injury.\n\nIf Viktor Gyokeres can start filling the onion bag up and Bukayo Saka can bag a few as well then that would be nice, but we look so good from set-pieces anyway. Our scoring stats from open play could be a bit of an issue but as long as we are scoring and winning then it doesn't really matter.\n\nIan's prediction: This is going to be a non-stressful win. We will be 2-0 up, concede a stupid goal but then finish the game off. 1-3\n\nChris and AI both got four correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games in week 25, giving them a total of 40 points apiece.\n\nHis guest, Gladiators star Apollo, was right about Manchester City's win at Anfield [everyone else went for a 2-2 draw] and ended up on 70 points thanks to four correct results including one exact score.\n\nBut the win went to the collective efforts of the BBC readers, with five correct results and one exact score [Bournemouth's 1-1 draw with Aston Villa] for a tally of 80 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "He has been jailed, tracked and threatened by China’s government. What was it like pay a visit home? As he publishes a polemic about surveillance and state control, the artist relives a momentous trip to see his mother\n\nAi Weiwei is talking me through the decision-making process before his first visit to China in over a decade. The artist, known around the world as the most famous critic of the Chinese communist regime, had to do some fraught arithmetic before deciding to head back home.\n\nBefore boarding a flight with his son, who had never met the artist’s elderly mother, Ai thought back to his time in detention when his captors told him he would spend the next 13 years in custody on bogus charges: “They said, ‘When you come out, your son won’t recognise you.’ That was very heavy and really the only moment that touched me.”\n\nHe ended up spending several months in captivity. Lao, his son, is now 17. Ai says Lao doesn’t really need his guidance any more so he decided to book their flights and roll the dice. “People said, ‘Are you scared?’ I said, ‘No, why should I be scared?’ I’m Chinese. I have a Chinese passport. I’m entitled to go back and see my mum. So I went back.”\n\nWelcome to the life of Ai Weiwei. For most people, returning home doesn’t involve weighing up the risk of whether you’ll see close family ever again, but that’s the reality for a 68-year-old whose whole existence has been shaped by authoritarianism and the struggle against it.\n\nHis trip to China went well. He ended up being interviewed at the airport and released after a couple of hours into a country whose smells, sights and sounds were soothing to him. Ai described the journey as being like “a phone call suddenly reconnecting”. Today, he’s more poetic, describing it as “a piece of jade broken that you can put back together because it matches very well. Everything’s so familiar: the light, the temperature, the people.”\n\nAi is meeting me in the London offices of his publisher to talk about his new book, On Censorship, a 90-page polemic on the nature of state control, AI and surveillance. The man certainly knows about these things. Born in Beijing in 1957, he grew up in labour camps in north-west China following the exile of his father, the poet Ai Qing. In 2011, he was detained for 81 days in a 170 sq ft windowless prison because of his own activism. Upon his release, he was tracked, interrogated and threatened by the Chinese state; then his passport was returned in 2015 and he began a life in exile. He currently divides his time between Lisbon, Berlin and Cambridge.\n\nHis artworks are as dramatic as his backstory. An army of 1,600 Chinese artisans created 100m hand-painted porcelain “seeds” that were scattered over the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in London 16 years ago. He cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus in 14,000 fluorescent orange lifejackets worn by refugees; and made a film dedicated to the children who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. That direct challenge to the official state narrative made him “the most dangerous person in China”.\n\nHis upcoming work, at Aviva Studios in Manchester, involves 30 tonnes of buttons, which were saved from a London factory that was closing down and smuggled into China to be turned into huge hanging artworks by craftspeople.\n\nThe book is a startling read, arguing that those in the west misunderstand the nature of censorship. He defines it as “the exercise of power over intellectual space”, both “an indispensable tool of mental enslavement and a fundamental source of political corruption”. It is not just authoritarian regimes, he warns. Liberal societies think that censorship is rare, “but people forget that even on sunny days, shadows are inevitable”.\n\nSome of the arguments are perplexing. In a section about the limitations of AI, the artist refers to the selfie he took with AfD leader Alice Weidel in 2018. He says AI decided that the image, which is real, must have been fake because the pair seemed to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At the time of the selfie, Weidel, whose grandfather was a Nazi, was considered to be in the more moderate wing of the far-right party, but since becoming leader has called for “large-scale repatriations” of foreigners, saying the country’s focus on the Holocaust is akin to a “guilt cult”.\n\nDoes Ai regret the selfie? He tells me that on many issues, her political demands “could be wrong”, but she’s still “more rational than other political opponents in Germany”. What about her anti-immigrant rhetoric – isn’t that anathema to him? “Some states don’t even accept one [immigrant] and Germany accepts 1.2 million, which is a pretty generous decision,” he replies. “So if they change the policy and they want to limit it, then there is nothing wrong.”\n\nHe’s also impressed by the fact that Weidel “openly wants Germany to be more independent from American influence”. He adds: “I think those are some of the things that we need to do.” Those who know German politics would find that argument surprising because the AfD are seen as the party who are closest to Trump and nearly all parties in the country want more independence from the US. A ringing endorsement of someone at the outermost reaches of far-right European politics might cause a few double takes, and there are more surprises.\n\nAi’s attitude to China has shifted dramatically. The nation, he said recently, is “in an upward phase,” pointing to the technological advancements made and increased personal freedoms. The west, however, struggles to “sustain its own logic”, has lost its “ethical authority” and has “descended into something barely recognisable”.\n\nAlthough a quick glance across the Atlantic at America in the age of ICE raids does somewhat make his point, he means Europe, too. So is the Chinese regime’s most famous critic now toeing the party line? “My position with China started before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in this black hole with my father,” he says, pointing to a picture on his iPhone of a desolate location in north-west China.\n\nHe’s not angry exactly, but the suggestion that he’s softened on the Chinese government has touched a nerve. “I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. So that’s my only relationship to China,” he says. “I’m not nostalgic. I’m not patriotic.” What about the claim that the west embraces censorship? Is that his experience in the UK? “I cannot get into details,” he says cryptically. “But I feel the same kind of surveillance, same kind of censorship in the west.”\n\nPressed for an example, he tells me a story about the Royal Academy in London, an institution that gave him a landmark exhibition in 2015 and made him an honorary member in 2011 following his detainment in China. In November 2023, an exhibition of new works to be shown at the Lisson Gallery was pulled after he posted a tweet that began: “The sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world.” The tweet was deleted, with the artist telling journalists his show had “effectively [been] cancelled”.\n\nIn the aftermath, a vote was then held at the RA to determine whether his membership should be revoked because of accusations that the post was antisemitic. “I don’t have the intention of an antisemite. My best friends, they’re all Jewish people,” says Ai. “I tweeted millions of tweets on Twitter, but [how is it that] this tweet can cause such trouble? Then they said the procedure is to let the Academicians vote.”\n\nHis peers supported him and he won the vote. Ai was then asked to write an article about freedom of speech for the RA’s magazine, which he did, arguing: “Speaking the truth and insisting on one’s own perspective is dangerous and may come at a heavy price. Books may go unpublished, exhibitions may be closed, concerts cancelled.”\n\nAfter he sent it, there was silence. Then he says the RA claimed they didn’t have room to run the piece. For him, this is the censorship in the west, which he argues in On Censorship can be “more covert, more deceptive and more corrosive” than in authoritarian regimes. “I have several cases like this,” Ai adds. “Happens in Britain and in Germany.”\n\nThe RA disputes this account, claiming the decision to drop the piece was made before Ai submitted it. A spokesperson added: “Plurality of voices, tolerance and free thinking are at the core of what we stand for and seek to protect.”\n\nI wonder how Ai feels about the world in 2026. His new book paints it as a place without refuge for those who value self-expression and freedom of speech. “I think today we are living in a complicated world, where life is more like a shattered mirror,” he says. “It reflects the reality, but the reality can be a broken reality.”\n\nDid his trip to China restore his faith in humanity? There’s a pause. “If we were in the time of the Tang dynasty, someone like me would go back and write beautiful poetry,” he says, smiling. “But not today. I just take a few selfies.”",

    "title": "OpenClaw creator makes a case for 'specialized intelligence' over superintelligence",
    "description": "OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said specialized AI, not AGI or LLMs, is a better future for the technology.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, many investors, founders, and tech giants often frame AI as an all-powerful force — something approaching omniscience.\n\nThey call it artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical system capable of matching or exceeding human reasoning across virtually all tasks and, beyond that, superintelligence, which would surpass human cognition altogether.\n\nAGI is the thing OpenAI and its competitors are racing to be the first to bring to life.\n\nThe industry isn't a monolith, however, nor are its builders.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, the now-viral personal AI assistant powering the agent-only social network, Moltbook, told the Y Combinator podcast on Saturday that he thinks the best AI is specialized, not generalized.\n\n\"What can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space?\" he said. \"As a group we specialize, as a larger society we specialize even more.\"\n\nHe said the same holds true for AI. Current AI systems are labeled as \"general.\" In practice, however, they are already specialized for particular tasks — like startups building models to solve Erdos math problems or identify gene mutations.\n\nWhile the hype around AI has largely focused on the types of models being built — from large language models to computer vision systems or even world models — some startups and tech giants are also experimenting with more focused, subject-specific forms of intelligence.\n\nAxiom, a startup founded by former Meta researcher Carina Hong and backed by $64 million in seed funding, for instance, is building specialized intelligence to tackle advanced mathematics.\n\nGoogle DeepMind has developed AlphaGenome, a system designed to predict how variants or mutations in human DNA affect a wide range of gene-regulating biological processes.\n\nCompanies are also developing smaller models, which could make it easier to build AI systems tailored to specific subjects or domains. Aidan Gomez, the CEO of Cohere, which builds AI technology for enterprises, told Business Insider in 2024 that there was increasing pressure to build \"smaller, more efficient models\" and to make them smarter with the right data and algorithms, rather than just scaling them.\n\nSteinberger is not the only one to push back against the idea of an all-powerful general intelligence.\n\nTimnit Gebru, a computer scientist who founded and leads the Distributed AI Research Institute, said AGI is a \"fictional thing\" in a November video published by Nature.\n\nShe said the backbone of engineering lies in building well-scoped, testable systems. The pursuit of a \"fictional, undefined 'machine god,'\" she said, is pushing the industry toward deeper labor exploitation and environmental damage.\n\nSteinberger, previously best known for launching the PDF processing company PSPDFKit, came out of retirement to build with AI. He said the technology has come a long way since he started, when his goal was simply to build \"something that could type stuff so my computer could do things.\"",

    "title": "AI agents failed at real-world consulting tasks — but Mercor's CEO says they're still on track to replace consultants",
    "description": "Mercor found AI agents failed at most consulting tasks, but its CEO says the models are improving so rapidly consultants should be worried.",
    "fullText": "New research suggests an AI agent can't fully replace a human consultant — at least for now.\n\nMercor, the AI training giant, tested how well leading AI models, acting as agents, performed real-world consulting, banking, and legal tasks.\n\nThe models failed most of the time, but Mercor's CEO, Brendan Foody, told Business Insider that the results tell only part of the story.\n\nThe consulting tasks in Mercor's APEX-Agents benchmark were designed to simulate real management consulting work, based on expert surveys and input from consultants at McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte, Accenture, and EY.\n\nAcross all task categories, the AI agents successfully completed the tasks less than 25% of the time on the first try. Given eight attempts, the agents could only complete 40% of the tasks. For the management consulting tasks, OpenAI's GPT 5.2 initially performed the best, completing nearly 23% of the tasks on its first attempt. Anthropic's Opus 4.6, released this week, performed even better at nearly 33%.\n\nWhile many of the tasks were not completed, Foody said the success rate for GPT 3 was only 3%, compared to 23% for GPT 5.2. Anthropic's model went from 13% to 33% on consulting tasks in a matter of months. Foody said he expects the success rate of the models to be closer to 50% by the end of the year.\n\n\"These are some of the hardest tasks in the economy that people pay millions of dollars to consulting firms to do, and the models are finally being able to do them with an incredible rate of progress,\" Foody said.\n\nAI has already disrupted the consulting industry, changing the way firms hire and make money, but the likelihood of agents displacing consultants grows as the models continue to improve.\n\nMcKinsey chief Bob Sternfels recently said the prestigious management consulting firm had 60,000 employees, 25,000 of which were AI agents.\n\nSternfels recently said it's the first time in McKinsey's history that the company is able to grow without growing its head count.\n\nThe frontier models Mercor tested included those from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, among others.\n\nOne example consulting task instructed the AI agent to \"analyze category consumption patterns and market penetration using the Category Penetration Score methodology for PureLife's portfolio strategy,\" asking for several specific outputs in response. The AI agents failed to produce an accurate response.\n\n\"No model is ready to replace a professional end-to-end,\" the findings concluded.\n\nMercor found the AI agents were great at research and pretty good at data analysis, Foody said.\n\nWhere they consistently got tripped up was on longer-horizon tasks — the longer it would take a human to complete a task, or the more steps it took, was the biggest indicator that the model might have a hard time.\n\nUnlike a human, Foody said, the models struggle to understand where in a specific file system they should look for the right information, so they often end up looking at the wrong files. They struggle with the planning side of figuring out how to work with multiple tools and cross-referencing files at the same time.\n\nFor tasks that can be done in an hour or less or that only require the use of a single tool, the models perform relatively well.\n\nFoody said the agents are almost like interns, where they might have a 50% pass rate, and the partner is still noticing a lot of issues in the work.\n\nFrank Jones, a former KPMG consultant who now works as an expert contractor for Mercor, said in his experience training AI, he's found the models can get close at certain tasks, but that some human refinement is often needed.\n\nHe also said the models need very specific prompts because they don't always understand common expectations or phrases in consulting, like \"client-ready.\"\n\n\"Most consultants, they know what that means. But for AI, I think there's a lot of nuance in that,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Foody, continuing to improve the models doesn't require a breakthrough — it requires more and better training, which the frontier labs are already investing heavily in.\n\n\"That's why we have so much revenue,\" he said, adding, \"We're in the business of replacing human judgment.\"\n\nMercor, whose clients have included OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, secured a funding deal in the fall that valued the company at $10 billion. Mercor employs more than 30,000 contractors around the world who help train AI models through tasks like rewriting chatbot responses. Foody previously said the company grew its revenue in 2025 by 4,658%.\n\nFoody said he believes consulting, and especially lower-level roles, are among the jobs he's confident will be displaced by AI. He said the next version of the AI agents benchmark will expand to evaluate the whole value chain of a professional services firm: \"Instead of evaling the analyst, we're evaling McKinsey itself.\"\n\nRight now, he says Mercor's AI agent benchmark tells an appealing story for McKinsey, because the company could say it shows they can use AI to add value but not replace humans.\n\n\"The next version of APEX tells a very scary story for McKinsey,\" he said, adding, \"In the coming two years, we're going to have chatbots that are as good as the best consulting firm.\"",

    "fullText": "Authors, a newsreader, a lawyer and an esteemed colleague: they’re all great – but I’m not married to any of them. Can we really depend on this technology?\n\nRecently, the Rowsons accidentally invented a new game that anyone can play at home. I have yet to come up with a world-beating name for it, so for now let’s just call it “How bloody stupid is AI?” The playing of the game will change from player to player, depending on their circumstances – but essentially the rules remain the same. Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.\n\nIn my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.\n\nIt’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny. As a satirist, I have always been a fool for anything that points up the even greater folly of our leaders, the tools of their techbro masters or the true capabilities of our new robot overlords. Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”\n\nImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overview was “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically is not my wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:\n\nTextile designer Fiona Scott-Wilson.\n\nActor Fiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.\n\nJulia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this is the fantasy author, the illustrator, the late powerlifter or another Julia Mills altogether).\n\nWriter and journalist Emily Rees.\n\nLawyer and academic Siva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.\n\nWriter and journalist Carrie McLaren.\n\nChannel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman.\n\nCNN correspondent Clarissa Ward.\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Rachel Johnson.\n\nThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.\n\nThen it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does he exist?\n\nThere was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. Playwright Lee Hall got a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.\n\nAs for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).\n\nAnother search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalist Ann Widdecombe (his ex-wife), Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author, Polly Toynbee is a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”\n\nFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”\n\nI suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.\n\nWhile my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imagine that family Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.\n\nWe should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?\n\nI wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”\n\nMartin Rowson is a cartoonist and author",

    "description": "Opinion: After decades in the trenches, this engineer is done with hype cycles",
    "fullText": "Opinion The real opponent of digital sovereignty is \"enterprise IT\" marketing, according to one Red Hat engineer who ranted entertainingly about the repeated waves of bullshit the industry hype cycle emits.\n\nDuring a coffee break at this year's CentOS Connect conference, The Reg FOSS desk paused for a chat with a developer who was surprised but happy to find us there. We won't name them – we're sure that they'd prefer to keep their job rather than enjoy a moment of fame – but we much enjoyed their pithy summary of how IT has faced repeated waves of corporate bullshit for at least 15 years now, and how they keenly and enthusiastically anticipate a large-scale financial collapse bursting the AI bubble.\n\nThis vulture has been working in the tech field for some 38 years now, and the Linux developer we spoke with has been in the business nearly as long. We both agreed that the late 20th century – broadly, the period from the early 1990s onward for a decade or so – had mostly been one of fairly steady improvement. Then, they suggested, roughly following the 2008 credit crunch, we've had some 15 years of bullshit in tech.\n\nThey called out about half a dozen particular instances of what they considered to be bullshit technology. We were too busy laughing sympathetically to whip out a laptop to make notes, but as best as we can recall the sequence, they were:\n\nAdding back some of the rather invective-laden commentary…\n\nContainers: Sure, yes, they work, they are handy for testing. But they aren't a deployment method. You shouldn't need them. Anything that you can run in a container, you can just run on the bare metal, and if you're not competent enough to get – and keep – that working, then you probably aren't competent enough to deploy a container either.\n\nKubernetes: If you don't need containers, then you don't need another vastly more complicated tool to deploy those containers. The chances are, you are not a vast multinational that must be able to withstand ten million potential new customers visiting your site all at once. It won't happen, so you won't lose any of that imaginary business.\n\n(This is sometimes known as the Use One Big Server approach, and in our humble opinion, it has great merit.)\n\nThe cloud: Nebulous by name and by nature. Who thought it was smart to take all your company's important data and hand it to some internet rando – probably the lowest bidder – trusting them to store the crown jewels, keep them safe, and never ever peek at them. If that sounds reasonable to you, maybe you should try selling homeopathy.\n\n(This can be summarized as There Is No Cloud – There's Just Somebody Else's Computer, and was being spelled out in clear language in 2015.)\n\nAnything \"as a service\" – it doesn't matter what: Infrastructure as a service – if you need servers, buy servers, or rent your own private servers. Nobody else will ever care as much about your servers as you will. Platform as a Service – now you don't even get servers, just OS instances. That's even worse. Software as a Service? Now you don't even know what the server is, or where it is, or what it's running; you don't get software, and you don't even know what data you have or how it's stored – you're paying for access to your own stuff.\n\n(The problems with this entire concept arguably go back to Peter Deutsch's Fallacies of Network Computing some 30 years ago.)\n\nThe blockchain, and anything built on the blockchain: the world's slowest and most-distributed database. Cryptocurrencies? Hashcash on the blockchain. NFTs – URL shorteners on the blockchain, only they're longer rather than shorter. Worthless. Web3? Get ripped off, as a service.\n\nWhich brings us round to \"generative AI\" or, as we prefer to term them, large language models, powered by the transformer algorithm. If The Financial Times can explain how it works to a banker in a couple of thousand words and a few minutes, it can't be that complicated or hard to understand, and it isn't. It's predictive text turned up to 11. It can't even count. As Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, caustically observed:\n\nThe \"i\" in \"LLM\" stands for intelligence.\n\n(This vulture laid out some of his case against it when Gentoo and NetBSD banned LLM bot slop in 2024.)\n\nHonestly, we can't fault any of this reasoning. We've looked into the chronological sequence of the waves of marketing drivel, and it's not quite how we expected. Although the earliest mention of Salesforce.com we can find on The Reg is from 2002, when we called it \"relatively new,\" it was founded in 1999. Perhaps the first mass SaaS offering to the general public was Google's Gmail in 2004.\n\nCloud computing in the sense of automatic creation and deployment of VMs arguably dates to Amazon taking Amazon Web Services live in 2002.\n\nWhoever \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" is or was, their paper [PDF] introducing Bitcoin was published in 2008, although it didn't come to The Reg's attention until 2011.\n\n2008 was also the year that the first version of LXC (you can still find version 0.1.0 on the downloads page) was released. Docker debuted in 2013 but your humble correspondent had predicted that Linux containers would be the Next Big Thing a couple of years earlier, back in 2011. We reckon we called it.\n\nKubernetes first appeared in 2014, although Google had been running \"Borg\" internally since around 2008. We still harbor a cynical suspicion that Mountain View threw it over the wall for no other reason than to distract the Penguinisti and keep them busy.\n\nSo in chronological order, those are:\n\n2002: Cloud computing goes mainstream with AWS\n\n2004: SaaS reaches the general public\n\n2008: LXC frees application containers from FreeBSD's Jail and brings them to Linux… and Bitcoin delivers full industrial-scale mass-production of the ancient scam of the pyramid scheme\n\n2014: Kubernetes is loosed upon an all-too-willing tech world\n\n2022: ChatGPT opens to the public, or as The Reg calls it, another AI to fill the world with kinda-true stuff\n\nAll right, yes, rather more than 15 years. \"A century of tech BS\" seems a bit over the top when it's only 2026, but it certainly feels that long.\n\nObviously there are many more potential candidates, but we thought this was an excellent top six. Some of the other contenders are more niche, from the eternally awful Jira to the project managers' religion of Agile. Which of your bêtes noires did we miss? ®",

    "title": "I see how important AI is at Google, so I taught my kids about it. Now, they're vibe coding.",
    "description": "A Google executive explains why he taught his kids to understand AI — and how they ended up vibe coding and participating in a hackathon.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Asif Saleem, a financial services go-to-market lead for Japan and the Asia Pacific region at Google. Asif is the father of 13-year-old Usman Asif and 18-year-old Shanzey Asif. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt's important for parents to help kids understand we're going through a very transformative time. This is like the era when the internet or mobile first emerged. With AI, it may be even bigger.\n\nKids need to understand this and embrace the technology. Whatever they end up studying — computer science, English, or philosophy — they can make AI part of it.\n\nI was curious about Cursor and some of the other vibecoding tools, so I joined a few \"Code with AI\" weekend sessions for executives.\n\nI really enjoyed it. Within a matter of hours, we were able to develop different applications. I developed a statement analyzer for a financial services system.\n\nOnce I came back home, I spoke to my family about it and showed them the demo. My children, Usman and Shanzey, are both tech-savvy, so that drove their interest. They attended the same course a few weeks later.\n\nThey were the youngest in the class. The good part was that they were completely independent, so I let them be on their own. That's how they ventured into vibe coding and participated in Cursor's 24-hour weekend hackathon in Singapore.\n\nThey've become more curious about things. Through vibe coding, they've learned to be more creative and to use technology to understand how things work.\n\nNeither of them has a formal technology background — they're not software developers — but they've been able to think through ideas, be more creative, and use technology to solve problems.\n\nTechnology is the biggest enabler. The question is how humans use it — whether for good or bad. If it's for good, what are the guardrails?\n\nUsing it for good means creating value, solving real challenges, and making information more accessible.\n\nManaging screentime is the reason we developed a reward system for Usman because he's young and he loves gaming. Gaming comes as a reward for achieving goals. Those goals include making your own breakfast, making your bed, or helping clean the house.\n\nWhen Shanzey is studying, she can't use AI for the content she's creating — it can't even be AI-inspired. It has to be her original work.\n\nThat's super important because schools validate whether output is AI-generated. The same applies to Usman.\n\nIt's important to have both physical and digital skills. Usman plays football because physical activity is important at his age. Shanzey is focused on school right now — her exams are very important, and getting good grades matters.\n\nI'd say my role is more like a coach — brainstorming with them. My wife does the same, helping them think through ideas and keeping them honest.\n\nI'm often busy with work, so a lot of this couldn't be done without my wife's help.\n\nThere's nothing better than hands-on learning. That's something I've learned over the last few years.\n\nYou will face challenges and go through them. Parents should get their kids to do things, give them challenges, and nurture them as they work through those challenges. With hands-on experience, they can get better results faster.\n\nWith building an app, we co-create the idea, but then the important part is making it happen and reporting back on progress.\n\nAt Google, I work with enterprise customers trying to transform their businesses with AI. I can see what's happening on the ground and how things are changing.\n\nI also see a lot of young talent at Google. They come in thinking about creating apps and learning skills, and I mentor some of them as well.\n\nIt's important to communicate this to my family. I spent time helping them understand how the world is changing and why it's important for them to understand AI.\n\nIt's not about running away from technology. AI will keep advancing, and the only thing you can do is be accustomed to it, no matter what you want to become.\n\nWe're now in a situation where we have very intelligent large language models, and we're also moving toward agentic AI, where you can work with agents that help you do a lot more. Speed and agility are improving, and you can now work within larger ecosystems that combine humans and machines, achieving much more.\n\nIf you know how to coexist and let machines do meaningful work with you, that's a skill to aspire to.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding?

    "description": "Shn Juay, the co-CEO of \"serious dating app\" Coffee Meets Bagel, said using an AI chatbot to flirt could cause an \"expectation mismatch.\"",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence has entered the realm of online dating. But Coffee Meets Bagel's CEO says there's a mark it can't meet.\n\nShn Juay, the co-CEO of the dating app that has around 20 million users worldwide, said her team was exploring how to integrate AI into its app.\n\nBut she said using AI chatbots to flirt with potential matches was taking it one step too far.\n\n\"I'm on the fence about using a chatbot to represent yourself in the online app to flirt better,\" Juay, who is based in Singapore, said.\n\n\"You have to eventually meet your partner offline, and when you meet, there could be an expectation mismatch,\" she said. \"Your partner might think that you were so engaging on the app, but not in person.\"\n\nCoffee Meets Bagel markets its app as \"for serious daters,\" showing users about 20 potential matches daily.\n\nFor Coffee Meets Bagel, AI still has a place in the online dating sphere. Juay said that the company is planning to use AI to detect scammers and catfishers in its app.\n\n\"It is hurting the dating app industry because we see an increase in users who are using AI-generated photos to misrepresent themselves,\" she said.\n\nAnother useful implementation, she said, was using it to help daters ask each other better questions.\n\n\"Chats fizzle out because — in Asia especially — we are more shy and not great at asking each other questions after 'Hi, how are you,' 'What job are you in,' and 'What are your hobbies?'\"\n\nSeveral app makers are exploring ways to add AI to the dating mix.\n\nMatch Group CEO Spencer Rascoff said in a tech event in October that AI is \"changing everything\" about its dating apps. Match Group owns Tinder, Hinge, and OkCupid, among others.\n\nIn April, Tinder released \"The Game Game,\" an interactive AI chatbot that allows users to practice flirting for five minutes in \"over-the-top, meet-cute scenarios.\" A Business Insider reporter tried the chatbot and found it largely unhelpful.\n\nGrindr's CEO, George Arison, said on a November earnings call that AI would make its app a \"magical experience.\"\n\nOther apps, like Amata, Facebook Dating, Sitch, and Three Day Rule, work like AI-powered matchmakers, narrowing down the dating pool to appeal to daters experiencing swipe fatigue. A pair of Business Insider reporters who tested the apps found them slightly expensive but appreciated that they did the heavy lifting of planning dates.\n\nAnd some daters are taking matters into their own hands, using AI as a wingman by getting tools like ChatGPT to craft Hinge bios and come up with pickup lines.\n\nCoffee Meets Bagel conducted a survey in November with 1,050 of its users in the US, aged 21 to 35. About 80% said they were comfortable with AI assisting them with dating, such as helping decide who to respond to first based on compatibility and responding to common questions.",

But not to Claude,\" the tag line reads.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Anthropic's Super Bowl ad last week in a lengthy X post.\n\n\"First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed,\" Altman wrote. \"But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest.\"\n\nOpenAI's own one-minute ad, released on Sunday, is more earnest. It shows a man's lifelong pursuit of knowledge from childhood to adulthood. The ad ends with him using OpenAI's Codex tool to further his goals.\n\n\"Our job was to make a film that feels like the beginning of a builder's story with the curiosity, the frustration, and the eventual breakthroughs,\" Michael Tabtabai, OpenAI's vice president of Global Creative, said in a statement.\n\n\"We drew from the influences that shaped our own researchers and engineers, then paired that with real stories from across the country of people using ChatGPT to build in everyday life,\" he said. \"If someone watching thinks, 'I wonder if I can do that,' we've done our job.\"",

    "description": "OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy says 'agentic engineering is the next evolution in AI coding as vibe-coding marks its first anniversary.",
    "fullText": "\"Vibe-coding\" just celebrated its first birthday. That's a lifetime in the AI boom.\n\nNow, the man who coined the term is celebrating the birth of a new one: \"agentic engineering.\"\n\nWhile vibe-coding is when humans prompt AI to write code, OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy says agentic engineering is when AI agents write the code themselves.\n\n\"Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally, my current favorite is 'agentic engineering,'\" he wrote in a recent X post.\n\nKarpathy said he calls it \"agentic engineering\" not just because agents are writing the code, but because \"there is an art & science and expertise to it.\"\n\nVibe-coding is one of the biggest innovations of the AI revolution. Prominent CEOs and startup founders alike are encouraging the use of vibe-coding across their teams. And billions are being poured into new vibe-coding companies.\n\nLovable, one of Europe's fastest-growing startups, announced that it had raised $330 million in Series B funding at a $6.6 billion valuation in December. Cursor, an AI-assisted code editor, announced a Series D funding round of $2.3 billion in November and said it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue.\n\nThe approach is also threatening traditional engineering jobs. In a Business Insider survey of 167 software engineers, 75 engineers said that they were \"keeping up,\" while 30 said they felt ahead of the curve, and 27 felt behind.\n\n\"Vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic 'contribution,' and even its article is longer. lol,\" Karpathy wrote on X about its meteoric rise.\n\nKarpathy was a founding member of OpenAI in 2015, years before competitors like Anthropic and xAI emerged. He later moved into self-driving technology, leading Tesla's Autopilot program as head of AI. He's now building Eureka Labs, which describes itself on its website as building a \"new kind of school that is AI native.\"",
