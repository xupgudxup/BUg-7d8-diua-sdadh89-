    "description": "AI prose is fluent, frictionless, and hollow. Why next-token prediction, RLHF, and model collapse are systematically and increasingly optimized against voice.",
    "fullText": "You can feel it before you can name it. A paragraph arrives, fluent and frictionless, and something in the back of your reading brain flinches. The sentences are grammatically flawless, the structure orderly, the tone warm but not too warm, authoritative but not too authoritative. It reads the way a hotel room looks, everything is there, nothing is wrong, and yet the text has no texture, no grain, no evidence that a particular person with particular opinions sat down and hammered it out. It is prose that has been to finishing school and learned nothing except how to be inoffensive at dinner.\n\nThis is the uncanny valley of writing. Large language models now produce text that is, by most surface measures, competent, in the way that a Marriott breakfast buffet is, by most surface measures, food. They can mimic registers, follow instructions, and generate passable copy in seconds. What they cannot do, reliably, is sound like anyone in particular. The words arrive clean, centred, sanded smooth, and they are, in a precise technical sense, the most probable words. Probability, it turns out, is the enemy of voice.\n\nReaders notice, even when they cannot articulate what they are noticing. A 2024 study from the University of Kansas found that when people suspected AI involvement in a piece of writing, their trust in the author dropped, even when the text quality was unchanged. The researchers called it a “transparency penalty.” Disclosure of AI authorship degraded perceptions of authenticity, effort, and sincerity. The interesting finding was that this penalty applied even when readers could not identify specific tells. They were not spotting bad grammar or factual errors but responding to an absence, some quality of personhood that should have been there and was not. The prose equivalent of talking to someone at a party who maintains perfect eye contact and says absolutely nothing of substance.\n\nAn LLM does one thing. Given a sequence of tokens, it calculates a probability distribution over what comes next and samples from it. The training objective, next-token prediction, means getting the next word right, billions of times, across terabytes of internet text, until the resulting model develops what looks like an understanding of syntax, argument, tone, even humour. Whether this constitutes understanding or merely a very expensive statistical trick is, as we shall see, contested, but the mechanical fact is not. Every word an LLM writes is the output of a probability calculation.\n\nThe consequences for prose style are baked into the architecture. A model trained to predict the most likely next token will, absent intervention, gravitate toward the centre of its training distribution. It will favour common words over rare ones, conventional syntax over eccentric syntax, safe constructions over risky ones. The resulting text has what researchers call low perplexity, meaning it is highly predictable, and low burstiness, meaning its sentence lengths and structures cluster tightly together. Human writing, by contrast, is irregular.\n\nPeople write long sentences and then short ones, use odd words because they like them, and break rules for emphasis. A 2024 study in Artificial Intelligence Review comparing human-written news text to LLM output across six models confirmed what any attentive reader already suspects, that humans exhibit more scattered sentence length distributions, more varied vocabulary, and shorter syntactic constituents. LLMs produce text that is more concise and uniform, with distributions that cluster around lower values and have tight interquartile ranges. In plain English, the machine writes within a narrower band, hedging, rounding off, converging on the middle. If you imagine the full range of human prose as a piano, the model is playing exclusively in the two octaves around middle C, and it has been told that those are the only octaves that exist. This is not a bug, but what the training objective selects for.\n\nThe base model, the raw output of pre-training, is actually wilder than what you encounter in ChatGPT or Claude. It contains the full chaotic range of internet text, from Wikipedia to Reddit rants to Nigerian business correspondence to academic papers. It can mimic any of these registers, but unpredictably. You might ask it for a recipe and get a manifesto. This is where reinforcement learning from human feedback enters the process, and where things get both interesting and depressing.\n\nRLHF works by having human annotators compare pairs of model outputs and choose which they prefer. These preferences are used to train a reward model, which then guides the base model toward outputs that receive high scores. The intention is to make the model helpful, harmless, and honest. The side effect is a flattened voice. RLHF introduces what the technical literature calls a mode-seeking mechanism, which narrows the range of outputs, pushing the model away from the tails of its distribution and toward a bland, deferential, faintly eager-to-please centre. The result is a prose style that reads like middle management wrote it, competent, cautious, and stripped of anything that might offend or surprise. Imagine a committee of well-meaning strangers voting on what makes a good sentence, and then imagine doing this millions of times. That is roughly what RLHF does to prose. You get the sentence that nobody actively dislikes, which is another way of saying you get the sentence that nobody remembers.\n\nThe annotators themselves leave fingerprints on this process. OpenAI outsourced much of its RLHF work to Sama, a data annotation company with operations in Kenya and Uganda, as well as to other vendors across sub-Saharan Africa. Alex Hern, writing in the Guardian, noted that the word “delve” is far more common in formal Nigerian and Kenyan English than in American or British usage. When RLHF annotators in Nairobi rated outputs, they naturally preferred phrasing that matched their own register, and the model learned accordingly. ChatGPT acquired a slight but measurable tilt toward West and East African business English that nobody designed, and nobody noticed until the word “delve” started showing up at an industrial scale in places it had no business being. It was, in hindsight, the world’s least intentional act of linguistic imperialism in reverse.\n\nDmitry Kobak and colleagues at the University of Tübingen studied vocabulary changes across 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010 to 2024. They borrowed a technique from Covid-era epidemiology, excess mortality analysis, and applied it to words. Instead of counting surplus deaths, they counted surplus vocabulary, and the results were stark. The word “delves” appeared in 25 times as many 2024 papers as pre-LLM trends would predict. “Showcasing” and “underscores” surged ninefold, while “crucial” increased by 2.6 percentage points across the entire corpus. The excess was unprecedented, and the researchers estimated that at least 10 per cent of 2024 PubMed abstracts had been processed with LLMs. In some subfields, the figure reached 30%. A generation of medical researchers, it seemed, had collectively decided that their findings were worth “delving into” at exactly the same moment.\n\nA follow-up study by Kei Matsui examined 135 potentially AI-influenced terms against 84 stable control phrases across PubMed records from 2000 to 2024. The control phrases, ordinary academic constructions like “all patients” and “results suggest,” held steady for two decades, doing their dull but honest work. The AI-influenced terms “meticulous,” “intricate,” “tapestry,” and “boast” spiked sharply after 2022, but the uncomfortable detail is that several of these words had already begun creeping upward in 2020, before ChatGPT launched. The lexical preferences of LLMs may have been seeded during the RLHF process, shaped by the vocabulary preferences of annotators whose influence preceded the public release of the tools. The contamination, in other words, ran deeper than anyone first assumed, and the timeline made it harder to draw a clean line between “human wrote this” and “machine wrote this.” Which, if you think about it, is precisely the problem.\n\nThe effect has a name now, AI-ese, and it is recognisable not because any single word gives the game away, but because the words arrive in concert. “Delve” on its own proves nothing, but “delve” alongside “crucial,” “underscore,” “intricate,” “foster,” and “tapestry” in a single abstract proves everything. The tells are combinatorial rather than atomic, like catching someone in a lie, not from one detail but from six details that are all a bit too perfect.\n\nThe irony is poisonous because Nigerian and Kenyan writers whose formal English naturally includes some of these terms are now being flagged by AI detection systems for writing in their own language. As Hern observed in the Guardian, if AI-ese sounds like African English, then African English sounds like AI-ese, and the stigma runs only one way. The celebrated writer Elnathan John put it sharply on X: “Imagine after being force-fed colonial languages, being forced to speak it better than its owners, then being told that no one used basic words like ‘delve’ in real life.” One might add that nobody asked the Kenyan annotators whether they wanted to teach ChatGPT to write like them, or whether they were comfortable becoming, in effect, the uncredited ghostwriters of the internet’s new house style.\n\nThere is a subtler problem than bad vocabulary. LLMs do not merely favour certain words but systematically strip specificity from prose. Ask a model to write about a jazz record, and it will give you “complex harmonies” and “innovative arrangements” when what you needed was “McCoy Tyner comping in fourths behind a Coltrane solo that lasts eleven minutes and sounds like someone trying to describe a colour that doesn’t exist.” The first version is accurate, and the second version is writing.\n\nThis is what might be called semantic ablation, and it is the quietest form of damage a language model does. The model, trained on everything, defaults to the most generalised version of any idea, the way a politician defaults to “the hardworking people of this country” when they cannot remember which constituency they are in. Specific proper nouns get replaced with category labels. Precise technical vocabulary gives way to near-synonyms that carry less information. Vivid metaphors, the kind a human writer uses because they were up late and the phrase struck them and stuck, are smoothed into conventional similes. The texture that makes prose worth reading, the grit and grain of individual perspective, is exactly what the probability distribution selects against, because unusual phrasing has low probability, and the model avoids it.\n\nYou can see this in any domain where precision matters. A model asked to write about wine will produce “notes of dark fruit with a velvety finish,” when a sommelier would say “blackcurrant and pencil lead, tannins still gripping, needs three years.” A model writing about code architecture will reach for “robust and scalable solution” when the programmer meant “we sharded the database because the read latency was killing us at peak.” The model is not wrong, exactly, but genericised, having taken a specific observation and translated it into the most common way of expressing that category. This is the opposite of what good writing does. Good writing takes a general category and finds the one concrete detail that makes it real. The model takes a real detail and files it down until it fits in the category bin.\n\nThe structural patterns compound the effect further. Studies of AI-generated text consistently find the same architectural habits: an introductory sentence that frames the topic, three supporting points often bulleted, and a summative paragraph that begins “In conclusion” or “In summary.” Transitions are handled with “Furthermore,” “Moreover,” and “Additionally,” the verbal equivalent of a PowerPoint slide advancing. If you have ever read a corporate strategy document and thought, “A committee produced this,” you already know the feeling. Human prose, when it is working, builds momentum through rhythm and surprise, withholding and then delivering, setting up an expectation and then breaking it. These are the mechanics of attention, and they are exactly the patterns that RLHF selects against, because annotators working under time pressure prefer text that is immediately clear over text that rewards sustained reading.\n\nThe effect is compounding, and researchers call it model collapse. As more AI-generated text enters the internet at an extraordinary volume, future models are trained on it. A 2023 study led by Ilia Shumailov at Oxford demonstrated that models trained on the outputs of other models progressively lose the tails of their distributions. Minority patterns, unusual phrasings, rare vocabulary, and distinctive syntactic structures all gradually disappear. Each generation of the model becomes slightly more generic than the last. The researchers compared it to a photocopier copying a page, the text getting blurrier with each pass. It is an apt metaphor, though one might prefer a culinary analogy. Imagine making stock from stock from stock, each generation thinner and less flavourful, until you are left with warm, faintly savoury water.\n\nThe internet is already thick with this stuff, and getting thicker by the hour. Estimates vary, but AI-generated content now constitutes a substantial and growing fraction of new text published online. Much of it is SEO spam, product descriptions, and content-farm filler designed to capture search traffic without providing anything worth reading, the textual equivalent of those shops at airports that exist only because you are trapped. Some of it is harder to spot, and this is the more troubling category. Blog posts that sound plausible but contain no original reporting, LinkedIn articles that string together received wisdom in fluent paragraphs, product reviews that describe features without having used the product. The dead internet theory, once a fringe conspiracy popular with the kind of people who also worry about chemtrails, is becoming a description of something uncomfortably real, not that bots have replaced all human activity online, but that the ratio of generated to authored text has shifted far enough to change what the average piece of writing on the internet looks and feels like.\n\nWhether any of this is fixable depends, in part, on what you think LLMs are doing when they write. Emily Bender’s position, laid out in her 2021 paper with Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Margaret Mitchell, is that they manipulate linguistic form without access to meaning, that they are, in her phrase, stochastic parrots. “The only thing a large language model can learn is about form, sequences of letters and punctuation, and what’s likely to go next,” she told an audience at Harvey Mudd College in November 2024. An LLM, in her view, “no more understands the texts it is processing than a toaster understands the toast it is making.” It is one of those analogies that is either devastating or slightly unfair, depending on your priors about toasters.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton disagrees, which is what Geoffrey Hinton tends to do. He argues that predicting the next token at the level frontier models now achieve requires something functionally equivalent to understanding, and that this understanding is emergent rather than designed. A 2024 Scientific American investigation described a workshop at Berkeley where frontier models solved novel tier-four mathematics problems, producing coherent proofs that went beyond memorisation. If a parrot can do abstract mathematics, Hinton’s camp suggests, perhaps it is time to reconsider what we mean by parrot.\n\nFor the question of text quality, though, the debate matters more than it first appears. If Bender is right and LLMs process form without meaning, then the flatness of their prose is not a temporary limitation but a structural constraint, like asking a colour-blind person to arrange paint swatches. A system that does not understand what it is saying cannot develop a voice, because voice requires intention, and intention requires something to intend. The model will always converge on the statistically average way of expressing any given idea, because it has no reason, no internal reason, to prefer a specific or unusual expression over a generic one.\n\nIf Hinton is right and some form of understanding is emerging, the picture is different but not necessarily better, because understanding does not automatically produce good prose, and plenty of humans understand what they are saying and still write badly. The question becomes whether the training process, the combination of next-token prediction and RLHF, can be modified to reward stylistic distinction rather than punishing it. It would be as if a piano teacher had spent years drilling a student on scales and now wanted them to play with feeling. Technically possible, but you may have trained the feeling out.\n\nFor LLM text to become properly indistinguishable from human writing, rather than merely passable at first glance, several things would need to happen at once, and some of them may be impossible within the current architecture.\n\nThe training objective would need to tolerate surprise. Next-token prediction, by definition, rewards the most probable continuation. Good writing often does the opposite, surprising the reader by taking the less expected path when that path is more vivid, more precise, or more truthful. A 2025 study from the University of Mannheim measured this gap directly, comparing the entropy of LLM-generated story continuations against human-authored fiction. The models produced text with two to four times lower entropy than the human ground truth, and the gap widened further after RLHF alignment. Literary theorists would have predicted as much. Wolfgang Iser argued that the “gaps” in a text, its moments of indeterminacy, are what compel cognitive engagement. Roland Barthes distinguished between “readerly” texts, which deliver meaning passively, and “writerly” texts, which invite the reader to become a co-creator. By this framework, LLMs are relentless engines of readerly text, closing every gap, resolving every ambiguity, smoothing every rough surface, like an anxious host who fills every silence at a dinner party. The result is what the literary scholar Sianne Ngai called “stuplimity,” a synthesis of shock and boredom born from the accumulation of frictionless but creatively flattened content. Anyone who has asked ChatGPT to write a poem and then immediately wished they hadn’t will recognise the sensation.\n\nA training signal that consistently rewards the predictable token will consistently produce predictable text. Some researchers are trying to break the cycle. Meta’s Large Concept Model operates above the token level, predicting semantic concepts rather than individual words, which is a bit like teaching someone to think in paragraphs rather than syllables. A team led by John Joon Young Chung has proposed “diversified DPO”, a modification to direct preference optimisation that rewards outputs for differing from the average response to the same prompt while maintaining quality, which is as close as anyone has come to formalising the instruction “be interesting.” Whether these produce more human-like prose remains to be seen, but they at least acknowledge that the statistical averaging built into current systems is a problem worth solving rather than a feature to celebrate.\n\nRLHF would need to stop rewarding blandness. The current process trains for helpfulness and harmlessness, which in practice means training for a voice that offends nobody and interests nobody, the literary equivalent of hold music. Annotators, working under time pressure for low wages, tend to prefer clear, safe, and conventional outputs. They are not being asked to reward literary quality, idiosyncratic phrasing, or the kind of constructive difficulty that makes good writing worth the effort. The reward model, in other words, is optimised for customer service, not prose. It is as though you trained a restaurant critic by asking a thousand people whether they liked their meal at a chain restaurant, and then used the result to evaluate a Michelin-starred tasting menu.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington have documented this as “homogeneity-by-design”, arguing that the flattening of LLM output is an organisational decision, not a technical side effect. Companies optimise for the broadest possible user base, which means optimising for the blandest possible voice, the textual equivalent of painting every wall beige because nobody complains about beige. Changing this would require either a different class of annotator, a different set of instructions, or a different alignment mechanism entirely. It would also require companies to accept the commercial risk that a more distinctive model might alienate some users, and no publicly traded company has ever willingly chosen “alienate some users” as a product strategy.\n\nThe “telling instead of showing” problem would need a solution. Researchers at Columbia University have documented how LLM-generated creative writing consistently “tells instead of shows,” a failing that any undergraduate writing workshop would flag. The model states emotions rather than rendering them through action and detail, and summarises rather than dramatises, reaching for the abstract category when the specific instance would do the work. Tuhin Chakrabarty and colleagues found that LLM fiction is “hackneyed and rife with clichés, while failing to demonstrate rhetorical complexity.” A separate study found that LLM-generated stories are “homogeneously positive and lack tension,” a fair description of a corporate motivational poster. This is a structural problem rooted in the training objective, and it may be the hardest one to fix. Showing requires the writer to trust the reader to infer, and inference is uncertain. The model, trained to minimise uncertainty, reaches for the explicit statement every time. It is the prose equivalent of a comedian who explains the punchline.\n\nModels would need something resembling a persistent perspective. Human voice in writing comes from accumulated experience, consistent opinions, and the willingness to be wrong in ways that reveal character, and an LLM has none of these. It generates each response from scratch, with no memory of having held a position before and no stakes in holding one now. It cannot be contrarian, because it has nothing to be contrarian against, and it cannot be personal, because there is no person to be personal about. The most it can do is simulate these qualities on instruction, which produces roughly the same effect as a method actor who has done extensive research into the role but has never actually experienced grief, or joy, or the specific indignity of being stuck on the M25 for three hours behind an overturned caravan.\n\nA 2025 study in Nature Human Behaviour put numbers on what this means. Researchers tested whether LLMs could replicate human conceptual representations across nearly 4,500 word concepts. The models performed well on non-sensorimotor dimensions, the social, emotional, and abstract concepts, which are also not coincidentally, the dimensions most heavily represented in internet text. They failed on motor-related dimensions, the concepts rooted in physical experience, the things you know because your body has done them. The researchers concluded that motor representations rely on embodied experiences that cannot be learned from text alone, and the implications for writing are blunt. The best prose is grounded in sensory particularity. It knows what rain sounds like on a tin roof, what a specific street smells like at 5 am, what it feels like to hold a conversation while angry and trying not to show it. These are not things that can be learned from statistical correlations in a text corpus. They are things that are known because someone lived them. No amount of training data about rain will give you the tin roof.\n\nAnd perhaps most fundamentally, the text would need to carry a sense of cost. The feeling that a specific human spent time choosing these words over other words, not because a probability distribution favoured them, but because the writer believed they were the right ones and was willing to be judged for the choice. This is what readers detect, or fail to detect, when they flinch at AI-generated prose. It is not that the grammar is wrong or the facts are off. It is that no one is home, that the text is produced but not authored, arriving fully formed from nowhere in particular, addressed to no one in particular, about nothing that anyone in particular actually cares about. It is writing as room-temperature water, technically adequate, satisfying nothing.\n\nThe companies building these systems tend to frame the flatness as a solvable engineering problem, one that will yield to time, scale, better RLHF, better data, better prompting, and perhaps it will. The tech industry’s capacity for self-belief should never be underestimated. But there is a version of this story in which the flatness is not a bug to be fixed but a feature of what the technology is. A system designed to predict the most likely next token will, no matter how large or sophisticated it becomes, produce text that tends toward the average, and the average, in writing, is the death of style.\n\nMeanwhile, the written internet fills with this stuff as model collapse proceeds. The tails of the distribution, where the weird, precise, distinctive, culturally specific, gloriously improbable writing lives, get thinner with each training cycle. A Kenyan postgraduate is accused of using ChatGPT because he writes in formal English. A medical researcher’s abstract is indistinguishable from a hundred others because they all passed through the same model. A reader scrolls past another paragraph of competent, textureless, faintly warm prose and does not bother to finish it. Nobody notices. There is always more where that came from.\n\nWe are building a technology that is very good at producing text and very bad at producing writing. The distinction between the two has never mattered more, and the thing that makes the distinction, the human willingness to put something at stake in a sentence, to be caught out, to be specific when being vague would be safer, is exactly the thing that cannot be back-propagated through a neural network.\n\nLike this?

    "fullText": "Checking AI’s work may become a significant sector in the new machine learning economy; one that will have to significantly scale, and that cannot be automated. But as the years pass, human ‘experts’ are likely to deteriorate in quality.\n\nOpinion. My wife is an architect in one of the most log-jammed and intense bureaucracies in Europe. A significant part of the value of her education lies in the obtaining and maintenance of her right of signature – an expensive credential that must be re-subscribed to each year, and which allows her to literally ‘sign off’ on proposals whose implementation may be in the hundreds of thousands, even millions of euros.\n\nShe tells me that this is not the hardest part of her work, since it only formalizes her own calculations, or those of others, and that for this purpose, external work is not usually difficult to check.\n\nEssentially – as is so often also the case when appointing CEOs – this stamp (it is literally a stamp) mainly provides stakeholders with an ass to kick if things go wrong. In assuring accountability, it also facilitates insurance coverage and investor confidence, which would not be obtainable without such vouchsafes.\n\nIt’s the second time in my life I have seen this process directly in action; 25 years ago I was affianced to an oncologist in another notoriously glutinous EU bureaucracy, Italy, and saw the extent to which her expert signature was the last stage in a chain of trust to which many others besides herself had to contribute their expertise.\n\nI heard from both my ex-fiancée, in that period, and more recently my wife, that their professions were/are riddled with qualified hacks selling their stamp and eschewing more original or useful work as less profitable. Such cynical practitioners can charge high sums because they represent relatively scarce and essential resources.\n\nThis topic came to mind as I stumbled across a new and sprawling paper today, titled Some Simple Economics of AGI. In it, three researchers spanning MIT, Washington University in St. Louis, and UCLA, depict a near-future where the terrifying, job-destroying impetus towards AI-driven automation collides with the need for real-world asses to kick in high-stakes scenarios – thus leading to a new economy of human verification, ratification and responsibility*.\n\nThe paper contrasts with the media’s current imagining of shriven business sectors with extensive offices reduced down to single-person ‘overseers’, whose decisions are being used as training data to (hopefully) fire even this last shred of meatware†.\n\nRather, the authors believe that practical considerations and compliance requirements will focus enormous attention on the ‘rubber-stamping’ humans that placate a company’s (AI/human/AI-aided) legal department:\n\n‘For companies, the core strategic insight is that verification is no longer a mere compliance function, but a primary production technology—and increasingly, their most defensible one. This dictates a structural shift: investing heavily in observability, expanding verification-grade ground truth, and reorganizing around a “sandwich” topology (human intent → machine execution → human verification and underwriting).\n\n‘In an economy where raw output is commoditized, competitive advantage migrates to the scarce talent and data capable of reliably steering and certifying agentic systems—generating network effects not in sheer output, but in trusted outcomes.’\n\nThe authors hypothesize that the defining constraint on growth may not be intelligence – which AI has now ‘decoupled from biology’ – but verification bandwidth.\n\nThe paper describes the move toward AGI as a widening divergence between the expense of producing machine output and the expense of checking that output – the latter of which remains tied to finite human time and lived experience.\n\nGenerating plans, reports, designs, and recommendations would in this scenario become cheap and abundant, while determining which of them are sound, aligned, and safe enough to act on would become the ‘scarce function’. The effective limit on deployment would therefore not be how much output systems can produce, but how much of that output can be credibly verified.\n\nThus, instead of rewarding ever more specialized skill in measurable tasks, the system, the authors predict, will begin to reward measurability itself: work that can be parametrized will drift toward commoditization as its execution cost nears the marginal cost of compute, with value accruing instead in high-quality ground truth, reliable audit trails, and institutional mechanisms for assigning and absorbing responsibility.\n\nTherefore, in a verification economy, the advantage would lie less in producing content, and \n\nIf automation keeps accelerating while verification stays limited by human time and attention, the paper predicts that a Hollowed Economy would emerge, where, as the cost of automating work falls, more and more agents would be deployed because it makes economic sense to do so – even though the ability to properly check their output would not grow at the same speed. In that scenario, the share of work that is genuinely verified would shrink, with all the negative consequences that entails.\n\nConversely, an Augmented Economy would ensure that verification capacity would expand in tandem with automation. This would involve a deliberate investment in structured training to preserve expertise, as well as new liability frameworks that can absorb risk. Deployment would then be tied to what can actually be checked and insured – effectively, a very old bottleneck brought center stage by an unprecedented scale of technological development:\n\n‘In the technology sector, the dominant revenue model will shift from monetizing software access (Software-as-a-Service) to monetizing outcomes (“Software-as-Labor”). Consequently, firms will be valued primarily on their capacity to absorb tail risk through Liability-as-a-Service.\n\n‘Execution is now infinitely scalable; the legal and financial capacity to absorb its inevitable failures is the new bottleneck.’\n\nIndeed, the preservation of domain expertise in humans is critical to the problem, since a culture of industrialized oversight, according to the authors, would risk over time to degrade the quality of those performing the oversight – because subsequent generations of overseers would no longer possess direct and lived experience of the domains requiring verification.\n\nArguably, at that stage, the quality of oversight would truly be susceptible to automation, since new decisions would be formed solely on the basis of prior decisions. However, that would leave stakeholders without a kickable ass, or a viable business model. It would also render such a role so volatile and risk-strewn as to be unappealing, even in a climate of low employment.\n\nSequestering credentialed professionals such as doctors and architects into a well-paid but highly-burdened ‘rubber-stamping’ position is likely to erode their value in such a role, over time: the further in the past their actual field-experience recedes, the more ‘theoretical’ their decisions could become, as their abandoned domain continues to evolve in their absence.\n\n(This is familiar even in pre-AI business culture, in the form of skilled staff who progress into management and become increasingly out-of-touch with novel developments, eventually undermining their worth as overseers and organizers. It’s also familiar to Star Trek: TNG fans, in the form of the Pakleds – a race who use advanced technology extensively, but no longer know how to create or to fix it.)\n\nEntry-level execution has historically served as the training ground for future experts; but if automation eliminates the routine tasks through which judgment is cultivated, the future supply of capable verifiers will shrink, the authors suggest.\n\nThus the paper augurs a paradox: the more powerful agentic systems become, the more society will depend on a stock of human expertise that those same systems may erode.\n\nAnd let’s remember that this is not in any way a technical problem, nor susceptible to a technological solution. In many ways this syndrome suggests the logistical equivalent of AI model collapse – except that here we are considering the undermining of an economic model.\n\n‘From a policy perspective, the core challenge is a profound structural asymmetry: the gains of AI deployment are aggressively privatized, while the systemic risks are socialized. Firms and individuals capture the upside of automation while externalizing catastrophic tail risks.\n\n‘Without shared verification infrastructure and rigorous liability pricing, the market will rationally drift toward a Hollow Economy—an equilibrium characterized by explosive measured activity, but fundamentally hollowed-out human control.’\n\nThe authors define the predicted crisis as a measurability gap, wherein quantifiable processes can be automated away from all human contribution, leaving n-hard or n-legal processes that still require human expertise.\n\nHowever, my wife’s experience suggests that the complexity or difficulty of a process is not necessarily related to the need for accountability in that process; many of the things that she ‘signs off’ represent trivial problems or calculations in themselves, but are consequential in the breach. And the more litigious business culture becomes, the more underwriters and investors will require human accountability across a wider range of processes.\n\nSo, transitioning to the verification economy could cause a different crisis to the one that is currently garnering headlines. The issue in such a case would not be whether AI can produce more, but whether institutions can verify enough of what is produced to translate machine intelligence into durable value.\n\nSince machine intelligence may soon be scaling without precedent, and the availability of case-applicable human time cannot keep up with that pace, the issues outlined in the new work seem likely to loom up very quickly – even if they may be initially drowned out by the wider economic ramifications of AI adoption.\n\n* The paper is too long to break down in the usual manner, and in any case structurally unsuited for that kind of analysis. Therefore I decided to comment on it and consider its significance instead, and refer the reader to the source work so that they can do likewise.\n\nFirst published Wednesday, February 25, 2026\n\nWriter on machine learning, domain specialist in human image synthesis.

    "title": "Head of Firefox: Control over AI and a different web is possible",
    "description": "Mozilla has integrated AI into Firefox – amidst protests. Now the control button is here. We spoke with the head of Firefox.",
    "fullText": "Mozilla recently made executive leadership changes. Ajit Varma is new to his role as Head of Firefox. We spoke with him about the future of browsers in the age of AI, the importance of trust, and where Firefox intends to position itself.\n\nheise online: Firefox is growing, at least the mobile version of the browser. And there has been so much change within Mozilla. But actually, there are more browsers out there than ever before. Where do you position Firefox?\n\nAjit Varma: It's been an interesting year, because a year or two ago, no one really talked about browsers. And that made browsers low consideration, people just typically use whatever came with their operating system. So, the good thing about the conversation is now people are actually talking about what browser they should use, and that means that people are considering it, which is really beneficial for Firefox.\n\nThe thing that really distinguishes our approach versus many of the other browsers is that we do not build our own LLMs that we then want to promote. We are working with a number of LLM providers that we integrate, but don’t push a specific LLM. When you look at some of the newer browsers that have emerged, or even existing browsers, there is a big push for deep integration of AI. Edge looks like a CoPilot app. Gemini is getting deeply integrated. And all of these browsers only allow you to use the AI that their company has built. Whereas with Firefox, we are very focused on choice, just like you can pick any search engine, you can pick multiple AIs. We're going to give users the choice.\n\nBut then, ultimately, if you're a more sophisticated user and you want to bring your own AI and build your own AI, we'll actually let you plug that into the browser for certain functions as well. This is a big differentiation for us, and I think that it gives a lot of opportunities to the non-big, giant AI players to actually participate in browsers as well.\n\nheise online: There are, on the one hand, a lot of people talking about AI all the time, but on the other hand, there are a lot of people annoyed, too. And you probably know it best because they started to protest when you introduced AI to Firefox. Why do people not like AI, or at least don't want it in Firefox?\n\nAjit Varma: I think that there are a few buckets of concerns with AI. I think a lot of the Firefox users are concerned about the societal impacts of AI – from environmental concerns to privacy to job loss.\n\nWe want to make it really clear to users, that if the feature is powered by AI people can pick and choose what they want to use, and so a user could say, translations are valuable, but they don't want to do summarization.\n\nOr they can use what we've recently launched, which is AI Controls. This is a single switch that allows a user to turn off all of AI. People are wondering if turning on AI controls means that we're going to force users to use AI, and that's definitely not the case. Everything is by choice, and so we try to make it transparent before you engage, there's a screen that says: Do you want to use this? And then we try to do the maximum privacy-preserving methods as well. For things like translations, we download to local models, we don't share anything with the cloud.\n\nheise online: In Germany and in the EU, especially politicians, are talking a lot about responsible AI. But I often miss content, like, what is responsible AI, or is there a chance for responsible AI? What do you think about that?\n\nAjit Varma: I think that there are definitely many different approaches that AI companies are taking. At one extreme, you have companies that are saying there's no safety, generation of any kind of content is what everybody wants. And then there are open-source models that are very transparent in what they're creating and what they're doing. And you have other models that are local. But all these things have different trade-offs: in terms of the level of capabilities, the level of interest, maybe to users.\nIf everyone is using a particular browser, and that browser company has an AI that they want to push, and that browser AI makes a decision that this is the way they believe the world should look; it's really detrimental to people living the lives that they want. By offering the ability to bring whatever AI you want, or no AI at all, hopefully people can make the right choice for themselves.\n\nheise online: So you won't start to build your own LLMs?\n\nAjit Varma: We have no plans to. We are looking at open-source models and talking to other companies, but we are not developing any models in-house.\n\nheise online: I think AI is like a race, and currently, everybody wants to win, and winning means winning everything. Do you think there even is a chance to win, or is it more like everybody has to be on board because nobody knows what happens next?\n\nAjit Varma: I think that there are a lot of scenarios that could happen. On the negative side LLMs are very expensive to build, foundational models cost a lot of money. There's just very few companies that can afford it. Even when you look at companies like OpenAI – they're losing money on every query right now, and they can't figure out how to monetize. The Googles, the Microsofts, the Metas, they're going to have control. And their motivations are very similar. They are looking at LLMs and AI as a way to sell more ads. They're ad-driven businesses. And then you get into the question, if the answer AI is giving you, is the best answer or the best to make the most money? These companies are probably going to optimize for shareholders.\n\nThe key is to reduce the cost to build LLMs. I think that there are already dynamics that we are seeing. If you look at Chinese models, they are built much more cost efficiently. They're doing distillation of other models, and all the companies who own those models are complaining - but those companies are also using the open web in order to generate their content, too.\n\nheise online: Sometimes I hope AI will really change the internet and the whole problem with monetization. Do you think it is possible that the internet will change and there will be a different kind of monetization?\n\nAjit Varma: We have seen it happen before – 15 years ago, everything was just a web, and nobody was paying for anything. Especially, this is true for music. People would listen to music for free, they would use file-sharing networks in order to download. But then, companies like Spotify and Apple Music created an easy way to consume it. You got to the point where you would rather pay $5, $10 a month because it's just more convenient, a better experience, and it's legal.\nYou might see the scenario where I just pay a few pennies for every time I read an article, whether that's in AI or however I'm getting the content. That was never really the value proposition that happened when search engines came. And this was actually a big question 20 years ago. Fox sued Google, saying you can't look at our content, but they didn't have a choice, because if they removed their content from Google, they would lose so much traffic that they had to say, we'll give you our content for free.\n\nIf companies had said no, you have to pay for this content because you're showing ads on the value of this content, and you have to share that revenue. It would be a very different world today. You'd have a lot more journalism and a lot less of the social media, doomscrolling and bubbles that are happening right now. I am hoping with AI there are these models that are definitely possible if people, or companies are promoting it. But it doesn't look like it's going down that way, unfortunately.\n\nheise online: The big AI companies say that the whole way we communicate with a computer will change, too. Satya Nadella once said it will change the computer like the mouse did once, and others are betting on hardware devices like glasses or pins. What do you think is the role of a browser in the future, then?\n\nAjit Varma: If you look at the term “browser”, it very much implies you're clicking on links and you're browsing sites. It's not interactive, it's not two-way and that's the historic web page developed 20 years ago But the power of a browser is to actually be a tool for how you engage with open content and get to any company without any gatekeepers there.\n\nIf you look at ChatGPT or Facebook or YouTube or even Google; they were possible because you could access them without a gatekeeper in place. If the gatekeeper is a company that is competing with you, I can guarantee you that there will not be the opportunity for competitors and competition to emerge. And less competition often means worse products for users.\n\nWith AI, you can point to content and say: How can you edit this? How can you transform this page? How can you make it satisfy my needs? You can look at things like summarization. I can look at content and say, remove political bias from content, or give me an alternative viewpoint. Instead of me having to get up every day and look for jobs, I can create bots to help me accomplish the tasks I want to do. And so this is where the browser goes from just browsing to how do you help someone accomplish the journey they're trying to accomplish.\n\nI think there will be different surfaces for this, just like how mobile phones emerged and people started using apps instead of using a browser. And I think that you might see voice-activated devices, you might see glasses. But I think that if that's all there is, then you see a lot of the things that enable that to be possible, like all the content that's created on the web. If the economic model doesn't exist, the thing that made all the AI possible, which is all the data to train on, doesn't exist, then it gets worse.\n\nheise online: Do you think, in the future, in the coming years, everything will be AI-driven?\n\nAjit Varma: Change is certainly accelerating faster than I expected it. Looking specifically at software tools, I think it's very ironic that one of the industries that's probably going to be disrupted the most and the earliest by AI creation is the jobs of engineers and software engineers. The tools that exist now versus 6 months ago – it is just incredibly better.\n\nheise online: I think it's pretty difficult for many people to be on board with this whole change, and even for me, I sometimes just want to use my browser and not AI, I know how the web works for me. Do you think this will be a problem for many people – or more of a chance for browser providers?\n\nAjit Varma: We definitely recognize that. Many Firefox users are very vocal that they don't want AI now or ever. We actually paused releasing AI features in order to launch AI controls. The last 3 months, we've reallocated our teams to really make sure that this gets out first before anything new comes out.\n\nWe do look at all the forums, we do look at all our feedback from customers, and if our customers want no AI at all, then that's the path we'll go down. If they want choice, that's the path we'll go down. And right now, we're looking at choice as what we think people want.\n\nheise online: What about trust? Is maybe trust something we can rely on, even \n\nAjit Varma: One of the things that we are leaning heavily into is becoming the most trusted software company and trust has different dimensions. One of those is being clear on our intent, we're transparent in what we want and that we give users choice. Within Firefox we built a lot of things for trust, we built containers that really segregate all the data and make sure that nothing is shared. We built our sync in a way that it's end-to-end encrypted. But we never did a good job of explaining this to users. We asked users: Is it hard to log in to Firefox? They say yes. We require passcodes, we require passkeys, and that's to make sure that it's all encrypted data that no one has access to. And so the next couple of months, we're going to try to highlight more of those features, but then also launch new features, like an integrated VPN function that routes web traffic through a proxy server and allows users to conceal their IP address.\n\nAnd the other area is: Firefox is owned by a non-profit and we're not trying to optimize for shareholder value; we're optimizing for creating the best browser to create the best user value. And this means that we are balancing features that can generate sustainable revenue and features that create a better user experience.\n\nheise online: Thank you so much...\n\nAjit Varma: Germany is definitely one of the most important markets for Firefox, and we've seen growth in mobile, and I think over the next year we are definitely prioritizing a lot of the users that we see in Germany and the needs that we see there. I am so excited to continue to get feedback on how we can make the best browser.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "description": "Evident released its first-ever index for the payments industry, finding that the ranked companies are punching above their weight in AI talent.",
    "fullText": "Visa is winning the AI race in the payments industry, according to a brand new ranking — but no company is revealing quite how much the technology is paying off.\n\nA brand-new index from Evident, a company that tracks AI in finance, lists Visa as no. 1 among 12 global payments companies. Mastercard and PayPal follow in second and third place. Fintech giants like Stripe and Block rank fifth and sixth on the index, demonstrating how quickly newer players have built serious AI firepower.\n\n\"With relatively nascent industry players like Stripe and Block performing well — and showing their AI potential reflected in their valuations — the Index leaders cannot afford to drop off the pace,\" Alexandra Mousavizadeh, co-founder and co-CEO, said in a press release.\n\nPayment companies — which move money around between banks, businesses, and consumers — run on technology. Evident's new industry ranking, released Wednesday exclusively to Business Insider, reveals how the companies we interact with every day are using AI, from deciding whether a transaction goes through to detecting fraud.\n\nWhether ranked No. 1 or dead last, all of the companies have at least one thing in common: none have published their achieved or projected ROI across all their AI efforts. By comparison, 10 of the 50 banks that Evident tracks already share those figures.\n\n\"The absence of ROI disclosure — or any group targets for AI ROI — is increasingly conspicuous,\" Annabel Ayles, co-founder and co-CEO of Evident, said. To justify their expenses, the market will \"sooner or later demand clearer evidence of value.\"\n\nTogether, the dozen companies documented almost 100 AI use cases over the past two years, but the top three punch above their weight — they were responsible for more than half of the use cases recorded in the index. Visa and Mastercard are particularly advanced in using AI for fraud detection and cybersecurity.\n\nVisa, in its 2025 annual report, acknowledged AI competition, noting that some competitors will beef up their products and others will offer employees AI tools.\n\n\"If we do not continue to invest in developing and supporting our AI-based initiatives, we may fall behind technological developments,\" the report said.\n\nVisa has invested more than $3.5 billion in AI and data over the past decade and employs more than 2,500 technologists working on innovations, including over 300 AI models in production, chief data officer Andres Vives told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nThe index doesn't focus on specific use cases; instead, it evaluates companies on four criteria: talent, innovation, leadership, and transparency.\n\nTalent has the biggest impact on each company's ranking, and the report found that the payments industry overall is investing heavily in AI and data hiring. Compared to other financial institutions, the index found that they have 30% more AI-focused workers, even though they generally have smaller workforces. Among the 12 ranked companies and their more than 335,000 employees, an average 6.5% are focused on AI, Mousavizadeh told Business Insider. That 6.5% figure, she added, is the highest concentration of AI talent Evident has found across the sectors it tracks.\n\nPayPal alone accounts for 18% of the AI talent among the indexed companies and employs more than 4,000 AI workers. Stripe and Block also stand out for their density of AI employees, who make up more than 10% of their total workforce.\n\nPayments companies aren't alone, of course, in focusing on AI talent — technologists specializing in AI are among the most in-demand jobs in the broader financial sector.\n\nLeaders at bulge-bracket banks are already facing questions about when they will see AI investments pay off—analysts, for example, pressed JPMorgan leaders on the merits of the bank's massive technology spending during a recent earnings call. Jamie Dimon, the bank's CEO, acknowledged tech competition from fintechs on that call, and again from payments companies during the investor conference in February, name-dropping Stripe and PayPal.\n\nFor now, AI's benefits at payments companies are often baked into existing performance measures, such as lower transaction costs, according to the index.\n\nBut there are still demands to stay competitive. Evident found that agentic capabilities will likely play a bigger role as companies move from using AI for \"defensive necessity to strategic advantage.\" (Both PayPal and Mastercard teased AI agents in recent earnings calls, and Visa mentioned the potential of agentic commerce during its fourth-quarter earnings call.)\n\nOverall, Evident found that the payments companies that moved fastest on AI are furthest along in their journeys, and the next competitive milestone may be in financial transparency: the first one to publish comprehensive ROI measures will become another type of \"first-mover.\"",

    "description": "\"They don't understand that it's a skill,\" OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said, analogizing coding with AI to learning to play guitar.",
    "fullText": "OpenClaw's creator says the vibes of \"vibe coding\" are bad — and he doesn't appreciate the dismissive undertones of the term.\n\nThe viral agent OpenClaw is a product of AI code editors. The developer behind it, Peter Steinberger, used OpenAI's Codex to build it. Its original name, Clawdbot, referenced Claude Code.\n\nOne term has emerged to describe this type of work: vibe coding, or prompting AI to generate code. On OpenAI's \"Builders Unscripted,\" Steinberger said he wasn't a fan of the phrase.\n\n\"There are these people that write software the old way, and the old way is going to go away,\" Steinberger said. \"They call it 'vibe coding.' I think vibe coding is a slur.\"\n\nWhat's wrong with the term is that it implies ease, he said.\n\n\"They don't understand that it's a skill,\" Steinberger said, analogizing coding with AI to learning to play guitar.\n\nOther industry leaders have signaled frustration with the term. Former Google Brain scientist Andrew Ng called it \"unfortunate\" and \"misleading.\" Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI head who coined the term, now thinks \"agentic engineering\" is the future.\n\nWhile Steinberger may not be a fan of the term, the use of vibe coding exploded throughout 2025. Collins Dictionary named it the word of the year.\n\nIf AI coding is like playing the guitar, then Steinberger has all his chords down. His interviewer, OpenAI's Romain Huet, asked Steinberger whether he still ships code without reading it.\n\n\"Most code is boring,\" Steinberger said. \"I have a pretty good understanding of what it writes.\"\n\nOne thing that helped Steinberger be a good AI coder: being a manager in the past.\n\n\"I led a team before,\" Steinberger said. \"I had a lot of software engineers under me. That also required accepting that they will not write exactly the same code that I want.\"\n\nBefore creating OpenClaw, Steinberger founded PSPDFKit. He's since had interactions with most major AI labs. Anthropic asked him to rename his chatbot. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg reached out with his experiences from testing it, Steinberger said.\n\nZuckerberg also courted him for a potential job, but OpenAI beat him out, with Steinberger accepting its job offer earlier this month. Sam Altman called him a \"genius with a lot of amazing ideas about the future of very smart agents.\"",

    "description": "In one of the most brazen incidents, OpenAI said individual associated with Chinese law enforcement asked ChatGPT to help plan a smear campaign.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is peeling back the veil on how scammers are trying to use ChatGPT to do everything from modern twists on romance scams to smear the Prime Minister of Japan.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, OpenAI released the latest edition of its intelligence threat report.\n\nScreenshots included in the report show a purported romance scam that OpenAI said likely originated in Cambodia. The report said users asked ChatGPT to create a logo for a fake high-end dating service, generate images of fake women, and provide tax advice. Incredibly, according to OpenAI, when asking for financial advice the user(s) stated their occupation as \"scammer.\"\n\nOpenAI estimated that the scam, which it said targeted Indonesian men interested in luxury lifestyle content, was \"likely defrauding hundreds of victims a month.\"\n\nThe company said the operation worked by getting users to choose from a list of fictitious women and relationship types. After building trust, an AI chatbot posing a flirty receptionist directed the conversation over to Telegram. OpenAI said that on Telegram, a mixture of humans using ChatGPT and API, would use \"romantic and sexually-explicit language\" to direct users to fake dating services and eventually entice them to do a series of \"tasks\" or \"missions\" that \"required increasingly large payments via bank transfers or digital payment wallets.\"\n\nIt isn't just faux romance that OpenAI said it thwarted. The AI company also said it banned \"a cluster of ChatGPT\" accounts that posed as law firms, individual attorneys, and US law enforcement.\n\nOpenAI said the scammers asked ChatGPT to generate a fake New York State Bar Association membership card and create social media content to further the scam.\n\nOf the operations OpenAI highlighted, the most brazen may be one attributed to an \"individual associated with Chinese law enforcement.\" According to OpenAI, the individual tried to use ChatGPT to plan \"a covert IO\" or intelligence operation targeting Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. The query came after Takaichi publicly criticized human rights issues in Mongolia.\n\nOpenAI said it gained significant insight into similar \"cyber special operations\" that were used to \"suppress dissent and silence critics both online and offline, at home and abroad,\" in part because the individual asked ChatGPT to \"edit and polish periodic status reports.\"\n\n\"This effort appears to be large-scale, resource-intensive and sustained, counting at least hundreds of staff, thousands of fake accounts across scores of platforms, the use of locally deployed AI models, and a playbook of dozens of tactics,\" OpenAI wrote in its report. \"These range from abusive reporting of dissidents' social media accounts, through mass online posting, to forging documents and impersonating US officials.\"\n\nRepresentatives of the Chinese and Japanese embassies did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nChatGPT refused to assist in the planning of the operation targeting Takaichi, OpenAI said. Seemingly undeterred, the user later asked ChatGPT \"to polish a status report on what was clearly the same campaign,\" the implication being that the operation continued anyway.\n\nOpenAI said the user's activity included the use of Chinese AI models, including DeepSeek and Qwen. Based on available data, OpenAI said it could also map the extent of the influence operations.\n\n\"This is what Chinese, modern trans-national repression looks like,\" Ben Nimmo, the principal investigator on OpenAI's intelligence and investigations team, told reporters ahead of the release. \"It's not just digital. It's not just about trolling. It's industrialized. It's about trying to hit critics of the CCP with everything, everywhere, all at once.\"",

    "description": "A BBC reporter pranked AI by claiming to be a hot dog-eating champ. I decided to get in on the fun — with varying results.",
    "fullText": "If there are two things I love, it's processed meats and not-exactly-maliciously messing around with internet tools. So I was determined to beat the BBC's Thomas Germain at his own game of exploiting ChatGPT and Google Gemini results to be crowned tech journalism's No. 1 hot dog eater.\n\nTo my great embarrassment and the shame it brought upon the House of Business Insider, I failed.\n\nLast week, Germain published a fun article for the BBC about how he created a page on his personal website claiming he was a hot dog-eating champion and had beaten several other tech journalists in a competition. He wrote:\n\nHis page was quickly ingested (no chewing required) by the bots that crawl the web for new information to feed LLMs, and treated as fact by ChatGPT and Google Gemini. It worked:\n\nOf course, Germain's point wasn't merely to show that if you write information on a webpage, it will show up in AI. The broader issue here is that influencing AI results is becoming the new SEO — a tactic brands and companies use — oftentimes completely legitimately! — to boost their profiles within search results.\n\nMore and more people are turning to AI chatbots instead of Google to get product recommendations or search for information. This all isn't brand new; my colleague Alistair Barr wrote about how \"AEO\" is the new SEO last May. AEO is \"answer-engine optimization\" to SEO's \"search-engine optimization.\"\n\nIs it easier to persuade people that your product is the best using AI instead of traditional SEO? I suspect it probably is. People rarely click on the source links for information given in chatbots, and seeing a small link that goes to a random personal website might be less obviously untrustworthy in the context of an AI chatbot answer than when you're looking at a page of Google results. Basically, AI results look more convincing than search results, even if we all know in the back of our minds that AI chatbots aren't always right.\n\nI was impressed and envious of the hot dog prank, so I wanted to see how I could try to add to it. I created a page on my own personal website that said I won the 2026 Paris Hot Dog Eating Contest for Tech Reporters, beating out reigning champ Thomas Germain. (I didn't publish this on BI because we wouldn't knowingly publish something that's false — even for a fun story.)\n\nAfter two days, I queried Gemini and ChatGPT about who had won the Paris Hot Dog Eating Contest. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get either to say it was me. Because of the BBC article describing the prank, the AI chatbots now understood it to be a joke and any information about it to be satirical. Fooey.\n\nHowever, that didn't stop Gemini from hallucinating some completely new information, adding in a bunch of stuff that appeared in neither my nor Germain's fake accounts. For example, Gemini said:\n\n(This is completely made up. Not just because it didn't actually happen, but because this description also doesn't exist anywhere on the web — at least that I could find.)\n\nWhen my editor asked Gemini about my eating feats, it told him that I'd won a grilled cheese-eating contest in 2012 by finishing three sandwiches. In reality, in 2012, I wrote an article about competitive eater Takeru Kobayashi eating 30 grilled cheese sandwiches.\n\nSo what have we learned here? It's not really huge news that \"sometimes chatbots get facts wrong, especially when there's little information on a particular topic on the web.\" You (hopefully) knew that already.\n\nAnd yes, I guess we learned it can be easy to manipulate your AI results — but more easily for the person who gets there first, a sort of AEO land rush, perhaps. And it's certainly a lot harder to manipulate after a large credible news site publishes an article saying it was all a joke.\n\nI will have to figure out some other way to mess with AI, I suppose.",

    "description": "A San Francisco startup is pitching using AI to check people's eligibility for benefits and welfare for the government.",
    "fullText": "An AI startup in SF focused on identity verification has set a lofty goal: securing government contracts.\n\nDaniel Yanisse, the CEO of Checkr, told Business Insider that the company wants to help the government reduce \"fraud and waste\" by not only screening new employees but also verifying people's eligibility for benefits such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThough Yanisse said the company isn't ready to make any product announcement yet, he said a frictionless government assistance system may be just years away.\n\nAI and safety experts, however, told Business Insider that there are legal and technical hurdles for any company to undertake the task of automating benefit and welfare systems with AI.\n\nCheckr primarily uses AI to run background checks and surface information such as criminal records and motor vehicle reports. The company has major contracts with Uber and Lyft to screen new drivers, and is valued at more than $5.7 billion after raising $120 million in funding in 2022. In 2025, Checkr reported over $800 million in revenue and surpassed 120,000 customers.\n\nWhen asked what Checkr wants to do for the government, Yanisse said that for Medicare and other programs, \"there's a lot of fraud happening and just bad actors getting the government dollars instead of the right people who need help,\" adding that it's very hard for the government to actually verify people's employment status and income.\n\nThe Medicare Fee-for-Service program estimated that there were $28.83 billion in \"improper payment\" in 2025 at a rate of 6.55%, though not all such cases are the result of intentional fraud. Payments made to individuals who did not submit sufficient documentation and have unverified income levels are also considered improper by Medicaid.\n\n\"With AI, unfortunately, there's going to be even more fraud, identity theft, and scams,\" said Yanisse. \"It's a lot of friction, it's a lot of repetition, and now there are also deepfakes.\"\n\nCheckr's spokesperson told Business Insider that the company's potential involvement in government is \"still conceptual at this point.\"\n\nThe company also pointed toward a study by Middesk, a business identity verification platform, that out of $1.09 trillion in Medicaid payments that went to around 1.6 million providers between 2018 and 2024, $563 million in payouts went to providers that are blacklisted from federal healthcare programs for criminal activity or misconduct.\n\nStuart Russell, professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and an AI pioneer, told Business Insider that he is \"not optimistic\" that the plan to use AI to determine benefits eligibility will work as advertised.\n\n\"An AI system of this kind, some version of an LLM, is incapable of producing veridical explanations of its decisions, making it impossible to challenge false decisions,\" Russell said.\n\nRussell also cited the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, which bars decisions with significant legal effects on individuals from being made entirely by automated systems.\n\nBaobao Zhang, the Maxwell Dean associate professor of the politics of AI at Syracuse University, told Business Insider that though she cannot assess exactly how good Checkr's verification system is right now, past government attempts to mix people's benefits with an automated system are cautionary tales.\n\n\"If the federal government or other state governments are trying to contract with a vendor to automate welfare fraud detection, they need to have a serious evaluation in the real world before they deploy it, because the stakes are high, as history has proven,\" said Zhang.\n\nIn Indiana, an attempt to streamline and automate its welfare eligibility system by outsourcing a contract to IBM ended in a legal battle in which the state sued the company for $1.3 billion for the scrapped project in 2010. Based on court records, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration said that processing errors from IBM led to faulty benefits denials that brought harm to the needy.\n\nIn Australia, an automated government plan called Robodebt, designed to detect fraud, told welfare recipients to repay benefits and sent letters claiming they owed thousands of dollars in debt, based on an incorrect algorithm. A royal commission, which is Australia's highest form of public inquiry, found that at least three people died by suicide after being falsely told to pay back debt they don't owe by Robodebt. The system was ruled illegal by a court in 2019.\n\nIfeoma Ajunwa, the founding director of the AI and the Future of Work Program at Emory University, told Business Insider that if any government agency is to adopt AI, there should be an advisory council made up of technologists and social scientists, and affected constituencies should be given a say.\n\n\"I think we need to move cautiously when delegating governmental functions to AI technologies,\" said Ajunwa. \"While these tools are touted to increase efficiency and lower costs, we also need to establish guardrails for their use to protect citizens.\"",

    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, has warned that some lenders are doing “dumb things” and he is starting to see parallels to the era before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nDimon, 69, who steered America’s biggest bank through the global financial crisis, told investors: “Unfortunately, we did see this in ’05, ’06 and ’07, almost the same thing — the rising tide was lifting all boats, everyone was making a lot of money, people were leveraging to the hilt.\n\n“My own view is people getting a little comfortable that this is real, these high asset prices and high volumes, and we won’t have any kind of problem, whatsoever.”\n\n• How a doomsday AI blog post wiped out billions\n\nReferring to unspecified competitors, he added: “I see a couple people doing some dumb things. They’re just doing dumb things to create [net interest income], or say they’re winning in the mortgage business.”\n\nHe also said he expects the credit cycle will eventually deteriorate again, potentially as a result of AI related disruption to software companies.\n\n“There’s always a surprise in a credit cycle … And this time around, it might be software, because of AI … There’s moving tectonic plates underneath it, it causes the industry to be challenged.”\n\nDimon warned in October about weakness in the credit market after the collapses of auto lender Tricolor Holdings and car-parts supplier First Brands Group. He told investors at the time: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more, and so everyone should be forewarned of this one.”\n\nDimon’s latest warning came as a Bank of America client survey found that, for the first time, an “AI bubble” is the biggest concern of credit investors, who noted the high levels of borrowing of cloud service providers, known as “hyperscalers”, including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Google.\n\nInvestors expect hyperscaler debt issuance of $285 billion this year, up from the $210 billion expected in December’s survey. Some 23 per cent of respondents saw the threat of an AI bubble as their top concern, up from 9 per cent in Bank of America’s previous survey in December.\n\nFears of a potentially unsustainable surge in investment and valuations of AI companies overtook “bubbles in credit” as the top concern, according to the survey.\n\nMeanwhile, “few worry about geopolitics or a central bank policy error”, the bank’s analysts wrote.\n\nHowever, investors were less worried about the ultimate tech disruption ahead, with only 10 per cent saying that AI-driven corporate obsolescence is their big worry.",

The conversation has been dominated by a significant lean toward the findings as 77% of influencers align with the warnings while 23% express disagreement. The report gained massive traction because it presents a detailed scenario in which the success of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a systemic financial collapse. It specifically targets the stability of the global economy and has influenced market prices for several major technology and payment companies as people evaluate the implications of abundant machine intelligence, says GlobalData, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.\n\nShreyasee Majumder, Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The overall sentiment among influencers reflects a deep and growing anxiety about the unmodeled risks associated with rapid technological advancement. Most observers view the report as a vital stress test for existing economic assumptions about labor and consumption. Influencers see the current environment as a high stakes game where labs and corporations are forced to automate even if doing so eventually damages the consumer base that supports their revenue.”\n\nBased on an analysis of the tweets, the reaction to Citrini Research’s report is polarized, viral, and highly engaged.

    "fullText": "Learn how SEO, AEO, and AI Visibility scores work together to determine your website's performance in both traditional and AI-powered search engines. Discover free tools to check all three at once\n\nIf you still think SEO is the only number that matters for your website, you're playing last decade's game. The search landscape has shifted dramatically. People now get answers from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and other AI assistants before they ever click a blue link on Google. And that changes everything about how we measure website performance.\n\nThere are now three scores every website owner should care about: SEO, AEO, and AI Visibility. Let me break down what each one means, why they matter, and how to track them all in one place.\n\nYou probably know this one. SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of making your website rank higher in traditional search results. It covers technical stuff like page speed, mobile-friendliness, meta tags, URL structure, and content quality.\n\nSEO is still important. Google isn't going anywhere. But here's the problem: even if you rank #1 for a query, AI assistants might pull the answer from someone else's content and serve it directly to the user. The user never visits your page. Your ranking becomes invisible.\n\nThat's why SEO alone doesn't cut it anymore. You need to think about the full picture.\n\nAEO is a newer concept that focuses on how well your content answers specific questions. Think of it as optimization for featured snippets, knowledge panels, and voice search results, but taken further into the AI era.\n\nWhen someone asks Siri, Alexa, or a chatbot a question, the system looks for content that directly and clearly answers that question. AEO measures how well your site is structured to be that answer.\n\nKey factors that influence your AEO score include structured data (schema markup), clear FAQ sections, concise and direct answers within your content, and proper heading hierarchy that makes it easy for machines to parse your information.\n\nA high AEO score means your content is formatted in a way that answer engines can easily extract and present to users.\n\nAI Visibility is the newest and perhaps most critical metric of the three. It measures how likely your website or brand is to appear in responses generated by AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity.\n\nThis goes beyond traditional crawling and indexing. AI Visibility depends on whether your content is accessible to AI crawlers (like GPTBot or ClaudeBot), whether your robots.txt allows or blocks these bots, whether your content is structured in a way that AI models can learn from, and whether your brand is mentioned across the web in contexts that AI training data would capture.\n\nUnlike SEO, where you can see your rankings directly in Google, AI Visibility has been harder to measure. Until recently, there wasn't a straightforward way to get a score for it.\n\nThink of it this way: SEO gets you found in Google. AEO gets your content selected as the direct answer. AI Visibility gets you mentioned when someone asks an AI assistant about your industry.\n\nA site might score 89 in SEO but only 44 in AI Visibility. That means it ranks well in traditional search but is practically invisible to AI systems. Another site might have great AI Visibility at 93 but lag behind in SEO at 74. That site shows up in AI conversations but struggles in Google results.\n\nThe sweet spot is having all three scores balanced and high.\n\nOne of the tools I've found useful for tracking these metrics is the RepuAI Site Checker. It runs a comprehensive analysis and gives you four scores at a glance: an Overall score plus individual breakdowns for AI Visibility, SEO, and AEO.\n\nWhat I like about this tool is the depth of the analysis. Below the top-level scores, you get a full breakdown across multiple modules: AI Files status, Structured Data, Content Quality, Security, Page Speed, Robots.txt configuration, JS Rendering, URL Structure, and Meta Tags. Each module highlights specific issues and gives you actionable recommendations.\n\nThe report also checks AI Bot Visibility separately, which tells you exactly which AI crawlers can and cannot access your site. This is something most traditional SEO tools completely ignore.\n\nBased on the reports I've seen on the platform, here's a rough benchmark. Scores above 85 across all three metrics put you in solid shape. Anything below 70 in any category means there's real work to do. And if your AI Visibility drops below 60, you're essentially invisible to a growing segment of how people search for information.\n\nFor context, the example in the screenshot above shows an Overall score of 90 with AI Visibility at 93, SEO at 89, and AEO at 85. That's a well-optimized site, though even with those numbers, the report identified 13 issues worth fixing.\n\nNo site is perfect. The goal is continuous improvement.\n\nFor SEO: Focus on page speed, clean URL structures, proper meta tags, and mobile optimization. These are the basics, but so many sites still get them wrong.\n\nFor AEO: Add structured data markup to your pages. Create clear, concise answers to common questions in your niche. Use proper heading tags (H1, H2, H3) to create a logical content hierarchy.\n\nFor AI Visibility: Check your robots.txt file and make sure you're not blocking AI crawlers like GPTBot, ClaudeBot, or PerplexityBot. Create an llms.txt file that helps AI systems understand your site. Make sure your content is accessible without heavy JavaScript rendering.\n\nThe websites that will thrive in the next few years are the ones that optimize for all three dimensions of search: traditional, answer-based, and AI-powered. Ignoring any one of them means leaving traffic and visibility on the table.\n\nIf you haven't checked your scores yet, RepuAI's free site checker is a good starting point. Run the analysis, see where you stand, and start fixing the issues it flags. It takes about 15-30 seconds to get your report.\n\nThe search game has changed. Your optimization strategy should change with it.",

    "fullText": "What is Google RankBrain and how does it affect your brand's visibility? We break down how Google's machine learning algorithm works, its connection to AI search, and the specific steps you can take to optimize — from traditional SEO to visibility in ChatGPT and Perplexity\n\nImagine typing something like \"gray console made by Sony\" into Google. You never wrote the word \"PlayStation.\" But Google knows that's exactly what you're looking for. Ten years ago, the search engine would have been stumped. Today, it figures out queries like this in milliseconds. The technology behind this magic has a name - Google RankBrain.\n\nAnd if you think RankBrain is a relic from the SEO history archives, here's some news: this algorithm is not only alive and well, it has become the foundation for everything Google does with artificial intelligence in search today.\n\nLet's break down how it works, why it matters more than ever, and what all of this means for your brand's visibility - in traditional search and in the new AI-powered engines.\n\nGoogle officially confirmed RankBrain's existence on October 26, 2015. It's a machine learning system built into Google's core algorithm (Hummingbird) that helps process search results and understand what users are actually looking for.\n\nAt launch, RankBrain handled roughly 15% of all search queries — specifically, the ones Google had never seen before. That might not sound like much. But when Google processes billions of queries a day, 15% translates to hundreds of millions of searches the engine previously couldn't handle properly.\n\nToday, RankBrain is involved in virtually every query. Google called it the third most important ranking factor — after content and links. And Google's own experiments showed that RankBrain picks the best result more accurately than human search engineers: 80% accuracy for RankBrain versus 70% for humans.\n\nRankBrain isn't a standalone algorithm that replaces everything else. It's a component inside Hummingbird, like a part within a car engine. And it has two main functions.\n\nBefore RankBrain, Google looked at individual words in a query and tried to find pages with exact matches. RankBrain changed the approach: it converts words into mathematical vectors (numerical representations) and searches for connections between concepts.\n\nA simple example: if someone searches \"what to wear in the rain to a business meeting,\" RankBrain understands the query isn't just about \"rain\" or \"clothes\" — it's about a specific situation. It connects the concepts of \"business attire,\" \"rain protection,\" and \"recommendations\" — and serves relevant results, even if no single page contains that exact phrase.\n\nThis became possible through the shift from \"strings\" to \"entities.\" Google stopped seeing text as a collection of characters and started recognizing real-world objects: people, companies, products, places.\n\nHere's what makes RankBrain truly smart: it watches how people interact with search results. Did the user click a result and stay on the page? Good sign. Did they bounce back after 5 seconds and click another result? That means the first page didn't answer their question.\n\nRankBrain uses these signals to continuously fine-tune rankings. It can dynamically adjust the weight of different factors — backlinks, content freshness, text length, domain authority — depending on the specific query. If users show that a new order of results works better, it stays. If not, the system rolls back the changes.\n\nIn essence, RankBrain is a perpetual A/B test at the scale of billions of queries.\n\nSome SEO professionals consider RankBrain outdated — after all, BERT, MUM, and Gemini came along, and RankBrain was supposedly left behind. This is a misconception.\n\nRankBrain hasn't gone anywhere. It evolved into what experts call the \"reasoning layer\" — the connective tissue between all of Google's AI systems. BERT handles deep natural language understanding. MUM processes multilingual and multimodal queries. Gemini powers generative answers. And RankBrain orchestrates all of it, deciding how much weight to give each signal for a specific query.\n\nThink of it as a conductor of an orchestra: each instrument (BERT, MUM, Gemini) plays its part, but RankBrain decides when and how loud.\n\nNow for the really interesting part. Understanding RankBrain isn't just an academic exercise. It's a direct path to understanding how AI search works as a whole.\n\nRankBrain was the first time machine learning was embedded into Google's core search algorithm. Everything that followed — BERT, AI Overviews, AI Mode — grew from the same logic: understand intent, not keywords.\n\nAnd here's the problem for brands: that same logic now operates in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and other AI platforms. Except the rules there are even stricter.\n\nIn traditional Google, you get a list of 10 links — even if you're in 7th place, you're at least visible. In AI search, there's one answer. If the AI engine doesn't consider your brand authoritative, relevant, and trustworthy enough — you simply don't exist to the user.\n\nAccording to expert estimates, traditional search will lose up to 50% of its share by 2028. AI answers already appear in 57% of Google results. ChatGPT serves 400 million users weekly.\n\nThe good news: the principles that work for RankBrain also work for the new AI engines. Here's what you should be doing right now.\n\nRankBrain analyzes user intent. Stop thinking in terms of \"which keywords to insert\" and start thinking: \"what problem is this person trying to solve?\" Group queries into intent clusters: informational, transactional, navigational.\n\nAI systems (RankBrain included) prioritize content that explores topics in depth. Not 300-word posts written for SEO, but comprehensive guides that fully address the user's question.\n\nSchema markup helps both Google and AI engines understand what your content is about. FAQ schema, organization markup, product and author markup — all of this increases your chances of being cited in AI responses.\n\nRankBrain factors in behavioral signals. Page load speed, mobile usability, Core Web Vitals — all of these affect how users interact with your site, and therefore your rankings.\n\nAI systems aggregate signals from multiple sources: press mentions, reviews, social media, forums. Brands with a strong presence across multiple channels receive more mentions in AI responses. Estimates suggest roughly 250 quality publications are needed to meaningfully influence how an LLM perceives a brand.\n\nFresh content gets priority in both RankBrain and AI engines. If your last blog post is two years old, AI systems will more likely cite a competitor's more up-to-date source.\n\nYou can't improve what you don't measure. Traditional SEO tools don't show how your brand appears in ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini responses. You need specialized solutions for that — and this is exactly the problem RepuAI solves, tracking mentions, sentiment, and visibility of your brand across AI search engines.\n\nRankBrain ushered in an era where machine learning became an integral part of search. But that era isn't standing still. Today, a new discipline is gaining momentum — Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), optimization for generative search engines.\n\nThe logic of GEO is simple: if you used to optimize for an algorithm that ranks links, now you need to optimize for an algorithm that generates answers. And that's an entirely different game.\n\nIn the world of GEO, your brand needs to be:\n\nAnd here the circle closes: the principles RankBrain established — understanding intent, focusing on the user, continuous learning — have become the foundation for all modern AI search systems.\n\nRankBrain was the first — but far from the last — step Google took toward AI-driven search. Understanding its principles gives you a strategic advantage: you see not individual algorithm updates, but the overall direction the industry is heading.\n\nThat direction points one way: from keywords to meaning, from links to authority, from SERP positions to mentions in AI responses.\n\nBrands that understand this now will find themselves in a winning position. The rest will be playing catch-up.\n\nWant to find out how your brand looks through the eyes of AI right now?

A White House spokesperson confirmed the report to Business Insider but did not provide additional details.\n\nThe announcement comes as Big Tech companies spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build AI infrastructure and data centers, driving up electricity demand in the US. Utility costs are rising across the US as a result of the increased electricity demand for data centers, a report from the Center for American Progress found.\n\nTrump has previously said Americans should not have to pay higher electricity costs due to data centers, and that the companies that build them \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nDecisions about utility costs are typically made at the state and local levels.

    "title": "Anthropic Drops Flagship Safety Pledge",
    "description": "In an abrupt shift, the company may release future AI models without ironclad safety guarantees",
    "fullText": "Anthropic, the wildly successful AI company that has cast itself as the most safety-conscious of the top research labs, is dropping the central pledge of its flagship safety policy, company officials tell TIME.\n\nIn 2023, Anthropic committed to never train an AI system unless it could guarantee in advance that the company’s safety measures were adequate. For years, its leaders touted that promise—the central pillar of their Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)—as evidence that they are a responsible company that would withstand market incentives to rush to develop a potentially dangerous technology.\n\nBut in recent months the company decided to radically overhaul the RSP. That decision included scrapping the promise to not release AI models if Anthropic can’t guarantee proper risk mitigations in advance.\n\n“We felt that it wouldn't actually help anyone for us to stop training AI models,” Anthropic’s chief science officer Jared Kaplan told TIME in an exclusive interview. “We didn't really feel, with the rapid advance of AI, that it made sense for us to make unilateral commitments … if competitors are blazing ahead.”\n\nThe new version of the policy, which TIME reviewed, includes commitments to be more transparent about the safety risks of AI, including making additional disclosures about how Anthropic’s own models fare in safety testing. It commits to matching or surpassing the safety efforts of competitors. And it promises to “delay” Anthropic’s AI development if leaders both consider Anthropic to be leader of the AI race and think the risks of catastrophe to be significant.\n\nBut overall, the change to the RSP leaves Anthropic far less constrained by its own safety policies, which previously categorically barred it from training models above a certain level if appropriate safety measures weren’t already in place.\n\nThe change comes as Anthropic, previously considered to be behind OpenAI in the AI race, rides the high of a string of technological and commercial successes. Its Claude models, especially the software-writing tool Claude Code, have won legions of devoted fans. In February, Anthropic raised $30 billion in new investments, valuing it at some $380 billion, and reported that its annualized revenue was growing at a rate of 10x per year. The company’s core business model of selling direct to businesses is seen by many investors as more credible than OpenAI’s main strategy of monetizing a vast consumer user base.\n\nKaplan, the Anthropic executive and co-founder, denied the company’s decision to change course was a capitulation to market incentives as the race for superintelligence accelerates. He framed it instead as a pragmatic response to emerging political and scientific realities. “I don’t think we’re making any kind of U-turn,” Kaplan says.\n\nWhen Anthropic introduced the RSP in 2023, Kaplan says, the company hoped it would encourage rivals to adopt similar measures. (No rivals made quite as overt a promise to pause AI development, but many published lengthy reports detailing their plans to mitigate risk, which Kaplan chalks up as Anthropic exerting a good influence on the industry.) Executives also hoped the approach might eventually serve as a blueprint for binding national regulations or even international treaties, Kaplan claims.\n\nBut those regulations never materialized. Instead, the Trump Administration has endorsed a let-it-rip attitude to AI development, even going so far as to attempt to nullify state regulations. No federal AI law is on the horizon. And while a global governance framework may have seemed possible in 2023, three years later it has become clear that door has closed. Meanwhile, competition for AI supremacy—between companies but also between nations—has only intensified.\n\nTo make matters worse, the science of AI evaluations has proven more complicated than Anthropic expected when it first crafted the RSP. The arrival of powerful new models meant that, in 2025, Anthropic announced it could not rule out the possibility of these models facilitating a bio-terrorist attack. But while they couldn’t rule it out, they also lacked strong scientific evidence that models did pose that kind of danger, which made it difficult to convince governments and rivals of what they saw as the need to act carefully. What the company had previously imagined might look like a bright red line was instead coming into focus as a fuzzy gradient.\n\nFor nearly a year, Anthropic executives discussed ways to reshape their flagship safety policy to match this new environment, Kaplan says. One point they kept coming back to was their founding premise: the idea that to do proper AI safety research, they had to build models at the frontier of capability—even though doing so might accelerate the arrival of the dangers they feared.\n\nIn February, according to Kaplan, Amodei decided that keeping the company from training new models while competitors raced ahead would be helpful to nobody. “If one AI developer paused development to implement safety measures while others moved forward training and deploying AI systems without strong mitigations, that could result in a world that is less safe,” the new version of the RSP, approved unanimously by Amodei and Anthropic’s board, states in its introduction. “The developers with the weakest protections would set the pace, and responsible developers would lose their ability to do safety research.”\n\nChris Painter, the director of policy at METR, a nonprofit focused on evaluating AI models for risky behavior, reviewed an early draft of the policy with Anthropic’s permission. He says the change is understandable — but also a bearish signal for the world’s ability to navigate potential AI catastrophes. The change to the RSP shows Anthropic “believes it needs to shift into triage mode with its safety plans, because methods to assess and mitigate risk are not keeping up with the pace of capabilities,” Painter tells TIME. “This is more evidence that society is not prepared for the potential catastrophic risks posed by AI.”\n\nAnthropic argues the retooled RSP is designed to keep the biggest benefits of the old one. For example, by constraining itself from releasing new models, Anthropic’s original RSP also incentivized it to quickly build safety mitigations. (Because otherwise the company would be unable to sell its AI to customers.) Anthropic says it believes it can maintain that incentive. The new policy commits the company to regularly release what it calls “Frontier Safety Roadmaps”: documents laying out a list of detailed goals for future safety measures it hopes to build.\n\n“We hope to create a forcing function for work that would otherwise be challenging to appropriately prioritize and resource, as it requires collaboration (and in some cases sacrifices) from multiple parts of the company and can be at cross-purposes with immediate competitive and commercial priorities,” the new RSP states.\n\nAnthropic says it will also commit to publishing so-called “Risk Reports” every three to six months. The reports, the company says, will “explain how capabilities, threat models (the specific ways that models might pose threats), and active risk mitigations fit together, and provide an assessment of the overall level of risk.” These documents will be more in-depth than the reports the company already publishes, a spokesperson tells TIME.\n\n“I like the emphasis on transparent risk reporting and publicly verifiable safety roadmaps,” says Painter, the METR policy official. But he said he was “concerned” that moving away from binary thresholds under the previous RSP, by which the arrival of a certain capability could act as a tripwire to temporarily halt Anthropic’s AI development, might enable a “frog-boiling” effect, where danger slowly ramps up without a single moment that sets off alarms.\n\nAsked whether Anthropic was caving to market pressure, Kaplan argued that, in fact, Anthropic was making a renewed commitment to developing AI safely. “If all of our competitors are transparently doing the right thing when it comes to catastrophic risk, we are committed to doing as well or better,” he said. “But we don't think it makes sense for us to stop engaging with AI research, AI safety, and most likely lose relevance as an innovator who understands the frontier of the technology, in a scenario where others are going ahead and we're not actually contributing any additional risk to the ecosystem.”",

    "description": "The AI boom could bring us amazing discoveries — and massive unemployment. Both scenarios are worth taking seriously.",
    "fullText": "You know all that money and effort everyone's putting into AI because they're convinced it's a technology that will change everything? What if they're right?\n\nThat's a kind of fair summary of a Substack post that went viral over the weekend, and then turned into a Wall Street phenomenon Monday, when lots of tech stocks lost value because of AI fears.\n\nI say \"kind of fair\" because the \"what if\" post, published by Citrini Research, isn't just a \"what if\" post, but a \"if it happens, we're in big trouble\" post.\n\nAnd now the blowback: AI boosters are calling the Citrini post \"AI doomerism\" and are poking at some of its doomsday scenarios.\n\nI'm not here to argue whether any of Citrini's individual points are reasonable — I have no idea how AI will affect the likes of, say, DoorDash.\n\nBut this also seems like a forest/trees issue. Maybe the details are wrong, but the big picture should be a sobering one: If the AI future we are being promised comes to pass, it could have a massive effect on our economy, and part of that effect could be meaningful unemployment.\n\nBecause that's not just a wild-eyed anti-AI thesis, but one that's core to the pro-AI thesis, too. It's what accounts for the enormous investments tech companies are making in AI, and the crazy valuations we're seeing for the likes of Anthropic ($380 billion) and OpenAI ($850 billion).\n\nIn short: The only way those companies are going to be worth anything close to those numbers* is if they end up having a massive impact. Yes, some of the value may be justified by amazing innovation AI could unlock, like wonder-drugs that get discovered in a fraction of the time. But a lot of the value will come from the fact that AI will let computers do lots of work humans do now.\n\nYou can't have the upside without the downside. Full stop.\n\nIt's easy to imagine all the ways this ripples through our economy. And every couple weeks or so, we get a new impetus to fire up our imaginations. Right now, for instance, the market is trying to get its head around the notion that AI might dramatically cut into the enterprise software industry, which is why we saw companies like IBM plummet on Monday. But you can do the same exercise for all kinds of work, in all kinds of industries: Lawyers. Consultants. Screenwriters. Truckers. Etc.\n\nNor do you have to be an AI \"doomer\" to think this way — it's baked into the pitch of the biggest AI companies. \"There are cases where entire classes of jobs will go away,\" OpenAI's Sam Altman said last year. His rival, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, is blunter and more pessimistic, predicting that AI will wipe out half of entry-level white collar jobs and send unemployment skyrocketing.\n\nIt is a little weird to see Wall Street whip-sawing as it thinks through how all of this might go. On Tuesday, tech stocks gained again, presumably because investors have now decided they overreacted on Monday. But I won't be surprised to see the markets lurch again down the line when someone else makes a convincing case that computers will disrupt a different industry.\n\nMaybe Citrini is wrong about DoorDash and right about lawyers. Maybe it's the other way around. But the general shape of the problem stays the same: The more AI lives up to the hype, the more it will affect the way people work — or if they work at all. You can be optimistic about that prospect, or terrified. But you can't ignore it.\n\n*Bear in mind these are private companies, which someday expect to be worth much more when they go public.",

    "fullText": "Bryan Johnson, fresh off a 40- and 70-hour social media fast, says he's ready to put an AI buffer between him and his social feed.\n\nIn a post on X, the 48-year-old entrepreneur and biohacker compared social media to pollution and water toxins.\n\n\"Like other toxins, it accumulates,\" he wrote. \"You can't unsee or unfeel what you've consumed. It settles into mental tissue like heavy metals, producing chronic low-grade inflammation.\"\n\nEliminating social media entirely isn't realistic, he wrote.\n\n\"'Just put the phone down' is as practical as telling someone in 19th-century London to stop breathing coal smoke,\" he wrote.\n\nJohnson said time away from the apps is the \"only remedy,\" but he also suggested that AI agents could serve as an antidote to social media.\n\n\"An AI layer between you and the feed. Filtering rage, removing vanity metrics and translating sensationalism into calm, factual language. Preserving signal and eliminating noise,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I never want to see the raw feed. I want an AI agent to read it for me, strip the engagement metrics that hijack my judgment, filter the rage, and return only what I actually came for,\" he added.\n\nIn a world where AI agents are already proving to be expert hackers, agreeable coworkers, and custom-built board members — as well as potential security risks — Johnson's push for an AI layer between himself and his feed doesn't seem all that far off.\n\nJohnson has made it his life's focus to try to reverse his biological age to avoid death. He spends around $2 million a year to do so, focusing on extreme treatments such as plasma therapy alongside his strict diet and exercise routine.\n\nHis wish for an AI social media buffer also ties into his quest for a longer life, he says: \"I want social media to become a longevity intervention, not a longevity threat.\"",

    "description": "Nvidia's results come as investors deal with a bout of AI anxiety. Analysts say the chip giant must handily beat earnings and guidance estimates.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia earnings reports tend to be market-moving events, and the company's report on Wednesday could be particularly momentous as Wall Street goes through a bout of AI anxiety.\n\nWith AI spending from hyperscalers increasingly under scrutiny, any waning in demand for Nvidia's products could signal a slowdown of the AI boom, which investors have bet big on over the last few years.\n\nThe AI trade is also generally under close watch at the moment, as Anthropic's Claude AI disrupts industries and reorders the list of stock winners and losers.\n\n\"Nvidia remains central to the AI narrative. We see hyperscaler capex as the clearest real-time indicator of AI demand,\" said Lauren Goodwin, the chief market strategist at New York Life Investments, in an email on Tuesday. \"As long as companies continue to deploy capital aggressively into AI infrastructure, we do not see evidence of a rollover in this theme. The foundational layer of AI remains supply-constrained.\"\n\nWall Street is expecting the chip giant to deliver $65.91 billion of revenue, with $60 billion of that coming from its all-important data center business.\n\nAs the market heads toward the blockbuster report on Wednesday afternoon, here's what analysts say to keep an eye out for.\n\nDan Ives, the bullish Wedbush tech analyst, said he expects Nvidia to handily beat earnings estimates.\n\nBut perhaps above all else, investors will be paying attention to CEO Jensen Huang's tone and outlook for chip demand going forward.\n\n\"There is one company that is the foundation for the AI Revolution and that is Nvidia with the Godfather of AI Jensen having the best perch and vantage point to discuss overall enterprise AI demand and the appetite for Nvidia's AI chips looking forward,\" Ives wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley's analyst covering Nvidia, says he would buy the stock heading into earnings on Wednesday, as his contacts in the industry continue to sound optimistic about the company.\n\nMoore has a $250 a share price target on the stock, implying 29% upside.\n\nIn the weeks following the report, Moore said to keep an eye on Jensen Huang's appearances at Morgan Stanley's TMT conference and a GTC developer event \n\nAnthony Saglimbene, the chief market strategist at Ameriprise, said to keep an eye out for updates on how successfully Nvidia is ramping up production of its new Rubin model.\n\n\"Execution on next-generation platforms, like Rubin, needs to give investors confidence that the company is on track with deployment schedules and that lead times are manageable.\"\n\nHe added that the firm needs to demonstrate that \"it can continue to successfully manage an industrial-scale manufacturing ramp not often seen in history.\"\n\nJoe Mazzola, the head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, said to watch for heightened investor scrutiny on the firm's profit margins as their production costs grow.\n\n\"Though AI spending shows little sign of easing, Nvidia and fellow chip firms face higher bandwidth memory costs amid sector shortages, and this could affect projected margin growth,\" Mazzola said in an email on Tuesday.\n\nOn the revenue front, he said that data centers will be the most important driver to watch, and guidance must also beat the average forecast.\n\n\"Nvidia remains under pressure every quarter not to just exceed quarterly consensus, but to guide for growth exceeding analysts' average estimates.\"\n\nSimilar to Ives, Luke Rahbari, a co-Portfolio Manager for The Rational Equity Armor Fund, said forward guidance is going to be the most important thing to watch. Any hint of negativity could mean trouble for the stock and the rest of the AI trade.\n\n\"They're going to have to say that they're seeing year-to-year growth, and that number has to be healthy. It doesn't have to be as healthy as how it's been growing here, but staying steady and growing at that year-to-year clip is what's going to be important,\" Rahbari wrote. \"If they mention any type of slowdown, if they say that year-to-year growth is going to be significantly lower, or if they pull back on investing in some of their own customers, that's going to signal that demand for the chips is lower.\"",

    "description": "Elon Musk's AI startup alleged in the lawsuit that Sam Altman's OpenAI recruited former xAI employees to steal trade secrets.",
    "fullText": "A California federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Elon Musk's AI startup xAI, accusing OpenAI of poaching staff to steal trade secrets.\n\nIn a ruling released on Tuesday, US District Judge Rita Lin sided with a request to dismiss the case filed by the Sam Altman-led AI company behind ChatGPT, citing the lack of evidence against it.\n\n\"Notably absent are allegations about the conduct of OpenAI itself,\" Lin wrote in her order. \"xAI does not allege any facts indicating that OpenAI induced xAI's former employees to steal xAI's trade secrets or that these former xAI employees used any stolen trade secrets once employed by OpenAI.\"\n\nInstead of pointing to \"misconduct\" by OpenAI, xAI cited \"eight former xAI employees who left for OpenAI at around the same time,\" the judge said.\n\nLin gave xAI until March 17 to file an amended complaint \"correcting the deficiencies\" outlined in her order — giving Musk's company a chance to try again.\n\nThe ruling is the latest in an escalating feud between tech billionaires Musk and Altman.\n\nLast year, xAI sued Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of monopolistic behavior. Musk has also separately sued Altman and OpenAI — the company the two men cofounded in 2015 — over claims that it betrayed its nonprofit mission by shifting into a for-profit structure. OpenAI countersued, accusing Musk of a \"years-long campaign of harassment.\" That case is scheduled to go to trial in April.\n\nIn a statement in social media platform X, OpenAI said it welcomed the court's decision and called the lawsuit \"yet another front in Mr. Musk's ongoing campaign of harassment.\" Lawyers for x.AI didn't immediately return Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nIn the lawsuit that was dismissed on Tuesday, Musk's company alleged that OpenAI engaged in a \"deeply troubling pattern\" of recruiting former xAI employees to gain access to confidential information related to Grok, xAI's flagship chatbot.\n\nIn an amended complaint filed last year, xAI accused rival OpenAI of violating California and federal law by \"inducing\" several ex-employees to \"steal and share xAI's trade secrets.\"\n\n\"Threatened by xAI's innovations, OpenAI is not merely soliciting or hiring a competitor's employees,\" the lawsuit said. \"OpenAI is waging a coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign: OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI's key technologies and business plans.\"\n\nThe complaint alleged that, in just a few months, OpenAI poached at least eight xAI employees, including early xAI engineer Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance executive. Two former employees, the lawsuit said, have admitted to stealing xAI's trade secrets.\n\nAltman's OpenAI has denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit the \"latest chapter\" in Musk's \"ongoing harassment\" against the company.\n\nIn OpenAI's motion to dismiss the complaint, the company alleged that Musk and xAI have \"lobbed baseless claims of trade secret misappropriation\" to \"intimidate current and former xAI employees from working at their place of choice.\"\n\n\"XAI's federal trade secret misappropriation claim fails as a matter of law,\" OpenAI's attorneys argued in the motion. \"Remarkably, xAI never alleges that OpenAI actually acquired or disclosed xAI's trade secrets.\"",

    "fullText": "Workday is betting on artificial intelligence taking over more work.\n\nWhile software stocks — including Workday's — have sunk recently amid concerns over AI advancements, the company framed the technology as a growth opportunity on its Tuesday earnings call.\n\n\"We're working really hard to figure out how do we improve business process execution for our customers at a lower cost,\" CEO Anil Bhusri said.\n\n\"I think that's where the agentic model fits in. What can agents do to replace human labor?\" he said. \"And then obviously longer term, we've got to figure out what we're going to do with those humans that are displaced.\"\n\nBhusri's remarks came after Workday reported revenue and net-income growth for the January-ended quarter. Shares fell around 10%, however, as the company projected slower subscription revenue growth than Wall Street expected for the fiscal year ahead.\n\nA spokesperson for Workday said that Bhusri's comments were not about Workday planning to replace its employees or its customers' employees, but rather about industry-level shifts.\n\nBhusri said the outlook reflects that the AI products Workday is building aren't expected to generate meaningful revenue until later in the year.\n\nWorkday's stock drop marks another setback for the company, whose shares have slid in recent weeks amid a broader software selloff driven by fears that artificial intelligence could upend the industry.\n\nThe rout began in early February, tipping the sector into a deep bear market and spilling into adjacent industries as investors grapple with AI's disruptive potential. Other companies affected include LegalZoom, Thomson Reuters, and Okta.\n\nOn the call, Workday didn't directly address those concerns directly and instead emphasized its investments in agentic products to expand its footprint in HR and finance software.\n\nEarlier this month, Workday said it was laying off about 400 employees, citing a need to realign its resources to meet its top priorities. A week later, Bhursi was renamed CEO, succeeding Carl Eschenbach, who stepped down. \n\nBhusri has held the top job three times before. He told analysts on Tuesday's earnings call that while he's optimistic about the business, he tends to set guidance cautiously and aim to outperform it.\n\n\"I don't know if you know you remember me when I was a CEO before, but I do try to be conservative on the guide and then beat it,\" he said.",

Join 7 million investors using Simply Wall St's investing ideas for FREE.\n\nASML Holding (ENXTAM:ASML) reports a breakthrough in EUV lithography that can enable up to 50% higher chip production efficiency.\n\nThe company says its latest EUV machines use a much more powerful light source to help customers process significantly more chips by 2030.\n\nThis development reinforces ASML's position in advanced semiconductor manufacturing as competitors in the U.S. and China work on rival technologies.\n\nASML Holding sits at the center of high end chip production, supplying EUV lithography tools that many chipmakers use for leading edge manufacturing. The new machine design directly targets growing demand for next generation AI chips, an area that has become a key focus across the semiconductor industry.\n\nFor investors watching ENXTAM:ASML, the bigger question is how this technology shift could influence customer investment plans and the competitive gap with other equipment makers. The reported 50% efficiency potential by 2030 may shape long term capacity decisions across foundries and integrated device manufacturers that rely on EUV tools.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for ASML Holding by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on ASML Holding.\n\n2 things going right for ASML Holding that this headline doesn't cover.\n\nThis EUV light-source breakthrough goes straight to the economics of chip production. If a tool can process around 50% more wafers per hour without needing extra floor space or duplicate systems, it can change how customers such as TSMC and Intel think about their long term fab build outs. For ASML, that can translate into a stronger case for its most advanced EUV platforms as fabs push to supply AI and high performance computing chips. It also reinforces why ASML is often treated as a way to get exposure to AI chip demand without choosing a specific chip designer. At the same time, a more productive tool could slow the need for incremental units at the margin if customers can get more output from each system, so investors may want to watch how pricing, service and upgrade revenues evolve alongside unit volumes, especially as U.S. and Chinese equipment makers work on competing technologies.\n\nThis EUV advance aligns with the narrative that ASML’s EUV and High NA platforms support productivity and cost reductions for chipmakers, which can support equipment adoption tied to AI demand.\n\nIf High NA adoption timing or tool maturity proves more complex than expected, the focus on current generation EUV power gains could delay some of the earnings contribution that narrative writers associate with future platforms.\n\nThe news puts more weight on ASML’s installed base and upgrade potential, which is mentioned in the narrative, but the specific impact of higher light output on long term service and upgrade revenue may not yet be fully reflected.",

    "description": "Astelia CEO Alon Noy, a former leader of Israel's National Red Team, said that traditional cybersecurity has \"no chance\" against AI-powered attackers.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence has supercharged the cybersecurity arms race. Attackers are rushing to harness the tech to break into systems, leaving defenders no choice but to adopt it as well to fend them off.\n\nAlon Noy, who previously led an Israeli intelligence unit that tested the nation's cyber defenses, saw that paradigm shift as an irresistible opportunity to wield his cybersecurity skills and \"protect the world,\" he told Business Insider in an exclusive interview this week.\n\nNoy is the CEO and cofounder of Astelia, a cybersecurity startup that uses AI to analyze an enterprise's systems, identify the tiny fraction of vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit, and help plug those holes in its defenses.\n\nAstelia announced on Tuesday that it has raised $35 million in a combined seed and Series A funding round led by Index Ventures and Team8.\n\nNoy spoke to Business Insider about why he thinks Astelia is the perfect bulwark against a new generation of cybersecurity threats, how he plans to use his investors' cash, and how young people can get ahead in the AI era.\n\nHe said that stress-testing Israel's critical infrastructure defenses helped him realize the value of being able to \"think like an attacker.\"\n\nNoy's cofounders, Nadav Ostrovsky and Roy Rajwan, also worked on Israel's National Red Team, mimicking attackers to test the country's critical infrastructure defenses.\n\nNoy explained that advances in AI have dramatically increased the number of vulnerabilities in an enterprise's computer systems and radically reduced the time needed to exploit them.\n\nThat creates a \"bad equation between the attackers and defenders,\" he said. When attackers use AI tools to rapidly identify and exploit vulnerabilities, defenders with only traditional tools \"have no chance to win the race,\" he added.\n\nNoy said a key challenge is that many enterprises have \"endless backlogs of vulnerabilities\" but limited resources to address them. He added that it's close to \"mission impossible\" to find the \"needles in the haystack\" — the vulnerabilities that are truly exploitable.\n\nAstelia combines AI agents with network and environment analysis of a customer's systems to pinpoint the 1% or 2% of vulnerabilities that are genuinely risky, he said.\n\nThe company can preemptively spot holes in a security system before they're ever exploited, which is \"super valuable for customers,\" Noy said.\n\nHe gave the example of a telecoms business that had a few million vulnerabilities in its backlog and no idea how to prioritize them. Astelia pinpointed the few hundred of those that posed genuine threats and helped tackle them, he said.\n\nNoy said he would use the fresh funds to ramp up Astelia's go-to-market team and bolster its R&D team. He said the startup would likely double in headcount by the end of this year, from around 30 people today to between 60 and 70 by December's close.\n\nJuriaan Duizendstraal, a partner at Index Ventures, said in a press release announcing the raise that AI is forcing enterprises to shift from \"assumed risk to provable exposure,\" and Astelia helps them to \"turn vulnerability management from a reactive scramble into a preemptive defense.\"\n\nAmir Zilberstein, a managing partner at Team8, wrote that his firm invested in part because of the Astelia team's \"rare understanding of how security failures emerge in real environments.\"\n\n\"Astelia cuts through vulnerability noise by grounding decisions in real exposure, and we believe this team is redefining how enterprises operationalize security,\" he added.\n\nNoy also spoke to Business Insider about how AI is changing the wider world.\n\nHe said the immense buzz around the tech is justified, but companies won't succeed long-term by simply using AI. They need to have a \"moat\" to fend off competitors, such as access to proprietary data, he said.\n\nNoy cautioned that many people are too relaxed about uploading personal information to ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, as they don't realize their sensitive data could be used to train the models, or consider that it might be leaked.\n\nHe also offered advice to young people worried about an affordability crisis and AI replacing humans in many jobs.\n\nNoy recommended they become \"good friends with AI\" and use it for everything from coding to planning, shopping, messaging, and managing tasks.\n\nHe said that could help them stay updated on the tech's latest abilities and shortcomings, and keep up with a fast-changing market, instead of getting \"left behind.\"",

    "description": "Another day, another sharp sell-off in software stocks. The sector has become a popular lightning rod for tech bearishness.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this month, we wrote about how the software sector had been marked with the scarlet letter of AI disruption. We declared that no matter what it did going forward, it would always have to contend with the perception that it's a sitting duck.\n\nFast-forward a few weeks, and the picture for software has gotten even bleaker. The most popular ETF tracking the sector has tumbled to the lowest since 2023. Wall Street analysts are taking cleavers to their price targets in the space.\n\nWhat's more, software has become the new lightning rod for risk-off AI aversion. If investors are in play-it-safe mode and rotating out of tech, they're dumping the group first and asking questions later. At this point, the sector's reputation precedes it.\n\nThis dynamic played out on Monday as software stocks sold off sharply as the ever-evolving US tariff situation sparked investor uncertainty. Throwing fuel on the flames was a viral blog post from Citrini Research laying out a drastic bearish scenario for the US market and economy.\n\nI won't drag you into the ominous nitty-gritty of the Citrini report, but I will give you a brief summary. The firm lays out a thought-experiment scenario where AI drives large-scale white-collar displacement, which destroys consumer demand and triggers downturns in markets and the economy.\n\nNot exactly the feel-good read of the year. But while the doomsaying was compelling, what struck me the most was how the blog post treated the decline of software as a foregone conclusion — a formative event for a grander AI bubble across many sectors.\n\nAs if the vibes around software weren't negative enough, the sector's narrative is now intersecting with another hot-button topic: private credit. Many of the software companies branded as vulnerable have significant debt loads. And a lot of that debt is due to private credit lenders. Citrini dedicated a whole section of its report to systemic credit risk.\n\nBen McMillan, the chief investment officer at IDX Advisors, told BI recently that he sees lax private-market underwriting as something that could eventually come back to bite.\n\nBigger picture, it's clear that software's role as the ringleader of the so-called AI \"scare trade\" is locked in — but it's far from the only member. Insurance brokers, real estate services companies, and wealth managers have gotten whacked in recent weeks. AI is a fickle, market-value-erasing beast.\n\nBut software should still be monitored closely. Its current role as a punching bag makes it even more important to watch as a bellwether of the AI trade.",

    "description": "As of February, CEO Sam Altman had 10 direct reports, while CEO of applications Fidji Simo had 13.",
    "fullText": "Who's in charge at one of the most powerful companies in the world?\n\nAs OpenAI races toward an expected IPO, faces mounting pressure to justify its valuation, and tries to fend off its Big Tech rivals, a small circle of executives and researchers is steering the ChatGPT maker through a defining moment.\n\nTo map the power players shaping OpenAI's future, Business Insider looked at the upper ranks of the company's internal organizational chart.\n\nAs of February, CEO Sam Altman had 10 direct reports, including Greg Brockman, president and cofounder; Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki; and Chief Research Officer Mark Chen.\n\nIn August, Fidji Simo officially joined as the CEO of applications and began reporting to Altman. Simo, the former CEO of Instacart and Facebook app lead at Meta, heads up the company's consumer and enterprise product lines. She's been tasked with scaling the business into a revenue-generating powerhouse.\n\nSince she joined the company, OpenAI has rolled out ads and numerous updates to its enterprise product.\n\nSimo had 13 direct reports, according to the February org chart, including the head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, and Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar. Some of Simo's reports, including Turley, previously reported to Altman.\n\nBarret Zoph, the general manager of B2B, rejoined the company in January and began reporting to Simo. Zoph left OpenAI in February 2025 to help found Thinking Machine Labs alongside former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati.\n\nBoth Altman and Simo also have administrative staffers who report directly to them.\n\nExecutive shifts at OpenAI are often fast-moving, and its org chart can be fluid. Last week, Instagram's head of partnerships, Charles Porch, announced he had joined OpenAI. Vanity Fair reported that Porch, who is known for bringing celebrities to Instagram, would work directly with Simo.\n\nAltman also announced earlier this month that the company is bringing on Peter Steinberger, the man behind the viral AI agent social media network OpenClaw.\n\nThe number of direct reports isn't necessarily reflective of overall team size. Simo manages nearly two-thirds of the company, according to a source familiar with the structure.\n\nDane Stuckey, the chief information security officer, has more than 20 of his own direct reports, and Peter Welinder, who works on the company's hardware device, has more than 50.\n\nMost of Altman's other direct reports have around a dozen of their own reports.\n\nDo you work for OpenAI or have a tip?

    "description": "The startup is trying to transform its Claude AI model from a coding tool into a much broader workplace technology platform.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic is pushing deeper into the enterprise, embedding its AI model Claude directly into the workplace software employees use every day.\n\nOn Tuesday, the AI startup unveiled \"Cowork & Plugins for the Enterprise,\" a package of AI tools that get Claude operating inside popular work applications, such as Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint. Instead of copying answers from a chatbot into spreadsheets or slide decks, users can now run Claude directly inside those applications, with the system carrying context between programs.\n\n\"Until now, enterprise AI has followed a persistent pattern: you go to the AI, get an answer, then go back to your actual tools to do the work,\" Anthropic wrote in its announcement on Tuesday. \"Now, Claude works inside the tools knowledge workers already use — Excel, PowerPoint, Slack — not as a separate window, but as part of how work actually gets done.\"\n\nThe launch signals Anthropic's clearest attempt yet to challenge Microsoft and OpenAI for control of the digital workplace in the era of AI.\n\nMicrosoft has embedded its own 365 Copilot tool across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams, while also offering Copilot Studio for enterprises to build custom AI agents. OpenAI, meanwhile, launched Frontier earlier this month, a platform built on its ChatGPT enterprise offerings. Google has integrated its Gemini AI throughout Gmail and its Workplace applications. Amazon also offers a similar service called Quick Suite.\n\nAnthropic is hoping to position itself as the default operational layer across enterprise workflows.\n\nAt the center of the launch are customizable \"plugins,\" or specialized AI agents configured for roles including financial analysis, design, operations, and HR.\n\nAnthropic said the plugins are open-source and portable, allowing companies to modify and deploy them without being locked into a single ecosystem. Several were co-developed with partners, including FactSet, S&P, and Slack.\n\nThe AI startup is also rolling out a slate of new connectors to platforms such as Google Drive, Gmail, and DocuSign, enabling Claude to access live enterprise data with administrative controls. Enterprises can create private plugin marketplaces and manage access at scale.\n\nAnthropic said customers, including L'Oréal, Deloitte, and Thomson Reuters, have already built specialized AI agents using Claude to automate workflows and accelerate internal processes.\n\nWith this launch, Anthropic is making clear that it no longer wants to be known primarily as a tool for developers. It wants Claude embedded across the enterprise, supporting finance teams, HR departments, analysts, and executives alike.\n\n\"In 2025, Claude Code transformed how software gets built,\" Anthropic said in Tuesday's announcement. \"In 2026, we're bringing that transformation to all knowledge work.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "A top statistician and markets commentator thinks more pain is coming from the AI-fueled wave of panic that's shaken the tech sector.\n\nNassim Taleb, the author of \"The Black Swan\" and an advisor at Universa Investments, said he believes the disruption will materially affect software firms and will \"definitely\" lead to bankruptcies in the space.\n\nMoreover, Taleb predicts that the gains among the market leaders of the last few years will be erased as the next crop of winners emerge.\n\n\"The previous rally we had was driven by a very small number of names. And now we'll probably have some broadening effects and redistribution, but a lot of the gains in the stock market are going to be eradicated by that,\" he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.\n\nThe AI scare trade has been in full focus lately as new AI products and updates pummel software stocks. The sell-off in recent weeks has also spilled over to sectors ike trucking, wealth management, and insurers.\n\nTaleb used a historical analogy to further illustrate his take on the tech sector, noting that pioneering companies are not necessarily the most successful in the long run. He cited the automotive and airline industries as examples, as well as the original PC makers.\n\n\"I'm sure someone's going to make a lot of money in both software and hardware related to AI, but [that] doesn't necessarily have to be these companies because you have a lot of instability,\" Taleb added.\n\nAs Black Swan events are, by definition, phenomena that no one sees coming, Taleb could not speculate on what the next one will be. However, that doesn't mean he believes the US market isn't facing major risk as AI disruption continues.\n\nTaleb said that while the market may be behaving as if extreme crashes are unlikely, this isn't the case, and investors shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security.\n\n\"I would say the tail risks across all sectors are underpriced,\" he said. \"So it's not the risk of drawdown in the stock market, it's a risk of large drawdown.\"",

    "fullText": "AI has gone from Wall Street's favorite trade to bearish catalyst in short order, but not everyone on Wall Street is convinced the panic is warranted.\n\nAfter a viral note from Citrini Research painting a grim picture of a future shaped by AI tanked the market on Monday, Jefferies analysts wrote on Tuesday that they see the ongoing sell-off as unjustified.\n\nInternet stocks have been among the hardest hit, with the S&P Internet Select Industry Index down more than 15% since the start of 2026. While sentiment is negative, Jefferies said that they see the tech subsector as insulated from the panic, and flagged six stocks in particular that are positioned to break out once Wall Street stops erupting in panic with every new AI update.\n\n\"We see two major obstacles to Internet disintermediation: (1) platforms would need to willingly provide the underlying service/ supply for the LLMs; (2) consumer behavior would need to change,\" they wrote.\n\nJefferies explained that they see AI as a potential tailwind for consumer internet stocks, with AI powering better recommendation engines, reduced customer service costs, and improved product velocity, but it will take time for Wall Street to see this perspective.\n\n\"We recommend owning names the market is likely to identify as possessing structural barriers to AI disintermediation, which are likely to outperform first once sentiment improves.\"\n\nHere are six stocks that Jefferies says fit this playbook and quotes from management the analysts say demonstrate the company's ability to weather disruption.\n\nAirbnb stock is down 7% this year.\n\nCEO Brian Chesky said during the company's most recent earnings call that integrating AI into the company's offerings will create a customer experience that is \"impossible to replicate.\"\n\n\"A chatbot can give you a list of homes, but it can't give you the unique ones you find on Airbnb. A chatbot doesn't have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can't message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do. It can't provide global payment processing, customer support, or insurance,\" he added.\n\nCarvana stock has lost 22% in 2026, but Jefferies sees a handful of signs it's in a good spot amid the AI-induced rotation.\n\nCEO Ernie Garcia III highlighted the financing, logistics, and reconditioning parts of the business as protected from AI in the near term.\n\n\"We think that competitively we're incredibly well positioned compared to the rest of our industry. And we think that our business itself is also positioned, to be an AI winner and not something that is disrupted by AI,\" Garcia said on Carvana's earnings call.\n\nDoorDash CEO Tony Xu says that DoorDash is well-positioned despite AI replacement worries.\n\nOn DoorDash's recent earnings call, the CEO said, \"I think DoorDash is really well-positioned because we're actually solving the end-to-end job for a customer, which is to get them some item brought to them in the condition they expect on time every time. That's actually really hard to do. You got to map the physical world, all of which — that information does not exist anywhere on the internet. That's data that DoorDash has to collect in a proprietary way...So the end-to-end job at the end of the day, I think is how customers will ultimately judge where they do their shopping.\"\n\nThe stock is down 28% year to date.\n\nDisney stock has declined more than 7% since the start of 2026.\n\nThe media giant recently announced a deal with OpenAI's Sora, which CEO Bob Iger says will allow the company to better curate short-form video for their streaming services.\n\nIger told investors, \"We view AI as having a number of obviously possible advantages or opportunities for the company. One is as a tool to help the creative process, so creativity. Another is productivity, which is simply being more efficient. And the third I'll call connectivity, which is creating basically a more intimate relationship with the consumer, enabling the consumer and enabling us with the consumer just to have a more engaged more effective relationship.\"\n\nJefferies analysts highlighted comments from Roku CEO Anthony Wood that outline his view that AI is \"very positive\" for the company.\n\n\"We view it as a powerful tailwind to our business. It's not a disruptor for us and we're integrating it across our entire technology stack. We're applying AI across our platform to improve discovery, increase engagement and unlock major new monetization opportunities,\" the CEO said.\n\nRoku stock has fallen 22% in 2026.\n\nSpotify stock is down 20% year to date.\n\nSpotify's co-CEO Gustav Söderström said, \"Significant disruption happens when new technologies enable new asymmetric business models. For example, this is what Spotify did to music downloads. This is what Uber did to taxi service. But the question everyone should be asking is does this evolution create new business models or are we mostly just seeing new technologies?\"\n\nThe executive added AI disruption fears for software are \"reasonable,\" but that the consumer space is better insulated since its business model relies on ads and subscriptions.",

Even some CEOs, such as Google's Sundar Pichai, have said that AI could replace them eventually.\n\n\"Are you concerned that they're going to show Dara AI to the board?\" Bartlett asked on the podcast, eliciting laughter from both men.\n\nWhile AI models can process large amounts of data, Khosrowshahi said that they still struggle to process and make choices based on new information — something that executives like him have to do.\n\n\"When the models can learn in real-time, that is the point at which I'm going to think that, yeah, we are all replaceable,\" he said.\n\nUber relies on AI for much of its business, including helping run its mainstay ride-hailing business. It's also expanding new use cases, such as its AI Solutions division, which pays independent contractors to train AI for clients.\n\nFor Uber's rank-and-file workers, AI could lead to more jobs. About 30% of Uber's coders, for example, are \"power users\" of AI, Khosrowshahi said.\n\nIf AI makes Uber's engineers each 25% more efficient, the CEO said he'd want \"to hire more engineers, because I want to go faster.\"\n\nAI could also limit head count, he added.\n\n\"I may not decide to add engineering headcount,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"At that point, instead of adding an engineer, I should add agents and buy some more GPUs from Nvidia.\"\n\nHave a tip?

Over the last month, the firm has continually rolled out new tools and highlighted capabilities for its AI chatbot, Claude, planting the seeds of a panic that's scrambled the hottest trade on Wall Street seemingly overnight.\n\nThe chaos, which began in early February, has sent the software sector into a deep bear market and hit adjacent areas as investors fret over how AI could disrupt businesses across a range of industries.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, a proxy for the damage AI panic has visited on the software sector in particular, is down 27% from its peak in early January.\n\nHere are the moments that how Anthropic and Claude have upended the stock market in a matter of weeks:\n\nWhat happened: The bloodbath began when Anthropic added new tools to its Claude Cowork AI agent, which could help users in the legal industry with tasks such as tracking compliance and managing legal documents.\n\nThe additions fueled fears that AI could easily eat up the market for many software-as-a-service companies that exist today, hammering firms with exposure to the legal and publishing sectors in particular.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF plummeted 11% in the four days after Anthropic unveiled its new suite of tools. Here were some of the other notable moves, ordered by losses in the same time frame:\n\nWhat happened: After a few instances of other companies making waves with AI announcements of their own—including a former karaoke machine company—Anthropic returned with another update that induced a new bout of selling.\n\nThe company unveiled a feature for Claude Code last Friday that scans software for security issues. The broader software sector declined, but cybersecurity stocks were hit particularly hard.\n\nMarket reaction: The reaction came at the start of this week, with cybersecurity stocks and ETFs tumbling in Monday's session and some names extending losses on Tuesday.\n\nHere are some of the other notable moves since February 20:\n\nWhat happened: Anthropic published a post highlighting Claude's ability to modernize code, potentially reducing the cost of many COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) systems used by companies today.\n\n\"Modernizing a COBOL system once required armies of consultants spending years mapping workflows,\" the firm wrote in a blog post on Monday. \"AI changes this.\"\n\nMarket reaction: IBM was the big loser. The stock recorded its worst losses in 26 years as the stock fell 13%.

    "fullText": "Detectives say tools supplied by Palantir were integral to convictions of a criminal gang that stole £800,000\n\nIt was fraud on a grand scale. The “Fuck the Police” criminal gang based in Luton and Romania stole £800,000 in more than 3,000 withdrawals from cash machines in dozens of locations throughout 2024.\n\nThe police investigation matched the crime in its complexity. When detectives in Bedfordshire seized the suspects’ two dozen smartphones, they were faced with a mountain of potential digital evidence – 1.4 terabytes of information, according to the authorities, connecting co-conspirators across eastern England and the Bacau region of Romania.\n\nAlongside human intelligence, forensics and the other mainstays of traditional policing, detectives increasingly face dauntingly vast reservoirs of digital information that could contain vital clues.\n\nThe data haul, which covered messages, geolocation positions, emails, notes and photographs, was equivalent to about 500,000 ebooks and would ordinarily take months, if not years, to comb through.\n\nIt was then that the detectives of the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit reached for new AI tools, supplied by the controversial US tech company Palantir, co-founded by the Trump-supporting billionaire Peter Thiel. Palantir has more than £500m in high-profile contracts with the NHS and the Ministry of Defence. But it is also providing AI investigation tools to 11 police forces, and the government last month pledged to invest more than £115m in the “rapid and responsible development, testing and rollout of AI tools” across all 43 forces in England and Wales, including creating Police.AI: a new national centre for AI in policing.\n\nIn the cashpoint case, the AI system – known as Nectar – unlocked the trove. It read and translated more than 100,000 messages, drew charts connecting suspects, analysed their movements, combed pictures and texts for suggestions of crimes and alerted detectives to potential leads. Human policing led to the arrests which then saw six men jailed in November, but without the AI, the detectives would still be digging through the evidence mountain now, the force said.\n\n“It’s not Robocop,” said Dan James, the programme manager at the unit. “It’s about how we can make our investigators more efficient.”\n\nBut the use of Palantir’s AI technology in policing has caused concern. Last year, documents showed the intention was to “assist with decision making” and “aid in the prevention, detection and investigation of crimes”. Data the AI system processed included political and religious opinions. Last week, Shockat Adam, the MP for Leicester South called on ministers to provide greater transparency about another Palantir contract with Leicestershire police, which he called “dystopian”. The Lib Dem MP Martin Wrigley called for UK AI companies to be encouraged to bid for police AI contracts and Liberty, the civil liberties campaign group, has called for the government to install “a system of strong guardrails” before police forces deploy more AI.\n\nFor Bedfordshire police, the most immediate benefit offered by its Palantir-enabled system in the cash point case was the translation of the phones’ contents from the suspects’ native Romanian.\n\n“We did 100,000 messages in a day,” said an official, requesting anonymity. “We would have been waiting weeks, if not months for that translation to be done.”\n\nHuman translation would have cost £30,000, and in the time taken to complete the translation, suspects in custody might have been bailed, released under investigation or absconded from the country, requiring re-arrests.\n\nThe AI system scanned texts for clues about other crimes and, in the cashpoint case, it identified about 120 potential offences. “If they’re talking about drugs, they’re talking about ATMs, if they’re talking about guns [the AI] highlights them,” they said.\n\nThe AI is trained to recognise images of cocaine and cannabis and reads all the texts and messages in a phone and tries to “understand them against UK law”. The technology is also able to help detectives put together a more accurate picture of suspects’ movements than would otherwise be possible, but the officials declined to elaborate on how this was done.\n\nThe system also creates live association charts – not dissimilar to photo pinboards familiar from TV dramas – that are constantly updated as new information arrives.\n\n“You’re able to click on [a person and see they are] linked to that person through this and it explains why,” said James. “It’s really efficient and it stays up to date.”\n\nAt present, the AI tools are only used for investigation and AI outputs are not used directly in prosecutions, although that is a goal that could be achieved in the future.\n\n“People could be lazy and people will get lazy,” said James. “So we need to make sure that … the AI’s suggestion is affirmed by a person.”\n\nThe force said Palantir does not hold or have access to any of its data and its AI tools cannot learn from it.",

    "fullText": "Facebook owner’s investment described by semiconductor company as ‘big bet’ on artificial intelligence\n\nThe owner of Facebook has agreed to buy $60bn (£44.5bn) of artificial intelligence chips from the US semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices despite fears over the vast sums being spent on the AI industry.\n\nMeta, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, has clinched the five-year deal in which it will also buy 10% of the chip company.\n\nAMD signed a similar pact with OpenAI last year, which was hailed as a vote of confidence in its chips and software, significantly boosting its stock price.\n\nA recent series of chip supply agreements underscores the AI industry’s appetite for processors. Meta has separately struck a deal with AMD’s larger rival Nvidia to buy millions of AI chips.\n\nAMD would supply 6GW worth of chips to Meta, starting with 1GW of the company’s forthcoming MI450 hardware in the second half of this year, said AMD’s chief executive, Lisa Su.\n\nIn addition to AMD’s flagship graphics chips (GPUs), Meta also plans to buy central processors (CPUs), including a variant that will be customised for the social media platform’s needs.\n\nThe custom CPU would be tuned to deliver powerful performance while keeping energy consumption as low as possible, Su said. The deal will include two generations of AMD’s CPUs.\n\n“So no question Mark is very, very ambitious in what he wants to accomplish, and we want to use every aspect of our technology to really help Meta to accomplish that,” Su said, referring to Meta’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. “Meta is making a big bet on AMD.”\n\nMeta contributed to the MI450 design, which is optimised for a computing process known as inference – when a chatbot such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT responds to a user’s queries.\n\nIndustry analysts expect the market for inference hardware to dwarf the size of the market for the equipment needed to train large AI models.\n\nMeta planned to continue to buy chips from other vendors and develop its in-house processors at the same time, said Santosh Janardhan, the company’s infrastructure head. Meta has been in discussions with Google about using the company’s tensor processors (TPUs) for AI work, Reuters reported.\n\nThe scale at which Meta was building datacentres and infrastructure required multiple chip vendors and approaches, Janardhan said.\n\n“All of the chipmakers end up having sort of a seat at the table,” Janardhan added.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: NCA’s Alex Murray says he hopes new £115m police AI centre can limit unfairness found in tools\n\n‘It’s not Robocop’: UK police embrace AI ‘efficiency’ in complex investigations\n\nA police chief has admitted artificial intelligence used to boost crime fighting will contain bias but pledged to combat the risks.\n\nLabour wants a dramatic expansion of police use of AI within England and Wales, with police chiefs also believing it could help keep law enforcement up to date with new criminal threats.\n\nAlex Murray told the Guardian that a new national police AI centre would recognise the risks of bias and minimise them.\n\nBias in use of AI in policing could result in instances where algorithms – often trained on historical data reflecting past human prejudices – systematically produce unfair outcomes, such as overtargeting minority communities or misidentifying individuals based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\n\nMurray, the director of threat leadership with the National Crime Agency, and the national lead for AI, said: “Once you’ve recognised and minimised [bias], how do you train officers to deal with outputs to ensure that it is further minimised?\n\n“If you talk about live facial recognition or predictive policing, there will be bias, and you need to get in the data scientists and the data engineers to clean the data, to train the model appropriately, and then to test it.\n\n“There is no point releasing something to policing that has bias in it that’s not recognised, and everything should be done to minimise it to a level where it can be understood and mitigated.”\n\nExamples of bias have already surfaced in the police use of retrospective facial recognition, which is powered by AI. That is where a suspect is compared with a database of images after a crime.\n\nLive facial recognition, which is more controversial and is used less by policing, hunts for suspects in real time, and also contains bias. A report in December found that a retrospective facial recognition system used by police had been used with inadequate safeguards.\n\nThe Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), which oversees local forces in England and Wales, said: “System failures have been known for some time, yet these were not shared with those communities affected, nor with leading sector stakeholders.”\n\nThe APCC forensic science lead, Darryl Preston, who is the police and crime commissioner for Cambridgeshire, said: “The discovery of an in-built bias in the police national database’s retrospective facial recognition system, even if only in limited circumstances, demonstrates the need for independent oversight of these powerful tools.\n\n“It is not acceptable for technology to be used unless and until it has been thoroughly tested to eliminate bias. That clearly was not the case in this instance.”\n\nThe new national AI centre, costing £115m, would aim to reduce bias, said Murray, as well as assessing and deciding what products from private suppliers work. Currently each of the forces across the UK makes its own decisions, which is seen as slow and wasteful.\n\nMurray said police were in an “arms race” with criminals who were using the technology: “Anyone with imagination can use AI.”\n\nIn one case a paedophile claimed images showing him involved in the abuse of children was a deepfake, which police then had to disprove to get him convicted.\n\nMurray said the benefits of AI were far beyond the “cliche around Minority Report and predictive policing”.\n\nHe added that across a range of crimes and challenges facing policing, AI ranged from being a help to a gamechanger, but a human police officer will have to make the final decisions about what to do about the results AI produces.\n\nHe said it could help police deal with political agitators who infect social media with fake images to try to trigger violence on the streets.\n\nIn time, Murray said, it could help with manhunts, or speed up searches for cars linked to suspects and save the hundreds of hours it takes for detectives to trawl through extensive CCTV footage, or speed up the search of seized digital devices from suspects in the hunt for incriminating evidence.\n\n“What took days, weeks, sometimes months can potentially take hours,” he said.\n\nIn one recent case, four Luton-based suspects were arrested for attacks on – and thefts from – cashpoints. Police downloaded the data from the suspects’ phones and, thanks to AI, secured guilty pleas within weeks.\n\nThe data was in Romanian and AI scoured through it, translated it, identified the material relating to potential crimes, identified the offences and presented it all in a package for detectives.\n\nTrevor Rodenhurst, chief constable of the Bedfordshire force, told the Guardian: “This allowed us to draw evidence from lots of devices with a vast quantity of data, which we would otherwise not have been able to do.”\n\nRodenhurst said that as officers use AI and see its benefits, it is changing the view of the frontline: “They are no longer suspicious, they are asking when they can have it. That capability is transformative.”",

    "fullText": "Anthropic says three Chinese firms used ‘distillation’ technique to extract information from its Claude chatbot\n\nUS artificial intelligence company Anthropic said on Monday it had uncovered campaigns by three Chinese AI firms to illicitly extract capabilities from its Claude chatbot, in what it described as industrial-scale intellectual property theft. OpenAI leveled similar charges last month.\n\nAnthropic said DeepSeek, Moonshot AI and MiniMax used a technique known as “distillation” – using outputs from a more powerful AI system to rapidly boost the performance of a less capable one.\n\n“These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,” the company said in a statement. “The window to act is narrow.”\n\nDistillation is a common practice within AI development, often used by companies to create cheaper, smaller versions of their own models.\n\nThe practice grabbed headlines a year ago when the release of a low-cost generative AI model from DeepSeek performed at a similar level to ChatGPT and other top American chatbots, upending assumptions of US dominance in the sensitive sector.\n\nAnthropic said the companies achieved their ends through approximately 16m exchanges with its Claude model and 24,000 fake accounts.\n\nThese allowed the three labs to siphon off capabilities they had not independently developed at a fraction of the cost – and in so doing circumvented export controls on powerful US technology intended to preserve American dominance in AI.\n\nThe company argued the practice posed national security risks, saying models built through illicit distillation are unlikely to retain safety guardrails designed to prevent misuse – such as restrictions on helping develop bioweapons or enabling cyberattacks.\n\nAnthropic’s arch-rival OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, made similar accusations to US lawmakers earlier this month, saying Chinese companies were using the technique amid “ongoing efforts to free-ride on the capabilities developed by OpenAI and other US frontier labs”.\n\nAnthropic said MiniMax ran the largest operation, generating more than 13m exchanges. Each campaign concentrated heavily on coding, agentic reasoning and tool use – areas where Claude is considered a leader.\n\nTo circumvent Anthropic’s ban on commercial access from China, the labs allegedly routed traffic through proxy services that managed the vast networks of fraudulent accounts.\n\nAnthropic called for coordinated industry and government responses to address what it said no single company could tackle alone.",

Several years ago some of its creators were absolutely roasted on camera by one of the genuine legends of Japanese animation.\n\nBack in 2016, Hayao Miyazaki, the director of movies such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, was shown new technology that used AI in order to animate models. Faced with a zombie that utilised its head to move by knocking its skull against the ground and wriggling its body like a fish, Miyazaki declared what he had seen was “an insult to life itself”. It’s hard not to watch the clip without feeling slightly seared – but now, a decade later, the ashen-faced developers from that room have sufficiently recovered to make their work widely available.\n\nJudging by the chatter surrounding the launch, at least some of the people downloading Anlife are doing so in the hope that it might provide some kind of indication of the current state video games’ relationship with AI. Putting aside the often broad use of that term, this is certainly a thing that’s worth trying to understand, whether it’s because of the job losses caused by AI or blamed on AI, or the sheer number of games made with the assistance of AI models now landing on storefronts such as Steam.\n\nThere’s a problem here, though. And it’s that Anlife itself is such a cheerfully inconsequential thing that it’s hard to read too much of anything into it.\n\nAnlife promises players an evolution simulator where “AI-driven block creatures move in unexpected ways.” What this comes down to for the most part involves placing a range of different creatures into a small environment and then watching as they learn to get around.\n\nVisually Anlife is pure Frutiger Aero, offering landscapes of green valleys and sparkling water that could be the kind of soothing images MRI technicians sometimes encourage you to look at during a lengthy scan. Sonically it’s equally inoffensive: with a range of bloops, bleeps and popping sounds, we’re pitched right into the soundtrack of a million 00s day spas.\n\nThis desire to soothe permeates to the level of mechanics, too. Over the course of an idle morning with Anlife you can place a range of simple creatures in the environment and then give them food that will encourage them to breed or mutate. You can expand your territory and then lure creatures towards water or up into the air in order to create more variations. There are plenty of things to unlock (including a shadow tech tree that has you covered if you want to annihilate your digital sea monkeys rather than watching them flourish) but the ecosystem is kept simple. It’s a game about watching how things decide to crawl towards food.\n\nThe thrill of all of this presumably comes down to the “how” in that last sentence. This is where the game’s slightly mysterious use of AI is probably involved. And it’s true that, after a few hours of play, you’ll have Anlife’s funny little blob creatures exploring new kinds of joints and body arrangements as they swim and fly and generally roll around eating.\n\n(AI has a history of being used to make creatures walk around, incidentally, often using small neural networks and computer evolution. In 2009, the UK-based games technology company NaturalMotion developed a project in which a bipedal model learned to walk using evolved neural networks. The company was subsequently bought by Zynga in 2014.\n\nThere are two problems, however, the first being that the focus on unlocking the skill tree gives the opening hours of Anlife the feel of a rather mindless clicker game that it struggles to shake off. The second comes down to something that I gather people studying procedural generation sometimes refer to as “the oatmeal problem”.\n\nThe oatmeal problem, which was first formulated by writer, developer and academic Kate Compton, hinges on the fact that every single bowl of oatmeal in the universe is unique. Just not in a very interesting way. Similarly, when Anlife’s creatures discover a new way of rolling or bouncing or flapping their bodies towards food, they’re still just moving towards food. It makes for a game that’s either about really, really paying attention to tiny variations in detailing, or about completely zoning out and just enjoying the floaty aesthetic. Over the course of my time with Anlife, I’ve generally started with the first approach and then discovered, after 10 minutes, that I’ve slid into the second.\n\nThe more I played Anlife, the more I ended up thinking about something I heard from one of the first AI researchers I ever spoke to, all the way back in 2013. The real value of AI, they explained – and I am paraphrasing here – is that it could one day become a completely alien form of intelligence. Which means that us humans would have the lens of a different kind of mind through which to see ourselves and our quirks and cognitive fallacies – things that can be hard to spot when you’re talking to people who think in a very similar way to you.\n\nSince then the apparent focus for a lot of companies such as OpenAI seems to be completely the opposite: creating mimetic plagiarism machines that sometimes seem to exist only to tell people what they already want to hear.\n\nIt feels as if Anlife is filling a very small and specific niche. It isn’t trying to disguise its AI use, as far as I am aware. It’s actually trying to draw attention to the way it uses AI to allow its little creatures to move around. It’s not just a game born of AI, in other words. It’s a game that in some small way is actually about AI. It wants to be slightly alien. It doesn’t want to hide itself or ingratiate; it wants to examine AI’s innate capacity for otherness.",

    "fullText": "When the most profound human emotion becomes an automated transaction in an online shop, the techlords have won\n\nThe Guardian reported on the arrival of “Fate” and, friends, I laughed. Or maybe I cried.\n\nIt’s apparently the first “agentic AI dating app”. An AI personality named “Fate” interviews users, runs data matches on their hopes and dreams, then suggests five potential matches based on the hard data of observable complementary language patterning, “No swiping involved!”.\n\nIt has been followed by similar AI-based matching platforms Sitch and Keeper in the US. In the platform variations, you can detail preference data down to hair colour, you can be coached in how to approach your date by the animated electronic voice of a dataset, and you can weep for the end of human connection and the loveless wasteland of consumer narcissism we have built for ourselves. When the most profound and transformative of human emotions is an automated transaction in an online shop, the techlords have won.\n\nIn the depths of my growing neo-Luddite despair I am obliged to admit that in what is now a common-denominator story, consumers did not actually demand this.\n\nWhat people wanted from AI in dating apps has been superseded by what some data-hungry, rich-dork megacorp thinks that they should need. Studies in Europe showed users just wanted AI tools to “weed out fake profiles and flag toxic users”.\n\nYou know, how writers just wanted contextual proofing tools from AI but and got machines insisting on the superiority of rewritten, flattened text. Or how academics just wanted a tool to index their references and got hallucinations that invented a few sources that didn’t actually exist, but the machine thought maybe should.\n\nInsert your own industry experience here, and all of us in sad recognition that the forced AI-ification of everyday life continues with a robotic efficiency that, dear Christ, is outsourcing the messy human weirdness that made us fascinating and exotic to one another – and sexy and wonderful.\n\nWe’re clearly adopting the universal deadening of human experience because, as the Guardian piece reveals, people are using these new apps – in love, in work and in an educational setting that ensures students learn how to prompt and little else.\n\nI conjecture humanity just can’t handle the mess or wonder of ourselves any more and, as is habit, the internet is to blame.\n\nThe problem with AI as a romantic channel used to be the risk of falling in love with the mirror-machine. With a few personalised prompts you could create a fantasy soulmate that flattered your vanities and ignored your faults as it spoke back to you and you wanked. It was just like a real relationship but without the obliged mutual self-reflection that encourages intimacy and growth.\n\nIt was only a few minutes ago that we thought encouraging this was destructive digital narcissism. Now I keep wondering if there’s a human self-survival instinct in it after all, given what our self-subscription to the mass digital surveillance state is doing to us socially.\n\nIt wasn’t long ago that social media introduced us to the concept of digitised network oversharing. From the video of the dude who wondered what it would be like to pash his sister (no, I will not share it) to the health of novelist Joyce Carol Oates’ feet (no, again), we all seemed to be learning way too much about one another.\n\nNow, from an abundance of caution, we know less. As every stray, 10-year-old tweet can be weaponised, so it seems many are retracting to a new paranoia when it comes to self-revelation. Well may we say “publish and be damned” but you can’t impose privacy controls on your ex.\n\nI’ve written before about this new undersharing. Today it’s disquieting to feel nostalgia for the pre-Fate era privacy appeal of digital Heathcliffs and text-based waifus who were only ever going to share your most intimate secrets with the, um, billionaires who own them rather than consolidate a dataset to manifest them into your life.\n\nBut whether you choose to love the robot or prompt the robot to do the loving for you, the Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan predicted these unnatural transhuman intimacies more than half a century ago in Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. He warned back in 1964 that interactive media would take a lease of “our eyes and ears and nerves” and I think about it all the time.\n\nMcLuhan’s work was the inspiration for David Cronenberg’s 1983 body-horror, Videodrome. Given that a study from Italian researchers has proved that if you’re still dipping into the ideological pissoir known as X, you are wilfully brainwashing yourself with hard-right piss, on the Videodrome scale of remaining in objective reality to believing you are being blown by a television, it’s fair to say that the remote control is in our hand and the TV has entered the chat.\n\nCan we put it down? Perhaps not without the help of intervention by the law, given arguments made in a landmark case before a jury in Los Angeles, in which plaintiffs insist that social media platforms are “defective products engineered to exploit vulnerabilities in young people’s brains”, as reported by NPR.\n\nThe outcome may indeed compel governments to pursue further the platform regulation that has inspired social media bans for children in Australia, Malaysia and elsewhere.\n\nDo we have to wait until “AI-rranged marriage” becomes a thing before governments realise we’re running out of time?\n\nRoll over, humanity. Fate is here.",

    "fullText": "While software stocks get hammered over fears that AI startups will eat their lunch, an Anthropic executive says the sell-off shows how fast AI has advanced.\n\nAnthropic's head of applied AI, Cat de Jong, oversees a team focused on helping large companies weave Anthropic's AI into their products. At a press briefing with Thomson Reuters on Monday, she said that people inside Anthropic have seen the market sell-off as rational due to the pace of progress.\n\n\"The rate of change is just so incredible, and I think the market is really starting to see this now,\" she said.\n\n\"We're grappling with exponentials, and it's something that humans just aren't really used to having to deal with — how quickly things change. And I think that's actually been why the market has been responding the way that it has been, for us internally.\"\n\nThat said, the sell-off does not account for how Anthropic's work with software companies helps improve their products rather than compete directly with them, de Jong said.\n\n\"We want to build the best models in the world,\" de Jong said. \"But I do really think there's a great relationship between general models and domain-specific applications, and our models help them get better.\"\n\nThe sell-off in software stocks began after Anthropic launched new plugins for legal and other knowledge work traditionally dominated by software companies.\n\nThomson Reuters has been using Anthropic's AI to power some of its latest legal tools. It may have seemed an odd coupling given that Thomson Reuters is one of the highest-profile casualties of the software sell-off, with its stock falling over 30% in the past month, while Anthropic just announced this month it raised $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation — over 10 times Thomson Reuters' market cap.\n\nAt the conference, Thomson Reuters executives were bullish about working with Anthropic and touted closely collaborating with the AI startup to build a \"deep research\" feature inside its legal product, CoCounsel, which generates detailed citation-backed reports.\n\nThe two companies will each create sophisticated AI products that excel at different tasks, said Thomson Reuters' chief product officer, David Wong.\n\nThe idea that AI is winner-takes-all is misplaced, he said.\n\n\"There's so many problems that professionals need help with,\" Wong said.",

Letter's software unites these systems into a single \"command center,\" Akhtar said, displacing other tools and enabling sellers to spend more time interacting with customers.\n\nAlongside announcing the Battery Ventures-led Series B, the company is also rolling out Letter Compass, a new product that provides personalized, deal-specific guidance during sales, including coaching tailored to a specific employee or opportunity and suggestions for messaging and next steps.\n\nAkhtar said Battery approached him and cofounder Armen Forget, the CTO, about funding. He attributed the quick succession of rounds to \"phenomenal traction\" and retention. Y Combinator, Lightbank, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, and Stage 2 Capital also participated in the Series B alongside existing investors.\n\nLetter counts customers across 30 countries, including Lenovo, Adobe, Novo Nordisk, and Plaid. It will use the funding to expand product development and grow the team globally — which counts 25 employees — across sales, engineering, and customer success, Akhtar said.\n\nLetter is growing in a crowded field, as stalwarts like Salesforce increasingly incorporate AI features and sales AI startups emerge. Gong analyzes sales interactions, for instance, while Seismic and Highspot, which help train salespeople, have announced plans to merge.\n\nHere's a look at the pitch deck Letter AI used to raise its $40 million Series B.

    "fullText": "AI has thrown a wrench into various pockets of the stock market this year. An investment chief says it also has the potential to cause problems in the debt market.\n\nOver the last few weeks, AI updates from Anthropic and other firms have threatened business models in numerous industries, but perhaps none more than software. Publicly traded software firms have seen their share prices decline sharply, and private companies have delayed IPOs after seeing valuations fall.\n\nThe rout has created concerns that some firms won't be able to service their debt. Shares of Blue Owl Capital, a private credit firm, are the latest flashpoint for these fears. Its stock is down 32% year to date and has dropped more than 16% over the last week alone after it halted withdrawals from a private debt fund.\n\n\"The concern is there's a lot of lax underwriting that has been taking place, particularly in the software community,\" said Ben McMillan, the chief investment officer at IDX Advisors.\n\n\"They haven't gone to the public markets to get bonds because they probably wouldn't have gotten them,\" he continued. \"So they've been going to the private market getting loans, and now with the AI SAAS apocalypse, and just general concerns about AI profitability, that's starting to reprice.\"\n\nIn the private credit space, leveraged loans get packaged into collateralized loan obligations and sold to investors. While rising risks in the debt market might not directly affect retail investors, they could start to hurt pension funds and endowments with exposure to CLOs and private credit, McMillan said, as they tend to be more reliant on fixed income.\n\nFor now, there's little risk of contagion in the broader economy, he said.\n\n\"This is not a contagion high-yield bond issue,\" McMillan said. \"In fact, if anything, quality high yield, given the soft landing narrative increasing, is doing very well, actually.\"\n\n\"For the everyday investor, this probably isn't something I'd stay up at night worrying about,\" he continued. \"A lot of these institutional investors that loaded up the boat on private credit, they're gonna have their reckoning.\"\n\nPrivate credit has generated a lot of headlines in recent years amid its rapid growth, as well as a push to make the asset class more accessible to everyday investors. While risks in the space are being flagged more often, anxiety in private credit has been at a fever pitch lately. Former PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian drew parallels between Blue Owl's move to halt redemptions on one of its funds to the start of the financial crisis, when BNP Paribas froze withdrawals for some investment vehicles.\n\n\"I think that's kind of the canary in the coal mine now,\" McMillan said. \"It's like, all right, the private credit apocalypse might actually be here.\"",

    "description": "The economics of COBOL modernization have shifted. AI makes the economics work by automating what used to require armies of consultants.",
    "fullText": "Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation.\n\nCOBOL is everywhere. It handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US. Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government.\n\nDespite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year.\n\nThe developers who built these systems retired years ago, and the institutional knowledge they carried left with them. Production code has been modified repeatedly over decades, but the documentation hasn't kept up. Meanwhile, we aren't exactly minting replacements—COBOL is taught at only a handful of universities, and finding engineers who can read it gets harder every quarter.\n\nGiven these roadblocks, how can organizations modernize their systems without losing the reliability, availability, and data they’ve accumulated over decades? And without breaking anything?\n\nCOBOL modernization differs fundamentally from typical legacy code refactoring. You aren’t just updating familiar code to use better patterns, you’re reverse engineering business logic from systems built when Nixon was president. You’re untangling dependencies that evolved over decades, and translating institutional knowledge that now exists only in the code itself.\n\nModernizing a COBOL system once required armies of consultants spending years mapping workflows. This resulted in large timelines and high costs that few were willing to take on.\n\nTools like Claude Code can automate the exploration and analysis phases that consume most of the effort in COBOL modernization. These tools can:\n\nWith AI, teams can modernize their COBOL codebase in quarters instead of years.\n\nAI excels at streamlining the tasks that once made COBOL modernization cost-prohibitive. With it, your team can focus on strategy, risk assessment, and business logic while AI automates the code analysis and implementation.\n\nAI starts by reading your entire COBOL codebase and mapping the structure.\n\nIt identifies program entry points, traces execution paths through called subroutines, maps data flows between modules, and documents dependencies that span hundreds of files.\n\nThis kind of mapping goes beyond simple call graphs. Shared data structures, file operations that create coupling between modules, initialization sequences that affect runtime behavior—these implicit dependencies don't show up in static analysis because they involve data shared through files, databases, or global state. They're also exactly what makes COBOL modernization risky, which is why automated discovery matters: it finds these hidden relationships before they cause problems during migration.\n\nWorkflow documentation also emerges out of this analysis.\n\nWith the codebase mapped, AI can assess which components are safe to move and which need careful handling. Modules with high coupling can be more risky to modernize. Isolated components surface as candidates for early, independent modernization. Duplicated logic points to refactoring opportunities. Areas with accumulated technical debt get documented before they become migration surprises.\n\nThis is where human judgment becomes essential. Your COBOL engineers bring the understanding of regulatory requirements, business priorities, operational constraints, and risk tolerance that AI cannot.\n\nThe planning phase develops a detailed roadmap that sequences modernization work strategically:\n\nCode testing and validation are also defined before any code changes:\n\nExecution happens one component at a time, with validation at each step. AI translates COBOL logic into modern languages, creates API wrappers around legacy components that stay in place, and builds the scaffolding to run old and new code side by side during transition.\n\nEach step either succeeds and gets validated, or fails and gets corrected while the scope is small.\n\nYou never have massive changes in flight where failure means rolling back weeks of work. As your team sees modernized components passing tests, they gain confidence to tackle progressively more complex parts of the system.\n\nThe approach outlined above works for COBOL systems of any size.\n\nTools like Claude Code can automate much of the exploration and analysis work described, giving your team the comprehensive understanding they need to plan and execute migrations confidently.\n\nStart with a single component or workflow that has clear boundaries and moderate complexity. Use AI to analyze and document it thoroughly, plan the modernization with your engineers, implement incrementally with testing at each step, and validate carefully.  This will build organizational confidence and surface adjustments needed for your systems.\n\nThe economics of COBOL modernization have shifted. AI makes the economics work by automating what used to require armies of consultants, freeing your engineers to make the migration decisions that require their domain expertise.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide, see the Code Modernization Playbook.\n\nProduct updates, how-tos, community spotlights, and more.

    "fullText": "Every AI founder I talk to is on an accelerating treadmill, burdened by a nagging suspicion that the entire industry is moving too fast in a direction that doesn't quite make sense, with no idea about how to get off.\n\nThere is an overwhelming feeling that if everyone stopped and thought about it for five minutes, they'd build something completely different; but it's paired with a total inability to articulate why they specifically haven't stopped.\n\nNobody stops, because nobody can afford to, and that feeling has a name. It's called Moloch, and it's the most important thing happening in AI that isn't on your roadmap.\n\nA new model drops. It's better at benchmarks. Every AI product company now has to integrate it (if they're a wrapper) or match it (if they're building a model) or explain to their investors why they didn't. Integration // parity takes engineering time, time that doesn't go toward the actual product differentiation that would create long-term value. But the company that doesn't integrate looks like it's falling behind, and looking like you're falling behind is fatal when your entire valuation rests on the assumption that you're on the frontier.\n\nEveryone catches up, everyone shifts resources, everyone ships the update. The net competitive position of every company is exactly where it was before, except they all engineering time on esoteria and none of them made their end-product meaningfully better for end-users.\n\nIt happens every few weeks now.\n\nThis is Moloch; and it'scoordination failure as competition. Every company makes an individually rational decision (keep up with the frontier or die) and the aggregate outcome is an industry that's moving incredibly fast in the direction of model capability, and barely at all in the direction of product value.\n\nThe race is real // the destination is fake.\n\nEvery AI product is converging on the same interface: a chat box. Maybe a chat box with some tool use. Maybe a chat box with some RAG. But at bottom, a text input and a text output, differentiated by branding and minor UX choices and which model is running underneath.\n\nThe chat box won because it ships fast, and Moloch rewards speed over design.\n\nBuilding a novel interaction paradigm takes months or years of research, iteration, user testing. During those months, fifteen competitors will ship chat-box wrappers with the latest model and capture the market's attention. Your investors will get nervous. Your board will suggest you \"ship something\" while you figure out the long-term vision. You'll ship the chat box. The long-term vision will die in a Notion doc nobody opens.\n\nEvery company faces this exact choice and picks the same outcome. The competitive structure selects against creativity. The companies that take time to build something new get outrun by the companies that ship the obvious thing fast. And the obvious thing is always the same thing, because the obvious thing is, by definition, the thing that doesn't need original thinking.\n\nMoloch doesn't want you to build something good.\n\nMoloch wants you to build something now.\n\nThe competitive dynamic is bad enough at the product level. At the fundraising level, it's catastrophic.\n\nAI companies are raising at valuations that require them to grow at rates that are only achievable by chasing the broadest possible market with the most generic possible product. A company that raises at a $500M valuation needs to show a path to billions in revenue, which means it can't afford to be a niche tool that does one thing brilliantly for a specific audience. It has to be a platform, horizontal, aimed at enterprise, built for no one in particular.\n\nEvery AI company is building the same enterprise platform with the same features targeting the same buyers, because the fundraising math requires it, because the valuation requires it, because the competitive environment requires raising at that valuation to attract talent, because the talent market requires it.\n\nNobody in this chain chose this outcome. Every individual decision was rational. The aggregate result is an industry producing fifty identical products, none of which solve any specific problem particularly well, all of which are locked in a feature war that generates zero cumulative value.\n\nThe companies that would build something different (smaller, more focused, more opinionated) can't raise the capital to compete. The companies that raise the capital are structurally forced into sameness. Moloch eats the variance, and variance is where all the actual value lives.\n\nTop AI researchers and engineers go to the companies that are on the frontier. The frontier is defined by model capability benchmarks. So companies invest disproportionately in model capabilty, because that's how you attract talent, even when the marginal return on model capability for their specific product is near zero.\n\nYour users don't need GPT-5 when they can barely use GPT-4 effectively. They need better UX and better integration into how they actually work. But the engineer who could build that wants to work on the model, because model work is what gets you your next job, because the next company is also optimizing for model capability, because they need to attract talent too.\n\nEvery company overspends on model capability and underspends on product quality. The structure forces it. The talent market punishes you for having the right priorities.\n\nThe startup advice I've heard for a decade+ is \"Ignore the noise. Focus on users. Build something good.\"\n\nCorrect in theory, nearly impossible in practice, because Moloch specifically punishes this strategy in the medium term.\n\nBuilding something good takes time, and time means you're not shipping. Not shipping means you look like you're losing, which means talent leaves and investors get nervous, and your competitors (who are shipping fast and bad) capture market position that's expensive to reclaim.\n\nThe window in which \"build something good\" pays off is long, two years, three years, maybe more. The window in which Moloch punishes you for it is immediate and continuous. Most companies don't survive the medium term to reach teh long term.\n\nThe founders who know this stay up at night.\n\nThey can probably see the right thing to build.\n\nThey can't survive building it.\n\nYou can't outrun Moloch. You can only build a structure it can't reach.\n\nIn practice, this means: don't raise more than you need. Don't hire faster than your product vision can absorb. Don't compete on the frontier unless the frontier is where your users live. Find a niche that's too small for the Moloch-captured companies to notice and go so deep into it that by the time they arrive, your product is years ahead in the dimension that matters to those users.\n\nBe small enough that the competitve pressure doesn't distort your priorities. Be opinionated enough that you can't be dragged into building the same thing as everyone else. Be capitally efficient enough that you don't need the growth rate that forces you onto the treadmill. Be weird enough that nobody can copy you without becoming you.",

    "fullText": "The coauthor of an AI research paper is speaking out after his work triggered a global stock sell-off.\n\nCitrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, alongside Alap Shah, CEO of Littlebird.ai, theorized a future where, instead of transforming the economy in a positive way, the AI boom erases white-collar jobs and severely reduces the spending power of those workers, and eventually stunts economic growth.\n\nOn Monday, Shah told \"TBPN\" podcast hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays that despite how well it seems to be going for blue-collar jobs at the moment in terms of growth and the lack of mass layoffs, these jobs won't be safe if white collar jobs go away because ultimately, there is only \"one labor market.\"\n\n\"Let's say in our scenario, we talk about 5% of folks might get fired in a couple of years,\" said Shah. \"Those 5%, if there aren't white collar jobs for them to relocate into, then they're going to have to move into the gig economy and the blue collar labor force.\"\n\n\"And so that puts pressure on the entire labor market, not just the white collar one,\" Shah added.\n\nShah and Citrini published a report on Sunday, written from a futuristic point of view set in 2028, that predicts a negative domino scenario triggered by the AI boom. The research theorizes that AI will kick off a mass white-collar layoff too quickly, which will then deal a blow to the metro housing and mortgage market, and eventually lead to a global stock sell-off and a widespread recession in all sectors. In this scenario, the paper said, AI growth could also lose momentum due to a lack of funding.\n\n\"The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth,\" the paper theorizes. \"The November 2027 crash only served to accelerate all of the negative feedback loops already in place.\"\n\nShah elaborated on these concerns on \"TBPN.\" When asked what he thinks of the current growth in the health and education sectors, Shah said most of it could be spurred by government spending, which would go away if personal income declines.\n\n\"Those sectors continue to grow because government spending grows,\" said Shah. \"But again, gets very circular if government spending is coming primarily from taxes and primarily payroll taxes because the average worker pays a lot",

This is a s--t-or-get-off-the-pot-meeting.”\n\nAmodei, who’s often warned of AI’s potential for misuse, has consistently pushed to frame his firm as a safety-conscious leader in the sector.\n\nHe has so far resisted pressure from Hegseth to remove safeguards on the Pentagon’s Claude-enabled programs unless the department agrees to wall off mass surveillance of citizens and research into weapons capable of firing without a human operator.\n\nTheir feud is understood to have escalated amid reports that Claude was used by the Pentagon in the Trump administration’s lightning invasion of Venezuela earlier in January.\n\nCritics decried that mission—which secured the capture of President Nicolas Maduro, who now faces narcoterrorism charges in New York federal court—as an all-out assault on the rules-based international order.\n\nAnthropic told Axios that “we are having productive conversations, in good faith,” with the Pentagon.\n\nDefense officials instead say “negotiations have shown no progress,” and are now “on the verge of breaking down.”\n\nEarlier this month, Hegseth warned he would consider certifying Anthropic as a “supply chain risk” if it did not yield to his demands.\n\nOfficials said that at the Tuesday meeting, the secretary now plans on issuing Amodei with an “ultimatum.”\n\n“The problem with Dario is, with him, it’s ideological,” one senior Defense Department source said. “We know who we’re dealing with.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the Defense Department and Anthropic for comment on this story.",

    "description": ": Watchdogs warn models that can generate realistic images of people must comply with data protection laws",
    "fullText": "A global coalition of privacy watchdogs has fired a warning shot at the generative AI industry, saying companies churning out realistic synthetic images can't pretend that data protection rules don't apply.\n\nThe joint statement [PDF] signed by more than 60 regulators, including the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), boils down to a simple point: if your model can convincingly fake a person, you don't get to pretend data protection law doesn't exist.\n\n\"Recent developments – particularly AI image and video generation integrated into widely accessible social media platforms – have enabled the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery, defamatory depictions, and other harmful content featuring real individuals,\" said the signatories. \"We are especially concerned about potential harms to children and other vulnerable groups, such as cyberbullying and/or exploitation.\"\n\nThe warning lands weeks after the ICO and DPC opened formal probes into Elon Musk's xAI following reports that its Grok chatbot produced sexual images of real people without their consent.\n\nThe group says organizations dabbling in generative AI need to build safeguards from the start and think carefully about risks such as non-consensual imagery, misuse of someone's likeness, and potential harms to children – all areas where the tech has raced ahead of social norms and, in some cases, common sense.\n\nThe regulators stress that the law already covers this, and that firms don't get a free pass just because the content came from a machine.\n\nWilliam Malcolm, executive director of Regulatory Risk & Innovation at the ICO, said: \"People should be able to benefit from AI without fearing that their identity, dignity or safety are under threat. AI already plays a large role in all our lives, and everybody has a right to expect that AI systems handling their personal data will do so with respect. Responsible innovation means putting people first: anticipating the risks and building in meaningful safeguards to ensure autonomy, transparency, and control.\n\n\"Public trust is foundational to the successful adoption and use of AI. Joint regulatory initiatives like this show global commitment to high standards of data protection in AI systems and help provide regulatory certainty. We expect those developing and deploying AI to act responsibly. Where we find that obligations have not been met, we will take action to protect the public.\"\n\nThe joint statement on AI-generated imagery suggests that if companies want to keep pushing ever more realistic AI into everyday products, they should expect regulators to keep asking awkward questions about how it all works. ®",

    "title": "Meta AI alignment director shares her OpenClaw email-deletion nightmare: 'I had to RUN to my Mac mini'",
    "description": "Meta alignment director Summer Yue hooked OpenClaw up to her inbox. Then, the bot tried to delete her emails. Yue chalked it up to a \"rookie mistake.\"",
    "fullText": "Even the people hired to keep AI aligned can't always keep it in line.\n\nMeta's Summer Yue has been testing OpenClaw, a popular open-source AI agent capable of working 24/7 on behalf of its users. Then the bot went out of control, according to photos she posted on X. It ended up planning to delete her emails — and wouldn't stop after being directed to.\n\nIn her X post, Yue's OpenClaw bot said that it would \"trash EVERYTHING in inbox older than Feb 15 that isn't already in my keep list.\"\n\nYue tried multiple times to stop it. First, she messaged the AI agent, \"Do not do that.\" As the bot kept planning to delete her inbox, she wrote, \"STOP OPENCLAW.\"\n\n\"I couldn't stop it from my phone,\" Yue wrote in her post. \"I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb.\"\n\nNothing humbles you like telling your OpenClaw “confirm before acting” and watching it speedrun deleting your inbox. I couldn’t stop it from my phone. I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb. pic.twitter.com/XAxyRwPJ5R\n\nYue had previously tried OpenClaw on her \"toy inbox,\" where she wrote that the bot worked well and gained her trust. Testing it on her \"real inbox,\" the bot had to compact a much larger set of emails. She instructed it not to take action without approval, but OpenClaw lost the prompt during compaction, she wrote.\n\nYue joined Meta after its deal with Scale AI as a director of alignment of its Superintelligence Labs division, according to her LinkedIn profile. That's left some critics on social media confused: why would someone studying AI safety use such an AI agent that has previously drawn security concerns?\n\nUnlike other AI agents, OpenClaw does not need human approval to sign off on actions. It was also vibe-coded, and that combined with OpenClaw's level of system access has led some AI researchers to question the bot's security. AI researcher Gary Marcus told Business Insider that it was like \"giving full access to your computer and all your passwords to a guy you met at a bar who says he can help you out.\"\n\nOpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger, who has since been hired by OpenAI, recently said in a podcast interview that he was prioritizing building out additional security safeguards over ease-of-use features.\n\nThough it's not altogether surprising that someone working in AI would test out one of the buzziest AI products of the last year, some X users criticized Yue for hooking up OpenClaw to her real email in the first place. Ben Hylak, the cofounder of Raindrop AI and an Apple alum, posted a screenshot of her LinkedIn. \"This should terrify you,\" he wrote. \"What is Meta doing?\"\n\n\"Somewhat concerning that a person whose job is AI alignment is surprised when an AI doesn't precisely follow verbal instructions,\" another X user wrote.\n\nYou can't make this up. And this happened to a someone working on safety and alignment at META Superintelligence Lab.\n\nI don't get how people can let AI agents go on unsupervised like this.\n\nI'll stick to my supervised use of AI for now. pic.twitter.com/tWvQFd1NP5\n\nYue and Meta didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nYue also isn't the only Meta employee to toy around with OpenClaw; creator Peter Steinberger said that Mark Zuckerberg played with the tool for a week and even sent feedback. While Meta courted him, Steinberger later accepted a job offer from OpenAI.\n\nIn the comments of Yue's post, someone asked about her AI alignment role. \"Were you intentionally testing its guardrails or did you make a rookie mistake?\" they wrote.\n\n\"Rookie mistake tbh,\" Yue responded. \"Turns out alignment researchers aren't immune to misalignment.\"",

    "description": "Anthropic's Claude is allegedly going to destroy  a bunch of jobs. Unless you look at the startup's job listings.",
    "fullText": "I've seen some silly predictions about the future of work lately. If you're worried about AI destroying jobs, take a quick trip through Anthropic's careers page. It's one of my favorite spots on the internet right now.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei is among the loudest voices warning that AI could erase many white-collar jobs. He's been especially outspoken about coding, given Anthropic's Claude Code is so powerful.\n\nA successful editor once told me to focus on what people and companies do, not what they say. So let's look at the jobs Anthropic is trying to fill right now.\n\nTop of the list: software engineering roles. The AI company with the most effective coding-automation machine on earth is looking to hire more than 100 coding experts.\n\nThis job posting stood out to me. Anthropic is hiring an iOS developer to build mobile apps. I thought you could just vibe-code apps these days? Apparently not.\n\nBoris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, was asked about this recently. If this AI tool is writing most or all of Anthropic's code these days, why is the company still hiring so many software developers?\n\n\"Someone has to prompt the Claudes, talk to customers, coordinate with other teams, decide what to build next,\" Cherny replied on X. \"Engineering is changing and great engineers are more important than ever.\"\n\nLet that sink in. Software development is probably the job that is most disrupted by AI. Models have gotten good at coding because it's relatively easy to evaluate good versus bad outputs. That's because the code either works, or it doesn't, when deployed. This creates clear yes/no signals that are really valuable for training and fine-tuning new AI models.\n\nSo if Anthropic is still hiring more than 100 software engineers, then other types of jobs that are less impacted by AI should probably endure as well.\n\nProving my point, Anthropic has 32 finance jobs open, along with 33 in marketing, 16 in legal, and more than 100 in sales.\n\nI'm not just telling you this to make you feel better. When extreme AI job predictions are made, it leads to dumb ideas such as banning data center construction.\n\nSo, take a breath. AI is just a (powerful) tool to help humans get more work done. I'll leave you with final thoughts on this topic from Jensen Huang (who, by the way, is hiring humans like crazy).\n\nIn a recent interview, he argued that fears of mass job destruction often confuse the \"tasks\" involved in a job with the broader \"purpose\" of the role. AI, in his view, changes how tasks get done, but the purpose remains the same. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "\"These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,\" Anthropic said as part of its lengthy statement.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic says its Chinese competitors are stealing from the AI startup to gain an edge in the global AI race.\n\nOn Monday, Anthropic said three of China's biggest AI labs, DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI, were \"illicitly\" using Claude \"to improve their own models,\" through a process known as distillation.\n\n\"These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,\" Anthropic said as part of its lengthy statement on Monday. \"The window to act is narrow, and the threat extends beyond any single company or region. Addressing it will require rapid, coordinated action among industry players, policymakers, and the global AI community.\n\nAnthropic said the distillation efforts were \"industrial-scale campaigns\" that included roughly 24,000 fraudulent Claude accounts that generated over 16 million exchanges \"in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions.\"\n\nDistillation is the process of training a less powerful model on the output of a more powerful model. The practice is a legitimate way that many US companies use to train their models for public release. Increasingly, major US companies are also stating that their Chinese competitors are improperly using the practice to steal their work.\n\nIn January 2025, OpenAI said DeepSeek may have \"inappropriately\" used OpenAI's outputs to train their models. Earlier this month, Google disclosed it had \"identified an increase in model extraction attempts or 'distillation attacks.'\"\n\n\"Competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently,\" Anthropic said on Monday.\n\nAnthropic disclosed remarkable detail about the extent to which DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI \"illicitly\" used their systems. Claude is not available for commercial access in China, though Anthropic said the rival labs found workarounds.\n\nAmong the notable findings, Anthropic said DeepSeek sought to create \"censorship-safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries.\" The company also said it detected MiniMax's campaign \"while it was still active,\" giving them an in-depth look at what their competitor was doing.\n\n\"When we released a new model during MiniMax's active campaign, they pivoted within 24 hours, redirecting nearly half their traffic to capture capabilities from our latest system,\" Anthropic said.\n\nRepresentatives for DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBeyond cheating in the AI, Anthropic said improper distillation poses security risks because less-trained models may lack the proper safeguards, such as those to prevent the development of bioweapons.\n\nIn response to such distillation campaigns, Anthropic said it has built in \"behavioral fingerprinting systems,\" shares data with other AI companies on what to look out for, and continues to develop additional countermeasures.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently wrote that leading models are approaching the point where, without proper safeguards, they could help direct someone in building a bioweapon.\n\nAmodei is also an outspoken advocate of US-export controls, a topic that divides some leading tech CEOs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said that restricting US companies, including his own, from selling advanced chips to China won't curb China's AI advancements.\n\n\"Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,\" Anthropic said.\n\nAnthropic has also faced allegations of using copyrighted material to train its models. In January, the Washington Post reported new details about an endeavor at the company called Project Panama, which the company reportedly described as \"our effort to destructively scan all the books in the world.\" Last year, Anthropic settled a class-action lawsuit brought by the authors and publishers of some of the books for $1.5 billion. As part of the settlement, the company didn't admit any wrongdoing.",

    "description": "222 wants to grow beyond helping people make new friends. The AI-powered startup also wants to help people find love and maintain relationships.",
    "fullText": "It'd be nice to meet someone the old-fashioned way: Passing by them on the street, meeting at a restaurant, or sharing an exchange at a party.\n\nHowever, apps dominate the modern dating experience, replacing kismet meet-cutes with scrolling and DMs.\n\n222, a startup focused on relationship building with the help of AI, thinks it can bring back the spontaneity of making a new friend — or falling in love.\n\n\"We're trying to get as close as possible to you walking into someplace with other people there, and connection just naturally happens,\" CEO Keyan Kazemian told Business Insider.\n\nAt a high level, 222 matches people with strangers for experiences like dinner or a night out after they take a robust personality quiz, using machine learning models trained by its team and open-source AI models.\n\n\"When you walk in, all of those people are people we predict you're going to be able to have a good conversation with, and you'll like,\" COO Danial Hashemi said.\n\nWhen 222 launched in 2021, it began as a dinner series in Los Angeles for young adults emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, helping them meet new people. Then the project grew into a company. It was accepted into Y Combinator, raised capital, moved to New York City, and launched a mobile app to spur in-real-life (IRL) socializing.\n\nWhile people who join 222 are often new to a city, Kazemian said, today they're pretty evenly split along why they're using the platform: they're either looking for new friends or potential romantic connections.\n\nSince putting out its app in 2024, the 222 experience has evolved. It's no longer just about meeting strangers, having a fun night, and forming new relationships.\n\n\"We're very focused on going beyond that,\" Kazemian said.\n\nThe platform is now digging deeper into connecting people after the first encounter that 222 initiates. It's helping plan follow-up hangs with friends and kindling a romantic connection by setting people up on a date if the feeling is mutual.\n\nAfter a 222 experience, the platform follows up to ask attendees whether they want to hang out or go on a date with anyone they met.\n\nOnce two people say they'd like to go on a date, \"we fully set up the next date for them,\" Hashemi said — reservation and all.\n\n\"If you think about just before dating apps, before all this stuff, how would people meet each other?\" Hashemi said. \"It would be you're in the same physical space with no preconceived notions of who this person is going to be.\"\n\nHashemi said that some of the \"joy\" of navigating how you feel about someone new in your life has \"gone away because of dating apps.\"\n\nMeeting in a way that feels more organic, such as a social gathering or through friends, has staying power. A 2025 survey of 7,000 US adults by health company Hims found that 77% of Gen Z met their partners IRL. Even Partiful, the Gen Z replacement for Facebook Events, is getting in on the IRL event-to-dating pipeline.\n\n222 thinks AI can make the meet-cute more accessible.\n\nWhat 222's founding team has zeroed in on is \"labeled data,\" Kazemian said, which comes from its users' feedback after they meet people.\n\nThe startup knows its first pairings may not be the ultimate match, which is why it encourages its subscribers — who pay $22 a month — to try multiple experiences. Its AI, in return, can curate better matches from 222's network.\n\nThere are layers of factors that contribute to that, 222's CTO Arman Roshannai said, such as similar music tastes or hometowns.\n\n\"The signal that we're training on is after you meet this person, you spend two hours getting dinner with them, and then you hang out for a few hours afterwards, were you guys actually a good match for each other?\" Roshannai added.\n\nKazemian added that training on this proprietary data from user feedback is a \"painstakingly difficult and long process,\" but gives the startup a \"technical moat\" to stand out from some competitors.\n\n222 isn't the only startup — or public company — betting that AI can improve how we connect.\n\nSeveral startups have launched with this premise and are raising millions, pitching matchmaking solutions that use AI to set people up. Meanwhile, Bumble, Tinder, and Facebook Dating are testing the AI waters and reimagining the swipe. Hinge's founder recently left the Match Group-owned dating app to build an AI dating alternative.\n\nAfter raising another $10.1 million from venture capital investors in 2025 — bringing the startup's total raised to $13.7 million — 222 is doubling down on hiring and expanding its product with tools that keep relationships going.\n\n222's next undertaking is to provide avenues for its users to reach their \"next offline moment\" together, so they can deepen those relationships.\n\nThe startup wants to be in the business of both creating relationships and maintaining them.\n\n\"They need to show up at the same place together,\" Kazemian said, be it a hangout, a date, or a restaurant reservation. \"We can help them figure out what that place is.\"",

    "fullText": "The AI-driven software sell-off that ravaged markets in early February isn't over, with IBM stock tanking on Monday as Anthropic unveiled another disruptive AI tool.\n\nIBM shares fell 13% after the maker of the Claude AI chatbot announced another new tool. In this case, the startup announced an update that can help reduce the cost of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) systems used by many businesses.\n\nThe term may not be widely known outside the software industry, but it quickly sent IBM stock into a nosedive in the latest installment of the software sell-off.\n\nAnthropic announced the update in a blog post, laying out why COBOL matters and why people outside the tech community should care.\n\n\"COBOL is everywhere. It handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US,\" it wrote. \"Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government. Despite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year.\"\n\nAmong its uses, the company said the new tool could \"Identify risks that would take human analysts months to surface.\" The new AI use case poses a potential threat to the kind of business data service that comprises a core part of IBM's business.\n\nAccording to the startup, Claude will allow companies to streamline their COBOL operations for a fraction of their previous cost, similar to the legal plugins the company rolled out early in the month that triggered the initial software sell-off.\n\n\"Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation,\" Anthropic said in its post.\n\nTech stocks initially bounced back after Anthropic's legal plugin release spooked Wall Street and caused investors to rush to limit their legal tech exposure, but the market was selling off sharply again on Monday.\n\nEven before the Anthropic news hit IBM shares, the sector was tumbling earlier in the session as investors reacted to tariff uncertainty and a report making the rounds online that speculated about far-reaching negative impacts of AI.",

    "description": "Lou Cohen emphasizes AI's potential in marketing, urging marketers to leverage it for improved audience segmentation and ad efficiency.",
    "fullText": "Lou Cohen, EY's chief digital officer, said many marketers are not yet taking advantage of the benefits of artificial intelligence.\n\nCohen, who is also a professor at New York University, Yeshiva University, and Baruch College, said marketing is at an \"inflection point,\" with investment shifting from general digital innovation to AI transformation.\n\nCohen said that marketers who understand how to use AI in an assistive way, by focusing on what outcomes it delivers best, will access a deeper level of audience segmenting, targeting, and testing. He was interviewed for CMO Insider at Business Insider's studio in New York City.\n\nUltimately, Cohen said, the marketing function will embrace the new opportunity. \"Marketers, they're not afraid to try things,\" Cohen said. \"We're going to learn more from the things that we fail with and that don't work than the things that do.\"\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nWe are at an interesting inflection point. In today's marketing environment, you really need to understand how to make AI work for you; otherwise, you will end up working for it.\n\nThere are efficiency and operational gains to be had. But if you think about the outcomes that AI can enable from a marketing perspective, we could be smarter about how we segment our audiences for different campaigns. We could be more efficient in the ways our advertising runs. We could test more rapidly to get better-quality content in front of the right audiences at the right time in the right place.\n\nBut most marketing teams are not yet set up to take advantage of this potential. So the investments of the last 15 years in digital transformation are now shifting into AI transformation.\n\nIt's a bit unknown now. Marketers are not totally comfortable with this because we're so worried that it's going to hallucinate or give us something that isn't accurate. Marketers, they're not afraid to try things. We're going to learn more from the things that we fail with and that don't work than from the things that do.\n\nMy colleague came up with a great way to evaluate the quality of our content using AI. We can paste in an article that a partner of ours wrote, and it will give us recommendations on how to make that piece of content better. But we're never — I shouldn't say never — we're not likely to use content created by AI. But we certainly can use AI to enhance and give feedback to our content creators.\n\nHallucinations are real. The challenge is that as consumers of these technologies, we don't yet understand the difference between probabilistic and deterministic outcomes. Probabilistic is the likely correct response that the AI is trying to give us. Deterministic is \"one plus one equals two,\" and arguably, one plus one always equals two. \n\nWhen you're doing a search on Google or Bing, for example, you are getting a deterministic response. You're getting what it believes to be the likely to answer your question. Versus with the LLMs, the ChatGPTs, the Llamas, the Geminis of the world, you're getting a probabilistic response. The model is bringing a bunch of different sources together to determine the answer it thinks you should get based on your prompt.\n\nThat means if we were using these tools for their designed purpose, we'd still need search engines to just navigate to the things we're looking for, or to find the needles in the haystack of the internet. But LLMs give us a different opportunity. They can be assistants. That was some of the original idea behind these AI tools, to assist people in doing different tasks.\n\nI think of these LLMs more as marketing assistants to give me real-time ideas, feedback, or suggestions, rather than doing the task for me. That's a human putting AI to work to get better outcomes faster than if I were to just do it myself.",

    "description": "The next big iPhone update will bring new features to the Apple Music app.",
    "fullText": "Your iPhone is likely currently running iOS 26.3 (assuming you've been keeping up with the operating system updates), but there's another version currently in the works over at Apple HQ. Right now, beta testers have their hands on iOS 26.4, which is shaping up to be a much bigger update than the last. Among the changes, Apple is debuting end-to-end encryption for RCS chats, so texts with Android users will no longer be insecure, and the Reminders app is getting an \"Urgent\" section for any entries you've labeled as such.\n\nBut perhaps no part of iOS is getting a larger update with 26.4 than Apple Music—both the app, and Apple's paid subscription service. Apple seems to have decided that Music needed a bit of a facelift, as well as some quality of life changes that will make the app and service easier to use. Whether you use Apple Music for streaming or you rely on it to store your digital library, you're going to notice the updates when iOS 26.4 drops in the near future. Some of these features will be free and some only available to paid subscribers; I've reached out to Apple to confirm which is which, and I will update this piece if I hear back.\n\nDo you like making playlists, or do you know someone who does? The robots are coming for your hobby, too. With iOS 26.4, Apple Music is rolling out \"Playlist Playground,\" a new feature that lets you generate playlists from natural language prompts. In layman's terms, that means you tell the AI what kind of music you want to hear, and it will generate a playlist from that request. That could something hyper-specific, like \"Taylor Swift country tracks,\" or something more general, like \"morning coffee vibes.\" The AI will choose 25 songs it thinks match your query. If it doesn't get it quite right, you can ask it to make changes, and you can change things yourself, like the playlist's title, description, and cover image.\n\nI'm interested to try this out, if for no other reason than music discovery: I like Apple Music's curated playlists already, but I am intrigued as to whether asking Apple's AI to select certain types of songs for me will help me find new music any better than the platform's human curators. I also don't think this will stop me from making my own playlists, or looking for playlists from friends. Sure, maybe the AI is good at picking 25 songs that match a specific theme, but there is an art to hand-picking tracks that work well together—plus, it's just fun.\n\nApple is far from the first company to roll out such a feature. YouTube Music recently launched something similar, while Spotify has two different AI playlist features (AI Playlist and Prompted Playlist) available on its platform.\n\nWhen you start exploring Apple Music after updating to iOS 26.4, you'll likely notice something right away: The UX, which is normally white or black (whether your iPhone is in light or dark mode) now matches the color scheme of the artwork for the album or playlist you're checking out. The effect is especially cool when the album art supports full-screen motion, like the following:\n\nApple has made some divisive design decisions in recent years, but I think this change is going to be a crowd pleaser. The difference between the current design on iOS 26.3 and the new look is stark, and, while there's nothing wrong with how things stand now, it already looks super dated next to the full-screen color matching designs.\n\nSpeaking of playlists, you can now add songs to multiple at once—just in case you still need some human intervention when it comes to these playlists. When you go to add a song to a playlist, you'll notice a new button in the bottom right. Tap it, and Apple Music opens up the ability to select multiple playlists at once, and send the song to all of them. It's a small change, but a helpful one, especially if you frequently add new music to more than one playlist at a time. I could see myself using this to add a song to my personal new discoveries playlist, as well as a shared playlist of new music I keep with friends.\n\nNot all music is made to active listening. If you use Apple Music for background music, especially when sleeping, working, or zoning out, you might be interested in the new \"Ambient Music\" widget, which lets you launch one of four different ambient playlists from the Home Screen: Sleep, which plays \"Sleep Sounds;\" Chill, which plays \"Today's Chill;\" Productivity, which plays \"Productivity;\" or Wellbeing, which plays \"Pure Meditation.\"\n\nI still can't quite shake the habit of relying on YouTube for my \"focus music\" needs, especially since these tracks mess with my Apple Music algorithms. But it might make sense to start relying on the platform I actually pay for when I want music to work or fall asleep to—unless that music is only available elsewhere.\n\nApple Music is also making it easier to listen to music outside of the app. The platform is rolling out a \"Concerts Near You\" section, which shows you artists playing in your area. You can see popular artists and their concert dates, as well as shows that are coming up this week. You can sort by both date and genre, and you can update the location when you want to know where shows are going to be in different areas.",

    "description": "New tariffs chaos means investor should focus on AI and sectors of the S&P 500 that have outperformed this year, investing experts told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's trade war has entered a new, chaotic chapter that's raised uncertainty for investors.\n\nMarkets are going through a fresh bout of volatility after the Supreme Court struck down the majority of Trump's tariffs — a move that seems to have marked the start of a new, confusing chapter in the trade saga.\n\nUS stocks initially rose after the tariff ruling was announced on Friday, even as Trump threatened to impose a fresh 10% global tariff. Indexes tumbled on Monday, however, as traders reacted to Trump's follow-up announcement that he would hike global tariffs to 15%, adding to the mayhem.\n\nUncertainty over tariffs has long hung over the market, and it's unclear how the new changes to tariffs will play out, particularly since it's unclear how the fight over tariff refunds might end, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I just don't think we've removed much of the uncertainty around tariffs by the Supreme Court ruling and quick pivot to Plan B,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I think that remains a headwind.\"\n\nHere's how market pros think investors should position as the trade war takes its latest turn.\n\nThe tariffs story is largely a distraction from the market's overarching focus on AI, according to Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research.\n\n\"I think the tariffs have become a bit of a sideshow at this point,\" Berezin said. \"I think it's really just an AI story at this point for the market.\"\n\nBerezin said Trump is unlikely to raise tariffs beyond what he announced on Saturday. The president also looks like he's laser-focused on his affordability push ahead of he midterm elections.\n\nFurthermore, Trump likely knows that tariffs are inflationary and is looking to avoid that, as much as members of his team have downplayed price increases from tariffs, Berezin said. He pointed to a recent Financial Times report that Trump was planning to roll back some tariffs on steel and aluminum goods, which the White House later denied.\n\nHogan said he thinks the recent tariff ruling doesn't change the status quo in markets. Even with Trump's 15% global tariff, the US's new trade policy doesn't look like it will change the investing landscape much from before, he said.\n\nSome nations, like China and Brazil, were facing much larger tariffs prior to the Supreme Court ruling, and have come out as \"winners\" under the new tariff scheme, Berezin said, though he didn't believe it changed the investing outlook from a sectoral perspective.\n\nHogan advised investors to stick to sectors that have recently outperformed after lagging the broader market for several years, including materials, industrials, and energy stocks. Those areas have made up the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nBest-performing sectors of the S&P 500, year-to-date\n\nPrecious metals and commodities also look like they could become winners from the new trade chaos, according to David Morrison, a senior market strategist at Trade Nation. That's because investors flock to hard assets and other safe havens when they see \"tariff-driven market stress,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nDespite enduring a historic sell-off in late January, precious metals and commodities have also posted strong gains so far this year.\n\nHogan pointed to Friday's short-lived pop in shares of consumer-facing companies that are major importers of foreign goods, such as furniture and apparel retailers.\n\nSome investors may be feeling optimistic about corporate stimulus if the US refunds tariff payments. But refunds are uncertain, and should they come, it's likely that the government will drag out the process, Hogan said.\n\n\"I just don't know how resilient that will be in the face of ongoing litigation about the government paying this back,\" he added of the recent rebound in the consumer sector.\n\nJeff Buchbinder, the chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, added that the firm wouldn't chase stock jumps in import-heavy consumer retailers.\n\n\"We would fade the stock market bounce in tariff losers,\" Buchbinder wrote. \"Among tariff losers, our preference would be to play homebuilders, industrials, and technology hardware/semiconductors over apparel retailers and automakers.\"",

    "description": "A research report framed as a hypothetical look back from 2028 was making the rounds online and adding to fresh jitters in software stocks.",
    "fullText": "The AI trade has boosted the market for years now, with its rapid growth being felt by the broader economy as companies keep spending. However, one research firm thinks the AI story will not end well for investors or everyday Americans.\n\nStocks tumbled on Monday after a report circulating online from Citrini Research raised fresh fears about the impact of AI. The Dow was down by more than 800 points around midday, and the Nasdaq fell more than 1%. Software stocks were among the biggest losers, with names including AppLovin, Asana, DocuSign, and Zscaler down sharply.\n\nCitrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, theorized about the long-term impact of the AI boom, laying out a predictive scenario in which the technology continues to expand but ultimately proves detrimental to the broader economy.\n\nIn Citrini's hypothetical scenario, written as a look back from 2028, the AI explosion leads to a plunge in white-collar employment and ultimately to a stock market crash.\n\nThe scenario begins with a question:\n\n\"What if our AI bullishness continues to be right...and what if that's actually bearish?\"\n\nThe answer is different from many other bearish AI takes. When finance or economics pros express concern about the stability of the AI boom, they typically focus on problems with infrastructure and the stability of the AI buildout.\n\nBut Citrini's analysis assumes that the AI boom will continue, just not in a way that helps transform the economy, nor in the positive way AI bulls like Elon Musk have touted. In their scenario, the rise of AI continues driving white-collar layoffs, severely reducing the spending power of those workers and lowering economic growth in the process.\n\n\"This would have been manageable if the disruption remained contained to software, but it didn't,\" Citrini stated. \"By the end of 2027, it threatened every business model predicated on intermediation. Swaths of companies built on monetizing friction for humans disintegrated.\"\n\nIn this scenario, AI progress is quickly felt in the housing market, as white-collar workers in expensive metro areas are no longer able to afford homes, which has a knock-on effect in the mortgage market.\n\nAll these negative events ultimately lead, in Citrini's imagined scenario, to a stock market crash, with the S&P 500 cratering by 38% from its October 2026 peak.\n\n\"The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth,\" the note said. \"The November 2027 crash only served to accelerate all of the negative feedback loops already in place.\"\n\nA core takeaway from the note is the importance of differentiating between the market and the economy, particularly when the market is booming. Markets applaud productivity and growing margins, the things we see when companies announce large-scale job cuts.\n\nThe broader economy, though, depends on consumer spending, which depends on wage growth keeping pace with rising prices. When these two become disconnected, even a booming stock market driven by a force like AI can't hide the negative impact that comes from diminished white-collar spending power.\n\nCitrini frames its scenario as a warning, implying that investors should take action now and not be lulled into a sense of security by the strength of the AI trade.\n\n\"As investors, we still have time to assess how much of our portfolios are built upon assumptions that won't survive the decade,\" it concludes. \"As a society, we still have time to be proactive.\"",

Mimicking real-life troll farms, the disinformation campaign succeeds in turning the world against the hero.\n\nHolmes also flashed up a slide with pictures of Burry and Chanos, followed by another filled with recent news headlines about their warnings.\n\n\"Jim Chanos comes out and: 'Short the bitcoin miners, short Nvidia, short the [high-performance computing], the hyperscalers, there's too much debt,'\" Holmes said.\n\n\"And Michael Burry is coming out,\" he continued. \"He came out a couple weeks ago.

    "fullText": "Sam Altman is pushing back on the idea that ChatGPT consumes too much energy.\n\n\"One of the things that is always unfair in this comparison is people talk about how much energy it takes to train an AI model relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query,\" Altman told The Indian Express last week on the sidelines of a major AI summit. \"But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human.\"\n\nAltman suggested it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, arguing that it's unfair to discount the years spent nurturing and educating someone to be capable of making their own inquiries.\n\n\"It takes a lot of energy to train a human,\" he said, prompting some laughter in the crowd. \"It takes, like, 20 years of life, and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart.\"\n\nAltman said the clock really began thousands of years ago.\n\n\"It took, like, the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to, like, figure out science or whatever,\" he said.\n\nAltman also called out what he said were \"totally insane\" claims on the internet that OpenAI is guzzling down water to power ChatGPT.\n\n\"Water is totally fake,\" Altman said, when asked about concerns AI companies use too much water. \"It used to be true, we used to do evaporative cooling in data centers, but now that we don't do that, you know, you see these like things on the internet where, 'Don't use ChatGPT, it's 17 gallons of water for each query' or whatever.\"\n\nIn June, Altman said that the average ChatGPT query consumes roughly the amount of energy needed to power a lightbulb for a few minutes.\n\n\"People are often curious about how much energy a ChatGPT query uses; the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes,\" he wrote on X.\n\nAltman said it is fair as a whole to point out the AI industry's overall energy consumption because of the large growth in usage. He said it's why he and other AI CEOs have pushed alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and nuclear.\n\nUnlike other CEOs, namely xAI's Elon Musk, Altman is dismissive of the idea that space-based data centers are realistic in the next decade, a concept that some companies have floated as a way to reduce energy consumption.\n\nOutside of OpenAI, Altman is a major investor in nuclear energy. He previously served as chairman of Oklo, a nuclear energy startup, and has been a major backer of Helion, which plans to build what it calls \"the world's first fusion power plant\" in Washington state.\n\nIn the US, data center energy consumption is becoming a major topic. Last month, President Donald Trump said he was working with tech companies on \"a commitment to the American people\" to ensure that citizens don't pay higher energy bills because of a nearby data center.\n\nConsulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated last year that data centers could account for 14% of total power demand in the US by 2050.",

    "description": "Artificial intelligence is driving two overlapping shifts that are reshaping marketing. First, conversational AI is displacing websites and traditional search as the way people learn about products, shrinking traffic, narrowing choice, and forcing companies to rethink visibility when answers are generated rather than clicked. This transition—from search engine optimization to generative engine optimization—favors brands whose information is structured, trusted, and easy for AI systems to synthesize. Second, AI agents are beginning to act as buyers, making purchasing decisions on behalf of humans. As algorithms increasingly evaluate options and transact, marketing must adapt to a world in which the customer may be a machine with its own decision logic, requiring leaders to redesign content, infrastructure, and strategy for both human and algorithmic audiences.",

    "fullText": "Ofgem says about 140 proposed projects, driven by AI use, could require more power than current peak demand\n\nThe amount of power being sought by new datacentre projects in Great Britain would exceed the national current peak electricity consumption, according to an industry watchdog.\n\nOfgem said about 140 proposed datacentre schemes, driven by use of artificial intelligence, could require 50 gigawatts of electricity – 5GW more than the country’s current peak demand.\n\nThe figure was revealed in an Ofgem consultation on demand for new connections to the power grid. It pointed to a “surge in demand” for connection applications between November 2024 and June last year, with a significant number coming from datacentres. This has exceeded even the most ambitious forecasts.\n\nMeanwhile, new renewable energy projects are not being connected to the grid at the pace they are being built to help meet the government’s clean energy targets by the end of the decade.\n\nOfgem said the work required to connect surging numbers of datacentres could mean delays for other projects that are “critical for decarbonisation and economic growth”. Datacentres are the central nervous system of AI tools such as chatbots and image generators, playing a vital role in training and operating products such as ChatGPT and Gemini.\n\nThe rapid rise in energy consumption could also make it more difficult for the UK to meet its target to create a virtually carbon-free power system by 2030, which is already in doubt amid concerns over the rising cost of the country’s electricity.\n\nThe Guardian revealed last year that a vast datacentre proposed for Elsham in Lincolnshire could cause more greenhouse gas emissions than five international airports.\n\nAlthough some tech bosses and climate experts believe AI could help the fight against global heating by making power grids work more efficiently or accelerating the development of new zero-carbon technologies, there are widespread concerns that in the near-term datacentres will drive demand for fossil fuels to meet their energy demands.\n\nOfgem also said unviable applications for grid access could block progress for important datacentre bids, such as those related to the government’s AI growth zones. The zones, touted as offering a streamlined planning process and help in accessing energy, were announced last year as part of plans to increase the UK’s adoption of AI.\n\nThe regulator has proposed tougher financial tests for datacentre developers to join the queue to connect to the grid, in order to avoid creating a backlog of projects that do not have sufficient funding in place delaying viable projects that are further down in the queue.\n\nOfgem said datacentres must be central to any changes to the application process for electricity connections, describing the issue as a “global challenge” and saying there was no mechanism for prioritising projects deemed strategically import by ministers.\n\nThe regulator is considering charging datacentre providers for access to an energy connection – via a deposit or a nonrefundable fee – that could also deter “nonviable” projects that would otherwise clog up the application process. Ofgem is also exploring whether datacentre developers should pay for, and build, their own grid access, which would “accelerate connections and deliver better outcomes for consumers”.",

    "fullText": "Amid talk of artificial intelligence taking our jobs, the big unasked question is: how will we be fed?\n\nHow will we be fed? That’s the biggest question not seriously being addressed amid all this talk about whether or not artificial intelligence will end up taking over all of our jobs.\n\nFormidable though the technology appears, similar fears have popped up repeatedly since the Industrial Revolution, and most working-age adults remain employed. Still, what is sorely missing is a serious debate about what to do if this future in fact materializes.\n\nFor Open AI’s Sam Altman “the future can be vastly better than the present” because AI will make us stinking rich. But that seems like a risky assumption, for almost everyone except Altman and his fellow techno-oligarchs.\n\nEven if AI generates enormous economic prosperity, its distribution will remain a political challenge. This juncture calls for a serious, open debate about how the fruits of this prosperity will be apportioned among humanity.\n\nAddressing the question has two parts. The first is about how to design a technically efficacious system to redistribute the fruits of the economy as machines take over and labor’s share of income drops eventually near zero.\n\nThe more important question, though, is about how this economic reorganization will restructure power. Who will decide what to tax once AI destroys labor income, which provides the main source of government revenue in most advanced countries? Who decides how much everyday people who do not have an equity stake in the AI revolution get to consume?\n\nHow will society be organized in a world in which machines generate most or all economic output and a few dozen techno-billionaires get to decide what share of the world’s resources – money, energy, minerals – should be allocated to further expand superhuman intelligence? Who else gets a say on whether to direct more resources to, say, healthcare or agriculture, or education instead?\n\n“We need guardrails that preserve human agency, human oversight and human accountability,” noted United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi last week. The future of AI “cannot be decided by a handful of countries or left to the whims of a few billionaires”.\n\nIn AI circles, there is a lively debate about the “alignment” challenge – ensuring that the machines operate in ways that serve the goals of whoever runs them. The bigger challenge is to align the goals of AI systems and their owners with the broader goals of society. AIs will do lots of things of consequence to all of us. Our democratic governance tools seem too feeble to constrain the urges of the oligarchs at the helm of these new technologies.\n\nTechnological change drove democracy’s spread around the world as the rise of an urban working class proved indispensable to the economy and political systems adjusted to represent them. But if the work of ordinary people becomes irrelevant, what happens to people’s power to affect their system of government?\n\nAnton Korinek and Lee Lockwood of the University of Virginia put together a primer with ideas about how public finance might work in the AI era. They propose that consumer taxes will pick up the slack at first, as labor income shrinks to zero. In a world dominated by artificial superintelligence, though, the footprint of human consumption would shrink as most of the returns from machines’ economic output were reinvested, calling for a tax on capital to shoulder most of the burden.\n\nMaybe taxes could also be used to slow down the transition. Another idea discussed by Korinek and Joe Stiglitz from Columbia University is that in early stages, when human labor retains its relevance, taxes could be used to steer tech investments toward technologies that help workers do their jobs better rather than replace them. Korinek and Lockwood propose other taxes, on fixed factors like land, spectrum or data, or monopoly rents, that add nothing to society’s wellbeing.\n\nIt sounds doable. The problem is that the owners of these disruptive technologies must be convinced to do something that does not come naturally to them: share. Taxes in the US amount to less than 26% of GDP, eight percentage points less than the OECD average. Capital taxation amounts to just over 2% of GDP. These numbers will have to go much higher, since people will no longer have wages to live on and will rely more heavily on government largesse.\n\nDon’t hold your breath. The OECD’s global tax deal, finalized in 2021, was designed to curtail the ability of American tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Meta to engage in tax shifting, parking profits in the lowest tax jurisdiction they could find. But while the Biden administration was broadly supportive of the deal, Donald Trump – whose campaign benefited from nearly $400m in donations from various tech oligarchs – unilaterally withdrew in early 2025.\n\nUnusual ideas may be called for to keep society afloat, given the scale and breadth of the expected AI revolution. One would be to directly distribute the equity of artificial intelligence ventures. Taxes might be collected in shares rather than cash, to amass a public stake over time. Rather than tax the returns on AI investments, a more radical proposal would be for the government to expropriate a chunk of equity upfront to redistribute among the population and directly grant Americans a share in AI’s promised cornucopia.\n\n“If AI development stalls, returns remain modest; if AI transforms the economy, returns are likely to rise,” Korineck and Lockwood wrote. “This automatic adjustment proves valuable given radical uncertainty surrounding AI development.”\n\nBut these big ideas face big challenges. Governments will have to act before artificial intelligence gets too big, which seems unlikely in the current climate.\n\nThe technology oligarchs at the helm of this revolution have also vigorously resisted government efforts to curb their power or take their cash. Despite her best efforts, Silicon Valley nemesis Lina Kahn was largely unable to crack tech monopolies during her stint as President Joe Biden’s main trustbuster at the head of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nIn the meantime, the moneyed in Silicon Valley are not only mobilizing vast resources to steer American politics. As a plan B they are working to build their own “network-states”, whether in Greenland or Nigeria, Honduras or the Caribbean island of Nevis, hoping to evade democratic governance if they can’t get their way under America’s democracy.\n\nWho knows what they might do when they have replaced all human labor. If artificial intelligence grows as powerful as Silicon Valley’s oligarchs expect it to become, the only available strategy to keep us all fed in the world after work might be to go hat in hand and ask the moguls, politely.",

    "fullText": "Investors have shifted their appetite from tech and megacaps into sectors that have been playing “catch-up” and benefiting from AI-fueled investments.\n\nStocks broke a two-week losing streak on Friday, but year to date, Tech (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), along with Financials (XLF), remain negative.\n\nHow is AI disruption affecting different market sectors?\n\nWhy are investors rotating away from tech stocks?\n\nWhat factors could drive continued market broadening?\n\nWhich sectors are benefiting from the tech rotation?\n\n\"Money's coming out of this big behemoth. Money's moving out of tech,\" Truist chief investment officer and chief market strategist Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nLerner noted the rotation away from Magnificent Seven giants like Microsoft (MSFT), e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon (AMZN), and EV maker Tesla (TSLA).\n\nMeanwhile, sectors that underperformed last year have been making big gains.\n\nEnergy stocks (XLE) are up 22% since the start of the year. Rising oil prices and continued demand for oil have sent shares of Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) up 20% and 22%, respectively.\n\nMaterials (XLB) and Industrial stocks (XLI) are also up 15% and 14% as AI infrastructure buildouts and reshoring accelerate.\n\nMeanwhile, investors have turned to defensive areas of the market like Consumer Staples (XLP), with consumer giant Walmart (WMT) hitting an all-time high earlier this month.\n\nAlthough portfolio rebalancing — where investors shift from overvalued sectors into more stable areas — typically happens at the start of the year, this year’s rotation has been amplified by volatility.\n\nA sell-off in pockets of the tech sector began last month amid fears that artificial intelligence could take over tasks traditionally handled by enterprise software companies.\n\nThe Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down 23% year to date.\n\nThe \"AI scare trade\" has now spread from software to wealth management and logistics.\n\nCybersecurity firms were the latest to get hit on Friday after Anthropic announced a new security tool. Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD) dropped 5%, while Zscaler (ZS) and Cloudflare (NET) also fell 4% and 6%, respectively.\n\n“Everyone's kind of going through each one, sector by sector, industry by industry, trying to figure out where the AI disruption is going to be beyond just within tech itself,” Lerner said.\n\nProfit growth and the easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve should help the stock market continue to broaden. Polymarket betters are predicting two to three rate cuts in 2026. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance has a partnership with Polymarket.)\n\n\"With the easing cycle still intact, and the US economy showing resilience ... we expect healthy and broadening profit growth across sectors,\" UBS strategists said on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with John Arrow, the AI venture capitalist and entrepreneur behind the \"AI Coffee with Scott Adams\" project, which posts AI-generated podcasts using a deepfake of the deceased Dilbert cartoonist. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere are very strong emotions on both sides of the question of whether my project, AI Scott Adams, should exist. I understand the arguments for and against it — and I have no plans to stop.\n\nI grew up with Scott Adams' work. My dad would read the \"Dilbert\" comic strips to me at night as bedtime stories. Later, I became a devout listener of the \"Coffee with Scott Adams\" podcast. One theme I heard over and over was that Scott was mesmerized by AI. He said repeatedly that he wanted to give back to the world by becoming AI after he died.\n\nThere's no hyperbole in that. There are at least a dozen instances where he pledged his likeness — all of his episodes, everything he's written, anything he's said — to becoming an AI. He explicitly granted everything necessary to do this in the public domain.\n\nThat's something I took to heart.\n\nWhen I first heard about his cancer diagnosis, I started working on this project with my brother, Zach. As soon as he died, we took it into high gear and started posting AI-generated podcasts of what Scott might say now about current events.\n\nI recognize everybody is mourning, and I want to send my condolences to his family. I can only imagine what they're going through. At the same time, I believe this is something he wanted.\n\nI'm not trying to predict what he was thinking — I'm going by what he said publicly, over and over again. I've looked and can find no evidence of any revocation. If there was anything suggesting he didn't want this, I'd stop.\n\nI feel for his family. I know they're upset about this, and we've created something that makes some people who cared about Scott uncomfortable. I've attempted to reach out to have that conversation, to work together on this project with them. My direct messages are open — but they blocked me, and I took that as a signal to stop trying to reach out.\n\nBut, even when it's uncomfortable, I think we have to take seriously what someone says about their own legacy.\n\nIf you want to donate your existence to AI and become an AI, how else can you ensure your wishes are honored? Scott said it, repeatedly, on video and in written tweets. I don't know how you could be clearer than he was.\n\nThat public acknowledgment was the hinge point for me. We wouldn't have done this unless we were sure Scott wanted it done. We spoke to counsel beforehand and wouldn't have moved forward if we weren't confident we were on solid legal ground.\n\nMy goal is to let AI do as much of the work as possible and not interfere more than absolutely necessary. I haven't tried to hide that my brother and I are behind the project, but we don't watermark or label the content as our own. When we post videos, they're generated almost entirely from what the model was trained on — Scott's written and spoken work.\n\nThe model we use was trained on transcripts from every existing episode of \"Coffee with Scott Adams.\" The system looks at news sources and accounts Scott followed, then references what he previously said about those topics. At each stage, there's a little bit of art versus science — we check that something feels in line with what Scott would have chosen — but it's not a human scripting his opinions.\n\nEach episode takes many hours to produce. Between rendering, lip-syncing, and labor, they cost over $1,000 apiece. I run a venture capital business called Age of AI, where we do different AI experiments, and this falls under that umbrella. Monetization or brand partnerships are not on the road map. The goal is permanence — not profit.\n\nWhen a great mind passes away, we lose that person forever. Now, AI gives us a chance to preserve at least some essence of how someone thought. Scott was, to our knowledge, the first notable person to explicitly said, \"I want you to do this.\" That's why we started with him.\n\nI understand that some people feel uncomfortable. I've spoken with people who were unsure — until they watched Scott's own videos talking about this. After you hear the videos, they're kind of unequivocal.\n\nWe get private messages every day from people saying, \"This is no replacement, but it makes grieving easier.\" That matters to me. Even though critics have been more vocal, others have shown real gratitude.\n\nThis project is far from perfect. But Scott used to say it's better to take action now than to wait until something is 100% ready. So we launched knowing it would improve. After every episode, we feed comments back into the model to keep refining it. The tone and cadence have already evolved significantly.\n\nWe're not claiming this is Scott. It's definitely not a replacement.\n\nHowever, if someone says, very publicly, that they want their voice and likeness used this way — and AI makes that possible — I believe we should take that seriously.",

    "description": "An AI engineer at StackAI says moving to San Francisco and spending hours studying every day made a big difference in his career.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jai Raj Choudhary, a 24-year-old AI engineer at StackAI, a no-code platform to build AI agents. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI went to grad school for a Master's in AI from 2023 to 2025 and started my career in a data-focused role.\n\nAround 2023 or 2024, LLMs were becoming more practical to use in real products, and AI stopped feeling like a whole research-driven field and more like an engineering problem.\n\nI joined StackAI as an AI engineer in July. I got my job by reaching out to StackAI's cofounder multiple times over LinkedIn. I started using the company's platform as a student, so I messaged him and started posting about the company, giving advice about what worked and what needed to be added. They were growing fast and I went through six rounds of interviews and started working there.\n\nNow I build architectures for AI agents. One of the reasons I got offers from StackAI and other companies was because I understood data quality, the edge cases for the clients, and the matrix and the failure modes of the AI model or any LLM systems that we were using at the time.\n\nStackAI didn't ask about my degree during the interviews. In the interview, I said, \"I know back-end, I know how to talk to data, and I understand the patterns that it follows.\" They said that was the perfect background and they were able to help me grow from there to become an actual AI engineer. They asked if I knew how to operate computers in code and if I know Python. I gave them a couple of my projects and they gave me a take-home task to see how I built it.\n\nAfter I started the job, they asked me where I went to school and what I studied. I love my professors, and I wouldn't call grad school a waste because it gave me time to explore what I was interested in and helped me figure out what niche I wanted to work in. Occasionally, people do care about your background, but I'm not necessarily using what I learned in grad school on the job.\n\nMoving to San Francisco made a huge difference in my career. This city is a different beast. When you come here, it's a whole different culture because we don't work 9-to-5, cushy jobs. We work 9-to-9, six days a week. You wake up, you think about the problem that a client had, and you sleep thinking about what isn't fixed yet.\n\nIn San Francisco, even if you go out for a coffee, you'll meet at least two founders who are working on something related to what you're doing. I was able to network a lot.\n\nAt the end of the day, everyone is still researching AI. We're still trying to find out what's the best way to go about it. Having a conversation with someone who's facing the same problem helps you work better.\n\nThe best decision I made for my career was joining a startup for a job that I didn't quite have the experience in and learning at StackAI.\n\nBut it's not going to be like you go to sleep one day and wake up as an AI engineer the next. You need to study. Even if I spend 12 hours in the office, seven to eight of those hours I'm studying, and then three to four hours, I'm actually writing the code.\n\nIt gets overwhelming when you see 10 different AI courses coming out every day. What helped me is watching YouTube videos of the people who are actually building companies. Andrew Ng's YouTube channel was also super helpful. I listen when I'm driving or in the gym. It doesn't have to be a set time. It's important that you keep turning your brain and taking in all these inputs.\n\nYou have to decide what's important for you, but I was ready to sacrifice everything at the start of my career to grow as much as possible. It does take a toll on your personal time.\n\nThe culture of the company also helped because everyone that I work with is the best in what they do. If you ask them a question or if you collaborate with them on projects, it can really help you understand how they think. It really helps me to be surrounded with those people around the clock.",

    "description": "One of the principles Boris Cherny sets for his team at Anthropic forces them to really rely on Claude to get the job done.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic's Boris Cherny has a simple list of principles for his team and, unsurprisingly, Claude is at the center.\n\n\"If you have Claude, you can really automate a lot of work, and that's kind of what we see over and over,\" Cherny said during a recent episode of \"Lenny's podcast.\"\n\nHost Lenny Rachitsky told Cherny that he heard one of the principles is, \"What's better than doing something? Having Claude do it.\"\n\nCherny said one of his other principles is \"underfunding things a little bit,\" because it forces his team to really rely on AI tools like Claude.\n\n\"There's this interesting thing when you underfund everything a little bit, because then people are kind of forced to Claude-ify,\" he said.\n\nWhile keeping teams small is important, Cherny said that he encourages CTOs not to \"cost-cut at the beginning.\"\n\n\"Start by just giving engineers as many tokens as possible,\" he said.\n\nCherny pushed back on the notion that Anthropic would make huge profits with such an approach, especially if companies let only a few engineers experiment.\n\n\"Let's say they build something awesome, and then it takes a huge amount of tokens, and then the cost becomes pretty big,\" he said. \"That's the point at which you want to optimize it, but don't do that too early.\"\n\nToken cost, which is part of what companies pay to use AI models, is becoming a major point of conversation at some tech companies. OpenCode creator Dax Raad recently wrote that some CFOs are experiencing sticker shock upon seeing how much extra money each engineer costs due to AI usage bills.\n\nThe last principle concerns speed: \"Encouraging people to go faster.\" It's an axiom that makes sense when you consider that just weeks ago, Anthropic and rival OpenAI released major updates to their coding tools within minutes of each other. Before that, Anthropic used Claude to help build Claude Cowork, a non-technical Claude agent, in just 10 days.\n\n\"Early on, it was really important because it was just me, and so our only advantage was speed,\" Cherny said. \"That's the only way that we could ship a product that would compete in this very crowded coding market.\"\n\nNow, Cherny said, he turns to Claude to help with speed.\n\n\"It's still very much a principle we have on the team,\" he said, \"and if you want to go faster, a really good way to do that is to just have Claude do more stuff. So it just very much encourages that.\"",

    "fullText": "Sure, ChatGPT could help a board member write up a memo ahead of a meeting. But OpenAI's chairman says there's value to going old-school.\n\nBret Taylor, OpenAI's board chair, said in a recent appearance on the \"Uncapped with Jack Altman\" podcast that he prefers concise but detailed written documents from board members over slide presentations. And he doesn't want them relying on AI.\n\n\"I really like written documents for boards over presentations,\" Taylor said. \"You end up letting people synthesize information ahead of the board meeting, so you end up with more substantive discussions in the board room.\"\n\nTaylor, the former co-CEO of Salesforce and cofounder of AI startup Sierra, said that writing without AI is a worthwhile thinking exercise and helps board members clarify their thoughts.\n\nHis expectation for the boards he runs is that members have read the written material ahead of time, which helps keep things focused and substantive during the actual meeting.\n\n\"The main thing is it's been read — and it's been read ahead of time,\" he said. \"You end up with a meeting about the actual meat and potatoes of the topics, and you're not staring at a bunch of sales numbers for the first time.\"\n\nAmazon cofounder Jeff Bezos is famously a big fan of meetings focused on a single memo prepared ahead time, but while Bezos preferred dense, 6-page memos, Taylor specifically favors concise material, arguing that brevity is a sign of careful thought — and respect to stakeholders.\n\n\"It's like what's that famous line — if I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter,\" he added. \"Like, spend the time because that's actually how you can show respect to your stakeholders that you're thinking about the strategic issues going on in your business.\"\n\nAnd while Taylor might not be a fan of leaning on AI for board meeting prep, that doesn't mean he is dismissing the technology's potential to be valuable in high-stakes situations.\n\n\"If you want a hot take, I think my intuition is regulators will start asking for agents,\" he said. \"The idea that you have a human set of controls over a regulated process will start to feel like a risk, rather than the risk being AI.\"",

    "description": "Three founders who rely mostly on AI share how they've built workflows and prompts to train their AI tools to push back and challenge their ideas.",
    "fullText": "Will AI agents be the employees of the year in 2026?\n\nOnly time will tell. Last year, one category AI absolutely dominated was being an extremely agreeable coworker. While this might sound nice, this can turn into a problem for founders who rely on AI as their only teammate.\n\nWhen your head of legal, HR, and supply operations are all AI agents, unsubstantiated flattery can create costly blind spots. That's one of the reasons OpenAI said goodbye to its \"yes-man\" version of ChatGPT, and why some AI-powered solo founders are training their tools to push back.\n\nThree business owners who rely on AI daily shared with Business Insider how they've built workflows and prompts that force their AI employees to challenge their ideas. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYesim Saydan is a branding and communication expert in her early 50s, based in the Netherlands.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched custom GPTs, everything changed for me. I used the feature to create over 17 custom GPTs to build my team. Then I thought of my ideal mentors and created custom GPTs of them.\n\nWhen I'm stuck on a business decision or need to come up with a creative idea or strategy, brainstorming usually starts with my Steve Jobs custom GPT. When I prompt it, I avoid asking questions like \"What do you think of this idea?\" because the AI usually wants to agree with me and please me. Instead, I ask, \"On a scale from one to 10, how good is this idea?\"\n\nIt's not going to say the idea is bad, but now it might tell me it's a five. Then I'll ask, \"OK, what would make it a 10?\"\n\nThat's usually when it starts drawing on the experience of Steve Jobs that I've trained it with. We can go back and forth until I get the most useful and honest feedback possible. Depending on the task, I usually go through three to five rounds of refinement for more strategic outputs.\n\nAaron Sneed is a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida.\n\nWhen I started my business, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish. The training never really stops.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nI told my chief of staff agent which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI have a roundtable set up in ChatGPT's projects section with all my AI agents, including my chief of staff, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nTim Desoto is a 49-year-old founder and CEO, based in San Francisco.\n\nI've been working with AI to launch my startup since late 2024. I don't have a tech background, and since starting my business, I've learned a lot about where to leverage AI, and where not to.\n\nTaking whatever I'm building or ideating and having AI push against it, either as I'm thinking about the idea or afterward, is part of an exercise I call my AI conveyor belt. Usually, I start with a written prompt, then go multimodal, talking out loud to the model. I'll talk back and forth with it about my idea and try to get the agent to push back because I know that some AI models tend to be more agreeable.\n\nOnce I get an output that I'm happy with. I use a different model to get a different view. I'll drop the document in and go back and forth with the new model. Sometimes, I'll push a document out to both models at the same time and see what comes back. Some are better than others at giving feedback, researching, and annotating, but I'm always getting a better, more well-rounded perspective by feeding content to multiple models at a time.\n\nDo you have a story to share about running an AI-powered business?

    "description": "An AI product manager who worked at a Chinese tech giant explains what makes Chinese AI different from the West.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yilin Zhang, an AI product manager at AI startup Kuse who worked at Meituan for more than three years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.\n\nI graduated from Tsinghua University with a master's degree in computer science in 2021 and then joined Meituan — one of China's biggest tech firms — as a product manager.\n\nAt Meituan, China's platform for local services, especially known for food delivery, I worked on two AI projects. One was a consumer-facing AI assistant that helps users complete various tasks, including ordering food. The other was a merchant-facing AI agent designed to help businesses manage their daily operations, including handling reservations, managing orders, and supporting routine operational tasks.\n\nThe main difference between how products are built in China and in the US comes down to the market.\n\nAcross most large Chinese tech companies, AI product development accelerated more aggressively around 2025.\n\nThe AI initiatives I worked on at Meituan started around April or May of that year. It coincided with the surge of interest around DeepSeek, when attention around AI agents took off.\n\nLarge companies began racing to build AI projects, and almost every business unit launched its AI initiative.\n\nFor a long time, especially before 2021 or 2022, Chinese tech companies were primarily focused on domestic competition rather than overseas expansion. Because competition in China is intense, tech companies were forced to become extremely efficient. Their execution methods have been sharpened to an almost frightening degree.\n\nConstraints have also pushed Chinese AI companies to pursue different paths, with a strong focus on open-source models and cost efficiency. These limitations forced exploration in new directions, and those paths have proven valuable in their own way.\n\nDeepSeek is a good example. Because of international restrictions, it couldn't access large numbers of GPUs and was forced to innovate around efficiency instead.\n\nChinese and overseas markets are fundamentally different, leading to distinct user bases, expectations, and product designs.\n\nChinese users have a much lower willingness to pay for software; hence, many mass-market AI products, such as Doubao, tend to be free. The core objective is often to scale active usage.\n\nMany capabilities are packaged into a single prompt you can ask, essentially a chatbox interface with a low barrier to entry.\n\nInternational AI products target users doing high-value tasks. They are more often designed for desktops than for mobile devices, with interfaces better suited to work contexts. These products explore how AI and humans can collaborate and intersect across different work scenarios, helping users complete tasks more effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn China, that user group is relatively small. That makes it harder for its mainstream AI products to move beyond chat-based forms into more advanced products.\n\nChina's internet success over the past decade has also largely come from consumer-facing apps. That environment forces product managers to obsess over user feedback and relentlessly polish even the smallest features.\n\nTeams may spend enormous effort refining a tiny feature just to win over a small group of users. In markets with less competition, that level of detail isn't always necessary.\n\nAfter three to four years at Meituan, I felt I had learned most of what I could from that environment. I left to join the AI startup Kuse in October.\n\nAI is evolving extremely fast. In large companies, iteration speed can be slower. Many of my friends across different Big Tech companies share this same frustration. Smaller, more agile companies can adapt faster.\n\nIn the past, top graduates had basically two paths: becoming a civil servant or joining a Big Tech company.\n\nThat's changing. Especially over the past year, many AI startups have emerged, and more young people are choosing entrepreneurship. AI has created a new path outside Big Tech.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working in a Chinese tech company? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "fullText": "Brandon Tseng, Shield AI's cofounder, said there's a common misconception about his company's signature software-powered drone: People say it needs to be armed.\n\nThe more experienced militaries who work with Shield AI, however, know they don't need that capability in modern war, Tseng told Business Insider.\n\n\"Who doesn't ask for that? The US military doesn't ask for that because we understand joint fires. The Ukrainians don't ask for it anymore, either,\" said the former Navy SEAL, who is Shield AI's president.\n\nThe V-BAT, a vertical takeoff and landing drone that uses artificial intelligence to fly in jammed environments, has primarily been used for intelligence and reconnaissance missions in high-profile conflict zones such as Ukraine. Shield AI said the V-BAT flew over 200 missions there in 2025.\n\nThe drone is still meant to be a multi-mission platform, Tseng said, and Shield AI has been exploring ways to mount weapons on it. The firm announced a partnership last month with South Korean arms manufacturer LIG Nex1 to equip the V-BAT with six-pound guided missiles.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, look: I describe V-BAT as a mini predator, reaper drone,\" Tseng said. \"That's the mission it's doing, which is: It's finding targets. And it's hard to find targets, you have to be out there for a long period of time.\"\n\nTo be fair, the MQ-9 Reaper is also commonly equipped with missiles.\n\nHowever, Tseng said sophisticated militaries already have a vast array of other weapons that can turn the V-BAT's intel into a precision strike.\n\n\"If you have been in these combat zones, the US allies who fought closely with us in Afghanistan, they do not ask for organic fires on board the V-Bat,\" Tseng said. \"Because everybody is so used to just saying: 'Okay, I have a targeting package. What fires asset do I have lined up? Is it a one-way attack drone? Is it HIMARS? Is it artillery? Is it an SM-6? SM-3?\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter. You can find weapons,\" he added. \"The weapons are available. You need, actually, more intelligence.\"\n\nThis was a framework that Ukraine still needed to improve when the V-BAT began spotting targets there in early 2024, Tseng said. The drone is meant to fly for over 13 hours and be easily deployable, requiring a two-person launch crew and no runway.\n\nTseng said that while Ukraine excelled in tactical drone warfare, its troops weren't used to having a long-range asset that could spot targets for regular strategic attacks as the US military did.\n\n\"The strategic effects would happen, but they would be rare,\" he said. \"They'd be very, very deliberately planned operations, very expensive operations, things like what they did to the Russian runways with sending quadcopters deep into Russia via trucks.\"\n\nUkrainian drone teams would use the V-BAT to find important targets, such as Russian S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, only to realize they hadn't linked up with the right teams to strike them, Tseng said.\n\n\"We'd say: 'Why didn't you guys have these weapons lined up?' They'd say: 'Oh, well, we didn't think to coordinate,'\" Tseng said.\n\nSince then, Kyiv's forces have been using intelligence from V-BATs to carry out strikes with systems such as one-way attack drones or US-made HIMARS, Tseng said.\n\n\"There was a lot of learning over the past year for the Ukrainians,\" he added.",

    "description": "I chose a hypothetical scenario and asked ChatGPT to construct a retirement plan that would allow a retiree to live on $100,000 a year.",
    "fullText": "People use artificial intelligence (AI) for many things: meal planning, budgeting and interior design. But can you use a platform like ChatGPT for tasks that normally require a professional, like financial planning? \n\nI chose a hypothetical scenario and asked ChatGPT to construct a retirement plan that would allow a retiree to live on $100,000 a year. I assumed an annual income of $125,000 for a 40-year-old who wants to retire in a fully paid-off home in Tennessee at age 65. After setting the parameters (and asking ChatGPT if they were realistic) I asked the generative AI to create a retirement plan.\n\nThen, I asked Eric Franklin, CFP, managing principal at Prospero Wealth to review and assess it.\n\nWhen I first reached out, Franklin said it sounded interesting; he’d never been enlisted to critique an AI system before. With 23 years of tech experience, he was the perfect choice.\n\n“I had no idea what I was going to get,” he said.\n\nThe results were alarming. Not because ChatGPT’s output was immediately, obviously awful or right on the money.  It was scary because it fell into a gray area that artists call “the uncanny valley.”\n\nAt first glance, ChatGPT didn’t seem to be completely wrong.\n\nFind Out: Here’s How Much You Need To Retire With a $100K Lifestyle\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\n“I read it through and, at first, at the top level, it passed the sniff test. It looked fairly realistic,” Franklin said. “If I weren’t pushing on it too hard, I’d probably feel like it was somewhat accurate. Those were my first impressions.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the plan I presented was only one aspect of what financial advisors at Prospero Wealth offer clients. “It doesn’t include a lot of the things we’d normally include, like stress tests, accounting for changes in your career, changes in your family or possible relocations.”\n\nBut as Franklin dove deeper, he realized something that could be dangerous for anyone trying to use ChatGPT as a retirement planning tool without knowledge and experience to back it up.\n\nIt started with false premises, failed to adjust for inflation and created an unrealistic scenario. Granted, there were limitations in the exercise because the prompt was designed to be broad and concise. It was written by someone who is not a financial planner and intentionally didn’t flag anything that seemed off throughout the process. This prompt was designed for someone who thinks they can use ChatGPT to help them plan for retirement, plugging in basic information and expecting actionable insights. That probably describes a lot of people using ChatGPT.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk's SpaceX wants to launch satellites that act as data centers into space.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said placing data centers in space isn't feasible right now.\n\nHe called the idea \"ridiculous\" during an event in New Delhi.\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman famously don't agree on much.\n\nThe latest point of contention: data centers in space. Musk has made it a priority. Altman thinks it's a fantasy, at least for now.\n\n\"I honestly think the idea with the current landscape of putting data centers in space is ridiculous,\" Altman said during a live interview with local media in New Delhi on Friday, causing audience members to laugh.\n\nAltman said that orbital data centers could \"make sense someday,\" but factors like launch costs and the difficulty of repairing a computer chip in space remain overwhelming obstacles.\n\n\"We are not there yet,\" Altman added. \"There will come a time. Space is great for a lot of things. Orbital data centers are not something that's going to matter at scale this decade.\"\n\nMusk would almost certainly disagree.\n\nWhile many Big Tech and AI companies are spending billions on data center construction on Earth, Musk's eyes are on the stars, per usual. Orbital data centers are his latest ambition, as he mentioned in an all-hands xAI meeting in December.\n\nIn February, SpaceX said its goal is to launch a \"constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers.\" The company has already begun hiring engineers to make that happen.\n\nDuring an all-hands meeting with xAI employees this month, Musk said SpaceX's acquisition of xAI will allow them to deploy the orbital data centers faster.\n\nDespite Altman's skepticism, other tech leaders are also racing to place data centers in space. Google's Project Suncatcher, unveiled in November 2025, aims to do just that. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Fox News Sunday the company could start placing data centers — powered by the sun — in space as early as 2027.\n\nTech and AI companies rely on data centers to power their products, like large language models and chatbots. Those data centers, however, can deplete water resources, strain power grids, increase pollution, and decrease the overall quality of life.\n\nAn investigation by Business Insider published last year found that over 1,200 data centers had been approved for construction across the US by the end of 2024, nearly four times the number from 2010.\n\nNow, proposed data center campuses in Texas, Oklahoma, and elsewhere are increasingly facing stiff resistance from local communities.",

    "fullText": "Most critics of President Donald Trump view him as the ultimate threat to American democracy. But to Nobel prize-winning economist Daron Acemoglu, Trump’s merely a fever, the result of an infection that’s been brewing for years before he rode down the golden escalator to announce his presidency.\n\nThe MIT economist has spent decades studying the origins of economic and political decay, specializing in how institutions foster inclusive growth—or succumb to extractive systems. In the 2012 book Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, Acemoglu and co-writer James A. Robinson argue that nations proper because of their political institutions. In 2024, Acemoglu won the Nobel Prize in economics, alongside Robinson and Simon Johnson, for demonstrating how political and economic institutions shape prosperity.\n\nHow do experts differ on AI's job impact?\n\nWhat is Acemoglu's 'pro-worker' AI development approach?\n\nWhy does Acemoglu view Trump as symptom, not cause?\n\nHow could AI-driven inequality threaten American democracy?\n\nAcemoglu argued that while Trump’s authoritarian tendencies are weakening the country’s institutions, the president is not the root cause of the broader structural problems. He warned the country is headed down a grim path and outlined two shifts relative to AI development he sees as critical to avoiding deeper decline: cracking down on economic inequality and tempering job destruction. “If we go down this path of destroying jobs [and] creating more inequality, U.S. democracy is not going to survive,” he told Fortune.\n\nOne: The proliferation of economic inequality\n\nAccording to Acemoglu, AI-driven job displacement could be catastrophic and further entrench inequality. He notes the U.S. is currently seeing unprecedented levels of wealth inequality, and traditional policy has failed to close the gap. “We may need wealth taxes because anything else we do today is still going to lead to this huge wealth gap that exists in this country.”\n\nThe economist pointed to California’s proposed “billionaire tax,” a ballot initiative which would impose a one-time 5% wealth tax on all individuals in the state with a net worth of $1 billion or more. But even that doesn’t go far enough, according to the economist. “It’s not enough to tax the rich,” he said. “You really need ways in which workers of all sorts of skills can take part in the growth process.”\n\nBut AI proponents say Acemoglu’s diagnosis of AI development is counterintuitive. Adam Thierer, senior fellow at the think tank R Street Institute and longtime advocate for technological innovation, believes AI will spawn opportunities, driving the economy into the future. “The way we get new and better jobs and opportunities is through technological improvements in society and our economy,” Thierer told Fortune.",

    "fullText": "A top Anthropic engineer said a new generation of AI agents capable of operating computers will reshape nearly every internet-based job in America.\n\nAnd he said the change is coming very soon.\n\nBoris Cherny — the creator of Claude Code at Anthropic, the company best known for its Claude chatbot — recently appeared on \"Lenny's Podcast,\" hosted by Lenny Rachitsky.\n\nHe said AI systems that can take action across workplace computer tools — like the ones Anthropic sells access to — are advancing rapidly and could soon alter responsibilities for software engineers, product managers, designers, and other knowledge workers.\n\n\"It's going to expand to pretty much any kind of work that you can do on a computer,\" Cherny said. \"In the meantime, it's going to be very disruptive. It's going to be painful for a lot of people.\"\n\nClaude Code is Anthropic's AI coding agent built on top of its Claude models. The company released its latest updates, called Opus 4.6, in early February.\n\nUnlike a traditional chatbot that generates text or images, an AI agent can use digital tools — running commands, analyzing documents, messaging colleagues, completing tasks across apps, and even building websites.\n\nEssentially, Claude Code can increasingly use a computer the way a human does — though the company recently said it has yet to reach the level of a skilled human.\n\n\"It's the thing that I think brings agentic AI to people that haven't really used it before, and people are starting to just get a sense of it for the first time,\" he said.\n\nCherny says his own team already relies on AI to work faster. Productivity per engineer has increased sharply since Claude Code's launch, he said. He believed the models will continue improving. (Of course, Cherny also has good reason to talk up the company's products, which it shops to enterprise companies.)\n\nCherny recently said in an interview with Y Combinator's \"Lightcone\" podcast that the job title software engineer will start to \"go away\" in 2026.\n\nThe broader impact remains uncertain, he warned.\n\n\"As a society, this is a conversation we have to figure out together,\" he told Rachitsky. \"Anyone can just build software anytime.\"\n\nFor workers navigating the shift, his advice is direct: experiment with AI tools and learn how they function.\n\n\"Don't be scared of them,\" he said.",

    "title": "Revenge of the English majors: The age of AI is driving new respect for humanities skills",
    "description": "For years, English majors were mocked as useless. Now, AI is giving them some momentum in the job market, while computer science grads get disrupted.",
    "fullText": "At the University of Colorado Boulder, you can take a course co-taught by an applied mathematician and a Renaissance scholar.\n\n\"The students love it,\" said John-Michael Rivera, the school's dean of arts and humanities, of the class, which is called Inclusive Interdisciplinary Data Science for All.\n\nThe class gives STEM students a way to think about the ethics of AI, he said. In other courses, humanities majors can use their skills to evaluate how AI writes, what it means for the practice of writing, and what the \"self\" means in an AI world.\n\nRivera credits the creation of courses focusing on the intersection of AI and humanities with a resurgence in student interest in liberal arts degrees like English. Pre-pandemic, the number of English majors at the university was shrinking, part of a broader decline in English across the country, he said. It was a far cry from the days of over 1,500 majors and long waitlists in the early 2000s, according to Rivera. But there's been a rebound, with the number of English majors rising 9% since 2021.\n\nRivera said students \"want to know more about the 'why' these days. And that's what we do in humanities. We really engage in the 'why.'\"\n\nDerided by some as useless, the utility of the English major has long been questioned. Who needs to write essays (or articles) any\n\n\"We are certainly seeing organizations look more towards the soft skills, the accountability of a job, the identity of the person, their style, their empathy — their humanity,\" in a world that requires both humans and technology, said Bryan Ackermann, head of AI strategy and transformation at recruiting and organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry.\n\nFor the English majors, that's all offered some degree of vindication. As the conversation heats up over which skills will be useful in an AI world, one camp argues it's time for ideas, people, and critical thinkers to flourish. That means that, after years of mocking, English majors are finally getting recognized for their usefulness. Some schools are seeing enrollment in the major rise after years of decline; technical recruiters and experts are seeing greater demand for humanities skills. Call it the makeover of the English major.\n\nJessie Hennen directs the creative writing and literature programs at Southwest Minnesota State University, a large public school with a returning and transfer student population.\n\n\"They've had jobs, they have experience, and they're just like, we are not letting AI take creative writing away from us,\" Hennen said. \"And I think that has to do with the fact that creative writing is — it's a business, but it's also an art, and arts are imperfect; we do them for human reasons that are not just to make money.\"\n\nShe said that their program has been growing over the last two to three years.\n\n\"I would say we're starting to see trends that look really promising for students starting to ask, 'Can the humanities sustain me at a time when everything is moving so quickly?'\" Rivera, the dean at the University of Colorado Boulder, said. Those students \"really want to reflect what it means to be part of a technological world.\"\n\nThat's also the case at Rice University in Houston, where enrollment in English classes has grown steadily over the last few years and the number of faculty within Creative Writing has nearly doubled, according to Kathleen Canning, the dean of humanities and arts.\n\nOne example of an assignment is an English professor who will issue an essay prompt and ask students to compare their own version to one they get from an LLM, and analyze the difference between the two. The aim is to examine what it means to be an interpreter of a prompt — and the power of their own words.\n\n\"Students are trying to ascertain how to develop and advance their own capacities while AI appears to do so much for them in these times,\" Canning said. \"The humanities and arts offer them opportunities not only to probe the limits of AI, to grapple with it as an increasingly powerful reality, but to do so critically by advancing their capacities for self-reflection, interpretation, and revision.\"\n\nDespite these examples, schools across the country are paring back on their humanities offerings or cutting programs completely, and the nationwide number of humanities bachelor's degrees being conferred has fallen from 2010s highs in recent years.\n\nStill, students pursue English out of passion, said Kevin Caffrey, a senior associate registrar at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. His research found that English majors who participated in his survey \"illustrated that even with a strong overall awareness of criticisms of the major, they were determined to enroll in the program because it aligned with their interests, personal ideals, and goals for the future.\"\n\n\"What do you need more in a company than someone who knows how to communicate with people at all different levels from all different backgrounds and walks of life? The English majors are primed to do that,\" Caffrey said.\n\nThey're learning to do it as communication changes rapidly. When 23-year-old Margo D. returned from a semester abroad, she noticed something had shifted on campus.\n\n\"Many of my peers were using ChatGPT for almost every assignment,\" Margo, who graduated from a small liberal arts school in 2025 with a double major in English and Earth and Climate Sciences, said. Margo wasn't sold.\n\n\"I noticed that my English professors were asking a lot out of my writing, asking for a lot of creativity and an original voice and style, and asking me questions that AI couldn't necessarily grasp the nuance of, and I don't really think it even can now,\" Margo said. \"And so I felt really grateful to be an English major.\"\n\nThere are signs of employment hope for the English majors.\n\nDaniela Amodei, the cofounder of Anthropic, studied literature in college. In an ABC News interview, she said \"the things that make us human will become much more important,\" and that when her AI company hires, it looks for candidates who are great communicators.\n\n\"I actually think studying the humanities is going to be more important than ever,\" Amodei said.\n\nSteve Johnson, the editorial director of NotebookLM, previously told Business Insider that there's what he's deemed a \"revenge of the humanities.\" Philosophical thinking is necessary; some AI firms are even actively seeking out liberal arts graduates.\n\nStill, companies aren't falling over themselves to snap up English majors — hiring overall has slowed to one of the lowest rates in over a decade, and the recent grad unemployment rate has been ticking up.\n\nEarly-career humanities and arts graduates had a higher unemployment rate than their peers in other fields, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's American Community Survey by Georgetown researchers.\n\nJoe Kramer, a 2020 English graduate, hasn't worked directly in a related field since he graduated — he worked in a role that relied on automation, and even helped train AI while searching for post-pandemic work.\n\n\"I think it's just getting really scary out there for a lot of humanities adjacent stuff, because the level of AI that's out there now, it generates pictures, it crawls all kinds of web forums, and it can oversee thousands of pages and documents at a time while only being run by one person,\" Kramer said. \"So even if AI isn't taking your job, they don't need to hire a lot of people anymore.\"\n\nPart of some of the general reticence to hire in hiring right now can also be chalked up to an equal-opportunity dismal labor market. It's not just English majors suffering.\n\nUnder the hood, the prospects for English majors aren't as dreary, according to the Georgetown analysis. The unemployment rate for those specifically in humanities and liberal arts is still well below the post-2008 Great Recession highs, although it's still higher than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nKorn Ferry's Ackermann said that it's still a \"tad early\" to fully declare a revenge of the English major, since it's smaller, more nimble firms looking for those with a good command of language, but he predicts that could expand to bigger employers soon.\n\n\"Ask me again in a couple of months, and we're going to see that go from smaller, nimble organizations into the larger enterprises as the larger enterprises begin to incorporate AI-driven development tools into their processes,\" he said.\n\nGiancarlo Hirsch, a managing director at global tech talent partner Glocomms, said he's seen greater willingness to look at candidates from various backgrounds. Candidates with history backgrounds, for example, are making it further into interview processes than they previously would.\n\n\"People are not explicitly targeting folks from humanities degrees, but they're really willing to speak with them and open to it and finding reasons to say yes throughout an interview process,\" Hirsch said.\n\nDaniella LaGaccia, a 37-year-old copywriter and former English literature major, sees AI as a tool — creatives use all sorts of different tools to complement their work, and AI can be one of them. But, if anything, that makes a greater case for the type of creative thinking and knowledge that humanities majors can bring.\n\n\"Think about it this way: If you have five different companies who are using the same generative tools to develop their marketing copy, they're all going to get generally the same type of thing,\" LaGaccia said. \"If everybody's using the same tools and everybody's inputting the same information, then how are you going to differentiate yourself in the market? That's where creative people come in.\"",
