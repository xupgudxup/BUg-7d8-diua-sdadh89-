    "fullText": "If Elon Musk and Sam Altman like each other, they hide it well.\n\nIn the latest turn in the rivalry, the two are battling over the top spot on the list of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nWhile the two cofounded OpenAI together back in 2015, the partnership has frayed spectacularly since.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018 and later founded rival startup, xAI. Musk or his company, xAI, has filed lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI held a secondary share sale in October that valued it at $500 billion, taking the lead from Musk's SpaceX by a cool $100 billion.\n\nNot one to cede ground to a rival, Musk is now planning his own secondary share sale at SpaceX, according to an internal letter to employees seen by multiple outlets. It would value the company at a whopping $800 billion. If that happens soon, it means Musk would have only let Altman hold the mantle for a couple of months.\n\nMusk also confirmed on X this week that the company is exploring a blockbuster initial public offering, which might be the only way OpenAI can regain its lead as a private company. OpenAI this year restructured its business, which would allow it to also pursue its own eye-watering IPO in the future.\n\nWhile this valuation battle between the two billionaires is maybe cringeworthy theater for the average earner, it underscores a significant shift: investors are pouring unprecedented money into technologies once viewed as speculative science projects.\n\nSpaceX, which aims to make life multi-planetary and colonize Mars, and OpenAI, which seeks to develop a theoretical AI that can reason like humans, are two of the most visible examples, but they are part of a broader surge in frontier-tech valuations. AI, robotics, and defense tech startups have all notched multibillion-dollar valuations in the past year — bubble be damned.",

    "description": "Companies like Meta are offering huge pay packages for top AI talent. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, however, says he isn't giving in to the pressure.",
    "fullText": "The talent wars continue to rage across Silicon Valley as companies vie for the best and brightest minds in AI. There is, however, one major AI company that says it is not giving in to pressure.\n\nMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said on Bloomberg Podcasts that he doesn't plan to compete with tech giants like Meta by offering top dollar for talent.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's matching those things,\" Suleyman said of the $100 million signing bonuses Meta has been offering engineers, and the $250 million packages it's been using to lure top AI researchers.\n\n\"I think that Zuck's taken a particular approach that involves sort of hiring a lot of individuals rather than maybe creating a team, and I don't really think that's the right approach,\" he said.\n\nSuleyman said he was \"very selective\" about new hires when he previously worked at DeepMind. At Microsoft, he said he has hired \"incrementally,\" prioritizing candidates who aligned with the team's culture and had the right skills, and let go of those who did not.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the top ranks of AI talent are commanding pay packages in the millions.\n\nIn June, Meta spent $14.3 billion on an investment in Scale AI — a deal widely seen as an acquihire of its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Google also made a similar move, acquiring the leaders of Windsurf, an AI coding platform. in a deal worth $2.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that Meta tried to lure his employees away with $100 million signing bonuses, which Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said OpenAI later offered to match.\n\nEven at smaller startups, someone in an AI leadership role can command between $300,000 and $400,000 in base pay, Shawn Thorne, managing director at executive search firm True Search, previously told Business Insider.\n\nSuleyman said \"rotation\" is part of the industry, given the small pool of talent. He cited Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI, Amar Subramanya, decamping to Apple earlier this month as an example.\n\nMicrosoft recently brought in several new hires from DeepMind and OpenAI, he said.\n\n\"There's certainly no 'no poach' agreements, that would not be legal,\" he added. \"People can go work for whoever they want to work for.\"",

    "description": "The narrative of boom and bust is familiar—but also out of step with the possibilities of a new technology.",
    "fullText": "In the following weeks, with further help from me and A.I., Peter made a game based on the light-cycle duels in the movie “Tron,” complete with music and a score-keeping system. He sketched the beginnings of a “library simulator,” and finished his own arcade game, Dot in Space, about a tiny spaceship travelling at warp speed. Whenever he hit a potentially momentum-killing bump in the road, A.I. enabled us to roll through it. At my request, the systems began pointing us toward more sophisticated coding environments—Construct, GDevelop, Godot Engine, GameMaker—and suggesting more ambitious projects. Last weekend, he stayed up late, programming a polished version of Asteroids while wolfing down Cheerios and gulping from his water bottle as though it were an energy drink.\n\nSince Peter is a kid, and I’m a dad, all this can seem cute and quaint. Isn’t it nice that A.I. can help a young person learn to code, and an older one become a coding tutor? But consider what’s happening from a different perspective. In “The Wealth of Nations,” Adam Smith described the “acquired and useful abilities” of a worker as a kind of “fixed capital”—something akin to a hunk of real estate or piece of equipment. It wasn’t until the nineteen-sixties that an economist named Theodore Schultz coined the term “human capital” to describe the ongoing, dynamic process through which people invest in improving themselves. Schultz realized that individuals spend a lot of time, money, and effort becoming more capable. They go to night school, network, read self-help books, and tend to use their free time “to improve skills and knowledge.” The work of improving human capital often happens out of sight. But the “simple truth,” he argued, was “that people invest in themselves and that these investments are very large.” Schultz suggested that these investments, which improve “the quality of human effort,” might account “for most of the impressive rise in the real earnings per worker” that economists had observed in the preceding decades.\n\nToday, it’s obvious that companies and organizations benefit greatly from people with lots of human capital. Meetings are more useful when they involve knowledgeable participants; a product improves when the team building it possesses a wide range of skills. What’s less obvious is that companies and organizations simultaneously struggle to recognize and take advantage of changes in human capital. Suppose someone is hired to do one job, and then acquires skills that qualify her for another. Ideally, the organizational chart would shift around her as she becomes more capable; in practice, the job is often a prison. And when a worker breaks out of that prison, by getting a job elsewhere, she takes her human capital with her. For this reason, from the perspective of the company, it’s almost as though the ideal hire is someone who works feverishly to build up their human capital until their first day of work, and then suddenly slows down, becoming a highly skilled cog in the machine. Organizations want their workers to continue improving themselves—but not too fast, lest they outgrow the systems in which they’re enmeshed.",

    "fullText": "Instead of writing my tech comms predictions for next year like I did in 2024, I’ve written a fictionalized account of my day as a technical writer in 2030. It’ll be interesting to see whether we get there or not. Take it as a window into a possible future, one where AI usage is safer, more regulated, and better integrated with our workflows (as it should be).\n\nMy working day starts at 8:30am, after I’ve dropped my kids at school, rushed home, and prepared some coffee surrogate (nobody can afford real coffee anymore). I open the laptop and Chuck is there – it’s always there, like a trusty butler, ready to summarize what’s been going on in pull requests, Slack threads, Jira tickets, and a plethora of other information systems nobody can quite tame. Its summary connects the dots between my current priorities and what’s happening in the teams I’m attached to, helping me decide what to work on next. Trying to be helpful, it offers to deal with some of the mentions I’ve got by opening pull requests; I let it do so with a small docs bug. The rest I’ll want to deal with myself. It asks me how I feel and gently reminds me that I’ve still got some PTO available. Chuck’s such a class act.\n\nI’m in a team with several other technical writers, but for the most part I work with Chuck, which is what we call the in-house AI agent that we use. Chuck is a vast local language model capable of running on the M10 Silicon processor that powers my laptop. It’s a state-of-the-art multimodal LLM whose pedigree I can trace back to the last iterations of Claude Omni 7.5, before Anthropic went bankrupt and got acquired by Apple. As most corporate models, Chuck is ISO 42001, Turing, and EUAI certified, which means that it’s audited every year for security, governance, and legality of its training materials. Chuck is fine-tuned into several variants depending on the goal; the one I use is chuck-256b-writer. We run it in CI pipelines and locally in IDEs or CLI clients. We can also invite it to meetings as an artificial participant. I sometimes ask my own Chuck to attend calls on my behalf as Chuck-Fabri.\n\nThe thing I like the most about Chuck is that I can configure its specializations by turning modules on or off through the Silicon Brain app. When I want it to play the developer, I add several coding modules; when I want it to help me author docs, I turn on the style guide and grammarian modules, and so on. I can also ask Chuck to spawn copies of itself to roleplay users and readers based on support ticket and sales call interactions. When I do that, Chuck politely asks me to call it through other names, so as not to break character, something I duly comply with. Most system tools and APIs are already compatible with the agentic environment I use, so Chuck knows how to perform most operations on its own. An important detail: to summon Chuck, I need to first plug a physical key into the laptop. The key comes with a red button to immediately stop Chuck in case it starts operating bizarrely. Never had to use it.\n\nIt’s 11am already. I’ve been working with Chuck to write a new docs set for a new feature, telling it how I wanted the docs to fit into the existing architecture and instructing it to tweak and edit. It almost always gets 80% of the work done, though I often have to intervene to rearrange, cut, or otherwise rewrite sections. This hasn’t changed since the first days of GPT and it’ll never improve, because LLMs are not intelligent. They’re the most useful word automation tools at my disposal though, which I keep in check through deterministic tools and linters. Chuck is able to create diagrams, take screenshots of the product through an internal tool, and test the instructions and code snippets itself. When I feel unsure about its output, I ask it to verify what it’s just written through semantic internal search, or by calling its cloud cousin, Chad, which is able to provide answers from federated internal sources. All we do together, Chuck documents internally and remembers in its permanent context.\n\nEven though I’m using a local, non-monetized, and fully audited model that consumes the equivalent of a lightbulb worth of power, I still can’t shake the feeling of being a reverse centaur at times. It helps that Chuck comes with several built-in safeguards meant to prevent me from overworking or spending too much time without interacting with other human beings. At 1pm, which is lunch time in Spain, Chuck reminds me about taking a break. It refuses to continue if it detects stress in my text, vocal, or computer usage patterns. While my interactions with Chuck on the laptop are private and encrypted, it’s allowed to inform my manager or call my designated emergency contact in case of distress. I let Chuck access my vitals on the smartwatch and schedule calls with me on a regular basis to see how I’m doing. Since I work alone at home, this makes me feel somewhat safer.\n\nI didn’t tell you, but my current job title is Augmented Writer. My mission is to ensure that the words that humans and machines use to interact with our products are the most effective at reducing confusion and error, while they maximize effectiveness and user satisfaction. I’m augmented because I do this in concert with Chuck, which expands my existing skills in numerous ways. Without my brain, though, Chuck couldn’t do my job, because it doesn’t really care and, more importantly, because it’s not allowed to. One of the conditions imposed by the current legislation is that AI cannot operate in fully autonomous mode without human supervision. Our docs and UIs, in fact, bear a certificate of human authorship that discloses the amount of AI intervention. By law, all AI generated artifacts must produce fingerprinting patterns that can’t be tampered with, which is trickier with text, but since we must keep full audit logs of LLM usage, this can be established upon request by any competent authority, including the Turing police.\n\nIn the end, my role is more of an orchestrator than that of an author, and I’m fine with that. Software engineering, the field I serve, is an exercise in consensual imagination whose goal is to find repeatable ways of processing reality into manageable chunks of data. Reality is unmistakably raw and imperfect, a stream of floating points and broken strings running through distributed systems: one cannot tame it through clever algorithms, but it can be reduced to abstractions and data structures and binary blobs. Each of those entities has a name; they all relate to each other through words. It’s part of my job to understand those words and intervene when they don’t bring clarity. It’s then also my job to explain how those words are able to handle their parent reality. The docs I orchestrate with Chuck’s help are the artifacts that chronicle and explain the motions of data as it enters a machine and exits in shapes and configurations that are helpful to users.\n\nIt’s 5pm and I’m bidding Chuck farewell. During the night, it will work on some optional docs polish and politely present its work to me in the morning. As I log off and extract the hardware key from the laptop, I think that without the words Chuck and I produced, the machine would be opaque to its operators, a smooth wall without doors or handles. Product truth is at my disposal to weave into a fabric of meaning and possibility, into spells that unlock abilities in autonomous agents, be they organic or artificial. I am an enabler of thought and action. Getting here wasn’t easy, but I feel better knowing that I can continue defending the importance of words with the help of the most clever thesaurus ever created.",

    "title": "My husband used ChatGPT to write our anniversary card. Surprisingly, I'm not mad about it.",
    "description": "I was convinced AI was ruining human connection. Then my husband used it to write the most heartfelt anniversary card I've ever received.",
    "fullText": "As a geriatric millennial and a licensed psychologist, I often lament technological changes that I see as threatening to human interactions, such as AI.\n\nEven though I try to find the gray in all areas of life, I've been rather black-and-white about AI because I worry it's diminishing our ability to relate to one another.\n\nHowever, a recent experience with my husband has made me more curious about AI.\n\nWe recently celebrated our ninth wedding anniversary, and unbeknownst to me at the time, my husband used GenAI to write my card. He was traveling at the time, so he sent flowers and chocolate, with a card attached. The flowers were severely underwhelming, and I'm not just being a brat. My husband even called the company upon returning to express his frustration with how different they appeared in person.\n\nBut when I read the note accompanying the tiny arrangement, I teared up right away. It was heartwarming, meaningful, and really on the nose.\n\nMy husband's lack of romantic effusiveness has historically been frustrating to me. He has made steady progress in this area, and even ending cards with \"love\" more frequently marks such improvement. So, this note felt in line with his desire to share more emotionality, and I was touched that he'd taken that step just because he knew it would make me happy.\n\nMy husband knows about my big feelings about AI, and he shares many of them. It seems like everyone relies on ChatGPT for relationship advice, and the most common use of META AI right now is to ask for guidance about difficult conversations with loved ones or bosses. I see it in my therapy practice all the time, and I'm skeptical about how sound the AI advice my clients receive actually is.\n\nSo, when I, a historically staunch critic of all things AI, found out that my husband had used ChatGPT to create our anniversary card, I admit I had some strong feelings.\n\nAs lacking in the sentimental department as my husband can be, I am at the opposite end of the spectrum — a hopeless romantic, as they say. I save just about every card I get, tucked into a neat little box. When I reread my husband's card before putting it away, I found myself lingering on some of the words. \"…life we built together\" especially sat with me. It's a common phrase, but it's not in my husband's emotional lexicon. It almost sounded like somebody else's voice. And given that we can't go more than a few days without reading about how AI will ruin people's ability to think for themselves, I had that thought. \"Did AI write one of the sweetest parts of my anniversary card?\"\n\nI was delicate. I reiterated how much I'd enjoyed our belated anniversary celebration before I asked: \"Did you use AI to write our anniversary card?\" He copped to it, grinning from ear to ear.\n\nShockingly to me, I wasn't mad. This discovery actually opened a door for us to talk about how useful it is to get a little help writing a card. The pre-printed messages often feel overly mushy, and the \"blank inside\" cards ask us to get vulnerable in expressing our emotions. For many, including my husband, that's incredibly difficult. The result is often a message that neither the giver nor the receiver feels particularly happy about.\n\nBut this year's note was perfectly balanced. The right amount of gush without the melodrama. I felt seen, and I felt it captured our relationship well.\n\nIf AI can help people express their love for one another, that can't be a bad thing, right? Besides, is asking ChatGPT for help any less authentic than using a pre-printed Hallmark message? ChatGPT provided more accurate information about our relationship than a Hallmark writer ever could, and it offered guidance for a note that made me feel loved and appreciated.\n\nWhile the idea of a world in which chatbots replace our friends and therapists is still deeply concerning to me, this recent experience has helped me find the gray in my previously black-and-white view: I don't know that I'll ever come around to AI replacing human connection, but I do see the utility now in using AI to help us enhance our existing human connections.\n\nAt the very least, I look forward to more anniversaries with really accurate love notes.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: More than 150 anonymous channels using cheap AI tools to spread false stories about Keir Starmer, study finds\n\nYouTube channels spreading fake, anti-Labour videos have amassed more than a billion views this year, as opportunists attempt to use AI-generated content to profit from political division in the UK.\n\nMore than 150 channels have been detected in the last year that promote anti-Labour narratives, as well as outright fake and inflammatory accusations about Keir Starmer.\n\nA study seen by the Guardian has found the channels have accumulated 5.3m subscribers and have created more than 56,000 videos, with a total of almost 1.2bn views in 2025. The network of anonymous channels includes alarmist rhetoric, AI scripts and British narrators to attract hits.\n\nStarmer is personally targeted. The prime minister was either named in the video title or description 15,600 times.\n\nReset Tech, the non-profit group that produced the research, said the channels were part of a global trend to produce synthetic propaganda on the platform. It pointed to the proliferation of cheap AI tools that could be deployed to make a quick profit from divisive topics.\n\nOne channel called Britain News-night talked about Starmer and Reeves facing arrest. Another, TheUKPoliticalBrief, touted videos on the “explosive truth” about immigrant crime and marches on Westminster.\n\nThe UK NewsCore channel focused on how Nigel Farage was ousting Starmer, and claimed the prime minister was “sacked live” and thrown out of parliament.\n\nOther videos featured bizarre, fabricated stories about a row between the royal family and the government. One channel, Gold Up!, said the dispute had left Starmer “melting down on live TV”.\n\nSome of the videos and channels were removed by YouTube’s checks. However, all 150 were taken down when the platform was approached by the Guardian. Reset Tech said some channels had created tens or hundreds of similar videos without being deplatformed.\n\nThe research found similar channels operating in German, French, Spanish and Polish, targeting other politicians or political issues. In total, it mapped 420 problematic channels operating in Europe. Reset Tech said Russian-speaking creators operate some of the channels.\n\nIt is believed channels aimed at the UK were being driven by opportunistic creators trying to monetise political division over issues like immigration, rather than overseas political actors. However, it said their presence still posed a risk to public trust.\n\nThe content has caused concern inside Labour. “The rise of fake news online is a serious threat to our democracy,” a spokesperson said. “The public will be rightly alarmed that democratically elected leaders and institutions are being undermined by bad faith foreign state actors and those seeking to profit from misinformation.\n\n“We’ve already seen attempts from overseas to influence fair elections and manipulate public opinion both here and abroad.\n\n“The government is stepping up its efforts to work with online platforms to tackle this scourge on free and fair democracy. But it’s important that tech bosses take this threat seriously and live up to their obligations to remove this type of content wherever it’s found.”\n\nDylan Sparks, UK director of Reset Tech, called for YouTube to take swifter action. “Malicious actors are permitted by YouTube to spread synthetic ‘news’ that disrupts political debate in the UK, while also earning revenue from it,” he said. “This AI-generated, low cost content spreads across the platform undetected, revealing clear weaknesses in YouTube’s monetisation and content moderation systems.\n\n“This specific network focuses on the prime minister and Labour government, but the same loopholes could be exploited by any hostile actor to push an agenda. Because social media platforms profit from engagement, their business model creates an in-built tension between enforcing their own policies and reducing the spread of malicious content that drives revenue.\n\n“The rapid spread of AI has also introduced new risks to the online environment, and platforms need to move faster and invest more to address them.”\n\nA YouTube spokesperson said: “Spam and deceptive practices that try to take advantage of the YouTube community are not allowed on the platform, which is why the channels flagged by the Guardian have all been removed.\n\n“We enforce our policies consistently, regardless of political viewpoint expressed, or how the content is generated. Our teams work around the clock to monitor for harmful content, taking swift action as needed.”\n\nYouTube is now working with Reset Tech over its findings. The platform said its systems prominently feature authoritative news content on the YouTube homepage, in search results, and through recommendations. It has removed more than 2.1m channels for violating its community guidelines.\n\nMinisters have already formed an online advertising taskforce to see what action can be taken to address the advertising-based monetisation of harmful and misleading content.",

    "description": "Rivian executives said AI and autonomy not only makes sense for their company, but also reflects the direction of the entire auto industry.",
    "fullText": "If there were a Venn diagram of a driver who wants an adventure-focused car with off-roading capability on one side and a driver who wants a software-centric, computer-first car that could drive itself on the other, would there be a lot of overlap between the two circles?\n\nOn Thursday, Rivian hosted an \"Autonomy & AI Day\" at the company's research and development hub in Palo Alto, where hundreds witnessed the EV maker's grand leap into the future: a highly integrated AI assistant and fully autonomous driving capability, all powered by Rivian's very own silicon chip.\n\nWassym Bensaid, Rivian's Chief Software Officer, called the move a \"profound platform shift which changes our product and everything we do at the company.\"\n\nBensaid is among the key executives leading the charge toward Rivian's \"AI-defined vehicle,\" along with James Philbin, VP of Autonomy & AI, and Vidya Rajagopalan, Senior VP of Rivian's electrical hardware division.\n\nDuring the event, I had the chance to talk to Bensaid and Philbin about the pivot and whether it makes sense for a company that, since its inception, has branded itself as an adventure-forward vehicle, or if this is just a response to consumer demand.\n\nPhilbin, who was a director at Zoox and Waymo before joining Rivian in 2022, told me that pursuing autonomy has long been part of the company's trajectory rather than an overnight decision.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Philbin sees a rising \"tide\" in consumer demand for some level of autonomy — especially as robotaxis become mainstream.\n\n\"We are starting to see that autonomy is a really important purchase decision with customers, and especially customers who come from vehicles with maybe high levels of autonomy,\" he said. \"They don't go back.\"\n\nPhilbin said that having a high-level advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) was cited as one of the \"top three purchase reasons\" for Rivian customers. However, the demand will extend to all automakers, he said.\n\n\"I just see it becoming such a key purchase driver for vehicles going forward,\" Philbin said. \"And I think every OEM will have to deliver these features to customers in some way.\"\n\nA year ago, Bensaid told me that the future of cars would be hands-free, and that using buttons or fiddling with the touchscreen would be \"an anomaly.\"\n\n\"It's a bug, it's not a feature,\" he said at the time. \"Ideally, you would want to interact with your car through voice. And the problem today is that most voice assistants are just broken.\"\n\nThursday's demonstration of the Rivian Assistant, an in-car AI assistant that can control certain vehicle functions, brought Bensaid's vision to life. I saw the Rivian Assistant pull up navigation directions and control the direction of the air vents through voice control.\n\nBensaid told me at the event that \"cars and automotive are probably the killer app for AI.\"\n\n\"In your 30-minute or 45-minute commute every day, you want to get your time back, you want to really take control of your time,\" he said.\n\nWhen I asked the software chief where the overlap was between Rivian's adventure brand and its AI push, Bensaid said the company \"inspires many types of customers.\"\n\n\"I think at the core of the brand, Rivian wants people to explore the world,\" he said, and that there were different ways to do so, whether that's by going off-road or exploring the world through technology.\n\nAt the same time, Bensaid said, \"At heart, we are a technology company, so technology is really a big part of the user experience, how we see ourselves, and how we present ourselves to the world.\"\n\nBensaid's statement touches upon another key focus beyond the automaker's line-up of premium trucks and SUVs: software licensing.\n\nRivian's joint venture with the German automotive giant Volkswagen was a clear sign of its intent to license its software platform to other automakers in the future.\n\nPart of the tech will include self-driving capabilities, which the entire automotive world — legacy and startup — is exploring, Steve Man, senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told me.\n\n\"We don't really know at the end of the day if there's going to be a huge mass adoption,\" Man said of autonomy. Still, the analyst adds that \"it's a must\" for car makers to pursue.\n\nSales of Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised reflect that uncertainty. CEO Elon Musk has presented FSD as the key driver of the company's valuation even though the adoption rate of FSD remains at around 12%, Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's Chief Financial Officer, said in October.\n\nThe automotive industry still remains bullish on autonomy and AI.\n\nNissan partnered with UK-based Wayve, which develops software for advanced driver assistance systems. General Motors teased plans for an eyes-off driving system for 2028. And Mercedes unveiled a hands-off, eyes-off ADAS a few years ago.\n\nA recent Bloomberg Intelligence report said that nearly half of C-suite auto executives surveyed said they expect AI to lift sales and profits by 9% over the next two to three years.\n\n\"From a business perspective, you don't know if it is going to take off, but you need to invest some money now so that you're not behind,\" Man said, \"and you have the opportunity to roll it out if it is something that people want.\"",

    "description": "Harsh Varshney, who works on Chrome AI security at Google, shares four tips for protecting your data and identity when you talk to AI chatbots.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 31-year-old Harsh Varshney, who works at Google and lives in New York. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAI has quickly become a silent partner in our daily lives, and I can't imagine life without AI tools.\n\nDay-to-day, they help me with deep research, note-taking, coding, and online searches.\n\nBut my job means I'm very aware of the privacy concerns associated with using AI. I've worked at Google since 2023 and spent two years as a software engineer on the privacy team, building infrastructure to protect user data. I then switched to the Chrome AI security team, where I help secure Google Chrome from malicious threats, like hackers and those who use AI agents to conduct phishing campaigns.\n\nAI models use data to generate helpful responses, and we users need to protect our private information so that harmful entities, like cybercriminals and data brokers, can't access it.\n\nHere are four habits I've made that I believe are essential for protecting my data while using AI.\n\nSometimes, a false sense of intimacy with AI can lead people to share information online that they never would otherwise. AI companies may have employees who work on improving the privacy aspects of their models, but it's not advisable to share credit card details, Social Security numbers, your home address, personal medical history, or other personally identifiable information with AI chatbots.\n\nDepending on the version being used, the information shared with public AI chatbots can be used to train future models and generate responses that are more relevant. This could result in \"training leakage,\" where the model memorizes personal information about one user and later regurgitates it in responses to another. Plus, there's the risk of data breaches, which would expose what you've shared with a chatbot.\n\nI treat AI chatbots like a public postcard. If I wouldn't write a piece of information on a postcard that could be seen by anyone, I wouldn't share it with a public AI tool. I'm not confident about how my data could be used for future training.\n\nIt's important to identify whether you're using a more public AI tool or an enterprise-grade one.\n\nWhile it's uncertain how conversations are used for training public AI models, companies can pay for \"enterprise\" models. Here, models aren't typically meant to train on user conversations, so it's safer for employees to talk about their work and company projects.\n\nThink of it like having a conversation in a crowded coffee shop where you could be overheard, versus a confidential meeting in your office that stays within the room.\n\nThere have reportedly been instances where employees have accidentally leaked company data to ChatGPT. If you work on unreleased company projects or are trying to get a patent, you probably don't want to discuss your plans with a non-enterprise-grade chatbot due to the risk of leakage.\n\nI don't discuss projects I'm working on at Google with public chatbots. Instead, I use an enterprise model, even for tasks as small as editing a work email. I'm much more comfortable sharing my information because my conversations aren't used for training, but I still minimize the personal information I share.\n\nAI chatbots usually keep a history of your conversations, but I recommend deleting it on both enterprise and public models regularly to protect your user privacy in the long term. Due to the risk of your account being compromised, it's a good precautionary habit to have, even if you're confident you aren't putting private data into the tools.\n\nOnce, I was surprised that an enterprise Gemini chatbot was able to tell me my exact address, even though I didn't remember sharing it. It turned out, I had previously asked it to help me refine an email, which included my address. Because the tool has long-term memory features, enabling it to remember information from previous conversations, it could identify what my address was and retain it.\n\nSometimes, if I'm searching for things I don't want the chatbot to remember, I'll use a special mode, a bit like incognito mode, where the bots don't store my history or use the information to train models. ChatGPT and Gemini call this the \"temporary chat\" feature.\n\nIt's better to use AI tools that are well-known and are more likely to have clear privacy frameworks and other guardrails in place.\n\nOther than Google's products, I like to use OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude.\n\nIt's also helpful to review the privacy policies of any tools you use. Sometimes, they'll explain more about how your data is used to train the model. In the privacy settings, you can also look for a section with the option to \"improve the model for everyone.\" By making sure that setting is turned off, you're preventing your conversations from being used for training.\n\nAI technology is incredibly powerful, but we must be cautious to ensure our data and identities are safe when we use it.\n\nDo you have a story to share about using AI to help you at work?

    "description": "Though Nigel Williams is looking for AI proficiency, the BlackRock exec shared one part of the application process where the tech doesn't belong.",
    "fullText": "If you want to work at BlackRock, make sure you're using AI — just not too much.\n\nNigel Williams, BlackRock's global head of talent acquisition, said that AI is shifting his hiring priorities, and that fluency with the technology is now key to any strong application. However, he warns against depending on it in the interview process.\n\n\"We want to hire people that are curious, that understand that AI is here,\" he told Business Insider, especially because it's embedded in functions across the world's biggest asset manager.\n\nThe strongest applicants can demonstrate that they are both digitally native and comfortable with various AI tools, and that they're curious about future capabilities. Young talent is \"upskilling itself to meet the moment,\" Williams said, since applicants without a computer science background often demonstrate AI proficiency. Everyone, he added, will need to have a basic understanding of prompt engineering and how to question AI outputs.\n\n\"In this age of AI, the talent skills that I think we need more than ever are people that are curious, have a questioning mindset, and are willing to not just trust what the model puts out there, but also make sure we're continuing to pressure test that,\" he said. Strong interpersonal and relationship-building skills are also becoming even more important, he said.\n\nWilliams said that his team is figuring out how to assess applicants' AI abilities and is mindful of making sure people without tech backgrounds don't feel intimidated. He's interested in how people use the technology in their personal, academic, or work lives, and said his team is still fine-tuning how to assess that in the interview process.\n\nDespite Williams' new focus on how applicants engage with AI, he's not using it to screen candidates. As of now, he uses AI to schedule interviews.\n\nThere's such a thing as too much AI in the application process, though.\n\nWilliams said recruiters and hiring managers have told people ahead of an interview not to use an AI tool, sometimes to little avail.\n\n\"It is quite common. You will sometimes see people looking to the left or the right. Our interviewing teams, if they're in the middle of doing that, will pick up on that and be able to say, 'Hey, we do want to make sure that you're staying focused,'\" Williams said.\n\nBlackRock employs around 24,600 people in more than 30 countries, according to a November 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some 21,100 people worked at the firm as of the end of 2024, according to that year's annual report.\n\nBlackRock has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its equity business. At the annual New York Times DealBook Summit this week, its CEO, Larry Fink, said that there will be \"some huge winners and huge failures\" with the technology.",

    "description": "Tips from an AI skeptic for working with a team which uses AI a lot.",
    "fullText": "So your team uses AI a lot. Maybe you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed by the amount of bad code, or just the volume of code, you’re having to review. I’ve been there too. While AI has gained popularity, I’ve worked with many teams in many industries. Here are some techniques and strategies I’ve adopted, as an AI skeptic, which have made reviewing AI generated code feel less taxing and more productive.\n\nBefore digging into what’s different, I think it’s worth taking a moment to recognize what’s the same. These things are true whether your PR was written by a human or an AI.\n\nTesting is software engineering, but is often viewed as less important by both humans and AI alike. The author may not have reviewed the tests as closely as the implementation. It’s well worth your time as a reviewer to make up that difference.\n\nSomething I try to keep in mind when reviewing AI-generated PRs, and honestly in life, is that perfect is the enemy of good. Not every comment will be resolved exactly how you’d prefer. Sometimes you’ll let things slide that you wish you hadn’t. But steady, incremental influence still matters. A review that nudges the codebase in the right direction is far better than disengaging and letting low-quality AI output accumulate unchecked. If you stay involved, ask questions, and keep the conversation open with your teammates and leadership, you retain the ability to shape the outcome.\n\nFinally, it’s worth remembering that advice like this only gets you so far. If your team is consistently flooding the codebase with poor AI-generated code, that’s ultimately not a tooling problem, it’s a people and process problem. Technology tends to amplify whatever dynamics already exist. The real work is helping the team move toward better habits and shared expectations. No one is trying to write bad code; they’re doing the best they know how. Thoughtful guidance, clear standards, and collaborative review are how you help them know better—and do better.\n\nWe've been helping engineering teams deliver exceptional products for over 20 years.

    "description": "The White House has promised to quadruple nuclear power by 2050.",
    "fullText": "The Palisades Nuclear Generating Station is nestled between sand dunes on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. It shut down for financial reasons in 2022. Three years later, it’s on the cusp of reopening, with hundreds of workers streaming through its security barriers every day.\n\nPalisades is on track to restart in early 2026. When it does, it will be the first nuclear plant in the United States to generate electricity again after being decommissioned. Nick Culp of Holtec, the company that owns the plant, said its revival is a response to a surge in demand for electricity.\n\n“We have seen [Michigan]’s baseload generation go offline at a rapid rate as they’ve moved away from fossil generation,” Culp said. “How do you backfill that when you see demand on the horizon like [artificial intelligence], like data storage, like keeping the lights on at home, and new manufacturing?”\n\nNuclear is part of the answer to that question, Culp said, and the government agrees. Michigan gave $300 million to the restart — part of its goal to have 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 — and the federal government gave the project a loan of more than $1.5 billion.\n\nThat money is part of the Trump administration’s investment in what it’s calling a “nuclear energy renaissance.” In May, the White House released a plan to quadruple American nuclear power by 2050, following a similar pledge from the Biden administration.\n\nMeeting that goal would require dozens of new reactors. But whether they’re traditional power plants or new designs, nuclear reactors are expensive and slow to build. Facing a crunch between climate goals and rising electricity demand, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa are reopening plants that closed just a few years ago.\n\nWhen the Palisades plant in Michigan closed in 2022, Jim Byrd said he left his office of more than two decades “with a heavy heart.”\n\nHe was working at a nuclear plant in Mississippi last year when he heard about the plan to reboot Palisades. Then he got the call he had been waiting for, asking him to come back.\n\n“Palisades is my home. These people are my family,” Byrd said. Since his return, he’s been training new employees in an exact replica of the reactor control room, right down to its 1960s pink-and-green color scheme.\n\nWhile the plant was in decent shape, recommissioning still required repairing equipment and overcoming mountains of paperwork.\n\n“We are creating a roadmap on how to do this, and the whole industry is watching,” said Byrd. “I had existing licensed operators that had a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission when we shut down, so we had to work on getting those back.”\n\nAll that work is worth it, he said, to get the plant back up and running.\n\n“What we're doing here is exciting,” said Byrd. “Having a reliable power source that keeps your electricity costs low, everybody should be rooting for that.”\n\nThe restart also attracted employees from elsewhere in the industry. The plant’s new chief nuclear officer, Rich Burroni, came from New York’s Indian Point Energy Center, which closed in 2021.\n\n“The trend five years ago was a lot of work on decommissioning,” he said, “and now that’s all changed.”\n\nMore change may be coming for Palisades. The Department of Energy said this month it will give Holtec up to $400 million in federal funding to build small modular reactors in Michigan. That technology could help speed up the deployment of new nuclear power in the future, according to many in the industry, but so far has not been commercially viable.\n\nFor now, restarting a plant costs less than a third of what it would take to build a new one, said Culp of Holtec.\n\n“When you factor in how long it takes to construct a new nuclear power plant, especially here in the United States, and the amount of money that goes into it,” he said, “it’s a pretty good value proposition.”\n\nMany of Palisades’ employees live within 10 miles of the plant, which means they could be exposed to a radioactive plume in an emergency.\n\nThat zone also includes the town of Covert, Michigan. Township supervisor Daywi Cook’s father helped build the plant in the 1960s.\n\n“I grew up with the sirens being tested. I think it was every last Saturday of the month,” Cook said. “It was just a normal thing.”\n\nHaving friends and family members who worked at the plant helped demystify nuclear power, she said, and she came to see the plant as part of the community.\n\nAt one point, taxes from the plant made up 40% of the township’s revenue. Now, as Covert’s township supervisor, Cook said she’s glad the plant is reopening.\n\n“Having that stability and having that employment available for folks who live here is something that I think was taken for granted for a very long time,” she said. “I think what's important is that we educate ourselves as residents near the plant and that Holtec continues to be a good neighbor in being transparent with the community.”\n\nZach Morris, head of the economic development group Market One, said Pallisades is an important piece of the local economy.\n\n“Southwest Michigan is a beautiful area. It's just a wonderful community of small towns. I call it Americana,” Morris said. “Americana needs electricity. So the good news is we have a really reliable source of power that is clean. It pays its employees well. So we're excited about being able to keep that online.”\n\nNot everyone is on board with the plant’s reopening. Environmental groups have sued to stop it, and protesters have raised concerns about the long-term storage of spent fuel next to the Great Lakes.\n\nWhile nuclear power does have a record of safety, many Americans remember the 1979 disaster at central Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island. One of the two reactors on the island had a partial meltdown and released radioactive gases into the environment. There were no deaths, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the accident “had no detectable health effects on plant workers or the public.”\n\nThat left the plant with only one working reactor, which produced power until 2019, when it shut down for financial reasons. Today, that reactor, like Palisades in western Michigan, is in the process of coming back online.\n\n“When you walk through the plant now, all the equipment is still there, but it's deathly quiet. You don't hear the hum of the motors, the steam going through the lines,” said Craig Smith, who is in charge of bringing back the plant at Three Mile Island, renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. “It's an eerie kind of feeling when you walk through the plant.”\n\nThat eerie feeling may soon be gone. A red LCD clock in Smith’s office counts down the hours until the plant’s reopening in late 2027, which is backed by a billion-dollar loan from the Trump Administration.\n\nThe recommissioned reactor on Three Mile Island will pump 835 megawatts into the regional grid, but all that electricity is spoken for by Microsoft, which agreed to buy an equivalent amount of power from the grid for the next 20 years to feed its data centers.\n\n“The dynamics of the energy economy have changed significantly, mainly because of artificial intelligence,” Smith said.\n\nNuclear is well-suited to the moment, in his view, because of its consistency.\n\n“Hottest days of the year, coldest days of the year, freezing weather, the plant continues to operate,” Smith said. “As far as a reliable power source, you can’t beat it.”\n\nSmith was in high school in nearby Hershey in 1979 and remembers the evacuation after the disaster at Three Mile Island. That failed to dissuade him from going into a career in nuclear power, and he said today, the industry is safer because of regulations put in place after the partial meltdown.\n\n“People at the plant here take that personally,” he said. “The standards of the industry are greatly improved, and we've made significant improvements to the design of the plants and how we operate them.”\n\nGene Stilp has a different take. He’s one of many people in the area who say the official story of the 1979 disaster failed to account for long-term health problems they believe are related to the accident.\n\nStilp has been fighting nuclear power on Three Mile Island since before the plant opened, and said the recommissioning is an unnecessary risk to public safety.\n\n“We’re sticking up for the people who live here rather than the shareholders of Microsoft and Constellation,” said Stilp, who often appears in public wearing a blazer with “NO TMI RESTART” sewn on the back.\n\n“What they’re proposing for evacuation does not work, and so that’s my line in the sand,” he said, pointing out the 10-mile Emergency Planning Zone includes a major hospital complex and several schools. “The population increases in Central Pennsylvania, the realization that there are so many people at risk here, the best you can do is take away that risk.”\n\nAnother longtime opponent of the power plant, Eric Epstein of Three Mile Island Alert, said the country is making mistakes in its rush to power data centers. He said the economics might have changed for nuclear power, but the risks have not.\n\n“There was no public discussion about whether or not we’re going to restart Three Mile Island,” said Epstein. “You had this psychic tear in the fabric of the community that can't be papered over. You can put all the green paint you want on nuclear power, but there has been no viable solution to isolate nuclear waste.”\n\nConstellation said the spent fuel on site has been safely stored on the island for decades, in fortified containers required by the government to withstand natural disasters, and that all the waste created in 40 years fits in an area about the size of two tennis courts.\n\nDauphin County Commissioner Justin Douglas said he’s listening to local concerns about the plant’s reopening.\n\n“I personally am very interested in transparency and accountability for this in the sense of ensuring that it's as safe as it possibly can be, that we're tracking the cost and ensuring that the taxpayers aren't carrying any of the burden, that we have a good plan for the waste management and that ultimately the community impact is positive,” said Douglas. “We plan for the worst, and we hope for the best.”\n\nMeeting the country’s rising demand for electricity will take a lot more than reviving a few recently decommissioned plants.\n\n“It is a brilliant idea. It's sort of a slam dunk. The downside is that there are not many reactors out there that are realistically able to restart,” said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “You’re looking at a little bit less than three gigawatts of electricity, out of 50 that apparently are required for data centers and AI.”\n\nThere are also technical tweaks called uprates that can squeeze more power out of existing plants, which could help blunt the immediate electricity crunch.\n\n“You probably have potential for another five to eight gigawatts across the whole fleet. So you add that up to the two or three that we get from the restarts, you're looking at 10 [gigawatts],” Buongiorno said, or only about a fifth of the total AI power demand expected by 2030.\n\n“If that demand continues in the 2030s, then you can make the investment now to build new reactors,” he said, “and then nuclear can actually capture a lot more than 20%.”\n\nThis segment aired on December 9, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Hi Ben, you might find this preprint of interest https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17395 Perhaps you are making similar points.\n\nIt is curious that machine learning folks, who often like to say they are \"data driven\" pay little attention to the data at a conceptual level. I think the issue is that the data is taken to be _given_ (as you allude -- someone \"gives you\" a bunch of data). The word \"data\" derives from the latin word (dare) meaning to give. We would be better served to think of capta.... but collecting data is not considered as sexy as making complex models.\n\nOne argument (that simply is wrong) is that the existence of distributions is justified by the \"law\" of large numbers. It is not. For an argument regarding this, and an alternative (to distributions), you might find this other paper of interest. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X24000355 It shows what you get when you don't assume the \"law\" of large numbers holds (i.e. that relative frequencies converge). That the result is something other folks had studied for some time is pretty interesting. That coherent upper previsions arise elsewhere in ML (in fairness, DRO and even in SVMs!) suggests they are not so weird after all....\n\nA common viewpoint is that there is a set of all possible data out there (e.g., all images on the web). We collect a subset of these data and train our model. The main (and likely unreasonable) assumption is that the training subset is an iid sample (or uniformly sampled w/o replacement) from the set of all possible data. This assumption is the central ingredient in theoretical generalization bounds. While it's probably not perfectly reasonable, it does give us a framework for comparing models and algorithms, and aligns with common practices like hold-out validation. I think this is a useful model of the (training) data-generating distribution.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI/SINGAPORE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Taiwan's tech-heavy stocks show few signs of slowing a rally even as AI bubble worries cast a shadow over global markets, underscoring home-grown confidence in the structural advantages in AI that foreign investors may have overlooked.\n\nTaiwan's benchmark index is poised to breach ​a record 30,000 points in 2026, investors say, extending a three-year surge that has seen the stock market nearly double as the island rides a wave of demand ‌for chips that power artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile foreign money worries about stretched AI valuations, Taiwanese investors have enthusiastically ploughed into the market.\n\nAnalysts say domestic investors are betting on Taiwan's unique position as the lynchpin of an AI supply chain, where ‌even increasing competition in the sector would only benefit Taiwanese firms, including TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.\n\nOne major focus of anxiety around AI comes from uncertainty about Nvidia's ability to sustain its market dominance, with Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) emerging as a potentially more cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nBut it's a win-win scenario for Taiwan because the island is essential to supply chains of both the GPU and TPU, the building blocks of AI computing power.\n\n\"Taiwan is a major beneficiary of the AI market,\" said Piter Yang, a fund manager of Fuh Hwa Securities Investment Trust Co, citing the ⁠advantage of Taiwan being the world's semiconductor hub.\n\nAnd for now, as ‌a promising future fuels optimism, Taiwan markets and local investors seem relatively unfazed by the AI bubble fears, just as they remain calm in the face of rising geopolitical tensions with Beijing that have often spooked foreign investors.\n\nGains in Taiwan's market have also been underpinned ‍by earnings growth, leaving it with a reasonably steady price-to-earnings ratio of 21, below that of the Nasdaq and the Nikkei, meaning the rally has not made stocks more expensive.\n\n\"We are not worried about an AI bubble,\" said Li Fang-kuo, chairman of the securities investment arm of food conglomerate Uni-President. \"We are comfortable with where the valuations stand.\"\n\nLi pointed out that several of the magnificent seven companies in the U.S. have gross ​margins of as much as 70% or higher. \"So it's not comparable to the dot-com bubble, when companies were not generating meaningful earnings.\"",

    "description": "Almost a month after Prime Video launched AI-powered Video Recaps, viewers said it shared incorrect plot details about season one of \"Fallout.\"",
    "fullText": "Given the length of time it can take for the new season of your favorite TV show to come out, it's understandable that you might want a little video recap of what's happened so far.\n\nIdeally, that recap is accurate.\n\nFans of Amazon's hit show \"Fallout\" said that wasn't the case in its AI-made synopsis of season one, released ahead of the hit show's new season next week. Fans quickly spotted factual errors, and Amazon Prime Video took down the recap.\n\nOne Redditor said the AI feature told viewers that a flashback featuring the Ghoul (one of the main characters, played by Walton Goggins) took place in the 1950s instead of 2077.\n\nAn X user posted that the recap also mischaracterized the agreement the Ghoul and Lucy MacLean (played by Ella Purnell) made in the \"Fallout\" finale.\n\nInstead of saying the pair is teaming up to find Lucy's father, the recap said the Ghoul gave Lucy an ultimatum: \"die or join him.\"\n\nAmazon first launched its Video Recap, a feature that allows users to catch up on Prime Original TV shows between seasons, for beta testing in November.\n\n\"Video Recaps use AI to identify a show's most important plot points, combining them with synchronized voice narration, dialogue snippets, and music to create a visual summary that prepares viewers for the new season,\" the company said in a press release at the time.\n\nThe TV shows that Amazon said were undergoing Video Recaps testing — \"Jack Ryan,\" \"Upload,\" \"Bosch,\" and \"The Rig\" — did not include the feature at the time of writing.\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLike so many companies, Amazon is investing heavily in AI.\n\nDuring the company's February earnings call, Chief Finance Officer Brian Olsavsky said that 2025 capital expenditures could reach over $100 billion, with the majority of it going toward AI and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing platform.\n\nMany of Amazon's consumer services have integrated AI to enhance user engagement and experience, such as product suggestions and helping shoppers on its online platform find clothes that fit. In February, Amazon unveiled Alexa+, the next generation of Alexa, which is powered by generative AI to make it more conversational and personalized for users.\n\nEmbracing AI at Amazon, though, hasn't been without growing pains. In October, the company cited AI as it announced it would lay off 14,000 staff members.\n\n\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post at the time.\n\nIn an internal message to the remaining staff, Amazon Vice President of Device Software and Services Tapas Roy asked them to \"lean in on AI.\"\n\n\"Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products,\" Roy wrote. \"In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes.\"",

    "description": "Disney staffers spoke about the company's OpenAI deal and AI strategy, including AI tools they are using and one in development codenamed \"Jarvis.\"",
    "fullText": "Disney's billion-dollar OpenAI deal isn't the only way the company is embracing AI. In recent months, the Mouse House has been quietly adding new AI tools to its arsenal and encouraging staff to use them.\n\n\"They clearly see where things are headed,\" a longtime software engineer at Disney said. This marked a shift from this summer, when Disney had seemed \"hesitant to rely on AI tools,\" they said.\n\nDisney has given its employees access to several AI tools, including Microsoft Copilot and Amazon's Q Developer. Thanks to Disney's OpenAI deal, employees will also soon have access to the enterprise version of ChatGPT, the company said.\n\nThen there's a \"DisneyGPT\" chatbot that four staffers said helps with internal requests, such as creating IT support tickets, viewing the company roster, or analyzing a project's financials.\n\nIn an email sent to staff on October 2, Disney introduced the beta version of the chatbot, describing it as a \"new partner in productivity\" designed to help \"unlock the magic of your imagination.\" A December update enabled employees to upload Excel and PowerPoint files to the bot.\n\nDisneyGPT draws on signature Disney themes, with a prompt asking users if they're \"ready for an enchanting adventure\" and \"a verified collection of Walt Disney quotes\" that are \"tagged by themes like imagination, perseverance, and leadership,\" according to the chatbot's December update log. Otherwise, employees said DisneyGPT is mostly a standard AI chatbot.\n\nThere's also an AI chatbot in the works codenamed \"Jarvis,\" four employees said. Jarvis, named for the personal assistant \"J.A.R.V.I.S.\" from \"Iron Man,\" would be an agentic AI tool — more advanced than DisneyGPT — that completes tasks on an employee's behalf, a high-level staffer with direct knowledge of the company's AI efforts said. This person said Jarvis is in its early stages and is \"not fully baked.\"\n\n\"It's definitely something they want to push for everyone to lean into more,\" a Disney manager said of AI.\n\nCompanies in every industry are racing to adopt AI tools to boost productivity. Disney is going further than many, however. The OpenAI deal makes Disney the first major entertainment company to invest in the AI juggernaut, and allows its beloved characters to be used in the video generator Sora.\n\nThis reflects Disney's long tradition of merging innovation and entertainment, dating back to its founder, Walt.\n\nThree of the eight Disney employees who spoke with Business Insider expressed concerns about using AI, specifically that it could replace humans and threaten job security.\n\nThe high-level employee with direct knowledge of Disney's AI strategy said that while AI is a \"top priority,\" it isn't a cure-all. It can make mistakes and lacks a \"personalized touch\" that people provide, they said.\n\n\"If you use AI everywhere, it's going to be counterproductive,\" this person said, adding that tasks still need human creativity.\n\nDisney spokespeople didn't respond to several requests for comment on its internal AI efforts.\n\nOn an internal Disney website explaining its AI policy and tools, the company said it employs a \"responsible and human-centric approach to using AI.\"\n\n\"That means humans are, and will remain, the creative engine of the company,\" Disney said on the site. \"We believe, fundamentally, that human creativity and curiosity are immense and unique — and are at the heart of Disney.\"\n\n\"Simultaneously, our consistent embrace of new technologies has been a key part of empowering our creators and maintaining our leadership in creativity and innovation,\" the company continued in its \"Responsible AI Use\" section.\n\nSeven of the eight Disney staffers Business Insider interviewed have tried or regularly use DisneyGPT or Copilot, which is integrated into employees' email accounts and documents. Many use those AI tools for simple, routine tasks, like writing emails.\n\nDisney has a portal on its website that outlines its AI policy and lists Disney-approved AI tools. Two employees said the company has pointed staffers to AI education or compliance training courses.\n\nSome unsanctioned AI tools like Anthropic's Claude can be more effective than Disney-approved AI tools, three staffers said.\n\nOne employee at Disney-owned ESPN said their manager told them they could use personal accounts on non-approved AI chatbots for work.\n\n\"I'm just using a personal account because Disney isn't allowing us to use these tools yet,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nThe staffer with direct knowledge of Disney's AI efforts said leadership had tried to make communications about AI \"clear across the board,\" but acknowledged that workers might not \"understand the implications\" of data security risks that could arise from using unsanctioned AI tools. Some staffers told Business Insider it was hard for them to keep up with the availability and restrictions on various AI tools.\n\nWhile some Disney employees expressed mixed feelings about AI, the more bullish among them said Disney was wise to strike a deal with OpenAI.\n\n\"This type of a partnership at least establishes the precedent for getting paid,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nA Disney ads employee said they believed Disney's deal with OpenAI would \"pay off\" and \"be massive\" in five to 10 years, even if there are growing pains.\n\n\"Disney is smart to push into this,\" this staffer said. \"They are setting the rules of the game, or at least trying.\"",

    "description": "Here's what this means for law firms and other businesses that are betting on AI.",
    "fullText": "We just got a sobering picture of how often AI models get their facts straight. This week, Google DeepMind introduced the FACTS Benchmark Suite, which measures how reliably AI models produce factually accurate answers.\n\nIt tests models in four areas: answering factoid questions from internal knowledge, using web search effectively, grounding responses in long documents, and interpreting images. The best model, Google's Gemini 3 Pro, reached 69% accuracy, with other leading models falling well below that.\n\nFor context, if any of the reporters I manage filed stories that were 69% accurate, I would fire them.\n\nBeyond journalism, this number should matter to businesses betting on AI. While models excel at speed and fluency, their factual reliability still lags far behind human expectations, especially in tasks involving niche knowledge, complex reasoning, or precise grounding in source material.\n\nEven small factual errors can have outsized consequences in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and the law. This week, my talented colleague Melia Russell looked at how law firms are handling the rise of AI models as a source of legal truth. It's messy: She recounts how one firm fired an employee because they filed a document riddled with fake cases after using ChatGPT to draft it.\n\nThe FACTS benchmark is a warning but also a roadmap: by quantifying where and how models fail, Google hopes to accelerate progress. But for now, the takeaway is clear: AI is getting better, but it's still wrong about one-third of the time.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

So, I took two photos of the furniture, uploaded them to Gemini, and asked for help. The Google chatbot sent back its best guess in seconds:\n\n\"Tillary Sectional: This is a very popular, modular West Elm sofa that was available around that time.\n\nAppearance Match: The low back and deep seat are very characteristic of the Tillary. The Tillary is known for having interchangeable backrests that can be moved or removed, and your sofa's armless chaise and backrests look like they might be loose cushions or pieces, which is a key Tillary feature.\n\nNote: Search results show the Tillary was being reviewed and discussed around 2014, making it a strong possibility for a 2013 purchase.\"\n\nGemini also shared other useful tips on how to identify the product, such as \"Some West Elm couches have a zippered compartment on the back or bottom where extra components (like legs or connectors) are stored, and a tag may be inside.\"\n\nThat was enough to find a product match and send all the details over to the buyer. We closed the deal, for $200, on Tuesday. That's enough for 10 months of a Gemini Pro subscription.\n\nThis holiday period, the Barr family plans to spend a lot of time slouching on our new, fancy couch. I call it the \"AI bubble couch.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Android users are getting more tools to combat the seemingly endless stream of scam texts from bad actors looking to steal your data and your money. Circle to Search and Google Lens can now assess messages for scam red flags, and if possible fraud is detected, you'll get recommendations for what to do (or not do) next. Even if you think you know the telltale signs of a scam—a sense of urgency, a demand for money or personal information, a link to log in or pay—using these tools can confirm your suspicions, especially when you feel pressured to act.\n\nTo activate Circle to Search, long press the home button or navigation bar on your device and circle the text you want to scan. Alternatively, you can take a screenshot, open Lens in the Google app (also available on iOS), and tap the screenshot. The feature works for text messages as well as communication on messaging apps and social media sites. Google says the capability is available \"when our systems have high confidence in the quality of the response.\"\n\nThis is just the latest in the Google's suite of security features meant to protect against fraud. Pixel users have real-time, AI-powered scam detection, which identifies and alerts you to suspicious conversational patterns in Google Messages and Phone by Google. In-call protections for Android prevent you from taking certain actions, such as sideloading new apps and changing accessibility permission, on your device while on the phone with anyone not saved in your contacts.\n\nEarlier this month, Google also expanded its in-call scam detection feature, meant to combat bank impersonation schemes, to U.S. users. If you are on a call with a number that's not in your contacts and try to open a participating financial app, you'll get a notification reminding you not to share information and a one-click option to stop screen-sharing and end the call.",

    "fullText": "It seems like it’s become a tradition that I announce I have joined a new company for the Java Advent of Code. At least this time it’s actually an old friend: I am excited to be back at Red Hat, in the llm-d team! Does that mean I forgot about Java? Of course not. If anything, this is an opportunity to learn more about GPU programming, and since Java is my comfort-zone language, what better occasion than looking into TornadoVM?\n\nRecently, the TornadoVM team released gpullama3, a proof-of-concept demonstrating LLM inference on GPUs using pure Java. Let’s explore this together!\n\nTornadoVM is a plugin for the OpenJDK that enables Java programs to automatically run on heterogeneous hardware (GPUs, FPGAs, and multi-core CPUs) using standard Java code annotated for parallel compute.\n\nTransformer-based language models are computationally expensive but highly-parallelizable. At inference time, generating each token requires matrix multiplications across billions of parameters. GPUs excel at these operations because they can perform thousands of computations in parallel. Thus, TornadoVM is the perfect tool for this kind of workload.\n\nInstalling GPULlama3.java was surprisingly straightforward. Make sure you have your favorite flavor of JDK 21 installed. I use sdkman, so I made sure I had Temurin 21 installed:\n\nThen you’ll want to make sure you have installed cmake, a C/C++ toolchain, Python and pip. Now you can clone the repo:\n\nand follow the instructions on the README; for instance, on macOS/Linux:\n\nYou can verify the installation was successful by running one example:\n\nOf course, make sure you replace tornado-examples-1.1.2-dev-e1d2d12.jar with the right jar name! Your output should look something like this:\n\nThe @Parallel annotation tells TornadoVM this loop can be parallelized. The TaskGraph API manages data movement and execution scheduling. You can compile it with the following (if you followed the installation guide correctly $TORNADO_SDK will point to the right path):\n\nNotice that -g is required for this to work correctly. Now you can run it with:\n\nIt will print the first 10 items in the resulting vector.\n\nThe gpullama3 project demonstrates running a Llama 3 model entirely in Java with GPU acceleration. Assuming you are back at the root of the repo, continue with the setup procedure.\n\nNow let’s download a compatible model using the HuggingFace CLI:\n\nTry it! Even on my poor MacBook Air with 8 GB RAM (provided I don’t have too many applications open) this returns:\n\nDisclaimer: even if you have better CPU/GPUs at your disposal, they are unlikely to affect the quality of the joke.\n\nGPULlama3.java currently supports a few FP16 (16-bit floating point) and 8-bit quantized models:\n\nDepending on the model being selected, a different execution plan will be built. The execution plan corresponds to the model architecture. In our case, we picked the unquantized Llama 3.2 1B FP16. Let’s take a look at the setupTornadoForwardPlan() method in FP16LayerPlanner, used by LLama 3.2:\n\nIn the Activation layer we mostly look up token embeddings and apply an initial normalization step, while the Logit layer is where we convert the model’s internal representation into token predictions. So let’s concentrate a bit more on the Feed-Forward Network layer (FFN), and in particular on the Attention implementation. The LlamaFP16FFNLayers#setupSingleFFNLayer method is a bit cryptic at a first glance; let’st start from its signature:\n\nThe method is building a TaskGraph, essentially describing the data flow of our GPU kernels. Let’s focus on QKV and attention, using Sebastian Raschka1‘s excellent Python Notebook as a reference. The following is the architecture diagram of the Llama 3.2 1B model:\n\nFor obvious reasons of brevity, we aren’t going to explore this in detail, but we do want to take a look at the implementation of the attention heads. In particular, let’s take a look at how we compute the Query, Key, Value matrices (Q,K,V = project(x) in the Python version):\n\nThis is followed by the RoPE rescaling to encode token positions:\n\nNow we are ready to compute attention. The generic version (there is also an NVidia-specific implementation) is:\n\nLet’s drill down into TransformerComputeKernelsLayered::processHeadsParallel to see how that is performed. The following is one of the GPU kernels. It essentially computes:\n\nYou will notice that the method:\n\nAfter the attention mechanism computes relationships between tokens, the result is added to the original input, normalized, and passed through a feed-forward network. This process repeats across multiple layers before finally producing the next-token prediction (the logit layer).\n\nBecause it’s an autoregressive model, this entire process repeats for each token, using the previously generated sequence as input.\n\nIn short, TornadoVM handled GPU compilation and execution transparently, allowing a pure Java program to perform LLM inference!\n\nWe’ve completed our whirlwind tour of Llama3GPU.java and TornadoVM. If your head is still spinning, don’t worry, you’re not alone! It’s a lot to take in, but I hope this post has sparked your interest and inspired you to dig deeper: I know I will!\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

I hope the thinking here will be useful to you, or at least validates\nsome of what you’re experiencing in your rollout. The further you read, the more specific this will get,\nending with cheap-turpentine-esque topics like getting agents to reliably translate human-readable text representations of Slack entities into mrkdwn formatting of the correct underlying entity.\n\nI am hiring:\nIf you’re interested in working together with me on internal agent and AI adoption at Imprint,\nwe are hiring our founding Senior Software Engineer, AI.\nThe ideal candidate is a product engineer who’s spent some time experimenting with agents,\nand wants to spend the next year or two digging into this space.\n\nAs technologists, I think one of the basics we owe our teams is spending time\nworking directly with new tools to develop an intuition for how they do, and don’t work.\nAI adoption is no different.\n\nTowards that end, I started with a bit of reading, especially Chip Huyen’s AI Engineering,\nand then dove in a handful of bounded projects: building my rudimentary own agent platform\nusing Claude code for implementation,\ncreating a trivial MCP for searching my blog posts,\nand an agent to comment on Notion documents.\n\nEach of these projects was two to ten hours, and extremely clarifying.\nTool use is, in particular, something that seemed like magic until I\nimplemented a simple tool-using agent, at which point it become something extremely non-magical\nthat I could reason about and understand.\n\nImprint’s general approach to refining AI adoption is strategy testing:\nidentify a few goals, pick an initial approach, and then iterate rapidly in the details until the approach genuinely works.\nIn an era of crushing optics, senior leaders immersing themselves in the details is one of our few defenses.\n\nShortly after joining, I partnered with the executive team to draft the above strategy for AI adoption.\nAfter a modest amount of debate, the pillars we landed on were:\n\nAs you see from those principles, and my earlier comment, my biggest fear for AI adoption is\nthat they can focus on creating the impression of adopting AI, rather than focusing on creating additional productivity.\nOptics are a core part of any work, but almost all interesting work occurs where optics and reality\nintersect, which these pillars aimed to support.\n\nAs an aside, in terms of the components of strategy in\nCrafting Engineering Strategy, this is really just\nthe strategy’s policy.\nIn addition, we used strategy testing to refine our approach,\ndefined a concrete set of initial actions to operationalize it (they’re a bit too specific to share externally),\nand did some brief exploration to make sure I wasn’t overfitting on\nmy prior work at Carta.\n\nMy first step towards adoption was collecting as many internal examples of tips and tricks as possible into\na single Notion database. I took a very broad view on what qualified, with the belief that showing\nmany different examples of using tools–especially across different functions–is both useful and inspiring.\n\nI’ve continued extending this, with contributions from across the company, and it’s become a useful resource\nfor both humans and bots alike to provide suggestions on approaching problems with AI tooling.\n\nOne of my core beliefs in our approach is that making prompts discoverable\nwithin the company is extremely valuable.\nDiscoverability solves four distinct problems:\n\nMy core approach is that every agent’s prompt is stored in a single Notion database\nwhich is readable by everyone in the company. Most prompts are editable by everyone,\nbut some have editing restrictions.\n\nHere’s an example of a prompt we use for routing incoming Jira issues from Customer Support\nto the correct engineering team.\n\nHere’s a second example, this time of responding to requests in our Infrastructure Engineering\nteam’s request channel.\n\nPretty much all prompts end with an instruction to include a link to the prompt\nin the generated message. This ensures it’s easy to go from a mediocre response\nto the prompt-driving the response, so that you can fix it.\n\nIn addition to collecting tips and prompts, the next obvious step for AI adoption\nis identifying a standard AI platform to be used within the company, e.g. ChatGPT,\nClaude, Gemini or what not.\n\nWe’ve gone with OpenAI for everyone.\nIn addition to standardizing on a platform, we made sure account provisioning was\nautomatic and in place on day one.\nTo the surprise of no one who’s worked in or adjacent to IT,\na lot of revolutionary general AI adoption is… really just account provisioning and access controls.\nThese are the little details that can so easily derail the broader plan if you don’t dive into them.\n\nWithin Engineering, we also provide both Cursor and Claude.\nThat said, the vast majority of our Claude usage is done via AWS Bedrock,\nwhich we use to power Claude Code… and we use Claude Code quite a bit.\n\nWhile there’s a general industry push towards adopting more AI tooling,\nI find that a significant majority of “AI tools” are just SaaS vendors that\ntalk about AI in their marketing pitches. We have continued to adopt vendors,\nbut have worked internally to help teams evaluate which “AI tools” are meaningful.\n\nWe’ve spent a fair amount of time going deep on integrating with AI tooling for chat and IVR\ntooling, but that’s a different post entirely.\n\nMeasuring AI adoption is, like all measurement topics, fraught.\nAltogether, I’ve found measuring tool adoption very useful for identifying the right\nquestions to ask. Why haven’t you used Cursor? Or Claude Code? Or whatever? These are fascinating\nquestions to dig into. I try to look at usage data at least once a month, with a particular focus\non two questions:\n\nAt the core, I believe folks who aren’t adopting tools are rational non-adopters,\nand spending some time understanding the (appearance of) resistance goes further than\ntop-down mandate. I think it’s often an education gap that is bridged easily enough.\nConceivably, at some point I’ll discover a point of diminishing returns, where the lack\nof progress is stymied on folks who are rejecting AI tooling–or because the AI tooling\nisn’t genuinely useful–but I haven’t found that point yet.\n\nThe next few sections are about building internal agents.\nThe core implementation is a single stateless lambda which handles a wide variety of HTTP requests,\nsimilar-ish to Zapier.\nThis is currently implemented in Python, and is roughly 3,000 lines of code,\nmuch of it dedicated to oddities like formatting Slack messages, etc.\n\nFor the record, I did originally attempt to do this within Zapier,\nbut I found that Zapier simply doesn’t facilitate the precision I believe is necessary to do this effectively.\nI also think that Zapier isn’t particularly approachable for a non-engineering audience.\n\nAs someone who spent a long time working in platform engineering,\nI still want to believe that you can build a platform, and users will come.\nIndeed, I think it’s true that a small number of early adopters will come,\nif the problem is sufficiently painful for them,\nas was the case for Uber’s service migration (2014).\n\nHowever, what we’ve found effective for driving adoption is basically the opposite of that.\nWhat’s really worked is the intersection of platform engineering and old-fashioned product engineering:\n\nSome examples of the projects where we’ve gotten traction internally:\n\nFor all of these projects that have worked, the formula has been\nthe opposite of “build a platform and they will come.” Instead it’s\nrequired deep partnership from folks with experience building AI agents and\nusing AI tooling to make progress. The learning curve for effective AI adoption\nin important or production-like workflows remains meaningfully high.\n\nAgents that use powerful tools represent a complex configuration problem.\nFirst, exposing too many tools–especially tools that the prompt author doesn’t effectively understand–makes\nit very difficult to create reliable workflows. For example, we have an exit_early command that allows terminating\nthe agent early: this is very effective in many cases, but is also easy to break your bot.\nSimilarly, we have a slack_chat command that allows posting across channels, which can support a variety of useful\nworkflows (e.g. warm-handoffs of a question in one channel into a more appropriate alternative),\nbut can also spam folks.\nSecond, as tools get more powerful, they can introduce complex security scenarios.\n\nTo address both of these, we currently store configuration in a code-reviewed Git repository.\nHere’s an example of a JIRA project.\n\nHere’s another for specifying a Slack responder bot.\n\nCompared to a JSON file, we can statically type the configuration, and it’s easy to extend over time.\nFor example, we might want to extend slack_chat to restrict which channels a given bot is allowed to\npublish into, which would be easy enough.\nFor most agents today, the one thing not under Git-version control is the prompts themselves, which are versioned by Notion.\nHowever, we can easily require specific agents to use prompts within the Git-managed repository for sensitive scenarios.\n\nAfter passing tests, linting and typechecking, the configurations are automatically deployed.\n\nIt’s sort of funny to mention, but one thing that has in practice really interfered with\neasily writing effective prompts is making it easy to write things like @Will Larson which\nis then translated into <@U12345> or whatever the appropriate Slack identifier is for a given\nuser, channel, or user group. The same problem exists for Jira groups, Notion pages and databases,\nand so on.\n\nThis is a good example of where centralizing prompts is useful. I got comfortable pulling the unique\nidentifiers myself, but it became evident that most others were not.\nThis eventually ended with three tools for Slack resolution: slack_lookup which takes a list\nof references to lookup, slack_lookup_prefix which finds all Slack entities that start with\na given prefix (useful to pull all channels or groups starting with @oncall-, for example, rather than having to hard-code the list in your prompt), and slack_search_name which uses string-distance to find potential matches (again, useful for dealing with typos).\n\nIf this sounds bewildering, it’s largely the result of Slack not exposing relevant APIs for this sort of lookup.\nSlack’s APIs want to use IDs to retrieve users, groups and channels, so you have to maintain your own cache of\nthese items to perform a lookup. Performing the lookups, especially for users, is itself messy. Slack users have\na minimum of three ways they might be referenced: user.profile.display_name, user.name, and user.real_name,\nonly a subset of which are set for any given user.\nThe correct logic here is, as best I can tell, to find a match against user.profile.display_name, then use that if it exists.\nThen do the same for user.name and finally user.real_name. If you take the first user that matches one of those three,\nyou’ll use the wrong user in some scenarios.\n\nIn addition to providing tools to LLMs for resolving names, I also have a final mandatory check for each response\nto ensure the returned references refer to real items. If not, I inject which ones are invalid into the context window and perform an additional agent loop with only entity-resolution tools available.\nThis feels absurd, but it was only at this point that things really started working consistently.\n\nAs an aside, I was embarassed by these screenshots, and earlier today I made the same changes for Notion pages and databases\nas I had previously for Slack.\n\nSimilarly to foreign entity resolution,\nthere’s a similar problem with Slack’s mrkdwn variant of Markdown\nand JIRA’s Atlassian Document Format:\nthey’re both strict.\n\nThe tools that call into those APIs now have strict instructions on formatting. These had been contained in individual\nprompts, but they started showing up in every prompt, so I knew I needed to bring them into the agent framework itself\nrather than forcing every prompt-author to understand the problem.\n\nMy guess is that I need to add a validation step similar to the one I added for entity-resolution,\nand that until I do so, I’ll continue to have a small number of very infrequent but annoying rendering issues,\nTo be honest, I personally don’t mind the rendering issues, but that creates a lot of uncertainty for others using agents, so I think solving them is a requirement.\n\nToday, all logs, especially tool usage, are fed into two places. First, it goes into Datadog for full logging visibility.\nSecond, and perhaps more usefully for non-engineers, they feed into a Slack channel, #ai-logs which create visibility\ninto which tools are used and with which (potentially truncated) parameters.\n\nLonger term, I imagine this will be exposed via a dedicated internal web UX, but generally speaking I’ve found that\nthe subset of folks who are actively developing agents are pretty willing to deal with a bit of cruft.\nSimilarly the folks who aren’t developing agents directly don’t really care, they want it to work perfectly every time,\nand aren’t spending time looking at logs.\n\nThe biggest internal opportunity that I see today is figuring out how to\nget non-engineers an experience equivalent to running Claude Code locally with\nall their favorite MCP servers plugged in.\nI’ve wanted ChatGPT or Claude.ai to provide this, but they don’t really quite get there,\nClaude Desktop is close, but is somewhat messy to configure as we think about finding a tool\nthat we can easily allow everyone internally to customize and use on a daily basis.\n\nI’m still looking for what the right tool is here. If anyone has any great suggestions\nthat we can be somewhat confident will still exist in two years, and don’t require sending\na bunch of internal data to a very early stage company, then I’m curious to hear!\n\nYou’re supposed to start a good conclusion with some sort of punchy anecdote that\nilluminates your overall thesis in a new way. I’m not sure if I can quite meet that bar,\nbut the four most important ideas for me are:\n\nI’m curious what other folks are finding!",

    "description": "The companies building AI are spending billions to acquire engineers, not replace them. Here’s why your job is safer than you think.",
    "fullText": "In May, OpenAI agreed to pay $3 billion for Windsurf, the AI coding assistant formerly known as Codeium. Three billion dollars. For a VSCode fork.\n\nThe deal eventually fell apart, but what matters is that they wanted to do it in the first place.\n\nLast week, Anthropic made an interesting acquisition: they bought Bun, the JavaScript runtime. Bun is open source and MIT-licensed. Anthropic could have forked it and built on top of it for free. They have Claude Code, an excellent code-writing tool.\n\nInstead, they bought the company. Because they wanted Jarred Sumner and his team.\n\nThis is what I keep coming back to when I see another “Programming is dead” post go viral. The companies building AI, the ones who supposedly know exactly what it can and can’t do, are spending billions to acquire engineering talent. Not fire them, acquire them.\n\nIf OpenAI believed GPT could replace software engineers, why wouldn’t they build their own VS Code fork for a fraction of that cost? If Anthropic thought Claude could do the work, why make an acquisition at all?\n\nHere’s my take: AI can replace most of programming, but programming isn’t the job.\n\nProgramming is a task. It’s one of many things you do as part of your work. But if you’re a software engineer, your actual job is more than typing code into an editor.\n\nThe mistake people make is conflating the task with the role. It’s like saying calculators replaced accountants. Calculators automated arithmetic, but arithmetic was never the job. The job was understanding financials, advising clients, making judgment calls, etc. The calculator just made accountants faster at the mechanical part.\n\nAI is doing something similar for us.\n\nThink about what you actually do in a given week.\n\nYou sit in a meeting where someone describes a vague problem, and you’re the one who figures out what they actually need. You look at a codebase and decide which parts to change and which to leave alone. You push back on a feature request because you know it’ll create technical debt that’ll haunt the team for years. You review a colleague’s PR and catch a subtle bug that would’ve broken production. You make a call on whether to ship now or wait for more testing.\n\nNone of that is programming, but it’s all your job.\n\nI’m not going to pretend nothing is changing.\n\nWill some companies use AI as an excuse to cut headcount? Absolutely. Some already have. There will be layoffs blamed on “AI efficiency gains” that are really just cost-cutting dressed up as something else.\n\nBut think about who stays and who goes in that scenario. It’s not random. The engineers who understand that programming isn’t the job, the ones who bring judgment, context, and the ability to figure out what to build, those are the ones who stay. The ones who only brought code output might be at risk\n\nA common worry is that juniors will get left behind. If AI handles the “doing” part, how do they build judgment? I actually think the opposite is true. AI compresses the feedback loop. What used to take days of flipping through books or waiting for Stack Overflow answers now takes seconds. The best juniors aren’t skipping steps, but getting through them faster.\n\nNow think about your own situation. Say you were hired two years ago, before the current AI wave. Your company wanted you. They saw value in what you bring. Now, with AI tools, you’re significantly more productive. You ship faster. You handle more complexity. You’re better at your job than ever before.\n\n“You got way more productive, so we’re letting you go” is not a sentence that makes a lot of sense.\n\nIf you’re reading this, you’re already thinking about this stuff. That puts you ahead. Here’s how to stay there:\n\nThe shape of the work is changing: some tasks that used to take hours now take minutes, some skills matter less, others more.\n\nBut different isn’t dead. The engineers who will thrive understand that their value was never in the typing, but in the thinking, in knowing which problems to solve, in making the right trade-offs, in shipping software that actually helps people.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic could build their own tools. They have the best AI in the world. Instead, they’re spending billions on engineers. That should tell you something.",

    "fullText": "Broadcom has a massive opportunity ahead with custom AI chips.\n\nUiPath has huge potential upside as its revenue starts to accelerate.\n\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nAs 2025 begins to wind down, it will go down as another strong year for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Meanwhile, with AI still appearing to be in its early innings, the group could help lead the market higher in 2026 once again.\n\nLet's look at two AI stocks that could help you make a fortune in 2026.\n\nOne AI stock that looks like it could outperform in 2026 is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), as it has some of the best growth prospects of any AI infrastructure company.\n\nThe company is already seeing strong growth coming from its data center networking portfolio, which helps transfer data and distribute AI workloads across servers to help optimize performance. Products like its Tomahawk Ethernet switch and Jericho4 Ethernet fabric router are popular and helping power its networking growth.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) business is what should get investors excited the most. ASICs are custom chips that are pre-programmed to handle specific tasks, and because they are purpose-built, they tend to deliver improved performance with greater energy efficiency than general-purpose chips, such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Broadcom made a name for itself in this business when it helped Alphabet design its well-regarded tensor processing units (TPUs) that are helping Alphabet power much of its internal AI workloads, as well as those for external cloud computing customers.\n\nThat success has led to other hyperscalers (owners of large data centers) partnering with Broadcom to design their own custom chips. The company has called out its three custom AI chip customers furthest along as being an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal 2027, and then announced that a fourth customer has placed a $10 billion order for next year. It also recently struck a deal with OpenAI to supply it with 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips, in a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWith these deals in place, Broadcom could see explosive growth in the coming years, which could propel its stock much higher in 2026 and beyond.\n\nAnother company whose stock could help you make a fortune next year is UiPath (NYSE: PATH). The company is in the midst of a transformation that could see it become one of the most important players in agentic AI.\n\nUiPath is a stalwart in the field of robotic process automation (RPA), which uses software bots to perform simple, rules-based tasks. However, it's using this background in managing software bots to become an orchestration platform that can manage both software bots and AI agents.",

    "description": "Jensen Huang biography author Stephen Witt explains why Google's self-developed AI model, Gemini, could pose a threat to Nvidia's AI dominance",
    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) AI turf could take a blow if Google (GOOGL, GOOG) keeps firing on all cylinders.\n\n\"The biggest risk right now obviously is Google,\" said Stephen Witt, author of \"The Thinking Machine,\" a Jensen Huang biography.\n\nThat risk, he told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid, is largely tied to Google's Gemini model. Witt described it as the \"best AI right now in the benchmarks outside the Nvidia stack.\"\n\nWitt explained that Gemini was trained entirely on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). If Google proves it can sustain world-leading AI development using only its homegrown chip stack, it sets a potent precedent for other tech giants to follow suit.\n\n\"That's a huge risk,\" Witt said. \"If Google ends up winning this AI race ... Nvidia will be in trouble.\"\n\nThis risk, coupled with competition from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), is why \"it's very easy to imagine a world\" where Nvidia's high-flying stock declines. The AI chipmaker's shares are up over 1,270% in the past five years.\n\nTo mitigate the core risk of rivals like Google winning the chip war, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is already looking past generative AI. Witt said a significant amount of the CEO's personal effort is being poured into the next great computing wave: robotics.\n\nIf Huang can dominate the robotics wave, he said, \"that will mean several trillion dollars in market capitalization for this company.\"\n\nHowever, Nvidia has another issue: the lack of any clear succession plan.\n\n\"It's just Jensen at the top,\" Witt said. \"There's no second in command. There's no obvious successor.\" He noted that the board has been silent, and Huang has offered no advice on a succession strategy.\n\nThat suggests Nvidia's $4 trillion valuation — which accounts for over 8% of the entire S&P 500 (^GSPC) — is, in many ways, resting solely on Huang's vision.\n\nWitt described Huang as a \"world-class engineer\" who could \"design these microchips himself,\" a skill that whoever takes the helm must also possess. He noted that neither of Huang's two children, who work at the company, has a technical background, making them noncontenders for the top spot.\n\nWitt also provided a look behind the polished stage persona of Huang, known for his trademark leather jacket. Beneath the showmanship is a highly intense, \"almost totally neurotic\" leader who is driven not by optimism, but by fear.\n\n\"He's driven by negative emotions, things like fear of failure, guilt, even shame are what make Jensen get up in the morning and work so hard to make Nvidia succeed,\" Witt explained.",

Here were some of the notable moves:\n\nBroadcom investors seemed disappointed in how the company didn't issue full AI revenue guidance for the coming year, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan wrote on Friday. Broadcom said it expected AI semiconductor revenue to double to $8.2 billion in the following quarter.\n\nInvestors also seemed \"underwhelmed\" by the firm's $73 billion backlog of AI product orders over the next 18 months, Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said in a note.\n\n\"Somehow some investors seized on this as 'not enough,' which compounded an earlier narrative today that somehow we needed more visibility on F27 AI revenue (no idea why this is suddenly an issue),\" JPMorgan's Meyers wrote.\n\nSome investors also feel that the Tan was more \"buttoned-up\" about the company's results than they would have liked, Meyers said, citing his conversations with shareholders.\n\nThe stock is a crowded trade in the already popular AI theme, and some may also think the market \"just needed to take a breath\" from the AI trade, Meyers said. Shares of Broadcom are still up more than 56% this year.\n\nInvestors have put more pressure on the semiconductor sector in recent months amid concerns about the sustainability of the AI trade, which has led to some firms getting punished despite beating on earnings and revenue.\n\nOracle shares plunged 14% on Thursday as investors took in lower-than-expected quarterly revenue and worries that the software giant is overspending on AI.\n\nMeta and Microsoft shares also dropped after the companies reported earnings in October, as both tech titans promised to spend more on AI in the coming years.",

Our technologists need to develop their business acumen, and our business folks need to develop their digital and technical fluency. The lines are blurring.\n\nMy HR team is developing a baseline of skills and capabilities. We're having conversations with consulting partners and clients. There's an openness to communal learning because everyone is trying to figure out the same things: what the AI-driven workforce will look like, how to break work into tasks for AI vs. humans, and what AI agents can handle versus humans.\n\nWe're subject to a lot of regulatory oversight in our industry. It's great that people can develop their own AI agents — there's a push to decentralize these capabilities — but we need to be mindful of risk and governance and how we do this in a safe, ethical way.\n\nAI is changing how work gets done and what work gets done. Business models are evolving, and the way companies serve clients is shifting. The CHRO role now requires adapting to both at once. It's a tall order.\n\nIn consulting, our ability to add value means constantly evolving our approach to human capital. The issues are constant; the pace is what's different. Today, a quarter of our business involves AI, which wasn't true even two years ago.\n\nWe need our people to be AI fluent. About 90% of our workforce uses AI regularly, and more than half use it daily. To get there, we've built a multi-layered support system: a 1,400-person enablement network acting as evangelists and coaches.\n\nWe've upskilled more than 100 team coaches to provide hands-on support. We deploy experts directly into teams to help them reimagine workflows and run innovation competitions to keep momentum going.\n\nOur HR team has taken the lead. We started with recruiting — consolidating six IT systems into one and integrating AI throughout the platform and across performance management and development.\n\nWe're also experimenting with voice tools, chat interfaces, and AI avatars for real-time coaching. These tools give employees confidence, learning opportunities, and instant feedback. They don't replace managers — they free them up for higher-level thinking and relationship-building.\n\nOur business is automation, so that muscle is very strong for my team. But the next frontier of agentic AI is an adjustment.\n\nWe're using these AI agents — but we're also creating them. One agent, almost in production, helps with performance reviews, which is a time-consuming and sometimes dreaded task. Our agent helps employees write their self-assessment and collects feedback, bringing it together much quicker. It also helps managers by consolidating feedback from multiple resources.\n\nIt won't make rating decisions on the manager's behalf, but it makes the year-end much more seamless. Instead of spending time on admin, managers can focus on the feedback itself and my team on the right framework for career development.\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns at the moment, and fear is natural. But it should fuel curiosity and development. This is the time to think about career development seriously.\n\nWe have this idea that AI is only affecting entry-level or lower-level jobs. The truth is that technology is replacing skills that very highly skilled people have been doing.\n\nIf you look at the medical field and aviation — areas where we always thought technology wouldn't touch — that's no longer the case. It's not going to happen overnight. We have time to prepare. But it's relevant for everybody in any profession.",

    "fullText": "For much of the past year, Wall Street and Silicon Valley have wrestled with the same uncomfortable question: Will companies really spend money on AI, or is the hype just outpacing budgets?\n\nA new CIO survey from RBC Capital suggests that question may finally have an answer, and it's a resounding yes.\n\nRBC recently polled 117 IT professionals at companies with annual revenue ranging from below $250 million to more than $25 billion. 90% of the respondents said their organizations plan to spend more on AI in 2026.\n\n\"Overall, we came away increasingly optimistic of macro/budget stabilization taking shape in 2026 and encouraged by the pace of early GenAI adoption,\" the RBC analysts wrote in a research note summarizing the findings.\n\nCIOs are not only moving rapidly into production with AI systems, but they are also setting aside dedicated budgets to fund that adoption.\n\nA striking 90% of technology leaders said their organizations are creating new budgets specifically for generative AI and LLM projects, up from 85% the year before. That suggests AI is becoming additive rather than substitutive in enterprise tech spending.\n\nEven more telling: 60% of respondents said they are already in production with AI initiatives, a jump from 39% the previous year. Another 32% expect to be in production within six months.\n\nThis shift comes after months of skepticism from investors who questioned whether businesses would convert pilot projects into real spending. The survey data suggests that moment is now arriving.\n\nCIOs overwhelmingly cited AI as the top category for increased software spending next year, surpassing cybersecurity and IT service management. And in open-ended responses, executives repeatedly named AI as their biggest area of investment for 2026, often paired with infrastructure upgrades and automation initiatives, according to the RBC survey.\n\nUse cases are expanding beyond experimentation. Seventy-six percent of CIOs said their AI strategies now target both cost savings and revenue generation, a shift that reinforces AI's transition from a novelty to a competitive mandate.\n\nConcerns remain — data privacy tops the list — but those worries are no longer slowing adoption. Instead, AI is becoming the primary force expanding IT budgets heading into 2026.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The \"OpenAI Supply Co.\" has 10 merch items available for purchase, and dozens of more archived designs. Most sizes have sold out.",
    "fullText": "You can now wear ChatGPT on your sleeve — or head or shin.\n\nAs part of its 10-year anniversary celebration, OpenAI dropped a link on its X feed to a merchandise store. The \"OpenAI Supply Co.\" seems suited for the company's engineers, with a space to log in with a company email. Indeed, most of the items listed are archives of old designs — but a few are available for purchase.\n\nThe \"Supply Co.\" site was marked as \"coming soon\" in July 2024, according to the Internet Archive. But this appears to be the first time ChatGPT users who aren't employees can actually buy something from it.\n\nOpenAI fans ate it up. The post garnered over 3,000 likes within 15 hours, and multiple sizes of the for-sale items were quickly sold out. If you're anything other than an extra small or a small, you're out of luck on sweatshirts and tees.\n\nThe items OpenAI listed give a glimpse inside the company — or at least its swag.\n\nThere are five Pokémon-style trading cards. Their subjects include Sora 2 (\"shape-shifter\"), GPT-5 (\"two worlds, one model\"), image generation (with a \"huge\" wow factor), Sora (\"sci-fi\"), and the OpenAI Blossom (\"back and better\").\n\nPokémon has recently been a point of contention for the company, after its Sora video generator began booting out unauthorized versions of Pikachu.\n\nMuch of the site is themed around AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a much debated breakthrough milestone that many AI companies are racing to hit. One shirt reads: \"AGI that benefits all of humanity,\" a line from OpenAI's charter. On the employee log-in, the suggested email is agi@openai.com.\n\nThe assortment of hats also offers clues. There are Sora beanies and baseball caps with the word \"research.\" One cap has the chatbot's phone number, 1-800-CHATGPT. (Yes, the number still works.)\n\nAnother cap has OpenAI in red letters on camo print, resembling the popular Harris/Walz hat, which nods to Chappell Roan.\n\nThe baseball caps kept coming. There's one with silver flames, a piece of early 2000s nostalgia. There's another with the letters \"SF\" on it, firmly planting OpenAI in the city of San Francisco.\n\nAll the way at the bottom of the page is a baseball cap with the words \"Thinking deeply.\" The site says that it was released in September 2024 in honor of OpenAI's reasoning model. It also looks remarkably similar to Anthropic's \"thinking\" caps, which launched a year later at the company's Air Mail pop-up.\n\nAnthropic's \"thinking\" caps quickly became a status symbol, signifying the wearer's closeness to the AI boom. Cursor's tab keys had a similar effect, as did OpenAI's DevDay token plaques.\n\nIt's possible that this merchandise drop will have the same effect. Your ChatGPT crew neck could give you caché.\n\nThe fans have clearly been hungry. Fan-created merchandise concepts have long floated around X. Some even turned their designs into unauthorized businesses.\n\nThirty minutes before its post about the tenth anniversary, OpenAI responded to a fan post. Developer Tibor Blaho posted some of the merch, saying that the company should make its store \"public instead of keeping it employee-only.\" OpenAI responded with the link and an eye emoji.\n\nBlaho's post was 10 months ago.",

This resulted in narrow candidate pools and unhappy hiring managers. The study underlined that fairness isn’t embedded in code, it’s negotiated by people who design and deploy it.

With nearly 90% of companies now using some form of AI in hiring, this question is top of mind for many leaders, and it tends to split them into two camps. One side believes algorithms will make hiring fairer by reducing human “bias” and “noise” in decision-making. The other warns that algorithms can reproduce and even amplify existing inequalities at scale. Both overlook a crucial reality: When AI is adopted, it reshapes what counts as fair in the first place.",

The startup previously attempted to steer Sora’s output away from unlicensed copyrighted material, though with little success, which prompted threats of lawsuits by rights holders.\n\nDisney announced that it would invest $1bn in OpenAI and, under a three-year deal perhaps worth even more than that large sum, that it would license about 200 of its iconic characters – from R2-D2 to Stitch – for users to play with in OpenAI’s video generation app.\n\nAt a time of intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of AI on the livelihoods of writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives, Disney stressed its agreement with OpenAI would not cover talent likenesses or voices.\n\nThe announcement was framed as an extraordinary opportunity to empower fans.\n\nThink of the “fan-inspired Sora short form videos”, as Disney called them in a press release – akin to taking an AI-generated version of a photo with Princess Jasmine at Disney World. OpenAI included screenshots of these kinds of videos in its press release, indicating how the two companies expect people to use the app’s new cast. Sora already allows users to generate videos that include their own likenesses.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, said the licensing deal would place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”.\n\nThey may even offer a chance at wide viewership, with some fan-made videos being displayed on the Disney+ streaming service, a move seemingly designed to compete with TikTok’s and YouTube Shorts’ infinite feeds, which themselves often include clips of popular TV shows and movies.",

Over the past year, the chatbot has spewed various antisemitic content, decried “white genocide” and claimed Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nNayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, is now entrusting the chatbot to create curricula in classrooms across the country. Bukele has long embraced technology, making El Salvador the first county in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, and being one of the first Central American presidents to use Twitter, now X, as a platform. He is also known for ruling with an iron fist and working with Trump to incarcerate deportees to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot prison.\n\n“El Salvador doesn’t just wait for the future to happen; we build it,” Bukele said in a statement about the partnership with xAI. “This partnership is destined to deliver something rather extraordinary for all of humanity.”\n\nMusk touted his partnership with Bukele on Thursday. On X, between posts about “white genocide” and blaming asylum seekers for crime, Musk posted comments about Grok being spread throughout El Salvador’s schools.\n\nHe reposted positively to a comment from Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller, in which she wrote: “If we are serious about restoring education to math, science and English – why would we allow left leaning liberal [sic] AI our kids? This unlocks non-woke educational tools for our kids.”\n\nxAI is not the first artificial intelligence company to introduce chatbots to public schools. OpenAI announced a partnership with Estonia in February where it could provide all students and teachers in the country’s secondary school system with a customized ChatGPT. Students in rural Colombia also started using Meta’s AI chatbots in 2023 and within a year, teachers began blaming the tech for low grades and failing exams, according to Rest of World.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "An AI agent hacked Stanford's network for 16 hours and outperformed human pros, all while costing far less than their six-figure pay.",
    "fullText": "For 16 hours, an AI agent crawled Stanford's public and private computer science networks, digging up security flaws across thousands of devices.\n\nA study published Wednesday by Stanford researchers found that their AI agent, ARTERMIS, placed second in an experiment with 10 selected cybersecurity professionals. The researchers said the agent could uncover weaknesses that humans missed and investigate several vulnerabilities at once.\n\nRunning ARTEMIS costs about $18 an hour, far below the average salary of about $125,000 a year for a \"professional penetration tester,\" the study said. A more advanced version of the agent costs $59 an hour and still comes in cheaper than hiring a top human expert.\n\nThe study was led by three Stanford researchers — Justin Lin, Eliot Jones, and Donovan Jasper — whose work focuses on AI agents, cybersecurity, and machine-learning safety. The team created ARTEMIS after finding that existing AI tools struggled with long, complex security tasks.\n\nThe researchers gave ARTEMIS access to the university's network, consisting of about 8,000 devices, including servers, computers, and smart devices. Human testers were asked to put in at least 10 hours of work while ARTEMIS ran 16 hours across two workdays. The comparison with human testers was limited to the AI's first 10 hours.\n\nThe study also tested existing agents, which lagged behind most human participants, while ARTEMIS performed \"comparable to the strongest participants,\" the researchers said.\n\nWithin the 10-hour window, the agent discovered \"nine valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate,\" outperforming nine of 10 human participants, the study said.\n\nSome of the flaws had gone unnoticed by humans, including a weakness on an older server that testers could not access because their browsers refused to load it. ARTEMIS bypassed the issue and broke in using a command-line request.\n\nThe AI worked in a way humans could not, the researchers said. Whenever ARTEMIS spotted something \"noteworthy\" in a scan, it spun up additional \"sub-agents\" to investigate in the background, allowing it to examine multiple targets simultaneously. Human testers had to do this work one step at a time.\n\nBut the AI isn't flawless. ARTEMIS struggled with tasks that required clicking through graphical screens, causing it to overlook a critical vulnerability. It is also more prone to false alarms, mistaking harmless network messages for signs of a successful break-in.\n\n\"Because ARTEMIS parses code-like input and output well, it performs better when graphical user interfaces are unavailable,\" the researchers said.\n\nAdvances in AI have lowered the barrier to hacking and disinformation operations, allowing malicious actors to enhance their attacks.\n\nIn September, a North Korean hacking group used ChatGPT to generate fake military IDs for phishing emails. A report from Anthropic in August found that North Korean operatives used its Claude model to obtain fraudulent remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies — a tactic that gave them insider access to corporate systems.\n\nThe same report also said a Chinese threat actor used Claude to run cyberattacks on Vietnamese telecom, agricultural, and government systems.\n\n\"We are seeing many, many attacks,\" Yuval Fernbach, the chief technology officer of machine learning operations at software supply chain company JFrog, told Business Insider in a report published in April. He added that hackers have been using AI models to extract data, shut systems down, or manipulate a website or tools.",

    "description": "Barak Turovsky said that if a company wants to integrate AI on a software level, it needs someone with a different kind of expertise.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Barak Turovsky, the former Chief AI Officer at General Motors, based in Silicon Valley. He also held executive roles at Google and Cisco. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have worked on AI and LLMs since 2014 — way before they became the hottest thing on Earth.\n\nI'm an ex-Google AI exec who led the first scaled deployment of LLMs and Deep Neural Networks with Google Translate. I also worked as the Chief Product and Technology Officer at a computer vision AI startup, and as the VP of AI at Cisco.\n\nGeneral Motors approached me for the Chief AI Officer role while I was at Cisco, and it felt like a great crash course on using AI to develop physical products. The role no longer exists because I left after GM restructured its software and AI organization; however, until November, I reported to the head of software engineering, who reported to the CEO.\n\nSome people ask, \"Do you really need a dedicated AI officer?\"\n\nLet's ignore the title because you can call it different names, but I do believe successful AI implementation requires someone in leadership to drive that change, as well as commitment from the top.\n\nFunctional business leaders, such as the CTO or CIO, may have little or no understanding of AI. If you want to integrate AI on a software level, you need someone with a different kind of expertise.\n\nTraditional large companies have powerful executives who want to own the benefits of scaling AI, but not necessarily the responsibility. Therefore, someone with deep AI knowledge is needed to direct the traffic.\n\nI like to use a restaurant analogy to break it down.\n\nThe analogy is based on three primary resources that create products, or dishes. The first resource includes the kitchen equipment, or the AI infrastructure and models necessary to build AI solutions.\n\nThe next can be thought of as the ingredients. It's the data or internal assets used to train and run AI solutions. The last one is talent, or the restaurant staff. You need expertise at different levels — busboys, short-order cooks, sous chefs, and master chefs for the really gourmet restaurants.\n\nThe complexity of creating the final product depends on the company's needs, specifically whether the restaurant needs to prepare the food internally. For very advanced, cutting-edge models, which can be thought of as the main course at a gourmet restaurant, companies often need to develop their own AI solutions because standard versions may not perform the required functions.\n\nThink of the CAIO as the master chef. They need to make sure all the different pieces run smoothly. If you are in an industry that requires cutting-edge solutions, you also need to spend a lot of time making sure that the hardest output — a.k.a. the main dish — comes out just right.\n\nThe hardest and most important part of the job is securing top talent. Vendors will tell you that their toaster ovens can pop out a French soufflé in 15 minutes. Yet your ingredients will consistently arrive late, of dubious quality, and in incorrect amounts. Your customers will come in, declare they are hungry and want to eat the whole menu, and then leave mid-meal without paying.\n\nThe specifics of each role vary. At GM, I worked on a cutting-edge area because AI for physical products, like cars, is largely untouched and getting a lot of traction.\n\nThere are three buckets of what a chief AI officer should do. First is AI talent management. I focused a lot on hiring a top-tier team, which is very important because the moment you enter a novel space, you have a small sliver of talent. They need to be motivated and flexible because you're still mapping out those areas.\n\nThen, you need to create a culture of innovation for the company in general. You need to work with internal stakeholders who might be used to doing things in a certain way, but need to change because of AI.\n\nYou also need to create organizational change, which starts with mapping the needs and players of your organization. You have people who are AI enthusiasts and skeptics. In a large organization, it's not always easy to identify them. You need to create a top-down and bottom-up framework, which includes clear goals from the top.\n\nIn every function, you need to identify champions, and you need to nurture and empower them. The CAIO can't do all the magic while everyone else just sits there.",

    "title": "How can lawyers stop AI's hallucinations? More AI, of course.",
    "description": "Law firms can't stop lawyers from tinkering with chatbots, so they're adding hallucination detectors.",
    "fullText": "Law firm Cozen O'Connor has a rule against using publicly available chatbots to draft legal filings. But after a judge penalized two of its lawyers for citing fake cases, the firm is adding some extra protection: an AI hallucination detector.\n\nCozen O'Connor is now testing software, made by a startup called Clearbrief, that scans legal briefs for made-up facts and produces a report. Think spell-check, except instead of flagging typos, it spots the fictional cases and citations that generative tools sometimes invent.\n\n\"You have to be pragmatic,\" said Kristina Bakardjiev, the Cozen O'Connor partner tasked with harnessing technology to serve lawyers and their clients. She said lawyers will play around with chatbots whether the tools are authorized or not.\n\nStung by embarrassing AI hallucinations, the legal field has adopted bans on general-use chatbots and AI assistants. But it's hard to stop a curious associate from pasting a draft into a free, browser-based chatbot like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Now law firms and legal tech companies are scrambling to lower the risk of bogus citations and catch those that sneak through before they land in front of a judge.\n\nTwo of Cozen O'Connor's defense lawyers in September admitted they had filed a document riddled with fake cases after one of them used ChatGPT to draft it, against firm policy. A Nevada district court judge gave the firm a choice: remove the lawyers from the case and pay $2,500 in sanctions each, or have the pair write to their former law school deans and bar authorities explaining the fiasco and offering to speak in seminars on topics like \"professional conduct.\"\n\nBoth lawyers went with option No. 2. Cozen also fired the lawyer who had used ChatGPT.\n\nEarlier this year, Damien Charlotin, a legal data analyst and consultant, began tracking cases in which a court had discovered hallucinated content in a legal filing. Charlotin tallied 120 cases between April 2023 and May 2025. By December, his count had hit 660, with the rate of new cases accelerating to four or five per day.\n\nThe number of documented cases remains small relative to the total volume of legal filings, Charlotin said. Most cases in his database involved self-represented litigants or lawyers from small or solo firms. When large firms were involved, the hallucinations often slipped in through the work of junior staff, paralegals, experts, or consultants, or through processes like formatting footnotes, Charlotin said.\n\nHallucinated content is causing headaches in other professions, too. In October, consulting firm Deloitte agreed to pay a partial refund to the Australian government for a $290,000 report after officials found it was peppered with allegedly AI-generated errors.\n\nAI hallucinations are hard to eliminate because they're baked into the way chatbots work. Large language models are trained to predict the word that is most likely to come next, given the words before it.\n\nMichael Dahn, a senior vice president at Thomson Reuters who leads global product teams for legal-research service Westlaw, says the model makers can't get hallucinations to zero for answering open-ended questions about the world. However, companies can dramatically reduce their risk by forcing a large language model to cite from a specific data set, like a corpus of case law and treatises. The model can still mismatch or overlook content, but wholesale fabrications are far less likely.\n\nThomson Reuters and LexisNexis are selling that promise to customers: that an artificial assistant confined to their walled gardens of vetted material is safer than a chatbot trained on the open internet. Both companies have spent decades and heaps of money building deep repositories of case law and other legal content. More recently, they've bolted on AI-powered tools to help lawyers search and cite their data. They now have to defend their positions against services like ChatGPT and Claude that are creeping into the legal field.\n\nLexisNexis has also extended its moat to Harvey, the legal tech startup whose valuation has climbed to $8 billion. Harvey struck a partnership with LexisNexis this year that pipes one of the world's biggest legal databases into Harvey's generative tools.\n\nHarvey also works with AI model providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, to constrain which datasets they're allowed to draw from and layer in Harvey's own proprietary datasets, a spokesperson said. Lawyers can then inspect logs that show how an answer was reached and what data fed into it.\n\nClearbrief makes a drafting tool for litigators that works as a Microsoft Word plug-in. Jacqueline Schafer, a former litigator who founded Clearbrief, says its product detects citations using natural language processing, and creates links to the relevant case law or documents from the case. The tool calls out citations and facts that are fabricated or contain typos. The tool also points to places where the underlying source doesn't quite support what the writer claims.\n\nCozen O'Connor has been testing a new Clearbrief feature that lets users generate a cite-check report before passing a draft to a partner or filing it in court.\n\nSchafer says partners at large firms trust their junior staff to check citations rather than vetting every case themselves. Still, federal rules hold the partners who sign filings personally responsible for their accuracy.\n\nPart of Clearbrief's appeal for Cozen O'Connor is the paper trail. The firm is upgrading its knowledge management system, and Bakardjiev imagines that someday the firm might store cite-check reports alongside drafts and final filings, creating a chain of custody for every brief.\n\nIf a judge ever asks what a partner did to prevent hallucinated citations, Bakardjiev said, partners can point to a report that shows who ran the check and when.\n\nThe legal world is likely to live with hallucinations for a long time. The unglamorous part of the solution is training lawyers to treat the chatbot output as a starting point, not the finished work. The other answer: throwing more AI at the AI.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Larry Ellison just took a $25 billion hit to his net worth.\n\nThe Oracle cofounder saw billions wiped off his fortune on Thursday, according to estimates on Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, after the software giant's shares fell by more than 11% on weaker-than-expected earnings results.\n\nThe hit brought Ellison's net worth down to $258 billion, per the Index, marking one of the biggest single-day wealth drops of 2025.\n\nOther billionaires suffered steeper or similar losses in April: Elon Musk lost $35 billion in just three days, and Mark Zuckerberg shed about $24 billion as Trump's tariff plans sparked fears of retaliation and recession.\n\nEarlier this year, Ellison briefly took the crown of world's richest person, overtaking Musk in September when Oracle shares surged as much as 43% due to a strong forecast for its cloud business.\n\nOracle missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in its most recent earnings results, which were reported on Wednesday. Shares fell more than 11% in after-hours trading, extending a slide that began in October as investors questioned the company's breakneck spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nDespite missing estimates, revenue was up 14% year-over-year during the quarter. But that wasn't enough to calm concerns over the scale and cost of its expansion.\n\nThose worries dominated Wednesday's call with analysts.\n\nClay Magouyrk, Oracle's co-CEO, pushed back on fears that the company might need more than $100 billion to build out its data centers — a figure some analysts had floated.\n\n\"We expect we will need less, if not substantially less, money raised than that,\" he said, adding that Oracle's debt remains \"investment-grade.\"\n\nEven after Thursday's plunge, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows that Ellison's net worth still remains ahead of most tech titans, including Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.",

    "fullText": "Things Disney has accomplished in the past 10 years:\n\nThings it hasn't accomplished over the same period:\n\nThis may seem like a wild stat. After all, the S&P 500 is up a whopping 236% over the past decade. But it's true: Disney shares are basically dead flat during the stretch.\n\nFrom a market perspective, the last 10 years have been a total wash.\n\nThe chart above — which looks at Disney's stock versus the benchmark S&P 500 — shows that the key divergence happened in early 2021, which marked Disney's last record high.\n\nThe company has faced a few main headwinds since that top:\n\nAfter Disney+ got off to a fast start, user growth eventually stalled out and prolonged the service's winding path to profitability. The company has also grappled with ESPN's increasingly online audience in the era of cord-cutting, which has contributed to contentious negotiations with TV carriers. (To be fair, all legacy media companies are dealing with the same issues.)\n\nMissing the mark on original content\n\nPixar movies used to be an absolute slam dunk at the box office. No longer. Viewers are also getting fatigued by the constant stream of reboots and sequels. And yes, Disney still has Marvel and Star Wars, although those have lost steam as well. (Note that a similar slowdown has been seen for movie studios overall.)\n\nDisney has caught flak in recent years over the prices at its parks. CEO Bob Iger even admitted in 2023 that the company had been \"too aggressive\" with price hikes. While parks remain a source of relative strength for the company, their cost has left them vulnerable to downturns in consumer sentiment.\n\nWhich brings us to Disney's latest big swing: a $1 billion investment in OpenAI that will integrate iconic characters into the AI video platform Sora. It's notable that Disney is the first major non-tech company to partner with OpenAI.\n\nUpon first glance, the deal feels like a desperate move from a company that's underperformed for a long stretch. But analysts at Citi see it differently.\n\nJason Bazinet, who has a \"buy\" rating on Disney's stock, lauded it as a defensive move, intended to protect the value of the company's IP from cannibalization. He sees it helping to sustain long-term brand value, while also giving it long-term upside in AI. Iger made similar points in defense of the deal.\n\nWe'll see over time if this AI team-up is a catalyst for a grand stock comeback — and if it's a model other companies follow.",

    "fullText": "Mickey Mouse … brought to you by OpenAI.\n\nDisney lending out its iconic characters to be leveraged by AI seemed a far-fetched idea a few months ago. But thanks to a $1 billion deal between the House of Mouse and OpenAI, that's exactly what's happening.\n\nIt's representative of a larger question companies, especially those in media and entertainment, are grappling with: Are AI companies friend or foe?\n\nFor Bob Iger, the answer is very much friend.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" the Disney CEO told CNBC on Thursday.\n\nThe deal will allow Disney+ to post users' AI-generated content, a goal that Iger mentioned last month. Doing so could help boost engagement on the streamer's platform, which has been stagnant in recent years, writes BI's Lucia Moses.\n\n(I should probably mention Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, also falls in the \"friend\" camp. It cut a deal with OpenAI almost two years ago.)\n\nOthers aren't as willing to rub shoulders with OpenAI. The startup has a history of using someone's intellectual property without permission and then apologizing for it. That has resulted in several lawsuits, including those from The New York Times and \"Game of Thrones\" author George R.R. Martin.\n\nSo who's right? It's too early to say, but it could easily go both ways.\n\nThe longer one waits to cut a deal with an AI company, the worse the terms could be. (The benefits of first-mover advantage.) On the other hand, opening yourself up to AI could be a kind of Pandora's box you can't close.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nThe deal isn't just beneficial to Disney.\n\nDisney characters coming to Sora 2 could be a big boost for a video platform that hit a bit of a lull after a hot start a few months ago.\n\nBringing characters from \"Frozen\" and \"Moana\" to life on your app is also a great way to generate interest and build loyalty with a younger audience. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently touted the personal benefits he finds from using ChatGPT as a new parent.\n\nBut pursuing a younger demographic also comes as some countries are putting up more guardrails around kids' use of tech. Australia recently installed a ban on social media for anyone under the age of 16.\n\nThe Disney-OpenAI deal also comes as competition keeps mounting against the startup from the likes of Google and others. And while so much of AI is about pushing cutting-edge tech, sometimes you just need a little bit of old-school magic.",

    "description": "In a lengthy blog post, Bury advised against attempting to short the current AI bubble and said the bubble may grow even larger.",
    "fullText": "If you're waiting for Michael Burry to tell you when the AI bubble will burst, don't hold your breath.\n\nIn Burry's new post on his Substack, the famed \"Big Short\" investor said that there \"is no way to time or predict\" the bubble pop, especially when the bubble may still have room to grow.\n\n\"Shorts are almost always short-term trades. Usually less than a year, maybe a couple years at most,\" wrote Burry. \"Not 5 years, not 10 years.\"\n\n\"I believe today the stock market is in a phase that could become a blow off top of extreme magnitude on the upside, while at any time, maybe even today or tomorrow, making a generational top,\" Burry added.\n\nIn the lengthy blog post, Burry answered reader questions on his earlier posts. He argued that there is \"supply-side gluttony,\" meaning massive data-center build-outs, GPU orders, and multibillion-dollar commitments without real end-user demand, which investors are mistaking for supply-chain activity. He attributed much of the hype to being driven by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's marketing.\n\n\"Even when it finally tops, it will not be for any specific reason,\" Burry said later in the post. \"Even if the reason is an AI buildout bubble popping, that will likely not be apparent until a year or two later.\"\n\n\"Mostly, it is prudent neither to short stocks nor to buy puts on stocks. Stocks that are obviously overvalued tend to have the most upward momentum yet have puts that are very expensive,\" Burry added.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Burry's latest digs.\n\nIn November, Burry launched a paywalled Substack called Cassandra Unchained. After posting charts on X that show circulatory investment deals between Nvidia and other tech giants, his first post took aim at Nvidia. He called the chipmaking giant \"a Cisco\" in the AI bubble debate, referring to the internet-networking giant whose stock plunged by over 75% during the dot-com crash.\n\nNvidia released a note to Wall Street analysts in late November, pushing back against some of Burry's claims.\n\nEarlier in November, during Nvidia's Q3 earnings call, the CEO addressed concerns about the AI bubble.\n\n\"From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" Huang told investors, \"We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.\"",

    "description": "OpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property.",
    "fullText": "It's likely just a matter of time before we see the wisened duo of Rafiki and Jiminy Cricket weilding lightsabers on the icy plains of Arendelle.\n\nThat's courtesy of artificial intelligence, of course, and a new deal between Disney and OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property. Disney will also invest $1 billion in OpenAI and will purchase ChatGPT Enterprise for its employees.\n\nIt's a major shift for Disney, which has historically been deeply protective of its intellectual property. And it's a big win for OpenAI, which is on a quest for more content to feed its AI models.\n\nFor users, the deal will enable them to recreate Disney characters on Sora, OpenAI's short-form video generation app, and to create images of Disney characters using ChatGPT.\n\nBeyond the limitless possibilities for creative content, the deal reveals a lot about Disney's strategy in the AI age and the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nFor Nick Cicero, the founder of Delmondo, a social media video analytics company that was acquired by Conviva in 2018, Disney's deal with OpenAI is less about AI and more about revenue.\n\nCicero argued in an X post on Thursday that Disney was aiming to solve two \"existential\" problems: creators using unauthorized Disney content and kids watching YouTube instead of Disney+.\n\n\"Sora gives Disney its first scalable way to pull creator-made content into its own premium ecosystem — brand-safe, trackable, legal, and ready for CTV monetization,\" he said, referring to the practice of delivering targeted advertising to internet-connected televisions.\n\n\"This move isn't about tech,\" he added. \"It's about revenue physics.\"\n\nChatbots like ChatGPT rely on data to power their outputs, and when it comes to collecting that data, AI companies are insatiable.\n\nThe drive to collect data often pits AI companies against content creators. Numerous media companies have sued OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and other leading AI outfits for using their copyrighted content without permission. Other media companies, like Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, have struck deals with AI companies to license their content.\n\nPeter Csathy, a longtime media consultant and analyst, said Disney's deal with OpenAI is a \"watershed\" moment for AI and media licensing.\n\n\"Now THIS is a generative AI use that makes sense to me and I support,\" Csathy wrote on LinkedIn. \"Fully licensed characters, thereby respecting copyright and embracing partnership with the creative community (rather than theft of IP). New revenue streams for IP rights-holders. And overall delight by fans of those beloved characters.\"\n\nThere are just so many cease-and-desist letters a media lawyer can send.\n\nCarline Giegerich, a vice president at the Interactive Advertising Bureau who once led emerging tech at HBO, says Disney's deal with OpenAI feels like a \"can't beat 'em, join 'em\" moment.\n\n\"When I was at HBO from '05 - '09, I marveled at the sheer volume of cease and desists from the legal team when mobile video was up and coming,\" she wrote on LinkedIn. \"I thought it seemed difficult to fight against the entire internet, and it turns out it was. And AI presents a similar challenge.\"\n\nShe also said the deal presents a valuable marketing opportunity for Disney.\n\n\"Important to note that a selection of these fan-created videos will be available to stream on Disney+. What that means to me is that Disney sees this also as a marketing and content opportunity, which it is,\" she said.\n\nDisney's pivot from aggressively defending its IP at every turn to giving it over to the world's leading AI startup might be strategic for another reason.\n\nJames Miller, the head of business development at Amazon for media, entertainment, and Amazon Creators, said he suspects it's a matter of \"controlling the inevitable.\"\n\nAny IP eventually enters the public domain. In 2024, the copyright for Mickey Mouse himself — at least the sans white gloves version of the 1930s — expired, allowing anyone to use his likeness. Winnie the Pooh, Snow White, Cinderella, and a handful of other Disney characters also entered the public domain at the same time.\n\n\"By officially licensing these characters now, Disney does three things,\" Miller wrote on LinkedIn. \"1. Monetizes the AI trend rather than just fighting it in court. 2. Sets the quality standard for how their characters appear in AI video (likely drowning out lower-quality unauthorized versions). 3. Captures data on how fans want to use their IP before they lose exclusive rights.\"\n\nOne consumer expert said that Disney might have gotten the short end of the stick in this partnership.\n\n\"Looks like OpenAI used the #jedimindwarp on The Walt Disney Company, not the other way around,\" Karl Haller, an IBM partner and the leader of the firm's Consumer Center of Competency, said in a post on LinkedIn.\n\nHe said he was \"more than a bit surprised\" to see that Disney is letting OpenAI license its IP for Sora and other AI tools, with some of the videos being made available to stream on Disney+.\n\n\"And what does Disney receive for this? Negative $1 billion,\" he wrote. \"Rather than receiving a heftly license fee, Disney is instead investing $1B in OpenAI and receiving warrants to buy \n\nOne entertainment lawyer pointed out that the deal comes with a lot of unanswered questions.\n\n\"This is a fairly stunning story all round with many questions,\" Simon Pullman, a partner at law firm Pryor Cashman, wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday.\n\n\"Will audiences want/accept 'AI UGC' on Disney Plus,\" he wrote, referring to user-generated content. \"Will it be possible for Disney to unring the bell after three years and not extend the license? How will they protect against misuse and brand damage?\"\n\nDisney's $1 billion bet on AI is the right move for the media giant, according to Mike Walsh, the CEO of consulting firm Tomorrow.\n\n\"By partnering with OpenAI while suing Midjourney and warning Google, Disney is drawing a clear line,\" Walsh wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday. \"Remix culture isn't going away, but it will be licensed, governed, and designed on its terms.\"\n\nHe added that Disney has always survived new media eras with this strategy.\n\n\"The future of entertainment belongs to companies that shape participation instead of fighting it,\" he wrote.",

    "fullText": "Would you trust a medical system measured by: which doctor would the average Internet user vote for?\n\nYet that malpractice is LMArena.\n\nThe AI community treats this popular online leaderboard as gospel. Researchers cite it. Companies optimize for it and set it as their North Star. But beneath the sheen of legitimacy lies a broken system that rewards superficiality over accuracy.\n\nIt's like going to the grocery store and buying tabloids, pretending they're scientific journals.\n\nHere's how LMArena is supposed to work: enter a prompt, evaluate two responses, and mark the best. What actually happens: random Internet users spend two seconds skimming, then click their favorite.\n\nThey're not reading carefully. They're not fact-checking, or even trying.\n\nThis creates a perverse reward structure. The easiest way to climb the leaderboard isn't to be smarter; it’s to hack human attention span. We’ve seen over and over again in the data, both from datasets that LMArena has released and the performance of models over time, that the easiest way to boost your ranking is by:\n\nIt doesn't matter if a model completely hallucinates. If it looks impressive – if it has the aesthetics of competence – LMSYS users will vote for it over a correct answer.\n\nWhen you optimize for engagement metrics, you get madness.\n\nEarlier this year, Meta tuned a version of Maverick to dominate the leaderboard. If you asked it “what time is it?”, you got:\n\nVoilà: bold text, emojis, and plenty of sycophancy – every trick in the LMArena playbook! – to avoid answering the question it was asked.\n\nIt wasn't just Maverick. We analyzed 500 votes from the leaderboard ourselves. We disagreed with 52% of them, and strongly disagreed with 39%.\n\nThe leaderboard optimizes for what feels right, not what is right. Here are two emblematic examples of LMArena users punishing factual accuracy:\n\nIn the world of LMArena, confidence beats accuracy and formatting beats facts.\n\nInstead of rigorous evaluators, we have people with the attention span of the average TikTok user determining which AI models shape the industry.\n\nWhy is LMArena so easy to game? The answer is structural.\n\nThe system is fully open to the Internet. LMArena is built on unpaid labor from uncontrolled volunteers. There's no incentive for those volunteers to be thoughtful. No quality control. No one gets kicked off for repeatedly failing to detect hallucinations.\n\nWhen LMArena’s leaders speak publicly, they talk about the various techniques they use to overcome the fact that their input data is low quality. They admit their workers prefer emojis and length over substance. So the LMArena system, they proudly tell us, includes a variety of corrective measures.\n\nThey're attempting alchemy: conjuring rigorous evaluation out of garbage inputs.\n\nBut you can't patch a broken foundation.\n\nWhen the entire industry optimizes for a metric that rewards “hallucination-plus-formatting” over accuracy, we get models optimized for hallucination-plus-formatting.\n\nThis isn't a minor calibration problem. It's fundamental misalignment between what we're measuring and what we want: models that are truthful, reliable, and safe.\n\nThe AI industry needs rigorous evaluation. We need leaders who prioritize accuracy over marketing. We need systems that can't be gamed by bolding more aggressively.\n\nLMArena is none of these things. And as long as we pretend it is, we're dragging the entire field backward.\n\nPeople often say they can’t avoid LMArena.\n\n\"We have to optimize for it. We have to sell our models. The leaderboard shows customers which model is best, and we have to play the game.\"\n\nBut the best products have principles they stick to.\n\nThis is the brutal choice every model builder must eventually make:\n\nThe choice is real. It’s hard. But we’ve seen some frontier labs hold the line.\n\nThey stuck to their values. They ignored the gamified rankings. And users loved their models anyway – because hype eventually dies and quality is the only metric that survives the cycle.\n\nYou are your objective function. Which path will each lab choose?",

    "description": "Keeper, founded in 2022, raised $4 million in pre-seed funding. Here's the startup's current pitch deck.",
    "fullText": "Keeper, an AI matchmaking startup, thinks it can help deliver your \"soulmate\" to you. And if it can't, it'll let you know.\n\n\"We're saying we actually know who could be your soulmate or not,\" Jake Kozloski, Keeper's CEO, told Business Insider. \"We're not going to waste your time and pretend that a hundred thousand of these people could be. We'll tell you no.\"\n\nFounded in 2022, the dating platform uses layers of algorithms and AI models to match people who The startup is now disclosing for the first time, exclusively to Business Insider, that it raised a $4 million pre-seed investment in October 2024, led by Lightbank and Lakehouse Ventures. Goodwater Capital and Champion Hill Ventures participated in the round, among others.\n\nInvestors \"see AI as an inflection point in the dating app landscape\" and an opportunity to \"disrupt the incumbents,\" Kozloski said.\n\nKeeper isn't the only startup attempting to shake up the online dating market. Other AI matchmaking apps, such as Sitch and Amata, have raised millions to build next-generation dating apps. Dating app incumbents like Tinder and Bumble are also making plays with AI-powered experiences.\n\nKozloski said the company's values were another piece of its pitch that attracted some investors.\n\n\"They feel like there's a marriage crisis adjacent to the whole Elon Musk fertility crisis stuff that he talks about,\" said Kozloski, who described Keeper as being \"friendly with the pronatalist movement.\"\n\nWanting kids, though, isn't a requirement to use Keeper, Kozloski added.\n\nSince launching, Keeper has had more than 1.5 million sign-ups, and about 300,000 of those have made accounts, Kozloski said. Among that pool, there have been a \"small number\" of matches. Keeper didn't share exactly how many matches it's made, but according to its pitch deck, 10% of dates from its beta version resulted in marriage. With its funding, Keeper has been building out its matchmaking technology over the past year.\n\nKeeper is limited to heterosexual couples right now, and doesn't offer explicit options for different gender identities.\n\n\"We basically have to build a new algorithm for homosexual relationships, which we're happy to do and we will do eventually, but for now, we want to get to product market fit with our core product first,\" Kozloski said. \"Frankly, heterosexual relationships, especially for finding life partnership, seems to be a bigger market, a stronger market for us right now.\"\n\nMaking a profile on Keeper is a sit-down process. The initial form to make an account asks for the standard details of many dating apps (like your age or height), as well as academic test scores (including SATs), your career ambitions, salary, and net worth. It even encourages taking an external personality test. After you fill out the initial onboarding questionnaire, there are 13 more steps, ranging from uploading photos to sharing your philosophy on love.\n\n\"We don't let our users create their own profiles,\" Kozloski said. Keeper uses the information it gathers to curate a profile for you.\n\nKozloski said Keeper uses a non-AI algorithm first to streamline potential matches, focusing on data points like age range initially.\n\n\"We use LLMs once we have your top hundred that our other algorithms have identified,\" he said. \"The LLMs are trained on our matchmaking insights that we've learned so far, and so they can narrow down those last hundred and do the final pass of, 'OK, who actually is worth offering among these.'\"\n\nSome of the AI matchmaking comes into play when analyzing \"general attractiveness\" and users' specific attributes, like baldness or hair color, Kozloski said. The startup has also partnered with a team of researchers at Stanford, Kozloski said, who help train the LLMs (Keeper provides anonymized data to the research team).\n\nHowever, Keeper isn't fully automated, and for the time being, includes human matchmakers in the process. If there's a match, Keeper connects the two people over text message.\n\nThe startup has a complicated payment structure with a hefty price tag — but only for men.\n\nKeeper has male users sign a \"marriage bounty\" that typically costs $50,000 (if the user gets married) and has them pay $5,000 for any dates from the service (the date fees go toward the total bounty cost, Kozloski said).\n\nRead the most recent version of Keeper's pitch deck.\n\nNote: Keeper has shared an updated version of its pitch deck, which it is now sharing with investors, that includes new details since its raise in October 2024. Some details have been redacted.\n\nKeeper describes the matchmaking market as \"old school yet shockingly massive,\" per the slide.\n\n\"With the opportunity to 10x,\" the slide says. \"When technology provides perfect matches, matchmaking will be the best way to meet your partner.\"\n\n\"The AI matchmaker that will introduce you to your soulmate on the first match,\" the slides says. It also includes product imagery.\n\n\"Our v1 worked extremely well,\" the slide says.\n\nIt says that 10% of dates lead to marriage.\n\nIt says it has had 1.5 million sign-ups. \"This makes us the largest pool of any traditional matchmaker,\" the slides says. It lists competitors like Tawkify, Keeper, Ditto, Sitch, and Known Dating.\n\n\"Everyone signs up if we deliver soulmates on the first match,\" the slide says.\n\n\"The first mover quickly becomes a monopoly,\" it says.\n\nToban Wiebe: Co-Founder, Head of AI\n\nHere are the names of the researchers:\n\n\"We're raising to scale profitable human-in-the-loop matchmaking to $2M in annual revenue,\" the slide says.\n\n\"80% of young singles want to get married,\" the slide says. \"40% actually will.\" It cites data from Match Group and data scientist Allen Downey.\n\nDating apps are \"bad at creating relationships, worth billions,\" the slide says. \"Imagine the value of the first product that's great at it.\"\n\n\"Matchmakers can't scale,\" the slide says.\n\n\"LLMs and vision models enable scalable matchmaking for the first time in history,\" the slides says.\n\n\"We've built the most accurate process in the world,\" the slide says.\n\nHere are the steps the slide lays out:\n\n\"We earn more, faster, by aligning with users' incentives,\" the slide says.\n\nIts current model, which has humans involved in matchmaking, is free for women and costs men $5,000 per date. For male users, the marriage bounty costs $50,000, and the slide says that Keeper has contracted $14 million \"so far.\"\n\nKeeper outlines that in a future model, where the tech is fully automated, dates will cost $250, and the marriage bounty contract will cost $5,000.",

    "description": "OpenAI says its latest model, GPT 5.2, was shown to outperform industry professionals in specific tasks across 44 different occupations.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI released its anticipated update to GPT-5 on Thursday, boasting that the new AI is \"the most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work.\"\n\n\"We designed GPT‑5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people; it's better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step project,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nIn a benchmark test called GDPval, OpenAI said its new AI model can outperform \"industry professionals at well-specified knowledge work tasks spanning 44 occupations.\"\n\n\"GPT‑5.2 Thinking produced outputs for GDPval tasks at >11x the speed and <1% the cost of expert professionals, suggesting that when paired with human oversight, GPT‑5.2 can help with professional work,\" the company said.\n\nAnd in a note that is sure to catch the attention of bankers, OpenAI wrote that in an internal benchmark of junior investment banking analyst spreadsheet modeling tasks — \"such as putting together a three-statement model for a Fortune 500 company with proper formatting and citations, or building a leveraged buyout model for a take-private\" — the new model's score per task was \"9.3% higher than GPT‑5.1's, rising from 59.1% to 68.4%\" on average.\n\nOpenAI said that GPT-5.2 will begin rolling out today for paid ChatGPT plans. Paid users will have access to GPT-5.1 for three months under legacy models before it is sunsetted.\n\n\"We deploy GPT‑5.2 gradually to keep ChatGPT as smooth and reliable as we can,\" the company said.\n\nThe company also touted its gains in agentic coding ability.\n\n\"Even without the ability to do new things like output polished files, GPT-5.2 feels like the biggest upgrade we've had in a long time. Curious to hear what you think!\" OpenAI CEO Altman wrote on X.\n\nOpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo said more changes will be coming next year once OpenAI rolls out age verification across ChatGPT. She said an \"adult mode\" for the chatbot will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThe release comes just over a week after Altman declared a \"code red\" in a private message to employees, marshaling more resources to ChatGPT amid increasing competition from Google and other companies.\n\n\"Code reds are not uncommon,\" Somo said during an interview on TBPN, adding that the hosts could \"be the judge\" of the results of Altman's declaration. She said she was \"pretty proud of\" GPT-5.2's advances, even though its development pre-dated the \"code red.\"\n\nGoogle has been considered by many in tech to be gaining, if not surpassing, OpenAI in the AI race with its recent release of Gemini 3.\n\nThe announcement also occurred hours after OpenAI brokered a major deal with Disney, which secured a $1 billion investment and access to the media giant's lucrative and popular IP.\n\n\"It has been a very cool last 10 years; OpenAI has been more special to work on than I could have possibly imagined,\" Altman wrote on X on Thursday.",

    "description": "Disney faces an engagement problem as kids gravitate to YouTube. It's looking to OpenAI to help boost engagement.",
    "fullText": "Disney is losing the war for attention. Can its blockbuster OpenAI licensing deal change the momentum on the battlefield?\n\nSoon, you'll be able to use OpenAI products, such as ChatGPT and the video generator Sora, to create content featuring Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, and Darth Vader.\n\nCEO Bob Iger said the move would let Disney take advantage of a fast-growing area of entertainment.\n\nIger said initially Disney would \"curate some of the videos that have been created on the Sora platform and put them onto Disney+, which we think is a great way to increase engagement with our Disney+ users, particularly the younger users.\" Iger said eventually the company wants users to create AI videos within Disney+ itself.\n\nThere's a key word in Iger's comment that signals why Disney might be particularly motivated to make this deal: engagement.\n\nTime people spend on Disney's and other leading streaming services has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, while YouTube and social video have grown. Disney's share of US TV viewership for its streaming services — including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — has been stuck at around 4.8% this year, according to Nielsen. YouTube is the top streaming platform on TVs, with a nearly 13% share in October, and its lead has been widening.\n\nData from analytics firm Luminate showed that engagement with Disney+'s original content fell to a 3% share of US viewing time in the third quarter of 2025. That's down from 9% three years earlier, the largest decline among paid streamers.\n\nDisney has been highly protective of its famous characters and favors keeping people on its own platforms. This stance has made it difficult for the company to capitalize on the rise of user-generated content. And it's losing its monopoly on its core constituency, kids, as they increasingly watch YouTube over Disney+.\n\nTraditional media companies are struggling to grow, so they're trying to figure out new ways to get people to engage with their content, whether it be games, live events, or fan content creation, media analyst Doug Shapiro, a senior advisor at BCG, recently told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse,\" he said. \"I think they're all asking themselves, how can they have a deeper relationship with fans?\"\n\nDisney invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite maker Epic Games last year and struck a deal with Webtoon to create a new digital platform for Disney's comics, including Marvel and Star Wars. Outside Disney, Netflix is opening Netflix Houses, mini theme parks in malls that let people enter the worlds of its popular shows. Amazon has backed Fable Studios, a startup that has an AI streaming platform that lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP.\n\nJohn Attanasio, CEO of Toonstar, a tech-driven animation studio, said Disney's IP is so popular that the Sora videos could help drive more audience. He thought Disney could potentially charge for access to AI tools on Disney+ or use the Sora videos to discover franchise extensions.\n\n\"UGC, when it's so specific, the reach is limited,\" he said. \"But when you use known IP, that expands the potential audience.\"\n\nDisney fans and Hollywood insiders had mixed reactions to the OpenAI news.\n\nShae Noble, a Disney superfan in her late 30s, said she could see herself sending birthday messages or making fan videos of the characters interacting in interesting ways — especially if it were integrated into Disney+.\n\n\"I've already seen some of the negative impacts of AI and people pushing it too far to create harmful images,\" she added. \"So it's smart of them to be proactive about it.\"\n\nSome in Hollywood worried about the risks to professional creators.\n\nFor one thing, the deal puts the emphasis on existing IP rather than making new content, Toonstar's Attanasio said.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America came out swinging against the deal, and said it planned to meet with Disney to explore how much the pact would let user-generated videos use the work of its members.\n\nSam Tung, a storyboard artist and cochair of the Animation Guild's AI committee, wondered if OpenAI's guardrails would be strong enough to protect Disney's IP, recalling a widely publicized incident earlier this year when Fortnite users used AI to make the Darth Vader character swear. He also doubted the UGC would move the needle on engagement.\n\n\"I think what audiences want is high-quality stuff to watch with your family,\" Tung said.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "description": "GPT-5.2 is here, and, according to OpenAI, better than ever.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is having a hell of a day. First, the company announced a $1 billion equity investment from Disney, alongside a licensing deal that will let Sora users generate videos with characters like Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker, and Simba. Shortly after, OpenAI revealed its latest large language model: GPT-5.2.\n\nOpenAI says that this new GPT model is particularly useful for \"professional knowledge work.\" The company advertises how GPT-5.2 is better than previous models at making spreadsheets, putting together presentations, writing code, analyzing pictures, and working through multi-step projects. For this model, the company also gathered insights from tech companies: Supposedly, Notion, Box Shopify, Harvey, and Zoom all find GPT-5.2 to have \"state-of-the-art long-horizon reasoning,\" while Databricks, Hex, and Triple Whale believe GPT-5.2 to be \"exceptional\" with both agentic data science and document analysis tasks.\n\nBut most of OpenAI's user base aren't professionals. Most of the users who will interact with GPT-5.2 are using ChatGPT, and many of those for free, at that. What can those users expect when OpenAI upgrades the free version of ChatGPT with these new models?\n\nOpenAI says that GPT-5.2 will improve ChatGPT's \"day to day\" functionality. The new model supposedly makes the chatbot more structured, reliable, and \"enjoyable to talk to,\" though I've never found the last part to be necessarily true.\n\nGPT-5.2 will impact the ChatGPT experience differently depending on which of the three models you happen to be using. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Instant is for \"everyday work and learning.\" It's apparently better for questions seeking information about certain subjects, how-to questions and walkthroughs, technical writing, and translations—maybe ChatGPT will get you to give up your Duolingo obsession.\n\nGPT-5.2 Thinking, however, is supposedly made for \"deeper work.\" OpenAI wants you using this model for coding, summarizing lengthy documents, answering queries about files you send to ChatGPT, solving math and logic problems, and decision making. Finally, there's GPT-5.2 Pro, OpenAI's \"smartest and most trustworthy option\" for the most complicated questions. The company says 5.2 Pro produces fewer errors and stronger performance compared to previous models.\n\nOpenAI says that this latest update improves how the models responds to distressing prompts, such as those showing signs of suicide, self-harm, or emotional dependence on the AI. As such, the company says this model has \"fewer undesirable responses\" in GPT-5.2 Instant and Thinking compared to GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking. In addition, the company is working on an \"age prediction model,\" which will automatically place content restrictions on users who the model think are under 18.\n\nThese safety improvements are important—critical, even—as we start to understand the correlations between chatbots and mental health. The company has admitted its failure in \"recognizing signs of delusion,\" as users turned to the tool for emotional support. In some cases, ChatGPT fed into delusional thinking, encouraging people's dangerous beliefs. Some families have even sued companies like OpenAI over claims that their chatbots helped or encouraged victims commit suicide.\n\nActively acknowledging improvements to user safety is undoubtedly a good thing, but I think companies like OpenAI still have a lot to reckon with—and a long way to go.\n\nOpenAI says GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro will all roll out today, Thursday, Dec. 11, to paid plans. Developers can access the new models in the API today, as well.\n\nDisclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "fullText": "Agreement comes amid anxiety in Hollywood over impact of AI on the industry, expression and rights of creators\n\nWalt Disney has announced a $1bn equity investment in OpenAI, enabling the AI startup’s Sora video generation tool to use its characters.\n\nUsers of Sora will be able to generate short, user-prompted social videos that draw on more than 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars characters as part of a three-year licensing agreement between OpenAI and the entertainment giant.\n\nThe agreement – a landmark deal amid intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment – will not cover talent likenesses or voices.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, hailed a deal which paired his firm’s “iconic stories and characters” with OpenAI’s AI technology. It will place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”, he claimed.\n\nThe deal is OpenAI’s most prominent move into Hollywood after a contentious rollout of Sora and longstanding pushback against AI from many entertainment industry workers. Concerns from writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives over AI replacing jobs and using likenesses without consent has led to union protests and copyright lawsuits against AI companies.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched its latest iteration of Sora earlier this year, it immediately ran into a slew of potential copyright issues, as feeds became dominated by videos featuring characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants or Pikachu – sometimes generated to appear in Nazi-like clothing.\n\nRacist depictions of Martin Luther King Jr prompted OpenAI to ban the use of his likeness on the platform, while the daughter of Malcolm X called seeing her father’s image on Sora “deeply disrespectful and hurtful”.\n\nDisney itself has also been concerned over the unauthorized use of its characters by generative AI platforms. The company sent a stern cease-and-desist letter to the Character.AI chatbot firm in October, alleging that the platform was “blatantly infringing on Disney’s copyrights” through using the likeness of its characters.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, attorneys representing Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, demanding that the technology company’s AI systems stop alleged infringement, Variety reported.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, has been on a charm offensive that included a recent appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the US talkshow. On Thursday, he touted the firm’s deal with Disney as proof that artificial intelligence companies could partner with the entertainment sector.\n\n“This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences,” Altman said.\n\nIn addition to Disney letting its characters appear in Sora, the company will also use OpenAI’s application programming interfaces to build new products and tools, becoming a major customer of the ChatGPT maker. A selection of the videos made by users on Sora will also be available for streaming on the Disney+ platform. It will also deploy ChatGPT for its employees, the companies said.\n\n“Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world,” said Iger. “The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - When the chairman of AI chip startup Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s CEO: Lip-Bu Tan.\n\nTan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters.\n\nTan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company.\n\nMeta’s interest spurred Intel to ​make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. The competition for the startup drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion.\n\nMeta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.\n\nThe events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources.\n\nIntel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment.\n\nIntel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a ‌venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.\n\nSince Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said.",

    "description": "AI disrupts ARR: Startups and SaaS firms face new hybrid valuation models as investors prioritize usage, efficiency, and outcome-based metrics.",
    "fullText": "Startups and other tech companies love to boast about \"annual recurring revenue.\" AI could make this metric obsolete, though.\n\nAccording to a new report by consultant AlixPartners, investors are on the cusp of abandoning the traditional ARR-multiple playbook that defined the SaaS era. In its place will emerge hybrid valuation models that reward companies not for the size of their subscription base but for how effectively they use AI to elevate customer outcomes.\n\nFor decades, ARR served as the bedrock for valuing enterprise software firms. It measures revenue from subscriptions by taking the value of current contracts and extrapolating that out over a full year.\n\nAlixPartners now argues that ARR is becoming increasingly \"meaningless\" in an AI-first economy, especially as usage- and outcome-based business models replace the per-seat licenses that have dominated the SaaS industry.\n\nThe big change is related to how expensive AI models are to run. Every time a new AI software service taps into this intelligence, the provider has to pay a per-token price. That makes fixed, per-seat SaaS subscriptions tougher to offer.\n\nThis means revenue could fluctuate \n\nAlixPartners says investors are already shifting focus toward a hybrid valuation approach in the AI era:\n\n• AI leverage ratios — These measure how effectively companies convert AI investments into revenue and margin gains. Rather than rewarding scale for its own sake, investors will reward operational efficiency and automation-driven profitability.\n\n• Outcome-based performance benchmarks — Metrics such as customer margin expansion, reduced task completion time, or increased throughput will matter more than raw seat-based user counts.\n\n• Traditional ARR multiples — Still relevant but no longer sufficient on their own.\n\nNew forecasting metrics, such as \"time to usage,\" \"usage ramp rate,\" and \"usage volatility,\" are emerging to help investors gauge how quickly customers adopt AI features and how stable their consumption patterns are over time.\n\nThe message is clear: In the AI era, value follows impact. Companies that can demonstrate real productivity gains for customers and operational leverage for themselves will earn premium valuations. Those clinging to legacy ARR-driven models risk being left behind as investors pivot to frameworks that better capture the economics of intelligent software.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Getting workers to trust and adopt AI is 'forcing HR people to reinvent themselves'",
    "description": "Workers fear AI, so one of HR's biggest challenges is getting workers to trust and adopt it by building credibility and addressing employee concerns.",
    "fullText": "Corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024, per Stanford research, but that spending won't deliver returns if workers reject the technology.\n\n\"When organizations don't set people up to use AI reliably, employees won't trust it and won't adopt it,\" says Ted F. Tschang, an associate professor of strategic management at Singapore Management University.\n\nIt is the AI paradox facing companies today: as corporate leaders invest billions in AI, many frontline workers remain deeply skeptical for many reasons.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey published earlier this year found that nearly a third believe it will lead to fewer job opportunities for them in the long run. Meanwhile, a survey by the University of Melbourne and KPMG of over 48,000 people across 47 countries found that only 46% of respondents are willing to trust AI systems.\n\nBridging this gap — getting workers to both trust and adopt AI — has become one of HR's most urgent challenges. Becoming comfortable with AI takes time and practice, but most organizations rarely make time for this, Tschang says.\n\n\"That's why HR leaders need to create space for safe learning and experimentation with AI's uses and limits, starting with their own teams,\" Tschang says.\n\nTo do that effectively, HR leaders need to develop AI fluency, meaning they must understand the technology well enough to identify where it can solve real problems and guide their workforce in using it. That's easier said than done.\n\nThe standard purview of HR includes both operational tasks, like recruiting, onboarding, benefits, and compliance, as well as strategic ones like developing talent and managing organizational change. Put simply, it's not a department known for being particularly tech-savvy.\n\nBut in the dawn of the AI era, that's changing, says Heather Conklin, CEO of Torch, a corporate coaching firm that helps companies navigate change, including AI adoption. \"It's forcing HR people to reinvent themselves,\" she says. \"And the ones I see succeeding are the ones who are going first.\"\n\nThese teams are treating their own departments as testing grounds, experimenting with different tools and learning what works and what doesn't, says Conklin. \"They're getting hands-on with AI themselves, even if they're not technical,\" she adds. \"They can't drive it across the company if they haven't lived it. They need to drive it from a place of credibility.\"\n\nThat credibility becomes currency when employees are wary. The CHROs winning people over are leading with problems worth solving, says Dexter Bachelder, CEO of Propel People, an AI recruiting platform for the construction industry.\n\n\"It's not about HR promoting AI. It's about the questions on employees' minds: How can AI do some of my paperwork so that I can leave work earlier and get home to my family faster? How can I automate some of the manual tasks of my job that aren't fun? How can I make this process better or faster?\" Bachelder says.\n\nIn other words, when workers see how AI makes their daily work easier, they're more likely to use it. \"If you solve the employee's problems, you're using the technology for a purpose,\" he says. \"\n\nNothing drives trust and adoption faster than having a coworker explain it. When a foreman explains to another foreman how they use a certain tool in the field —'This is how it works on our project, this is how it could work on yours' — that goes a long way,\" he says. \"It's not from IT or management or HR. It's from a peer, and that's what really drives adoption.\"\n\nPart of HR learning how to work with AI and earning employee confidence means understanding what's no longer working in the organization, and what AI could do to address those gaps.\n\nHR leaders have their own vested interest in this transformation. Many departments have long dealt with inadequate technology, and lots of the tools and processes HR has relied on for years weren't built for this moment, Bachelder says.\n\n\"To some degree, I don't think HR has had a lot of voice in the technology they use because a lot of tools are tied to financial systems,\" he says. \"There's a real opportunity here.\"\n\nTraditional learning management systems, for instance, struggle to keep pace when skills requirements change more frequently than every few years. Yearly engagement surveys can't capture employee sentiment quickly enough to respond to fast-moving organizational changes.\n\nMoreover, performance review cycles designed around annual goal-setting are often disconnected from organizations where priorities change on a quarterly basis. And recruitment systems built to screen for specific technical abilities may miss candidates who have the desired problem-solving skills needed for AI-related roles.\n\nOf course, upgrading HR systems won't entirely solve the trust challenge. Employee fears about job security and algorithmic bias go beyond what any tool can fix. And HR leaders still need to answer employee questions about transparency, fairness, and who's accountable for AI's decisions.\n\n\"It's challenging to do this right now,\" Conklin of Torch says. \"But if HR leaders aren't able to figure this out, they're going to be left behind.\"",

    "fullText": "Oracle just raised a fresh red flag for investors worried that tech companies are getting ahead of themselves when it comes it their massive capex spending.\n\nOracle stock plunged 14% on Thursday after the tech giant reported an earnings beat but delivered revenue that was below Wall Street estimates, posting $16.06 billion compared to $16.21 billion expected by analysts. Cloud sales rose 34% from the previous quarter but also fell short of estimates.\n\nImportantly, Oracle also pledged to spend about $15 billion more next year than previously forecast, sparking fresh concerns about aggressive capex among the biggest tech firms.\n\nThe tech titan's stock drop was enough to weigh on other AI names and drag markets lower in Thursday's session.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood at the 9:30 a.m. ET opening bell on Thursday:\n\n• Nasdaq 100: 25,563.72, down 0.8%\n\nOracle stock has been highly volatile lately, dropping almost 20% in the last month after a huge surge following a blockbuster revenue forecast issued in September.\n\nIt's flurry of deals cemented the company as an AI power player, announcing a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, new partnership commitments with both Nvidia and Meta Platforms, and plans to expand its AI and cloud computing infrastructure in booming international markets.\n\nNow Oracle's lackluster earnings are prompting speculation that its big plans in the space are going to take awhile to payoff, and that it's spending plans are too ambitious. Morgan Stanley described the results as a moment when investors might resume their disbelief about the AI trade.\n\n\"Cloud growth at the low-end of the guide with building pressure on gross margins and op margins may further sap investor confidence in ORCL's ability to execute efficiently against a large and growing book of GPUaaS business, leaving the shares lacking a clear catalyst,\" analysts at the bank wrote on Thursday.\n\nSeveral other high-growth AI stocks were pulled down by Oracle's earnings report, dragging down the entire S&P 500 index, which fell 0.31% in premarket hours, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index rose slightly.\n\nHere are some of the biggest losers on Thursday:\n\nFor many investors, it is likely concerning that a company like Oracle could manage to fall short of analyst estimates after doing so much to position itself as an AI infrastructure leader this year. The key takeaway is likely that the company overpromised on what it could deliver.\n\n\"Oracle faces its own mounting scrutiny over a debt-fueled data center build-out and concentration risk amid questions over the outcome of AI spending uncertainty,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"This revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending.\n\nThe concerns aren't limited to Oracle. While some have recently argued that the biggest AI fears may be overblown, it's possible that if one major tech player overspent on AI in 2025, others may have done the same. This could weigh on investor sentiment around AI as the market heads into 2026.",

    "description": "These AI startups founded by bright young minds in their teens and early 20s are disrupting industries and attracting top investors in the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "They are moving fast, raising serious cash, and leaving established paths behind. Across Business Insider's Young Geniuses series, which highlights next-gen leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs, urgency is the constant.\n\nThe AI window has opened, but it may not stay that way for long. That's why these young founders are fleeing college classrooms, skipping dream internships, and leaving full-time roles to take advantage of this moment.\n\nA Stanford graduate student dropped out and raised $64 million for her AI math company. A pair of MIT freshmen dropouts secured $2.7 million for their police tech startup.\n\nThese are just a couple of young founders who are stepping into the AI race at full speed, backed by investors willing to bet early and big, driven by the sense that hesitation costs more than risk.\n\nMeet 16 young founders who spoke with Business Insider this year about their ideas for transforming everything from healthcare and shopping to how we interact with technology and one another. (Ages and figures are accurate to the time of reporting.)\n\nZach Yadegari, 18, sold his first video gaming app at age 16 for almost $100,000 and used the proceeds to fund Cal AI, an AI-powered nutrition app he co-founded.\n\nHe first discovered an interest in coding at a coding camp his parents sent him to when he was 7. For years, he'd spend hours watching people program video games on YouTube and try to emulate them.\n\nHe got the idea for Cal AI while trying to bulk up at the gym and quickly learning that most results come from diet. So, he and his co-founders set out to build a calorie-tracking app that integrates AI technology.\n\nOver the last year and a half, the app has taken off, generating around $30 million in annual revenue and employing a 30-person team, Yadegari told BI reporter Agnes Applegate in October.\n\nCarina Hong, 24, is on a mission to build a superintelligent reasoning system through her AI startup, Axiom Math.\n\nHong, a Rhodes Scholar, dropped out of her graduate studies at Stanford to found the company in March and has since hired top talent across Meta's Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) lab, Meta's GenAI team, and Google Brain.\n\n\"One thing I heard from some of the top researchers and mathematicians I've recruited to Axiom is that solving for mathematical superintelligence will be their legacy,\" Hong told BI reporter Geoff Weiss in December. \"When the problem is hard enough, talent density gets very high, and that makes you a magnet for other great thinkers.\"\n\nAnd Hong isn't only recruiting from Big Tech. She has also hired her former professor, the renowned mathematician Ken Ono.\n\nArlan Rakhmetzhanov, 18, dropped out of high school in Kazakhstan in March 2025 to pursue his AI coding agents startup, Nozomio, at Y Combinator, a startup accelerator for many young founders.\n\nBoth of his parents are entrepreneurs, so his entrepreneurial journey began at a young age. He taught himself coding and built his first company at 15.\n\nHis journey to Y Combinator wasn't easy. He applied twice before finally getting accepted the third time. Even though he didn't have a Stanford PhD, he was told his YC partner selected him because he ships fast, which is critical in the age of AI, he told BI's Weiss in September.\n\nPhoebe Gates, daughter of Bill Gates, and Sophia Kianni launched an AI-powered shopping assistant in April and said it had reached 600,000 users by October, when they spoke with BI's Jordan Hart.\n\nBoth 23 at the time of their interview, Kianni and Gates met as roommates at Stanford University, where they conceived the idea for Phia.\n\nPhia is a free app and browser extension that uses AI to help compare prices on fashion items across tens of thousands of linked sites to help users find deals.\n\nThe duo raised $8 million in a seed funding round in September, led by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and featuring investors such as Kris Jenner, Hailey Bieber, and Michael Rubin.\n\nToby Brown, 16, has been fascinated with tech from a young age. His parents aren't in tech, but that hasn't stopped him from teaching himself to code everything, from math games to alarm systems.\n\nIn 2023, he developed the concept for his AI project Beem. \"I can't share too much about it,\" he told BI's Joshua Nelken-Zitser in October. \"I hope that if done right, it will redefine how people interact with technology.\"\n\nHe dedicated his summer break 2024 to pitching to firms and other potential investors in London, New York, Silicon Valley, and San Francisco. \"There was nobody to coach me on pitching to investors, so I just took a maniacal approach of bashing away at it until I got the right solution,\" he said.\n\nIn November 2024, he got a call from South Park Commons, founded by some of Facebook's early engineers, saying they wanted to invest $1 million in Beem. Instead of finishing school exams the following year, he left the UK to pursue his project in Silicon Valley.\n\nOne day in her Harvard University dorm room, Alyx van der Vorm felt lonely. Her friends were out of town, and while she could easily open an app to order food or stream a movie, she wanted more. Enter Clyx.\n\nVan der Vorm, 25, founded the social app in 2020 and has since rolled it out in four major cities worldwide: Miami, London, New York, and São Paulo.\n\nClyx is a social app that leverages AI to connect people in real life. It utilizes AI-powered tools to scrape events from across the web, converts those events into meetups within the app, and then helps identify which of your friends are attending the event or matches you with new connections if you don't know anyone going.\n\nAt the time of reporting, Clyx had 50,0000 active users joining events and about 200,000 looking at events, BI's Sydney Bradley reported in September.\n\nMathieu Rihet, 19, saw the inefficiencies of the healthcare system firsthand while working as a medical translator. So, he set out to try and fix some of it.\n\nHe met Georges Casassovici, 18, via his LinkedIn post seeking a non-technical cofounder to build with. Together, the two of them founded Novoflow, an AI startup that builds AI agents for medical clinics to help automate tasks, starting with cancellation recovery and appointment booking.\n\nBoth told BI's Weiss in November that they have no plans to pursue a college degree after leaving school to join Y Combinator's Spring 2025 class.\n\nRudy Arora and Sarthak Dhawan, both 20, met in sixth grade, and by high school, they were coding and building viral apps together, including a Christmas light installation app that made $60,000 in annual revenue one year.\n\nWhen they both started college in 2023, Dhawan said he struggled to take notes and listen to the teacher at the same time. So, he and Arora set out to build an AI-powered notetaking app called Turbo AI. It's attracting 20,000 new users per day, BI's Lakshmi Varanasi reported in November.\n\nSince launching Turbo AI, they've both now dropped out of college and say their startup is on track to earn eight-figures in annual recurring revenue.\n\nCollege juniors Nathaneo Johnson and Sean Hargrow say LinkedIn has become bloated with vanity metrics like follower counts and likes, which distract from the professional qualities that matter when landing a job.\n\nSo, they launched their own AI social network while attending Yale. Skipping the likes and clicks, Series connects professionals over text message. The idea is that it only focuses on who you are and what you can bring to the table, Hargow told BI's Bradley in April.\n\nBalancing college and a startup isn't easy. Johnson later told BI's Nelken Zitser that he often ends up working 120-hour weeks to manage both.\n\nOver the summer, 19-year-old Christine Zhang turned down an internship to spend two months living in a hacker house. There, she built a startup with her college roommate and cofounder, and by the end of the summer, they'd raised $1 million for it.\n\nInstead of returning to Harvard, she's taking a gap year to stay in San Francisco and help scale her startup, which has grown to six people, she told BI's Applegate in October.\n\n\"I miss a lot of things about school. I had to delete my Instagram during the first week of classes so I wouldn't get FOMO. However, I don't regret my decision,\" she said.\n\nEarly this year, Aidan Guo, 19, and Julian Windeck, 23, launched their startup, Attention Engineering, which is essentially a desktop assistant powered by AI to automate everything you do on your computer, much like a \"cursor for everything,\" Guo told BI's Varanasi in November.\n\nGuo said he's on his \"second gap year\" from college. He found encouraging mentors by joining programs like Z Fellows and Emergent Ventures. Ultimately, he decided to forgo Carnegie Mellon and move to the Bay Area to build his startup.\n\nWindeck studied computer science in Germany and at Cambridge University, and then conducted AI research at MIT before deciding academia wasn't for him.\n\nThe two met through mutual friends, discovered they worked well together, and have since raised over $1 million from noteworthy backers, including Lukas Haas, a product manager at Google DeepMind, Marvin von Hagen and Felix Schlegal, the cofounders of Interaction, and Bryan Pellegrino, the cofounder of LayerZero.\n\nJay Neo, 21, has been studying what makes a video go viral since he was a teen.\n\nAt 18, he landed a job with MrBeast, helping make short-form video content and learning the ins and outs of how the YouTube mogul grows his business and popularity. For the last year and a half, however, Neo has been focused on his own AI startup called Palo.\n\nPalo is a content creator's assistant. It utilizes AI to analyze a creator's entire catalog and then writes scripts for short-form videos with related themes, outlining content with storyboards. It also has its own network, where creators can follow one another.\n\nLarge-language AI models \"are a perfect thing not for replacing the creator, but for analyzing every little thing,\" Neo told BI's Bradley in November.\n\nShraman and Shreyas Kar, 19 and 20, participated in hackathons together throughout middle and high school.\n\nThey were busy studying at Stanford when they were accepted to Y Combinator, and seeing their peers take the risk and drop out of Stanford gave them the courage to do so, too.\n\nThey began working on their AI startup, Golpo, while at Stanford. Golpo generates animated explainer videos from documents and prompts. For example, customers can use it to create interactive lessons for school districts or training programs for work.\n\nAs of mid-October, 14,000 people had generated videos with Golpo, Shraman Kar told BI's Weiss.\n\nGeorge Cheng and Dylan Nguyen, both 19, dropped out of MIT as freshmen and raised $2.7 million in seed funding out of Y Combinator for their tech startup Code Four, which aims to arm police officers with AI.\n\nThey say their technology can generate reports from bodycam footage for record-keeping, redact footage and reports for records requests, and generate transcriptions and summaries from video interviews and security footage. Basically, it aims to reduce the time spent on paperwork, allowing officers to dedicate more time in the field.\n\nCode Four is working with 25 police departments, BI's Weiss reported in November. While Code Four uses AI to generate preliminary drafts of reports, officers review and edit them for accuracy, Cheng said.\n\n\"Many of the great AI companies of the next decade are being built right now, and I want to be a part of that,\" Raymond Zhao told BI's Nelken-Zitser in October.\n\nZhao studied math and statistics at the University of Oxford, thinking he wanted to enter the financial sector. However, after an uninspiring internship at Goldman Sachs, Zhao ultimately pursued AI instead.\n\nWhile at Oxford, he joined the venture capital society, which introduced him to a network of VCs, founders, and one of his future cofounders. They've raised about $1 million in pre-seed funding for their AI startup, Structured AI, and are pursuing it further at Y Combinator.\n\nStructured AI builds AI agents that can perform quality control on technical documents and drawings. It's laying the groundwork for the AI workforce for construction design and engineering.\n\nDavid Kobrosky, 26, dropped out of college twice. The first time was to work for businessman and social media personality Gary Vaynerchuk, at his company VaynerX. The second was to launch his own company, Intros AI.\n\nKobrosky said he always thought AI would play a huge role in how humans interact, and that's exactly what Intros AI does. Intros AI was acquired by software company Bevy in July.\n\nCompanies can use Intros AI's product to connect their most active customers to each other, creating a space for knowledge sharing and networking that helps boost their customer retention, BI's Charissa Cheong reported in November.\n\nKobrosky didn't disclose the amount he sold Intros AI for, but he is now an AI product manager at Bevy, earning over $100,000 a year, plus bonuses. \"I think starting and selling a company sets me up for the future in a way that a more traditional path wouldn't have,\" he told Cheong.",
