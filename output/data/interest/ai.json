    "description": "Some (well-known) consequences of AI automating work",
    "fullText": "In the previous post, we discussed several observations, Lisanne Bainbridge made in her much-noticed paper “The ironies of automation”, she published in 1983 and what they mean for the current “white-collar” work automation attempts leveraging LLMs and AI agents based on LLMs, still requiring humans in the loop. We stopped at the end of the first chapter, “Introduction”, of the paper.\n\nIn this post, we will continue with the second chapter, “Approaches to solutions”, and see what we can learn there.\n\nHowever, before we start: Some of the observations and recommendations made in the paper must be taken with a grain of salt when applying them to the AI-based automation attempts of today. When monitoring an industrial production plant, it is often a matter of seconds until a human operator must act if something goes wrong to avoid severe or even catastrophic accidents.\n\nTherefore, it is of the highest importance to design industrial control stations in a way that a human operator can recognize deviations and malfunctions as easily as possible and immediately trigger countermeasures. A lot of work is put into the design of all the displays and controls, like, e.g., the well-known emergency stop switch in a screaming red color that is big enough to be punched with a flat hand, fist or alike within a fraction of a second if needed.\n\nWhen it comes to AI-based solutions automating white-collar work, we usually do not face such critical conditions. However, this is not a reason to dismiss the observations and recommendations in the paper easily because, e.g.:\n\nIf we let this sink in (plus a few other aspects, I did not write down here but you most likely will add in your mind), we quickly come to the conclusion that also in our AI-related automation context humans are often expected to make quick decisions and act based on them, often under conditions that make it hard (if not impossible) to conduct any in-depth analysis.\n\nIf we then also take into account, that depending on the situation a wrong result produced by an AI solution which eluded the human operator may have severe consequences in the worst case (e.g., assume a major security incident due to a missed wrongdoing of the AI solution), the situation is not that far away anymore from the situation in an industrial plant’s control station.\n\nSummarizing, we surely need to add the necessary grain of salt, i.e., ask ourselves how strict the timing constraints in our specific setting are to avoid comparing apples and oranges in the worst case. However, in general we need to consider the whole range of possible settings which will – probably more often than we think – include that humans need to make decisions in a very short time under stressful conditions (which makes things more precarious).\n\nThis brings us immediately to Lisanne Bainbridge’s first recommendation:\n\nIn any situation where a low probability event must be noticed quickly then the operator must be given artificial assistance, if necessary even alarms on alarms.\n\nIn other words, the system must support the human operator as well as possible in detecting a problem, especially if it tends to occur rarely. It is a consequence of the “monitoring fatigue” problem we discussed in the previous post.\n\nDue to the learnings people have made, a lot of effort has been put into the design of the displays, the controls and also the alerting mechanisms of industrial production control stations, making sure the human operators can make their jobs as good, as stress-free and as reliable as possible.\n\nThe usual idea is that a single human controls a fleet of AI agents that are designed to do some kind of job, e.g., writing code. Sometimes, most agents are generic “workers”, orchestrated by some kind of supervisor that delegates parts of the work to the worker agents. Sometimes, the different agents are “specialists”, each for a certain aspect of the job to be done, that collaborate using some kind of choreography (or are also orchestrated by a supervisor). While the generic workers are easier to set up, the specialized workers usually produce more accurate results.\n\nBecause these AI-based agents sometimes produce errors, a human – in our example a software developer – needs to supervise the AI agent fleet and ideally intervenes before the AI agents do something they should not do. Therefore, the AI agents typically create a plan of what they intend to do first (which as a side effect also increases the likelihood that they do not drift off). Then, the human verifies the plan and approves it if it is correct, and the AI agents execute the plan. If the plan is not correct, the human rejects it and sends the agents back to replanning, providing information about what needs to be altered.\n\nLet us take Lisanne Bainbridge’s recommendation and compare it to this approach that is currently “best practice” to control an AI agent fleet.\n\nUnless we tell them to act differently, LLMs and also AI agents based on them are quite chatty. Additionally, they tend to communicate with an air of utter conviction. Thus, they present to you this highly detailed, multi-step plan of what they intend to do, including lots of explanations, in this perfectly convinced tone. Often, these plans are more than 50 or 100 lines of text, sometimes even several hundred lines.\n\nMost of the time, the plans are fine. However, sometimes the AI agents mess things up. They make wrong conclusions, or they forget what they are told to do and drift off – not very often, but it happens. Sometimes the problem is obvious at first sight. But more often, it is neatly hidden somewhere behind line 123: “… and because 2 is bigger than 3, it is clear, we need to < do something critical >”. But because it is so much text the agents flood you with all the time and because the error is hidden so well behind this wall of conviction, we miss it – and the AI agent does something critical wrong.\n\nWe cannot blame the person for missing the error in the plan. The problem is that this is probably the worst UI and UX possible for anyone who is responsible for avoiding errors in a system that rarely produces errors.\n\nBut LLM-based agents make errors all the time, you may say. Well, not all the time. Sometimes they do. And the better the instructions and the setup of the interacting agents, the fewer errors they produce. Additionally, we can expect more specialized and refined agents in the future that become increasingly better in their respective areas of expertise. Still, most likely they will never become completely error-free because of the underlying technology that cannot guarantee consistent correctness.\n\nThis is the setting we need to ponder if we talk about the user interface for a human observer: a setting where the agent fleet only rarely makes errors but we still need a human monitoring and intervening if things should go wrong. It is not yet clear how such an interface should look like, but most definitely not as it looks now. Probably we could harvest some good insights from our UX/UI design colleagues for industrial production plant control stations. We would need only to ask them …\n\nLisanne Bainbridge then makes several recommendations regarding the required training of the human operator. This again is a rich section, and I can only recommend reading it on your own because it contains several subtle yet important hints that are hard to bring across without citing the whole chapter. Here, I will highlight only a few aspects. She starts with:\n\n[Some points made in the previous section] make it clear that it can be important to maintain manual skills.\n\nThen she talks about letting the human operator take over control regularly, i.e., do the job instead of the machine as a very effective training option. Actually, without doing hands-on work regularly, the skills of a human expert deteriorate surprisingly fast.\n\nBut if taking over the work regularly is not an option, e.g., because we want continuous superhuman productivity leveraging AI agents (no matter if it makes sense or not), we still need to make sure that the human operator can take over if needed. In such a setting, training must take place in some other way, usually using some kind of simulator.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with simulators, especially if human intervention is only needed (and wanted) if things do not work as expected:\n\nThere are problems with the use of any simulator to train for extreme situations. Unknown faults cannot be simulated, and system behaviour may not be known for faults which can be predicted but have not been experienced.\n\nThe consequence of this issue is:\n\nThis means that training must be concerned with general strategies rather than specific responses […]\n\nIt is inadequate to expect the operator to react to unfamiliar events solely by consulting operating procedures. These cannot cover all the possibilities, so the operator is expected to monitor them and fill in the gaps.\n\nWhich leaves us with the irony:\n\nHowever, it is ironic to train operators in following instructions and then put them in the system to provide intelligence.\n\nThis is a problem we will need to face with AI agents and their supervising humans in the future, too. The supervising experts are meant to intervene whenever things become messy, whenever the AI agents get stuck, often in unforeseen ways. These are not regular tasks. Often, these are also not the issues we expect an AI agent to run into and thus can provide training for. These are extraordinary situations, the ones we do not expect – and the more refined and specialized the AI agents will become in the future, the more often the issues that require human intervention will be of this kind.\n\nThe questions seem to hint at a sort of paradox, and an answer to both questions is all but obvious. At the moment, we still have enough experienced subject matter experts that the questions may feel of lower importance. But if we only start to address the questions when they become pressing, they will be even harder – if not impossible – to solve.\n\nTo end this consideration with the words of Lisanne Bainbridge:\n\nPerhaps the final irony is that it is the most successful automated systems, with rare need for manual intervention, which may need the greatest investment in human operator training.\n\nIn other words, we cannot simply take a few available human experts and make them supervise agents that took over their work without any further investments in the humans. Instead, we need to train them continuously, and the better the agents become, the more expensive the training of the supervisors will become. I highly doubt that decision makers who primarily think about saving money when it comes to AI agents are aware of this irony.\n\nAs I wrote in the beginning of first part of this blog series, “The ironies of automation” is a very rich and dense paper. We are still only at the end of the second chapter “Approaches to solutions” which is two and a half pages into the paper and there is still a whole third chapter called “Human-computer collaboration” which takes up another page until we get to the conclusion.\n\nWhile this third chapter also contains a lot of valuable advice that goes well beyond our focus here, I will leave it to you to read it on your own. As I indicated at the beginning, this paper is more than worth the time spent on it.\n\nHowever, before finishing this little blog series, I would like to mention a new kind of dilemma that Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper because the situation was a bit different with industrial production plant automation than with AI-agent-based automation. But as this topic fits nicely into the just-finished training paradox section, I decided to add it here.\n\nThe issue is that just monitoring an AI agent fleet doing its work and intervening if things go wrong usually is not sufficient, at least not yet. All the things discussed before apply, but there is more to interacting with AI agents because we cannot simply be reactive with AI agents. We cannot simply watch them doing their work and only intervene if things go wrong. Instead, we additionally need to be proactive with them: We need to direct them.\n\nWe need to tell the AI agents what to do, what not to do, which chunks to pick and so on. This is basically a leadership role. While you do not lead humans, the kind of work is quite similar: You are responsible for the result; you are allowed to set directions and constraints, but you do not immediately control the work. You only control it through communicating with the agents and trying to direct them in the right direction with orders, with feedback, with changed orders, with setting different constraints, etcetera.\n\nThis is a skill set most people do not have naturally. Usually, they need to develop it over time. Typically, before people are put in a leadership role directing humans, they will get a lot of leadership training teaching them the skills and tools needed to lead successfully. For most people, this is essential because if they come from the receiving end of orders (in the most general sense of “orders”), typically they are not used to setting direction and constraints. This tends to be a completely new skill they need to learn.\n\nThis does not apply only to leading humans but also to leading AI agents. While AI agents are not humans, and thus leadership will be different in detail, the basic skills and tools needed are the same. This is, BTW, one of the reasons why the people who praise agentic AI on LinkedIn and the like are very often managers who lead (human) teams. For them, leading an AI agent fleet feels very natural because it is very close to the work they do every day. However, for the people currently doing the work, leading an AI agent fleet usually does not feel natural at all.\n\nHowever, I have not yet seen anyone receiving any kind of leadership training before being left alone with a fleet of AI agents, and I still see little discussion about the issue. “If it does not work properly, you need better prompts” is the usual response if someone struggles with directing agents successfully.\n\nSorry, but it is not that easy. The issue is much bigger than just optimizing a few prompts. The issue is that people have to change their approach completely to get any piece of work done. Instead of doing it directly, they need to learn how to get it done indirectly. They need to learn how to direct a group of AI agents effectively, how to lead them.\n\nThis also adds to the training irony of the previous topic. Maybe the AI agent fleets will become good enough in the future that we can omit the proactive part of the work and only need to focus on the reactive part of the work, the monitor-and-intervene part. But until then, we need to teach human supervisors of AI agent fleets how to lead them effectively.\n\nWe discussed several ironies and paradoxes from Lisanne Bainbridge’s “The ironies of automation” and how they also apply to agentic AI. We looked at the unlearning and recall dilemma and what it means for the next generation of human supervisors. We discussed monitoring fatigue and the status issue. We looked at the UX and UI deficiencies of current AI agents and the training paradox. And we finally looked at the leadership dilemma, which Lisanne Bainbridge did not discuss in her paper but which complements the training paradox.\n\nI would like to conclude with the conclusion of Lisanne Bainbridge:\n\n[…] humans working without time-pressure can be impressive problem solvers. The difficulty remains that they are less effective when under time pressure. I hope this paper has made clear both the irony that one is not by automating necessarily removing the difficulties, and also the possibility that resolving them will require even greater technological ingenuity than does classic automation.\n\nI think over time we will become clear on how much “The ironies of automation” also applies to automation done with AI agents and that we cannot ignore the insights known for more than 40 years meanwhile. I am also really curious how the solutions to the ironies and paradoxes will look like.\n\nUntil then, I hope I gave you a bit of food for thought to ponder. If you should have some good ideas regarding the ironies and how to address them, please do not hesitate to share them with the community. We learn best by sharing and discussing, and maybe your contribution will be a step towards solving the issues discussed …",

    "fullText": "Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure\n\nFor states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.\n\nThe Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states who meet certain application criteria, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.\n\nAnalysts have noted that this $50bn will not be nearly enough to make up for the Congressional Budget Office’s projected $911bn reduction in Medicaid spending over the next decade under the bill (Obba). These cuts will affect both patients who lose free health coverage under Medicaid, and hospitals who benefit from those patients’ Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nChenhao Tan, associate professor of data science at the University of Chicago, and Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida’s college of AI and cybersecurity, said AI technology could provide major benefits to rural hospitals that are frequently under-resourced and under-staffed. They also agreed that AI has the potential to alleviate the administrative burden that physicians at these hospitals often face.\n\nPhysicians are responsible for taking detailed notes on patient visits and compiling them for electronic health records systems – a task that can take eight hours or more each week, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nA recent study found that AI generated patient notes are similar in quality to those of general physicians, but worse than those of expert physicians. Tan said that it’s important to take context – like frequent physician burnout in rural hospitals – into account when evaluating risks and benefits.\n\n“If the baseline is tired human doctors, then I think it is even easier to make an argument that AI may do better than them,” Tan said.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn hopes that AI can help alleviate rural hospital staffing issues, not only by reducing the workload but by attracting more doctors.\n\n“If the equipment is state-of-the-art, and they feel that much of the burdensome work is done by AI, I think this could be one incentive for physicians to go work in rural areas, this might have a great impact,” she said.\n\nThe FDA currently regulates AI technologies that are intended to evaluate and diagnose health conditions because they are considered medical devices. However, technologies that simply transcribe and compile patient notes are not regulated, though they may market themselves as Hipaa compliant.\n\nWhile Tan said it would be too high a bar to expect these technologies to be “bulletproof” before they can enter the market, he acknowledged that “there should be something higher than nothing,” in terms of regulatory requirements.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn also said that the proliferation of AI also creates additional cybersecurity concerns.\n\n“AI makes it easier for ordinary people to hack systems,” she said, adding that AI has the potential to improve patient safety by merging patient records from different providers so that, for example, every provider is aware of every medication that a patient is taking and can thus easily avoid dangerous medication interactions.\n\nBut this kind of technology will also require more privacy precautions.\n\n“The more data sharing there is, obviously the risk for data security breach is larger,” Chagal-Feferkorn continued.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Tan said “worker upscaling needs to go hand in hand” with the adoption of AI technology. But Tan and Chagal-Feferkorn both expressed concern that under-resourced hospitals will attempt to adopt AI technology as a cost-cutting measure without the necessary staff and safety infrastructure.",

In 2020, you were a genius.\n\nMost aspiring entrepreneurs look for \"Business Ideas.\" Smart entrepreneurs look for \"Market Signals.\"\n\nThe internet is not just a communication network; it is a Global Consciousness. Every day, billions of people type their fears, desires, and problems into search bars and forums. This data stream contains the blueprint for the next Unicorn—if you know how to read it.\n\nThis guide will teach you the art of Trend Hacking: The scientific process of using AI to scan the global data-stream for \"rising waves\" before they hit the shore.\n\nWe will show you exactly how to use the Market Signal Analyzer to find your Blue Ocean, validate it for $0, and scale it before the competition even wakes up.\n\nEvery trend follows a mathematical curve known as the Gartner Hype Cycle, modified for the viral internet age. Understanding this curve is the difference between catching the wave and crashing.\n\nThe Market Signal Analyzer Advantage:\nMost free tools (Google Trends) only visualize Phase 3. By the time a line goes vertical on Google Trends, the market is saturated. The Signal Analyzer detects the \"Velocity of Discussion\" in Phase 1, giving you a 6-month head start.\n\nBefore you build, you must filter your ideas through the \"Triad of Profit.\" A valid business idea must pass all three filters.\n\nPeople pay to stop pain.

    "fullText": "Marketing automation used to mean \"scheduling emails.\" In 2025, it means \"replacing the marketer.\"\n\nThe landscape has shifted. The goal is no longer to make your marketing team faster; the goal is to build a system that runs without them.\n\nThis is the age of the Autonomous Growth Engine.\n\nWe are witnessing the most significant shift in business economics since the Industrial Revolution. The \"Cost of Cognition\" is dropping to zero. Tasks that previously required expensive humans—writing strategy, editing video, analyzing data—can now be executed by autonomous agents for fractions of a cent.\n\nIf you are a founder, a CMO, or a growth hacker looking to dominate your niche without burning cash on headcount, this is your blueprint. We will break down exactly how to architect a \"Zero-Touch\" marketing strategy that operates 24/7/365.\n\nTo understand where we are going, we must understand why the old model is dead.\n\nIn 2021, the standard advice for a Series A startup was:\n\nThis created massive OpEx (Operating Expense) bloat. When the market turned, these startups died. They couldn't move fast enough because every decision required a meeting.\n\nToday, a \"One-Person Unicorn\" can out-execute a 50-person team.\n\nThe competitive advantage of the next decade is not \"Talent.\" It is \"Architecture.\" Can you architect a system that scales infinitely?\n\nJust like self-driving cars, marketing automation has levels. Most companies are stuck at Level 2.\n\nThis guide is about moving you from Level 2 to Level 3 immediately.\n\nTo build a Level 3 system, you need three core engines working in harmony. We call this the \"Trinity of Autonomy.\"\n\nThe Goal: Dominate \"Share of Voice\" without typing.\n\nTotal Human Time: 5 Minutes (Review & Approve).\nTotal Output: 1 Pillar Page + 10 Social Assets.\n\nThe Goal: Broadcast-quality production at \"TikTok Speed.\"\n\nVideo is the highest-converting asset class, but traditionally the hardest to automate. Not anymore.\n\nAn AI Video Agent doesn't just \"make video\"; it engineers retention.\n\nThe Result: You can test 20 different video angles in a single day. A human team would take a month to shoot one concept.\n\nThe Goal: Turn traffic into revenue without sales calls.\n\nTraffic is vanity. Revenue is sanity. An autonomous system doesn't just drive clicks; it ensures they buy.\n\nThe biggest reason landing pages fail is \"The Maker's Blind Spot.\" You love your product, so you assume everyone else gets it. They don't.\n\nThis creates a \"Self-Healing Funnel.\" The system identifies leaks and proposes patches before you bleed revenue.\n\nYou have the theory. Here is exactly what to do, week by week.\n\nDon't turn on ads yet. You need Authority.\n\nLet's look at the hard numbers. This is what you save by moving to Vect AI.\n\nThis is not a \"saving.\" This is a War Chest. You can take that $359k and pour it into paid acquisition, product development, or just profit.\n\nThe future belongs to the founders who leverage leverage.\n\nArchimedes said, \"Give me a lever long enough, and I shall move the world.\"\nIn 2025, AI is the lever.\n\nYou don't need a team. You need a system. You don't need overhead. You need output.\n\nThe tools are here. The playbook is open. The only question is: Will you hire people, or will you hire the OS?\n\nYou have the blueprint. Now you need the engine. Launch the AI agent for \"Marketing Video Ad\" and get results in minutes.",

    "fullText": "If Elon Musk and Sam Altman like each other, they hide it well.\n\nIn the latest turn in the rivalry, the two are battling over the top spot on the list of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nWhile the two cofounded OpenAI together back in 2015, the partnership has frayed spectacularly since.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018 and later founded rival startup, xAI. Musk or his company, xAI, has filed lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI held a secondary share sale in October that valued it at $500 billion, taking the lead from Musk's SpaceX by a cool $100 billion.\n\nNot one to cede ground to a rival, Musk is now planning his own secondary share sale at SpaceX, according to an internal letter to employees seen by multiple outlets. It would value the company at a whopping $800 billion. If that happens soon, it means Musk would have only let Altman hold the mantle for a couple of months.\n\nMusk also confirmed on X this week that the company is exploring a blockbuster initial public offering, which might be the only way OpenAI can regain its lead as a private company. OpenAI this year restructured its business, which would allow it to also pursue its own eye-watering IPO in the future.\n\nWhile this valuation battle between the two billionaires is maybe cringeworthy theater for the average earner, it underscores a significant shift: investors are pouring unprecedented money into technologies once viewed as speculative science projects.\n\nSpaceX, which aims to make life multi-planetary and colonize Mars, and OpenAI, which seeks to develop a theoretical AI that can reason like humans, are two of the most visible examples, but they are part of a broader surge in frontier-tech valuations. AI, robotics, and defense tech startups have all notched multibillion-dollar valuations in the past year — bubble be damned.",

    "fullText": "The talent wars continue to rage across Silicon Valley as companies vie for the best and brightest minds in AI. There is, however, one major AI company that says it is not giving in to pressure.\n\nMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said on Bloomberg Podcasts that he doesn't plan to compete with tech giants like Meta by offering top dollar for talent.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's matching those things,\" Suleyman said of the $100 million signing bonuses Meta has been offering engineers, and the $250 million packages it's been using to lure top AI researchers.\n\n\"I think that Zuck's taken a particular approach that involves sort of hiring a lot of individuals rather than maybe creating a team, and I don't really think that's the right approach,\" he said.\n\nSuleyman said he was \"very selective\" about new hires when he previously worked at DeepMind. At Microsoft, he said he has hired \"incrementally,\" prioritizing candidates who aligned with the team's culture and had the right skills, and let go of those who did not.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the top ranks of AI talent are commanding pay packages in the millions.\n\nIn June, Meta spent $14.3 billion on an investment in Scale AI — a deal widely seen as an acquihire of its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Google also made a similar move, acquiring the leaders of Windsurf, an AI coding platform. in a deal worth $2.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that Meta tried to lure his employees away with $100 million signing bonuses, which Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said OpenAI later offered to match.\n\nEven at smaller startups, someone in an AI leadership role can command between $300,000 and $400,000 in base pay, Shawn Thorne, managing director at executive search firm True Search, previously told Business Insider.\n\nSuleyman said \"rotation\" is part of the industry, given the small pool of talent. He cited Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI, Amar Subramanya, decamping to Apple earlier this month as an example.\n\nMicrosoft recently brought in several new hires from DeepMind and OpenAI, he said.\n\n\"There's certainly no 'no poach' agreements, that would not be legal,\" he added. \"People can go work for whoever they want to work for.\"",

    "fullText": "In the following weeks, with further help from me and A.I., Peter made a game based on the light-cycle duels in the movie “Tron,” complete with music and a score-keeping system. He sketched the beginnings of a “library simulator,” and finished his own arcade game, Dot in Space, about a tiny spaceship travelling at warp speed. Whenever he hit a potentially momentum-killing bump in the road, A.I. enabled us to roll through it. At my request, the systems began pointing us toward more sophisticated coding environments—Construct, GDevelop, Godot Engine, GameMaker—and suggesting more ambitious projects. Last weekend, he stayed up late, programming a polished version of Asteroids while wolfing down Cheerios and gulping from his water bottle as though it were an energy drink.\n\nSince Peter is a kid, and I’m a dad, all this can seem cute and quaint. Isn’t it nice that A.I. can help a young person learn to code, and an older one become a coding tutor? But consider what’s happening from a different perspective. In “The Wealth of Nations,” Adam Smith described the “acquired and useful abilities” of a worker as a kind of “fixed capital”—something akin to a hunk of real estate or piece of equipment. It wasn’t until the nineteen-sixties that an economist named Theodore Schultz coined the term “human capital” to describe the ongoing, dynamic process through which people invest in improving themselves. Schultz realized that individuals spend a lot of time, money, and effort becoming more capable. They go to night school, network, read self-help books, and tend to use their free time “to improve skills and knowledge.” The work of improving human capital often happens out of sight. But the “simple truth,” he argued, was “that people invest in themselves and that these investments are very large.” Schultz suggested that these investments, which improve “the quality of human effort,” might account “for most of the impressive rise in the real earnings per worker” that economists had observed in the preceding decades.\n\nToday, it’s obvious that companies and organizations benefit greatly from people with lots of human capital. Meetings are more useful when they involve knowledgeable participants; a product improves when the team building it possesses a wide range of skills. What’s less obvious is that companies and organizations simultaneously struggle to recognize and take advantage of changes in human capital. Suppose someone is hired to do one job, and then acquires skills that qualify her for another. Ideally, the organizational chart would shift around her as she becomes more capable; in practice, the job is often a prison. And when a worker breaks out of that prison, by getting a job elsewhere, she takes her human capital with her. For this reason, from the perspective of the company, it’s almost as though the ideal hire is someone who works feverishly to build up their human capital until their first day of work, and then suddenly slows down, becoming a highly skilled cog in the machine. Organizations want their workers to continue improving themselves—but not too fast, lest they outgrow the systems in which they’re enmeshed.",

    "fullText": "Instead of writing my tech comms predictions for next year like I did in 2024, I’ve written a fictionalized account of my day as a technical writer in 2030. It’ll be interesting to see whether we get there or not. Take it as a window into a possible future, one where AI usage is safer, more regulated, and better integrated with our workflows (as it should be).\n\nMy working day starts at 8:30am, after I’ve dropped my kids at school, rushed home, and prepared some coffee surrogate (nobody can afford real coffee anymore). I open the laptop and Chuck is there – it’s always there, like a trusty butler, ready to summarize what’s been going on in pull requests, Slack threads, Jira tickets, and a plethora of other information systems nobody can quite tame. Its summary connects the dots between my current priorities and what’s happening in the teams I’m attached to, helping me decide what to work on next. Trying to be helpful, it offers to deal with some of the mentions I’ve got by opening pull requests; I let it do so with a small docs bug. The rest I’ll want to deal with myself. It asks me how I feel and gently reminds me that I’ve still got some PTO available. Chuck’s such a class act.\n\nI’m in a team with several other technical writers, but for the most part I work with Chuck, which is what we call the in-house AI agent that we use. Chuck is a vast local language model capable of running on the M10 Silicon processor that powers my laptop. It’s a state-of-the-art multimodal LLM whose pedigree I can trace back to the last iterations of Claude Omni 7.5, before Anthropic went bankrupt and got acquired by Apple. As most corporate models, Chuck is ISO 42001, Turing, and EUAI certified, which means that it’s audited every year for security, governance, and legality of its training materials. Chuck is fine-tuned into several variants depending on the goal; the one I use is chuck-256b-writer. We run it in CI pipelines and locally in IDEs or CLI clients. We can also invite it to meetings as an artificial participant. I sometimes ask my own Chuck to attend calls on my behalf as Chuck-Fabri.\n\nThe thing I like the most about Chuck is that I can configure its specializations by turning modules on or off through the Silicon Brain app. When I want it to play the developer, I add several coding modules; when I want it to help me author docs, I turn on the style guide and grammarian modules, and so on. I can also ask Chuck to spawn copies of itself to roleplay users and readers based on support ticket and sales call interactions. When I do that, Chuck politely asks me to call it through other names, so as not to break character, something I duly comply with. Most system tools and APIs are already compatible with the agentic environment I use, so Chuck knows how to perform most operations on its own. An important detail: to summon Chuck, I need to first plug a physical key into the laptop. The key comes with a red button to immediately stop Chuck in case it starts operating bizarrely. Never had to use it.\n\nIt’s 11am already. I’ve been working with Chuck to write a new docs set for a new feature, telling it how I wanted the docs to fit into the existing architecture and instructing it to tweak and edit. It almost always gets 80% of the work done, though I often have to intervene to rearrange, cut, or otherwise rewrite sections. This hasn’t changed since the first days of GPT and it’ll never improve, because LLMs are not intelligent. They’re the most useful word automation tools at my disposal though, which I keep in check through deterministic tools and linters. Chuck is able to create diagrams, take screenshots of the product through an internal tool, and test the instructions and code snippets itself. When I feel unsure about its output, I ask it to verify what it’s just written through semantic internal search, or by calling its cloud cousin, Chad, which is able to provide answers from federated internal sources. All we do together, Chuck documents internally and remembers in its permanent context.\n\nEven though I’m using a local, non-monetized, and fully audited model that consumes the equivalent of a lightbulb worth of power, I still can’t shake the feeling of being a reverse centaur at times. It helps that Chuck comes with several built-in safeguards meant to prevent me from overworking or spending too much time without interacting with other human beings. At 1pm, which is lunch time in Spain, Chuck reminds me about taking a break. It refuses to continue if it detects stress in my text, vocal, or computer usage patterns. While my interactions with Chuck on the laptop are private and encrypted, it’s allowed to inform my manager or call my designated emergency contact in case of distress. I let Chuck access my vitals on the smartwatch and schedule calls with me on a regular basis to see how I’m doing. Since I work alone at home, this makes me feel somewhat safer.\n\nI didn’t tell you, but my current job title is Augmented Writer. My mission is to ensure that the words that humans and machines use to interact with our products are the most effective at reducing confusion and error, while they maximize effectiveness and user satisfaction. I’m augmented because I do this in concert with Chuck, which expands my existing skills in numerous ways. Without my brain, though, Chuck couldn’t do my job, because it doesn’t really care and, more importantly, because it’s not allowed to. One of the conditions imposed by the current legislation is that AI cannot operate in fully autonomous mode without human supervision. Our docs and UIs, in fact, bear a certificate of human authorship that discloses the amount of AI intervention. By law, all AI generated artifacts must produce fingerprinting patterns that can’t be tampered with, which is trickier with text, but since we must keep full audit logs of LLM usage, this can be established upon request by any competent authority, including the Turing police.\n\nIn the end, my role is more of an orchestrator than that of an author, and I’m fine with that. Software engineering, the field I serve, is an exercise in consensual imagination whose goal is to find repeatable ways of processing reality into manageable chunks of data. Reality is unmistakably raw and imperfect, a stream of floating points and broken strings running through distributed systems: one cannot tame it through clever algorithms, but it can be reduced to abstractions and data structures and binary blobs. Each of those entities has a name; they all relate to each other through words. It’s part of my job to understand those words and intervene when they don’t bring clarity. It’s then also my job to explain how those words are able to handle their parent reality. The docs I orchestrate with Chuck’s help are the artifacts that chronicle and explain the motions of data as it enters a machine and exits in shapes and configurations that are helpful to users.\n\nIt’s 5pm and I’m bidding Chuck farewell. During the night, it will work on some optional docs polish and politely present its work to me in the morning. As I log off and extract the hardware key from the laptop, I think that without the words Chuck and I produced, the machine would be opaque to its operators, a smooth wall without doors or handles. Product truth is at my disposal to weave into a fabric of meaning and possibility, into spells that unlock abilities in autonomous agents, be they organic or artificial. I am an enabler of thought and action. Getting here wasn’t easy, but I feel better knowing that I can continue defending the importance of words with the help of the most clever thesaurus ever created.",

    "title": "My husband used ChatGPT to write our anniversary card. Surprisingly, I'm not mad about it.",
    "description": "I was convinced AI was ruining human connection. Then my husband used it to write the most heartfelt anniversary card I've ever received.",
    "fullText": "As a geriatric millennial and a licensed psychologist, I often lament technological changes that I see as threatening to human interactions, such as AI.\n\nEven though I try to find the gray in all areas of life, I've been rather black-and-white about AI because I worry it's diminishing our ability to relate to one another.\n\nHowever, a recent experience with my husband has made me more curious about AI.\n\nWe recently celebrated our ninth wedding anniversary, and unbeknownst to me at the time, my husband used GenAI to write my card. He was traveling at the time, so he sent flowers and chocolate, with a card attached. The flowers were severely underwhelming, and I'm not just being a brat. My husband even called the company upon returning to express his frustration with how different they appeared in person.\n\nBut when I read the note accompanying the tiny arrangement, I teared up right away. It was heartwarming, meaningful, and really on the nose.\n\nMy husband's lack of romantic effusiveness has historically been frustrating to me. He has made steady progress in this area, and even ending cards with \"love\" more frequently marks such improvement. So, this note felt in line with his desire to share more emotionality, and I was touched that he'd taken that step just because he knew it would make me happy.\n\nMy husband knows about my big feelings about AI, and he shares many of them. It seems like everyone relies on ChatGPT for relationship advice, and the most common use of META AI right now is to ask for guidance about difficult conversations with loved ones or bosses. I see it in my therapy practice all the time, and I'm skeptical about how sound the AI advice my clients receive actually is.\n\nSo, when I, a historically staunch critic of all things AI, found out that my husband had used ChatGPT to create our anniversary card, I admit I had some strong feelings.\n\nAs lacking in the sentimental department as my husband can be, I am at the opposite end of the spectrum — a hopeless romantic, as they say. I save just about every card I get, tucked into a neat little box. When I reread my husband's card before putting it away, I found myself lingering on some of the words. \"…life we built together\" especially sat with me. It's a common phrase, but it's not in my husband's emotional lexicon. It almost sounded like somebody else's voice. And given that we can't go more than a few days without reading about how AI will ruin people's ability to think for themselves, I had that thought. \"Did AI write one of the sweetest parts of my anniversary card?\"\n\nI was delicate. I reiterated how much I'd enjoyed our belated anniversary celebration before I asked: \"Did you use AI to write our anniversary card?\" He copped to it, grinning from ear to ear.\n\nShockingly to me, I wasn't mad. This discovery actually opened a door for us to talk about how useful it is to get a little help writing a card. The pre-printed messages often feel overly mushy, and the \"blank inside\" cards ask us to get vulnerable in expressing our emotions. For many, including my husband, that's incredibly difficult. The result is often a message that neither the giver nor the receiver feels particularly happy about.\n\nBut this year's note was perfectly balanced. The right amount of gush without the melodrama. I felt seen, and I felt it captured our relationship well.\n\nIf AI can help people express their love for one another, that can't be a bad thing, right? Besides, is asking ChatGPT for help any less authentic than using a pre-printed Hallmark message? ChatGPT provided more accurate information about our relationship than a Hallmark writer ever could, and it offered guidance for a note that made me feel loved and appreciated.\n\nWhile the idea of a world in which chatbots replace our friends and therapists is still deeply concerning to me, this recent experience has helped me find the gray in my previously black-and-white view: I don't know that I'll ever come around to AI replacing human connection, but I do see the utility now in using AI to help us enhance our existing human connections.\n\nAt the very least, I look forward to more anniversaries with really accurate love notes.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: More than 150 anonymous channels using cheap AI tools to spread false stories about Keir Starmer, study finds\n\nYouTube channels spreading fake, anti-Labour videos have amassed more than a billion views this year, as opportunists attempt to use AI-generated content to profit from political division in the UK.\n\nMore than 150 channels have been detected in the last year that promote anti-Labour narratives, as well as outright fake and inflammatory accusations about Keir Starmer.\n\nA study seen by the Guardian has found the channels have accumulated 5.3m subscribers and have created more than 56,000 videos, with a total of almost 1.2bn views in 2025. The network of anonymous channels includes alarmist rhetoric, AI scripts and British narrators to attract hits.\n\nStarmer is personally targeted. The prime minister was either named in the video title or description 15,600 times.\n\nReset Tech, the non-profit group that produced the research, said the channels were part of a global trend to produce synthetic propaganda on the platform. It pointed to the proliferation of cheap AI tools that could be deployed to make a quick profit from divisive topics.\n\nOne channel called Britain News-night talked about Starmer and Reeves facing arrest. Another, TheUKPoliticalBrief, touted videos on the “explosive truth” about immigrant crime and marches on Westminster.\n\nThe UK NewsCore channel focused on how Nigel Farage was ousting Starmer, and claimed the prime minister was “sacked live” and thrown out of parliament.\n\nOther videos featured bizarre, fabricated stories about a row between the royal family and the government. One channel, Gold Up!, said the dispute had left Starmer “melting down on live TV”.\n\nSome of the videos and channels were removed by YouTube’s checks. However, all 150 were taken down when the platform was approached by the Guardian. Reset Tech said some channels had created tens or hundreds of similar videos without being deplatformed.\n\nThe research found similar channels operating in German, French, Spanish and Polish, targeting other politicians or political issues. In total, it mapped 420 problematic channels operating in Europe. Reset Tech said Russian-speaking creators operate some of the channels.\n\nIt is believed channels aimed at the UK were being driven by opportunistic creators trying to monetise political division over issues like immigration, rather than overseas political actors. However, it said their presence still posed a risk to public trust.\n\nThe content has caused concern inside Labour. “The rise of fake news online is a serious threat to our democracy,” a spokesperson said. “The public will be rightly alarmed that democratically elected leaders and institutions are being undermined by bad faith foreign state actors and those seeking to profit from misinformation.\n\n“We’ve already seen attempts from overseas to influence fair elections and manipulate public opinion both here and abroad.\n\n“The government is stepping up its efforts to work with online platforms to tackle this scourge on free and fair democracy. But it’s important that tech bosses take this threat seriously and live up to their obligations to remove this type of content wherever it’s found.”\n\nDylan Sparks, UK director of Reset Tech, called for YouTube to take swifter action. “Malicious actors are permitted by YouTube to spread synthetic ‘news’ that disrupts political debate in the UK, while also earning revenue from it,” he said. “This AI-generated, low cost content spreads across the platform undetected, revealing clear weaknesses in YouTube’s monetisation and content moderation systems.\n\n“This specific network focuses on the prime minister and Labour government, but the same loopholes could be exploited by any hostile actor to push an agenda. Because social media platforms profit from engagement, their business model creates an in-built tension between enforcing their own policies and reducing the spread of malicious content that drives revenue.\n\n“The rapid spread of AI has also introduced new risks to the online environment, and platforms need to move faster and invest more to address them.”\n\nA YouTube spokesperson said: “Spam and deceptive practices that try to take advantage of the YouTube community are not allowed on the platform, which is why the channels flagged by the Guardian have all been removed.\n\n“We enforce our policies consistently, regardless of political viewpoint expressed, or how the content is generated. Our teams work around the clock to monitor for harmful content, taking swift action as needed.”\n\nYouTube is now working with Reset Tech over its findings. The platform said its systems prominently feature authoritative news content on the YouTube homepage, in search results, and through recommendations. It has removed more than 2.1m channels for violating its community guidelines.\n\nMinisters have already formed an online advertising taskforce to see what action can be taken to address the advertising-based monetisation of harmful and misleading content.",

    "description": "Rivian executives said AI and autonomy not only makes sense for their company, but also reflects the direction of the entire auto industry.",
    "fullText": "If there were a Venn diagram of a driver who wants an adventure-focused car with off-roading capability on one side and a driver who wants a software-centric, computer-first car that could drive itself on the other, would there be a lot of overlap between the two circles?\n\nOn Thursday, Rivian hosted an \"Autonomy & AI Day\" at the company's research and development hub in Palo Alto, where hundreds witnessed the EV maker's grand leap into the future: a highly integrated AI assistant and fully autonomous driving capability, all powered by Rivian's very own silicon chip.\n\nWassym Bensaid, Rivian's Chief Software Officer, called the move a \"profound platform shift which changes our product and everything we do at the company.\"\n\nBensaid is among the key executives leading the charge toward Rivian's \"AI-defined vehicle,\" along with James Philbin, VP of Autonomy & AI, and Vidya Rajagopalan, Senior VP of Rivian's electrical hardware division.\n\nDuring the event, I had the chance to talk to Bensaid and Philbin about the pivot and whether it makes sense for a company that, since its inception, has branded itself as an adventure-forward vehicle, or if this is just a response to consumer demand.\n\nPhilbin, who was a director at Zoox and Waymo before joining Rivian in 2022, told me that pursuing autonomy has long been part of the company's trajectory rather than an overnight decision.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Philbin sees a rising \"tide\" in consumer demand for some level of autonomy — especially as robotaxis become mainstream.\n\n\"We are starting to see that autonomy is a really important purchase decision with customers, and especially customers who come from vehicles with maybe high levels of autonomy,\" he said. \"They don't go back.\"\n\nPhilbin said that having a high-level advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) was cited as one of the \"top three purchase reasons\" for Rivian customers. However, the demand will extend to all automakers, he said.\n\n\"I just see it becoming such a key purchase driver for vehicles going forward,\" Philbin said. \"And I think every OEM will have to deliver these features to customers in some way.\"\n\nA year ago, Bensaid told me that the future of cars would be hands-free, and that using buttons or fiddling with the touchscreen would be \"an anomaly.\"\n\n\"It's a bug, it's not a feature,\" he said at the time. \"Ideally, you would want to interact with your car through voice. And the problem today is that most voice assistants are just broken.\"\n\nThursday's demonstration of the Rivian Assistant, an in-car AI assistant that can control certain vehicle functions, brought Bensaid's vision to life. I saw the Rivian Assistant pull up navigation directions and control the direction of the air vents through voice control.\n\nBensaid told me at the event that \"cars and automotive are probably the killer app for AI.\"\n\n\"In your 30-minute or 45-minute commute every day, you want to get your time back, you want to really take control of your time,\" he said.\n\nWhen I asked the software chief where the overlap was between Rivian's adventure brand and its AI push, Bensaid said the company \"inspires many types of customers.\"\n\n\"I think at the core of the brand, Rivian wants people to explore the world,\" he said, and that there were different ways to do so, whether that's by going off-road or exploring the world through technology.\n\nAt the same time, Bensaid said, \"At heart, we are a technology company, so technology is really a big part of the user experience, how we see ourselves, and how we present ourselves to the world.\"\n\nBensaid's statement touches upon another key focus beyond the automaker's line-up of premium trucks and SUVs: software licensing.\n\nRivian's joint venture with the German automotive giant Volkswagen was a clear sign of its intent to license its software platform to other automakers in the future.\n\nPart of the tech will include self-driving capabilities, which the entire automotive world — legacy and startup — is exploring, Steve Man, senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told me.\n\n\"We don't really know at the end of the day if there's going to be a huge mass adoption,\" Man said of autonomy. Still, the analyst adds that \"it's a must\" for car makers to pursue.\n\nSales of Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised reflect that uncertainty. CEO Elon Musk has presented FSD as the key driver of the company's valuation even though the adoption rate of FSD remains at around 12%, Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's Chief Financial Officer, said in October.\n\nThe automotive industry still remains bullish on autonomy and AI.\n\nNissan partnered with UK-based Wayve, which develops software for advanced driver assistance systems. General Motors teased plans for an eyes-off driving system for 2028. And Mercedes unveiled a hands-off, eyes-off ADAS a few years ago.\n\nA recent Bloomberg Intelligence report said that nearly half of C-suite auto executives surveyed said they expect AI to lift sales and profits by 9% over the next two to three years.\n\n\"From a business perspective, you don't know if it is going to take off, but you need to invest some money now so that you're not behind,\" Man said, \"and you have the opportunity to roll it out if it is something that people want.\"",

    "description": "Harsh Varshney, who works on Chrome AI security at Google, shares four tips for protecting your data and identity when you talk to AI chatbots.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 31-year-old Harsh Varshney, who works at Google and lives in New York. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAI has quickly become a silent partner in our daily lives, and I can't imagine life without AI tools.\n\nDay-to-day, they help me with deep research, note-taking, coding, and online searches.\n\nBut my job means I'm very aware of the privacy concerns associated with using AI. I've worked at Google since 2023 and spent two years as a software engineer on the privacy team, building infrastructure to protect user data. I then switched to the Chrome AI security team, where I help secure Google Chrome from malicious threats, like hackers and those who use AI agents to conduct phishing campaigns.\n\nAI models use data to generate helpful responses, and we users need to protect our private information so that harmful entities, like cybercriminals and data brokers, can't access it.\n\nHere are four habits I've made that I believe are essential for protecting my data while using AI.\n\nSometimes, a false sense of intimacy with AI can lead people to share information online that they never would otherwise. AI companies may have employees who work on improving the privacy aspects of their models, but it's not advisable to share credit card details, Social Security numbers, your home address, personal medical history, or other personally identifiable information with AI chatbots.\n\nDepending on the version being used, the information shared with public AI chatbots can be used to train future models and generate responses that are more relevant. This could result in \"training leakage,\" where the model memorizes personal information about one user and later regurgitates it in responses to another. Plus, there's the risk of data breaches, which would expose what you've shared with a chatbot.\n\nI treat AI chatbots like a public postcard. If I wouldn't write a piece of information on a postcard that could be seen by anyone, I wouldn't share it with a public AI tool. I'm not confident about how my data could be used for future training.\n\nIt's important to identify whether you're using a more public AI tool or an enterprise-grade one.\n\nWhile it's uncertain how conversations are used for training public AI models, companies can pay for \"enterprise\" models. Here, models aren't typically meant to train on user conversations, so it's safer for employees to talk about their work and company projects.\n\nThink of it like having a conversation in a crowded coffee shop where you could be overheard, versus a confidential meeting in your office that stays within the room.\n\nThere have reportedly been instances where employees have accidentally leaked company data to ChatGPT. If you work on unreleased company projects or are trying to get a patent, you probably don't want to discuss your plans with a non-enterprise-grade chatbot due to the risk of leakage.\n\nI don't discuss projects I'm working on at Google with public chatbots. Instead, I use an enterprise model, even for tasks as small as editing a work email. I'm much more comfortable sharing my information because my conversations aren't used for training, but I still minimize the personal information I share.\n\nAI chatbots usually keep a history of your conversations, but I recommend deleting it on both enterprise and public models regularly to protect your user privacy in the long term. Due to the risk of your account being compromised, it's a good precautionary habit to have, even if you're confident you aren't putting private data into the tools.\n\nOnce, I was surprised that an enterprise Gemini chatbot was able to tell me my exact address, even though I didn't remember sharing it. It turned out, I had previously asked it to help me refine an email, which included my address. Because the tool has long-term memory features, enabling it to remember information from previous conversations, it could identify what my address was and retain it.\n\nSometimes, if I'm searching for things I don't want the chatbot to remember, I'll use a special mode, a bit like incognito mode, where the bots don't store my history or use the information to train models. ChatGPT and Gemini call this the \"temporary chat\" feature.\n\nIt's better to use AI tools that are well-known and are more likely to have clear privacy frameworks and other guardrails in place.\n\nOther than Google's products, I like to use OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude.\n\nIt's also helpful to review the privacy policies of any tools you use. Sometimes, they'll explain more about how your data is used to train the model. In the privacy settings, you can also look for a section with the option to \"improve the model for everyone.\" By making sure that setting is turned off, you're preventing your conversations from being used for training.\n\nAI technology is incredibly powerful, but we must be cautious to ensure our data and identities are safe when we use it.\n\nDo you have a story to share about using AI to help you at work?

    "description": "Though Nigel Williams is looking for AI proficiency, the BlackRock exec shared one part of the application process where the tech doesn't belong.",
    "fullText": "If you want to work at BlackRock, make sure you're using AI — just not too much.\n\nNigel Williams, BlackRock's global head of talent acquisition, said that AI is shifting his hiring priorities, and that fluency with the technology is now key to any strong application. However, he warns against depending on it in the interview process.\n\n\"We want to hire people that are curious, that understand that AI is here,\" he told Business Insider, especially because it's embedded in functions across the world's biggest asset manager.\n\nThe strongest applicants can demonstrate that they are both digitally native and comfortable with various AI tools, and that they're curious about future capabilities. Young talent is \"upskilling itself to meet the moment,\" Williams said, since applicants without a computer science background often demonstrate AI proficiency. Everyone, he added, will need to have a basic understanding of prompt engineering and how to question AI outputs.\n\n\"In this age of AI, the talent skills that I think we need more than ever are people that are curious, have a questioning mindset, and are willing to not just trust what the model puts out there, but also make sure we're continuing to pressure test that,\" he said. Strong interpersonal and relationship-building skills are also becoming even more important, he said.\n\nWilliams said that his team is figuring out how to assess applicants' AI abilities and is mindful of making sure people without tech backgrounds don't feel intimidated. He's interested in how people use the technology in their personal, academic, or work lives, and said his team is still fine-tuning how to assess that in the interview process.\n\nDespite Williams' new focus on how applicants engage with AI, he's not using it to screen candidates. As of now, he uses AI to schedule interviews.\n\nThere's such a thing as too much AI in the application process, though.\n\nWilliams said recruiters and hiring managers have told people ahead of an interview not to use an AI tool, sometimes to little avail.\n\n\"It is quite common. You will sometimes see people looking to the left or the right. Our interviewing teams, if they're in the middle of doing that, will pick up on that and be able to say, 'Hey, we do want to make sure that you're staying focused,'\" Williams said.\n\nBlackRock employs around 24,600 people in more than 30 countries, according to a November 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some 21,100 people worked at the firm as of the end of 2024, according to that year's annual report.\n\nBlackRock has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its equity business. At the annual New York Times DealBook Summit this week, its CEO, Larry Fink, said that there will be \"some huge winners and huge failures\" with the technology.",

    "description": "Tips from an AI skeptic for working with a team which uses AI a lot.",
    "fullText": "So your team uses AI a lot. Maybe you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed by the amount of bad code, or just the volume of code, you’re having to review. I’ve been there too. While AI has gained popularity, I’ve worked with many teams in many industries. Here are some techniques and strategies I’ve adopted, as an AI skeptic, which have made reviewing AI generated code feel less taxing and more productive.\n\nBefore digging into what’s different, I think it’s worth taking a moment to recognize what’s the same. These things are true whether your PR was written by a human or an AI.\n\nTesting is software engineering, but is often viewed as less important by both humans and AI alike. The author may not have reviewed the tests as closely as the implementation. It’s well worth your time as a reviewer to make up that difference.\n\nSomething I try to keep in mind when reviewing AI-generated PRs, and honestly in life, is that perfect is the enemy of good. Not every comment will be resolved exactly how you’d prefer. Sometimes you’ll let things slide that you wish you hadn’t. But steady, incremental influence still matters. A review that nudges the codebase in the right direction is far better than disengaging and letting low-quality AI output accumulate unchecked. If you stay involved, ask questions, and keep the conversation open with your teammates and leadership, you retain the ability to shape the outcome.\n\nFinally, it’s worth remembering that advice like this only gets you so far. If your team is consistently flooding the codebase with poor AI-generated code, that’s ultimately not a tooling problem, it’s a people and process problem. Technology tends to amplify whatever dynamics already exist. The real work is helping the team move toward better habits and shared expectations. No one is trying to write bad code; they’re doing the best they know how. Thoughtful guidance, clear standards, and collaborative review are how you help them know better—and do better.\n\nWe've been helping engineering teams deliver exceptional products for over 20 years.

    "description": "The White House has promised to quadruple nuclear power by 2050.",
    "fullText": "The Palisades Nuclear Generating Station is nestled between sand dunes on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. It shut down for financial reasons in 2022. Three years later, it’s on the cusp of reopening, with hundreds of workers streaming through its security barriers every day.\n\nPalisades is on track to restart in early 2026. When it does, it will be the first nuclear plant in the United States to generate electricity again after being decommissioned. Nick Culp of Holtec, the company that owns the plant, said its revival is a response to a surge in demand for electricity.\n\n“We have seen [Michigan]’s baseload generation go offline at a rapid rate as they’ve moved away from fossil generation,” Culp said. “How do you backfill that when you see demand on the horizon like [artificial intelligence], like data storage, like keeping the lights on at home, and new manufacturing?”\n\nNuclear is part of the answer to that question, Culp said, and the government agrees. Michigan gave $300 million to the restart — part of its goal to have 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 — and the federal government gave the project a loan of more than $1.5 billion.\n\nThat money is part of the Trump administration’s investment in what it’s calling a “nuclear energy renaissance.” In May, the White House released a plan to quadruple American nuclear power by 2050, following a similar pledge from the Biden administration.\n\nMeeting that goal would require dozens of new reactors. But whether they’re traditional power plants or new designs, nuclear reactors are expensive and slow to build. Facing a crunch between climate goals and rising electricity demand, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa are reopening plants that closed just a few years ago.\n\nWhen the Palisades plant in Michigan closed in 2022, Jim Byrd said he left his office of more than two decades “with a heavy heart.”\n\nHe was working at a nuclear plant in Mississippi last year when he heard about the plan to reboot Palisades. Then he got the call he had been waiting for, asking him to come back.\n\n“Palisades is my home. These people are my family,” Byrd said. Since his return, he’s been training new employees in an exact replica of the reactor control room, right down to its 1960s pink-and-green color scheme.\n\nWhile the plant was in decent shape, recommissioning still required repairing equipment and overcoming mountains of paperwork.\n\n“We are creating a roadmap on how to do this, and the whole industry is watching,” said Byrd. “I had existing licensed operators that had a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission when we shut down, so we had to work on getting those back.”\n\nAll that work is worth it, he said, to get the plant back up and running.\n\n“What we're doing here is exciting,” said Byrd. “Having a reliable power source that keeps your electricity costs low, everybody should be rooting for that.”\n\nThe restart also attracted employees from elsewhere in the industry. The plant’s new chief nuclear officer, Rich Burroni, came from New York’s Indian Point Energy Center, which closed in 2021.\n\n“The trend five years ago was a lot of work on decommissioning,” he said, “and now that’s all changed.”\n\nMore change may be coming for Palisades. The Department of Energy said this month it will give Holtec up to $400 million in federal funding to build small modular reactors in Michigan. That technology could help speed up the deployment of new nuclear power in the future, according to many in the industry, but so far has not been commercially viable.\n\nFor now, restarting a plant costs less than a third of what it would take to build a new one, said Culp of Holtec.\n\n“When you factor in how long it takes to construct a new nuclear power plant, especially here in the United States, and the amount of money that goes into it,” he said, “it’s a pretty good value proposition.”\n\nMany of Palisades’ employees live within 10 miles of the plant, which means they could be exposed to a radioactive plume in an emergency.\n\nThat zone also includes the town of Covert, Michigan. Township supervisor Daywi Cook’s father helped build the plant in the 1960s.\n\n“I grew up with the sirens being tested. I think it was every last Saturday of the month,” Cook said. “It was just a normal thing.”\n\nHaving friends and family members who worked at the plant helped demystify nuclear power, she said, and she came to see the plant as part of the community.\n\nAt one point, taxes from the plant made up 40% of the township’s revenue. Now, as Covert’s township supervisor, Cook said she’s glad the plant is reopening.\n\n“Having that stability and having that employment available for folks who live here is something that I think was taken for granted for a very long time,” she said. “I think what's important is that we educate ourselves as residents near the plant and that Holtec continues to be a good neighbor in being transparent with the community.”\n\nZach Morris, head of the economic development group Market One, said Pallisades is an important piece of the local economy.\n\n“Southwest Michigan is a beautiful area. It's just a wonderful community of small towns. I call it Americana,” Morris said. “Americana needs electricity. So the good news is we have a really reliable source of power that is clean. It pays its employees well. So we're excited about being able to keep that online.”\n\nNot everyone is on board with the plant’s reopening. Environmental groups have sued to stop it, and protesters have raised concerns about the long-term storage of spent fuel next to the Great Lakes.\n\nWhile nuclear power does have a record of safety, many Americans remember the 1979 disaster at central Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island. One of the two reactors on the island had a partial meltdown and released radioactive gases into the environment. There were no deaths, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the accident “had no detectable health effects on plant workers or the public.”\n\nThat left the plant with only one working reactor, which produced power until 2019, when it shut down for financial reasons. Today, that reactor, like Palisades in western Michigan, is in the process of coming back online.\n\n“When you walk through the plant now, all the equipment is still there, but it's deathly quiet. You don't hear the hum of the motors, the steam going through the lines,” said Craig Smith, who is in charge of bringing back the plant at Three Mile Island, renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. “It's an eerie kind of feeling when you walk through the plant.”\n\nThat eerie feeling may soon be gone. A red LCD clock in Smith’s office counts down the hours until the plant’s reopening in late 2027, which is backed by a billion-dollar loan from the Trump Administration.\n\nThe recommissioned reactor on Three Mile Island will pump 835 megawatts into the regional grid, but all that electricity is spoken for by Microsoft, which agreed to buy an equivalent amount of power from the grid for the next 20 years to feed its data centers.\n\n“The dynamics of the energy economy have changed significantly, mainly because of artificial intelligence,” Smith said.\n\nNuclear is well-suited to the moment, in his view, because of its consistency.\n\n“Hottest days of the year, coldest days of the year, freezing weather, the plant continues to operate,” Smith said. “As far as a reliable power source, you can’t beat it.”\n\nSmith was in high school in nearby Hershey in 1979 and remembers the evacuation after the disaster at Three Mile Island. That failed to dissuade him from going into a career in nuclear power, and he said today, the industry is safer because of regulations put in place after the partial meltdown.\n\n“People at the plant here take that personally,” he said. “The standards of the industry are greatly improved, and we've made significant improvements to the design of the plants and how we operate them.”\n\nGene Stilp has a different take. He’s one of many people in the area who say the official story of the 1979 disaster failed to account for long-term health problems they believe are related to the accident.\n\nStilp has been fighting nuclear power on Three Mile Island since before the plant opened, and said the recommissioning is an unnecessary risk to public safety.\n\n“We’re sticking up for the people who live here rather than the shareholders of Microsoft and Constellation,” said Stilp, who often appears in public wearing a blazer with “NO TMI RESTART” sewn on the back.\n\n“What they’re proposing for evacuation does not work, and so that’s my line in the sand,” he said, pointing out the 10-mile Emergency Planning Zone includes a major hospital complex and several schools. “The population increases in Central Pennsylvania, the realization that there are so many people at risk here, the best you can do is take away that risk.”\n\nAnother longtime opponent of the power plant, Eric Epstein of Three Mile Island Alert, said the country is making mistakes in its rush to power data centers. He said the economics might have changed for nuclear power, but the risks have not.\n\n“There was no public discussion about whether or not we’re going to restart Three Mile Island,” said Epstein. “You had this psychic tear in the fabric of the community that can't be papered over. You can put all the green paint you want on nuclear power, but there has been no viable solution to isolate nuclear waste.”\n\nConstellation said the spent fuel on site has been safely stored on the island for decades, in fortified containers required by the government to withstand natural disasters, and that all the waste created in 40 years fits in an area about the size of two tennis courts.\n\nDauphin County Commissioner Justin Douglas said he’s listening to local concerns about the plant’s reopening.\n\n“I personally am very interested in transparency and accountability for this in the sense of ensuring that it's as safe as it possibly can be, that we're tracking the cost and ensuring that the taxpayers aren't carrying any of the burden, that we have a good plan for the waste management and that ultimately the community impact is positive,” said Douglas. “We plan for the worst, and we hope for the best.”\n\nMeeting the country’s rising demand for electricity will take a lot more than reviving a few recently decommissioned plants.\n\n“It is a brilliant idea. It's sort of a slam dunk. The downside is that there are not many reactors out there that are realistically able to restart,” said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “You’re looking at a little bit less than three gigawatts of electricity, out of 50 that apparently are required for data centers and AI.”\n\nThere are also technical tweaks called uprates that can squeeze more power out of existing plants, which could help blunt the immediate electricity crunch.\n\n“You probably have potential for another five to eight gigawatts across the whole fleet. So you add that up to the two or three that we get from the restarts, you're looking at 10 [gigawatts],” Buongiorno said, or only about a fifth of the total AI power demand expected by 2030.\n\n“If that demand continues in the 2030s, then you can make the investment now to build new reactors,” he said, “and then nuclear can actually capture a lot more than 20%.”\n\nThis segment aired on December 9, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Hi Ben, you might find this preprint of interest https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17395 Perhaps you are making similar points.\n\nIt is curious that machine learning folks, who often like to say they are \"data driven\" pay little attention to the data at a conceptual level. I think the issue is that the data is taken to be _given_ (as you allude -- someone \"gives you\" a bunch of data). The word \"data\" derives from the latin word (dare) meaning to give. We would be better served to think of capta.... but collecting data is not considered as sexy as making complex models.\n\nOne argument (that simply is wrong) is that the existence of distributions is justified by the \"law\" of large numbers. It is not. For an argument regarding this, and an alternative (to distributions), you might find this other paper of interest. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X24000355 It shows what you get when you don't assume the \"law\" of large numbers holds (i.e. that relative frequencies converge). That the result is something other folks had studied for some time is pretty interesting. That coherent upper previsions arise elsewhere in ML (in fairness, DRO and even in SVMs!) suggests they are not so weird after all....\n\nA common viewpoint is that there is a set of all possible data out there (e.g., all images on the web). We collect a subset of these data and train our model. The main (and likely unreasonable) assumption is that the training subset is an iid sample (or uniformly sampled w/o replacement) from the set of all possible data. This assumption is the central ingredient in theoretical generalization bounds. While it's probably not perfectly reasonable, it does give us a framework for comparing models and algorithms, and aligns with common practices like hold-out validation. I think this is a useful model of the (training) data-generating distribution.",

    "title": "Amazon Prime Video scraps AI-powered TV show recap after 'Fallout' fallout",
    "description": "Almost a month after Prime Video launched AI-powered Video Recaps, viewers said it shared incorrect plot details about season one of \"Fallout.\"",
    "fullText": "Given the length of time it can take for the new season of your favorite TV show to come out, it's understandable that you might want a little video recap of what's happened so far.\n\nIdeally, that recap is accurate.\n\nFans of Amazon's hit show \"Fallout\" said that wasn't the case in its AI-made synopsis of season one, released ahead of the hit show's new season next week. Fans quickly spotted factual errors, and Amazon Prime Video took down the recap.\n\nOne Redditor said the AI feature told viewers that a flashback featuring the Ghoul (one of the main characters, played by Walton Goggins) took place in the 1950s instead of 2077.\n\nAn X user posted that the recap also mischaracterized the agreement the Ghoul and Lucy MacLean (played by Ella Purnell) made in the \"Fallout\" finale.\n\nInstead of saying the pair is teaming up to find Lucy's father, the recap said the Ghoul gave Lucy an ultimatum: \"die or join him.\"\n\nAmazon first launched its Video Recap, a feature that allows users to catch up on Prime Original TV shows between seasons, for beta testing in November.\n\n\"Video Recaps use AI to identify a show's most important plot points, combining them with synchronized voice narration, dialogue snippets, and music to create a visual summary that prepares viewers for the new season,\" the company said in a press release at the time.\n\nThe TV shows that Amazon said were undergoing Video Recaps testing — \"Jack Ryan,\" \"Upload,\" \"Bosch,\" and \"The Rig\" — did not include the feature at the time of writing.\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLike so many companies, Amazon is investing heavily in AI.\n\nDuring the company's February earnings call, Chief Finance Officer Brian Olsavsky said that 2025 capital expenditures could reach over $100 billion, with the majority of it going toward AI and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing platform.\n\nMany of Amazon's consumer services have integrated AI to enhance user engagement and experience, such as product suggestions and helping shoppers on its online platform find clothes that fit. In February, Amazon unveiled Alexa+, the next generation of Alexa, which is powered by generative AI to make it more conversational and personalized for users.\n\nEmbracing AI at Amazon, though, hasn't been without growing pains. In October, the company cited AI as it announced it would lay off 14,000 staff members.\n\n\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post at the time.\n\nIn an internal message to the remaining staff, Amazon Vice President of Device Software and Services Tapas Roy asked them to \"lean in on AI.\"\n\n\"Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products,\" Roy wrote. \"In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes.\"",

    "title": "Disney employees detail its internal AI strategy, from 'DisneyGPT' to a new 'Jarvis' tool in the works",
    "description": "Disney staffers spoke about the company's OpenAI deal and AI strategy, including AI tools they are using and one in development codenamed \"Jarvis.\"",
    "fullText": "Disney's billion-dollar OpenAI deal isn't the only way the company is embracing AI. In recent months, the Mouse House has been quietly adding new AI tools to its arsenal and encouraging staff to use them.\n\n\"They clearly see where things are headed,\" a longtime software engineer at Disney said. This marked a shift from this summer, when Disney had seemed \"hesitant to rely on AI tools,\" they said.\n\nDisney has given its employees access to several AI tools, including Microsoft Copilot and Amazon's Q Developer. Thanks to Disney's OpenAI deal, employees will also soon have access to the enterprise version of ChatGPT, the company said.\n\nThen there's a \"DisneyGPT\" chatbot that four staffers said helps with internal requests, such as creating IT support tickets, viewing the company roster, or analyzing a project's financials.\n\nIn an email sent to staff on October 2, Disney introduced the beta version of the chatbot, describing it as a \"new partner in productivity\" designed to help \"unlock the magic of your imagination.\" A December update enabled employees to upload Excel and PowerPoint files to the bot.\n\nDisneyGPT draws on signature Disney themes, with a prompt asking users if they're \"ready for an enchanting adventure\" and \"a verified collection of Walt Disney quotes\" that are \"tagged by themes like imagination, perseverance, and leadership,\" according to the chatbot's December update log. Otherwise, employees said DisneyGPT is mostly a standard AI chatbot.\n\nThere's also an AI chatbot in the works codenamed \"Jarvis,\" four employees said. Jarvis, named for the personal assistant \"J.A.R.V.I.S.\" from \"Iron Man,\" would be an agentic AI tool — more advanced than DisneyGPT — that completes tasks on an employee's behalf, a high-level staffer with direct knowledge of the company's AI efforts said. This person said Jarvis is in its early stages and is \"not fully baked.\"\n\n\"It's definitely something they want to push for everyone to lean into more,\" a Disney manager said of AI.\n\nCompanies in every industry are racing to adopt AI tools to boost productivity. Disney is going further than many, however. The OpenAI deal makes Disney the first major entertainment company to invest in the AI juggernaut, and allows its beloved characters to be used in the video generator Sora.\n\nThis reflects Disney's long tradition of merging innovation and entertainment, dating back to its founder, Walt.\n\nThree of the eight Disney employees who spoke with Business Insider expressed concerns about using AI, specifically that it could replace humans and threaten job security.\n\nThe high-level employee with direct knowledge of Disney's AI strategy said that while AI is a \"top priority,\" it isn't a cure-all. It can make mistakes and lacks a \"personalized touch\" that people provide, they said.\n\n\"If you use AI everywhere, it's going to be counterproductive,\" this person said, adding that tasks still need human creativity.\n\nDisney spokespeople didn't respond to several requests for comment on its internal AI efforts.\n\nOn an internal Disney website explaining its AI policy and tools, the company said it employs a \"responsible and human-centric approach to using AI.\"\n\n\"That means humans are, and will remain, the creative engine of the company,\" Disney said on the site. \"We believe, fundamentally, that human creativity and curiosity are immense and unique — and are at the heart of Disney.\"\n\n\"Simultaneously, our consistent embrace of new technologies has been a key part of empowering our creators and maintaining our leadership in creativity and innovation,\" the company continued in its \"Responsible AI Use\" section.\n\nSeven of the eight Disney staffers Business Insider interviewed have tried or regularly use DisneyGPT or Copilot, which is integrated into employees' email accounts and documents. Many use those AI tools for simple, routine tasks, like writing emails.\n\nDisney has a portal on its website that outlines its AI policy and lists Disney-approved AI tools. Two employees said the company has pointed staffers to AI education or compliance training courses.\n\nSome unsanctioned AI tools like Anthropic's Claude can be more effective than Disney-approved AI tools, three staffers said.\n\nOne employee at Disney-owned ESPN said their manager told them they could use personal accounts on non-approved AI chatbots for work.\n\n\"I'm just using a personal account because Disney isn't allowing us to use these tools yet,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nThe staffer with direct knowledge of Disney's AI efforts said leadership had tried to make communications about AI \"clear across the board,\" but acknowledged that workers might not \"understand the implications\" of data security risks that could arise from using unsanctioned AI tools. Some staffers told Business Insider it was hard for them to keep up with the availability and restrictions on various AI tools.\n\nWhile some Disney employees expressed mixed feelings about AI, the more bullish among them said Disney was wise to strike a deal with OpenAI.\n\n\"This type of a partnership at least establishes the precedent for getting paid,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nA Disney ads employee said they believed Disney's deal with OpenAI would \"pay off\" and \"be massive\" in five to 10 years, even if there are growing pains.\n\n\"Disney is smart to push into this,\" this staffer said. \"They are setting the rules of the game, or at least trying.\"",

    "description": "Here's what this means for law firms and other businesses that are betting on AI.",
    "fullText": "We just got a sobering picture of how often AI models get their facts straight. This week, Google DeepMind introduced the FACTS Benchmark Suite, which measures how reliably AI models produce factually accurate answers.\n\nIt tests models in four areas: answering factoid questions from internal knowledge, using web search effectively, grounding responses in long documents, and interpreting images. The best model, Google's Gemini 3 Pro, reached 69% accuracy, with other leading models falling well below that.\n\nFor context, if any of the reporters I manage filed stories that were 69% accurate, I would fire them.\n\nBeyond journalism, this number should matter to businesses betting on AI. While models excel at speed and fluency, their factual reliability still lags far behind human expectations, especially in tasks involving niche knowledge, complex reasoning, or precise grounding in source material.\n\nEven small factual errors can have outsized consequences in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and the law. This week, my talented colleague Melia Russell looked at how law firms are handling the rise of AI models as a source of legal truth. It's messy: She recounts how one firm fired an employee because they filed a document riddled with fake cases after using ChatGPT to draft it.\n\nThe FACTS benchmark is a warning but also a roadmap: by quantifying where and how models fail, Google hopes to accelerate progress. But for now, the takeaway is clear: AI is getting better, but it's still wrong about one-third of the time.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "The Barr family purchased a new couch recently, and we've been trying to sell the old one. My wife posted in a local email group and a potential buyer got in touch with a question.\n\n\"Do you happen to know the model? I would love to look it up online rather than asking you lots of questions. :) Thanks!\" she wrote.\n\nThis is an old couch, so all product codes dissolved in the sands of time years ago. So, I took two photos of the furniture, uploaded them to Gemini, and asked for help. The Google chatbot sent back its best guess in seconds:\n\n\"Tillary Sectional: This is a very popular, modular West Elm sofa that was available around that time.\n\nAppearance Match: The low back and deep seat are very characteristic of the Tillary. The Tillary is known for having interchangeable backrests that can be moved or removed, and your sofa's armless chaise and backrests look like they might be loose cushions or pieces, which is a key Tillary feature.\n\nNote: Search results show the Tillary was being reviewed and discussed around 2014, making it a strong possibility for a 2013 purchase.\"\n\nGemini also shared other useful tips on how to identify the product, such as \"Some West Elm couches have a zippered compartment on the back or bottom where extra components (like legs or connectors) are stored, and a tag may be inside.\"\n\nThat was enough to find a product match and send all the details over to the buyer. We closed the deal, for $200, on Tuesday. That's enough for 10 months of a Gemini Pro subscription.\n\nThis holiday period, the Barr family plans to spend a lot of time slouching on our new, fancy couch. I call it the \"AI bubble couch.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

The move, which aligns with what rivals Google and OpenAI do with their models, would mark the biggest departure to date from the open-source strategy Meta has touted for years.

    "fullText": "Android users are getting more tools to combat the seemingly endless stream of scam texts from bad actors looking to steal your data and your money. Circle to Search and Google Lens can now assess messages for scam red flags, and if possible fraud is detected, you'll get recommendations for what to do (or not do) next. Even if you think you know the telltale signs of a scam—a sense of urgency, a demand for money or personal information, a link to log in or pay—using these tools can confirm your suspicions, especially when you feel pressured to act.\n\nTo activate Circle to Search, long press the home button or navigation bar on your device and circle the text you want to scan. Alternatively, you can take a screenshot, open Lens in the Google app (also available on iOS), and tap the screenshot. The feature works for text messages as well as communication on messaging apps and social media sites. Google says the capability is available \"when our systems have high confidence in the quality of the response.\"\n\nThis is just the latest in the Google's suite of security features meant to protect against fraud. Pixel users have real-time, AI-powered scam detection, which identifies and alerts you to suspicious conversational patterns in Google Messages and Phone by Google. In-call protections for Android prevent you from taking certain actions, such as sideloading new apps and changing accessibility permission, on your device while on the phone with anyone not saved in your contacts.\n\nEarlier this month, Google also expanded its in-call scam detection feature, meant to combat bank impersonation schemes, to U.S. users. If you are on a call with a number that's not in your contacts and try to open a participating financial app, you'll get a notification reminding you not to share information and a one-click option to stop screen-sharing and end the call.",

    "fullText": "It seems like it’s become a tradition that I announce I have joined a new company for the Java Advent of Code. At least this time it’s actually an old friend: I am excited to be back at Red Hat, in the llm-d team! Does that mean I forgot about Java? Of course not. If anything, this is an opportunity to learn more about GPU programming, and since Java is my comfort-zone language, what better occasion than looking into TornadoVM?\n\nRecently, the TornadoVM team released gpullama3, a proof-of-concept demonstrating LLM inference on GPUs using pure Java. Let’s explore this together!\n\nTornadoVM is a plugin for the OpenJDK that enables Java programs to automatically run on heterogeneous hardware (GPUs, FPGAs, and multi-core CPUs) using standard Java code annotated for parallel compute.\n\nTransformer-based language models are computationally expensive but highly-parallelizable. At inference time, generating each token requires matrix multiplications across billions of parameters. GPUs excel at these operations because they can perform thousands of computations in parallel. Thus, TornadoVM is the perfect tool for this kind of workload.\n\nInstalling GPULlama3.java was surprisingly straightforward. Make sure you have your favorite flavor of JDK 21 installed. I use sdkman, so I made sure I had Temurin 21 installed:\n\nThen you’ll want to make sure you have installed cmake, a C/C++ toolchain, Python and pip. Now you can clone the repo:\n\nand follow the instructions on the README; for instance, on macOS/Linux:\n\nYou can verify the installation was successful by running one example:\n\nOf course, make sure you replace tornado-examples-1.1.2-dev-e1d2d12.jar with the right jar name! Your output should look something like this:\n\nThe @Parallel annotation tells TornadoVM this loop can be parallelized. The TaskGraph API manages data movement and execution scheduling. You can compile it with the following (if you followed the installation guide correctly $TORNADO_SDK will point to the right path):\n\nNotice that -g is required for this to work correctly. Now you can run it with:\n\nIt will print the first 10 items in the resulting vector.\n\nThe gpullama3 project demonstrates running a Llama 3 model entirely in Java with GPU acceleration. Assuming you are back at the root of the repo, continue with the setup procedure.\n\nNow let’s download a compatible model using the HuggingFace CLI:\n\nTry it! Even on my poor MacBook Air with 8 GB RAM (provided I don’t have too many applications open) this returns:\n\nDisclaimer: even if you have better CPU/GPUs at your disposal, they are unlikely to affect the quality of the joke.\n\nGPULlama3.java currently supports a few FP16 (16-bit floating point) and 8-bit quantized models:\n\nDepending on the model being selected, a different execution plan will be built. The execution plan corresponds to the model architecture. In our case, we picked the unquantized Llama 3.2 1B FP16. Let’s take a look at the setupTornadoForwardPlan() method in FP16LayerPlanner, used by LLama 3.2:\n\nIn the Activation layer we mostly look up token embeddings and apply an initial normalization step, while the Logit layer is where we convert the model’s internal representation into token predictions. So let’s concentrate a bit more on the Feed-Forward Network layer (FFN), and in particular on the Attention implementation. The LlamaFP16FFNLayers#setupSingleFFNLayer method is a bit cryptic at a first glance; let’st start from its signature:\n\nThe method is building a TaskGraph, essentially describing the data flow of our GPU kernels. Let’s focus on QKV and attention, using Sebastian Raschka1‘s excellent Python Notebook as a reference. The following is the architecture diagram of the Llama 3.2 1B model:\n\nFor obvious reasons of brevity, we aren’t going to explore this in detail, but we do want to take a look at the implementation of the attention heads. In particular, let’s take a look at how we compute the Query, Key, Value matrices (Q,K,V = project(x) in the Python version):\n\nThis is followed by the RoPE rescaling to encode token positions:\n\nNow we are ready to compute attention. The generic version (there is also an NVidia-specific implementation) is:\n\nLet’s drill down into TransformerComputeKernelsLayered::processHeadsParallel to see how that is performed. The following is one of the GPU kernels. It essentially computes:\n\nYou will notice that the method:\n\nAfter the attention mechanism computes relationships between tokens, the result is added to the original input, normalized, and passed through a feed-forward network. This process repeats across multiple layers before finally producing the next-token prediction (the logit layer).\n\nBecause it’s an autoregressive model, this entire process repeats for each token, using the previously generated sequence as input.\n\nIn short, TornadoVM handled GPU compilation and execution transparently, allowing a pure Java program to perform LLM inference!\n\nWe’ve completed our whirlwind tour of Llama3GPU.java and TornadoVM. If your head is still spinning, don’t worry, you’re not alone! It’s a lot to take in, but I hope this post has sparked your interest and inspired you to dig deeper: I know I will!\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

I hope the thinking here will be useful to you, or at least validates\nsome of what you’re experiencing in your rollout. The further you read, the more specific this will get,\nending with cheap-turpentine-esque topics like getting agents to reliably translate human-readable text representations of Slack entities into mrkdwn formatting of the correct underlying entity.\n\nI am hiring:\nIf you’re interested in working together with me on internal agent and AI adoption at Imprint,\nwe are hiring our founding Senior Software Engineer, AI.\nThe ideal candidate is a product engineer who’s spent some time experimenting with agents,\nand wants to spend the next year or two digging into this space.\n\nAs technologists, I think one of the basics we owe our teams is spending time\nworking directly with new tools to develop an intuition for how they do, and don’t work.\nAI adoption is no different.\n\nTowards that end, I started with a bit of reading, especially Chip Huyen’s AI Engineering,\nand then dove in a handful of bounded projects: building my rudimentary own agent platform\nusing Claude code for implementation,\ncreating a trivial MCP for searching my blog posts,\nand an agent to comment on Notion documents.\n\nEach of these projects was two to ten hours, and extremely clarifying.\nTool use is, in particular, something that seemed like magic until I\nimplemented a simple tool-using agent, at which point it become something extremely non-magical\nthat I could reason about and understand.\n\nImprint’s general approach to refining AI adoption is strategy testing:\nidentify a few goals, pick an initial approach, and then iterate rapidly in the details until the approach genuinely works.\nIn an era of crushing optics, senior leaders immersing themselves in the details is one of our few defenses.\n\nShortly after joining, I partnered with the executive team to draft the above strategy for AI adoption.\nAfter a modest amount of debate, the pillars we landed on were:\n\nAs you see from those principles, and my earlier comment, my biggest fear for AI adoption is\nthat they can focus on creating the impression of adopting AI, rather than focusing on creating additional productivity.\nOptics are a core part of any work, but almost all interesting work occurs where optics and reality\nintersect, which these pillars aimed to support.\n\nAs an aside, in terms of the components of strategy in\nCrafting Engineering Strategy, this is really just\nthe strategy’s policy.\nIn addition, we used strategy testing to refine our approach,\ndefined a concrete set of initial actions to operationalize it (they’re a bit too specific to share externally),\nand did some brief exploration to make sure I wasn’t overfitting on\nmy prior work at Carta.\n\nMy first step towards adoption was collecting as many internal examples of tips and tricks as possible into\na single Notion database. I took a very broad view on what qualified, with the belief that showing\nmany different examples of using tools–especially across different functions–is both useful and inspiring.\n\nI’ve continued extending this, with contributions from across the company, and it’s become a useful resource\nfor both humans and bots alike to provide suggestions on approaching problems with AI tooling.\n\nOne of my core beliefs in our approach is that making prompts discoverable\nwithin the company is extremely valuable.\nDiscoverability solves four distinct problems:\n\nMy core approach is that every agent’s prompt is stored in a single Notion database\nwhich is readable by everyone in the company. Most prompts are editable by everyone,\nbut some have editing restrictions.\n\nHere’s an example of a prompt we use for routing incoming Jira issues from Customer Support\nto the correct engineering team.\n\nHere’s a second example, this time of responding to requests in our Infrastructure Engineering\nteam’s request channel.\n\nPretty much all prompts end with an instruction to include a link to the prompt\nin the generated message. This ensures it’s easy to go from a mediocre response\nto the prompt-driving the response, so that you can fix it.\n\nIn addition to collecting tips and prompts, the next obvious step for AI adoption\nis identifying a standard AI platform to be used within the company, e.g. ChatGPT,\nClaude, Gemini or what not.\n\nWe’ve gone with OpenAI for everyone.\nIn addition to standardizing on a platform, we made sure account provisioning was\nautomatic and in place on day one.\nTo the surprise of no one who’s worked in or adjacent to IT,\na lot of revolutionary general AI adoption is… really just account provisioning and access controls.\nThese are the little details that can so easily derail the broader plan if you don’t dive into them.\n\nWithin Engineering, we also provide both Cursor and Claude.\nThat said, the vast majority of our Claude usage is done via AWS Bedrock,\nwhich we use to power Claude Code… and we use Claude Code quite a bit.\n\nWhile there’s a general industry push towards adopting more AI tooling,\nI find that a significant majority of “AI tools” are just SaaS vendors that\ntalk about AI in their marketing pitches. We have continued to adopt vendors,\nbut have worked internally to help teams evaluate which “AI tools” are meaningful.\n\nWe’ve spent a fair amount of time going deep on integrating with AI tooling for chat and IVR\ntooling, but that’s a different post entirely.\n\nMeasuring AI adoption is, like all measurement topics, fraught.\nAltogether, I’ve found measuring tool adoption very useful for identifying the right\nquestions to ask. Why haven’t you used Cursor? Or Claude Code? Or whatever? These are fascinating\nquestions to dig into. I try to look at usage data at least once a month, with a particular focus\non two questions:\n\nAt the core, I believe folks who aren’t adopting tools are rational non-adopters,\nand spending some time understanding the (appearance of) resistance goes further than\ntop-down mandate. I think it’s often an education gap that is bridged easily enough.\nConceivably, at some point I’ll discover a point of diminishing returns, where the lack\nof progress is stymied on folks who are rejecting AI tooling–or because the AI tooling\nisn’t genuinely useful–but I haven’t found that point yet.\n\nThe next few sections are about building internal agents.\nThe core implementation is a single stateless lambda which handles a wide variety of HTTP requests,\nsimilar-ish to Zapier.\nThis is currently implemented in Python, and is roughly 3,000 lines of code,\nmuch of it dedicated to oddities like formatting Slack messages, etc.\n\nFor the record, I did originally attempt to do this within Zapier,\nbut I found that Zapier simply doesn’t facilitate the precision I believe is necessary to do this effectively.\nI also think that Zapier isn’t particularly approachable for a non-engineering audience.\n\nAs someone who spent a long time working in platform engineering,\nI still want to believe that you can build a platform, and users will come.\nIndeed, I think it’s true that a small number of early adopters will come,\nif the problem is sufficiently painful for them,\nas was the case for Uber’s service migration (2014).\n\nHowever, what we’ve found effective for driving adoption is basically the opposite of that.\nWhat’s really worked is the intersection of platform engineering and old-fashioned product engineering:\n\nSome examples of the projects where we’ve gotten traction internally:\n\nFor all of these projects that have worked, the formula has been\nthe opposite of “build a platform and they will come.” Instead it’s\nrequired deep partnership from folks with experience building AI agents and\nusing AI tooling to make progress. The learning curve for effective AI adoption\nin important or production-like workflows remains meaningfully high.\n\nAgents that use powerful tools represent a complex configuration problem.\nFirst, exposing too many tools–especially tools that the prompt author doesn’t effectively understand–makes\nit very difficult to create reliable workflows. For example, we have an exit_early command that allows terminating\nthe agent early: this is very effective in many cases, but is also easy to break your bot.\nSimilarly, we have a slack_chat command that allows posting across channels, which can support a variety of useful\nworkflows (e.g. warm-handoffs of a question in one channel into a more appropriate alternative),\nbut can also spam folks.\nSecond, as tools get more powerful, they can introduce complex security scenarios.\n\nTo address both of these, we currently store configuration in a code-reviewed Git repository.\nHere’s an example of a JIRA project.\n\nHere’s another for specifying a Slack responder bot.\n\nCompared to a JSON file, we can statically type the configuration, and it’s easy to extend over time.\nFor example, we might want to extend slack_chat to restrict which channels a given bot is allowed to\npublish into, which would be easy enough.\nFor most agents today, the one thing not under Git-version control is the prompts themselves, which are versioned by Notion.\nHowever, we can easily require specific agents to use prompts within the Git-managed repository for sensitive scenarios.\n\nAfter passing tests, linting and typechecking, the configurations are automatically deployed.\n\nIt’s sort of funny to mention, but one thing that has in practice really interfered with\neasily writing effective prompts is making it easy to write things like @Will Larson which\nis then translated into <@U12345> or whatever the appropriate Slack identifier is for a given\nuser, channel, or user group. The same problem exists for Jira groups, Notion pages and databases,\nand so on.\n\nThis is a good example of where centralizing prompts is useful. I got comfortable pulling the unique\nidentifiers myself, but it became evident that most others were not.\nThis eventually ended with three tools for Slack resolution: slack_lookup which takes a list\nof references to lookup, slack_lookup_prefix which finds all Slack entities that start with\na given prefix (useful to pull all channels or groups starting with @oncall-, for example, rather than having to hard-code the list in your prompt), and slack_search_name which uses string-distance to find potential matches (again, useful for dealing with typos).\n\nIf this sounds bewildering, it’s largely the result of Slack not exposing relevant APIs for this sort of lookup.\nSlack’s APIs want to use IDs to retrieve users, groups and channels, so you have to maintain your own cache of\nthese items to perform a lookup. Performing the lookups, especially for users, is itself messy. Slack users have\na minimum of three ways they might be referenced: user.profile.display_name, user.name, and user.real_name,\nonly a subset of which are set for any given user.\nThe correct logic here is, as best I can tell, to find a match against user.profile.display_name, then use that if it exists.\nThen do the same for user.name and finally user.real_name. If you take the first user that matches one of those three,\nyou’ll use the wrong user in some scenarios.\n\nIn addition to providing tools to LLMs for resolving names, I also have a final mandatory check for each response\nto ensure the returned references refer to real items. If not, I inject which ones are invalid into the context window and perform an additional agent loop with only entity-resolution tools available.\nThis feels absurd, but it was only at this point that things really started working consistently.\n\nAs an aside, I was embarassed by these screenshots, and earlier today I made the same changes for Notion pages and databases\nas I had previously for Slack.\n\nSimilarly to foreign entity resolution,\nthere’s a similar problem with Slack’s mrkdwn variant of Markdown\nand JIRA’s Atlassian Document Format:\nthey’re both strict.\n\nThe tools that call into those APIs now have strict instructions on formatting. These had been contained in individual\nprompts, but they started showing up in every prompt, so I knew I needed to bring them into the agent framework itself\nrather than forcing every prompt-author to understand the problem.\n\nMy guess is that I need to add a validation step similar to the one I added for entity-resolution,\nand that until I do so, I’ll continue to have a small number of very infrequent but annoying rendering issues,\nTo be honest, I personally don’t mind the rendering issues, but that creates a lot of uncertainty for others using agents, so I think solving them is a requirement.\n\nToday, all logs, especially tool usage, are fed into two places. First, it goes into Datadog for full logging visibility.\nSecond, and perhaps more usefully for non-engineers, they feed into a Slack channel, #ai-logs which create visibility\ninto which tools are used and with which (potentially truncated) parameters.\n\nLonger term, I imagine this will be exposed via a dedicated internal web UX, but generally speaking I’ve found that\nthe subset of folks who are actively developing agents are pretty willing to deal with a bit of cruft.\nSimilarly the folks who aren’t developing agents directly don’t really care, they want it to work perfectly every time,\nand aren’t spending time looking at logs.\n\nThe biggest internal opportunity that I see today is figuring out how to\nget non-engineers an experience equivalent to running Claude Code locally with\nall their favorite MCP servers plugged in.\nI’ve wanted ChatGPT or Claude.ai to provide this, but they don’t really quite get there,\nClaude Desktop is close, but is somewhat messy to configure as we think about finding a tool\nthat we can easily allow everyone internally to customize and use on a daily basis.\n\nI’m still looking for what the right tool is here. If anyone has any great suggestions\nthat we can be somewhat confident will still exist in two years, and don’t require sending\na bunch of internal data to a very early stage company, then I’m curious to hear!\n\nYou’re supposed to start a good conclusion with some sort of punchy anecdote that\nilluminates your overall thesis in a new way. I’m not sure if I can quite meet that bar,\nbut the four most important ideas for me are:\n\nI’m curious what other folks are finding!",

    "description": "The companies building AI are spending billions to acquire engineers, not replace them. Here’s why your job is safer than you think.",
    "fullText": "In May, OpenAI agreed to pay $3 billion for Windsurf, the AI coding assistant formerly known as Codeium. Three billion dollars. For a VSCode fork.\n\nThe deal eventually fell apart, but what matters is that they wanted to do it in the first place.\n\nLast week, Anthropic made an interesting acquisition: they bought Bun, the JavaScript runtime. Bun is open source and MIT-licensed. Anthropic could have forked it and built on top of it for free. They have Claude Code, an excellent code-writing tool.\n\nInstead, they bought the company. Because they wanted Jarred Sumner and his team.\n\nThis is what I keep coming back to when I see another “Programming is dead” post go viral. The companies building AI, the ones who supposedly know exactly what it can and can’t do, are spending billions to acquire engineering talent. Not fire them, acquire them.\n\nIf OpenAI believed GPT could replace software engineers, why wouldn’t they build their own VS Code fork for a fraction of that cost? If Anthropic thought Claude could do the work, why make an acquisition at all?\n\nHere’s my take: AI can replace most of programming, but programming isn’t the job.\n\nProgramming is a task. It’s one of many things you do as part of your work. But if you’re a software engineer, your actual job is more than typing code into an editor.\n\nThe mistake people make is conflating the task with the role. It’s like saying calculators replaced accountants. Calculators automated arithmetic, but arithmetic was never the job. The job was understanding financials, advising clients, making judgment calls, etc. The calculator just made accountants faster at the mechanical part.\n\nAI is doing something similar for us.\n\nThink about what you actually do in a given week.\n\nYou sit in a meeting where someone describes a vague problem, and you’re the one who figures out what they actually need. You look at a codebase and decide which parts to change and which to leave alone. You push back on a feature request because you know it’ll create technical debt that’ll haunt the team for years. You review a colleague’s PR and catch a subtle bug that would’ve broken production. You make a call on whether to ship now or wait for more testing.\n\nNone of that is programming, but it’s all your job.\n\nI’m not going to pretend nothing is changing.\n\nWill some companies use AI as an excuse to cut headcount? Absolutely. Some already have. There will be layoffs blamed on “AI efficiency gains” that are really just cost-cutting dressed up as something else.\n\nBut think about who stays and who goes in that scenario. It’s not random. The engineers who understand that programming isn’t the job, the ones who bring judgment, context, and the ability to figure out what to build, those are the ones who stay. The ones who only brought code output might be at risk\n\nA common worry is that juniors will get left behind. If AI handles the “doing” part, how do they build judgment? I actually think the opposite is true. AI compresses the feedback loop. What used to take days of flipping through books or waiting for Stack Overflow answers now takes seconds. The best juniors aren’t skipping steps, but getting through them faster.\n\nNow think about your own situation. Say you were hired two years ago, before the current AI wave. Your company wanted you. They saw value in what you bring. Now, with AI tools, you’re significantly more productive. You ship faster. You handle more complexity. You’re better at your job than ever before.\n\n“You got way more productive, so we’re letting you go” is not a sentence that makes a lot of sense.\n\nIf you’re reading this, you’re already thinking about this stuff. That puts you ahead. Here’s how to stay there:\n\nThe shape of the work is changing: some tasks that used to take hours now take minutes, some skills matter less, others more.\n\nBut different isn’t dead. The engineers who will thrive understand that their value was never in the typing, but in the thinking, in knowing which problems to solve, in making the right trade-offs, in shipping software that actually helps people.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic could build their own tools. They have the best AI in the world. Instead, they’re spending billions on engineers. That should tell you something.",

    "description": "Broadcom and UiPath both have huge opportunities in front of them.",
    "fullText": "Broadcom has a massive opportunity ahead with custom AI chips.\n\nUiPath has huge potential upside as its revenue starts to accelerate.\n\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nAs 2025 begins to wind down, it will go down as another strong year for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Meanwhile, with AI still appearing to be in its early innings, the group could help lead the market higher in 2026 once again.\n\nLet's look at two AI stocks that could help you make a fortune in 2026.\n\nOne AI stock that looks like it could outperform in 2026 is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), as it has some of the best growth prospects of any AI infrastructure company.\n\nThe company is already seeing strong growth coming from its data center networking portfolio, which helps transfer data and distribute AI workloads across servers to help optimize performance. Products like its Tomahawk Ethernet switch and Jericho4 Ethernet fabric router are popular and helping power its networking growth.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) business is what should get investors excited the most. ASICs are custom chips that are pre-programmed to handle specific tasks, and because they are purpose-built, they tend to deliver improved performance with greater energy efficiency than general-purpose chips, such as graphics processing units (GPUs). Broadcom made a name for itself in this business when it helped Alphabet design its well-regarded tensor processing units (TPUs) that are helping Alphabet power much of its internal AI workloads, as well as those for external cloud computing customers.\n\nThat success has led to other hyperscalers (owners of large data centers) partnering with Broadcom to design their own custom chips. The company has called out its three custom AI chip customers furthest along as being an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal 2027, and then announced that a fourth customer has placed a $10 billion order for next year. It also recently struck a deal with OpenAI to supply it with 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips, in a deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nWith these deals in place, Broadcom could see explosive growth in the coming years, which could propel its stock much higher in 2026 and beyond.\n\nAnother company whose stock could help you make a fortune next year is UiPath (NYSE: PATH). The company is in the midst of a transformation that could see it become one of the most important players in agentic AI.\n\nUiPath is a stalwart in the field of robotic process automation (RPA), which uses software bots to perform simple, rules-based tasks. However, it's using this background in managing software bots to become an orchestration platform that can manage both software bots and AI agents.",

    "description": "Jensen Huang biography author Stephen Witt explains why Google's self-developed AI model, Gemini, could pose a threat to Nvidia's AI dominance",
    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) AI turf could take a blow if Google (GOOGL, GOOG) keeps firing on all cylinders.\n\n\"The biggest risk right now obviously is Google,\" said Stephen Witt, author of \"The Thinking Machine,\" a Jensen Huang biography.\n\nThat risk, he told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid, is largely tied to Google's Gemini model. Witt described it as the \"best AI right now in the benchmarks outside the Nvidia stack.\"\n\nWitt explained that Gemini was trained entirely on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). If Google proves it can sustain world-leading AI development using only its homegrown chip stack, it sets a potent precedent for other tech giants to follow suit.\n\n\"That's a huge risk,\" Witt said. \"If Google ends up winning this AI race ... Nvidia will be in trouble.\"\n\nThis risk, coupled with competition from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), is why \"it's very easy to imagine a world\" where Nvidia's high-flying stock declines. The AI chipmaker's shares are up over 1,270% in the past five years.\n\nTo mitigate the core risk of rivals like Google winning the chip war, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is already looking past generative AI. Witt said a significant amount of the CEO's personal effort is being poured into the next great computing wave: robotics.\n\nIf Huang can dominate the robotics wave, he said, \"that will mean several trillion dollars in market capitalization for this company.\"\n\nHowever, Nvidia has another issue: the lack of any clear succession plan.\n\n\"It's just Jensen at the top,\" Witt said. \"There's no second in command. There's no obvious successor.\" He noted that the board has been silent, and Huang has offered no advice on a succession strategy.\n\nThat suggests Nvidia's $4 trillion valuation — which accounts for over 8% of the entire S&P 500 (^GSPC) — is, in many ways, resting solely on Huang's vision.\n\nWitt described Huang as a \"world-class engineer\" who could \"design these microchips himself,\" a skill that whoever takes the helm must also possess. He noted that neither of Huang's two children, who work at the company, has a technical background, making them noncontenders for the top spot.\n\nWitt also provided a look behind the polished stage persona of Huang, known for his trademark leather jacket. Beneath the showmanship is a highly intense, \"almost totally neurotic\" leader who is driven not by optimism, but by fear.\n\n\"He's driven by negative emotions, things like fear of failure, guilt, even shame are what make Jensen get up in the morning and work so hard to make Nvidia succeed,\" Witt explained.",

Producer Andrew Willis noted how important it is for workers to fight back against the injustices facing the games industry at the moment.\n\"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it's incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives,\" Willis said.",

    "fullText": "Broadcom is the latest victim of investors punishing high-flying AI companies.\n\nThe chipmaker tumbled 8% as investors took in its stellar results for the last quarter, but were left disappointed by certain aspects of the company's outlook.\n\nThe firm beat on earnings and revenue, leading shares to initially rise after-hours on Thursday, before falling into the red as CEO Hock Tan dug into the results in the call with analysts.\n\n\"It was surprising to see a call that started with such good numbers and such a great story end with frustration,\" Josh Meyers, an executive director at JPMorgan, wrote in a client note on Friday.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. ET opening bell on Friday:\n\nOther chip stocks also lost slightly, extending a decline in the sector that kicked off after Oracle reported earnings earlier in the week. Here were some of the notable moves:\n\nBroadcom investors seemed disappointed in how the company didn't issue full AI revenue guidance for the coming year, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan wrote on Friday. Broadcom said it expected AI semiconductor revenue to double to $8.2 billion in the following quarter.\n\nInvestors also seemed \"underwhelmed\" by the firm's $73 billion backlog of AI product orders over the next 18 months, Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said in a note.\n\n\"Somehow some investors seized on this as 'not enough,' which compounded an earlier narrative today that somehow we needed more visibility on F27 AI revenue (no idea why this is suddenly an issue),\" JPMorgan's Meyers wrote.\n\nSome investors also feel that the Tan was more \"buttoned-up\" about the company's results than they would have liked, Meyers said, citing his conversations with shareholders.\n\nThe stock is a crowded trade in the already popular AI theme, and some may also think the market \"just needed to take a breath\" from the AI trade, Meyers said. Shares of Broadcom are still up more than 56% this year.\n\nInvestors have put more pressure on the semiconductor sector in recent months amid concerns about the sustainability of the AI trade, which has led to some firms getting punished despite beating on earnings and revenue.\n\nOracle shares plunged 14% on Thursday as investors took in lower-than-expected quarterly revenue and worries that the software giant is overspending on AI.\n\nMeta and Microsoft shares also dropped after the companies reported earnings in October, as both tech titans promised to spend more on AI in the coming years.",

    "description": "AI is reshaping the CHRO role, requiring HR leaders to become AI strategists and bridge people, technology, and data in today's workforce.",
    "fullText": "AI is changing how companies hire, train, and lead, and in the process, the chief human resources officer's role is expanding.\n\nToday's top HR leaders are becoming AI strategists, helping their organizations navigate the next wave of workplace transformation.\n\n\"The old model of HR was employees over here, technology over there,\" says Thomas Hutzschenreuter, a university professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). \"But the new model of work is human-AI collaboration.\"\n\nAI is a coworker now, he says, and that means that \"HR has a bigger mandate. They need to understand not just people and culture, but go deeper into the strategy, the business, and the technology itself.\"\n\nTo understand how companies are navigating the shift, Business Insider spoke with people leaders at Citizens Bank, one of the largest banks in the Northeast; Boston Consulting Group, a global consultancy; and UiPath, an automation software testing company.\n\nAll interviews have been edited for brevity.\n\nCHROs are becoming the architects of the future of work, bridging people, technology, and data.\n\nThere are many questions we are in the middle of that are germane to how we as an organization move forward, such as: What's going to happen to entry-level roles? What roles are emerging? And how do we reskill people in a way that prepares them to make shifts thoughtfully?\n\nWe need people who can quickly learn, adapt, and change. Our technologists need to develop their business acumen, and our business folks need to develop their digital and technical fluency. The lines are blurring.\n\nMy HR team is developing a baseline of skills and capabilities. We're having conversations with consulting partners and clients. There's an openness to communal learning because everyone is trying to figure out the same things: what the AI-driven workforce will look like, how to break work into tasks for AI vs. humans, and what AI agents can handle versus humans.\n\nWe're subject to a lot of regulatory oversight in our industry. It's great that people can develop their own AI agents — there's a push to decentralize these capabilities — but we need to be mindful of risk and governance and how we do this in a safe, ethical way.\n\nAI is changing how work gets done and what work gets done. Business models are evolving, and the way companies serve clients is shifting. The CHRO role now requires adapting to both at once. It's a tall order.\n\nIn consulting, our ability to add value means constantly evolving our approach to human capital. The issues are constant; the pace is what's different. Today, a quarter of our business involves AI, which wasn't true even two years ago.\n\nWe need our people to be AI fluent. About 90% of our workforce uses AI regularly, and more than half use it daily. To get there, we've built a multi-layered support system: a 1,400-person enablement network acting as evangelists and coaches.\n\nWe've upskilled more than 100 team coaches to provide hands-on support. We deploy experts directly into teams to help them reimagine workflows and run innovation competitions to keep momentum going.\n\nOur HR team has taken the lead. We started with recruiting — consolidating six IT systems into one and integrating AI throughout the platform and across performance management and development.\n\nWe're also experimenting with voice tools, chat interfaces, and AI avatars for real-time coaching. These tools give employees confidence, learning opportunities, and instant feedback. They don't replace managers — they free them up for higher-level thinking and relationship-building.\n\nOur business is automation, so that muscle is very strong for my team. But the next frontier of agentic AI is an adjustment.\n\nWe're using these AI agents — but we're also creating them. One agent, almost in production, helps with performance reviews, which is a time-consuming and sometimes dreaded task. Our agent helps employees write their self-assessment and collects feedback, bringing it together much quicker. It also helps managers by consolidating feedback from multiple resources.\n\nIt won't make rating decisions on the manager's behalf, but it makes the year-end much more seamless. Instead of spending time on admin, managers can focus on the feedback itself and my team on the right framework for career development.\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns at the moment, and fear is natural. But it should fuel curiosity and development. This is the time to think about career development seriously.\n\nWe have this idea that AI is only affecting entry-level or lower-level jobs. The truth is that technology is replacing skills that very highly skilled people have been doing.\n\nIf you look at the medical field and aviation — areas where we always thought technology wouldn't touch — that's no longer the case. It's not going to happen overnight. We have time to prepare. But it's relevant for everybody in any profession.",

    "fullText": "For much of the past year, Wall Street and Silicon Valley have wrestled with the same uncomfortable question: Will companies really spend money on AI, or is the hype just outpacing budgets?\n\nA new CIO survey from RBC Capital suggests that question may finally have an answer, and it's a resounding yes.\n\nRBC recently polled 117 IT professionals at companies with annual revenue ranging from below $250 million to more than $25 billion. 90% of the respondents said their organizations plan to spend more on AI in 2026.\n\n\"Overall, we came away increasingly optimistic of macro/budget stabilization taking shape in 2026 and encouraged by the pace of early GenAI adoption,\" the RBC analysts wrote in a research note summarizing the findings.\n\nCIOs are not only moving rapidly into production with AI systems, but they are also setting aside dedicated budgets to fund that adoption.\n\nA striking 90% of technology leaders said their organizations are creating new budgets specifically for generative AI and LLM projects, up from 85% the year before. That suggests AI is becoming additive rather than substitutive in enterprise tech spending.\n\nEven more telling: 60% of respondents said they are already in production with AI initiatives, a jump from 39% the previous year. Another 32% expect to be in production within six months.\n\nThis shift comes after months of skepticism from investors who questioned whether businesses would convert pilot projects into real spending. The survey data suggests that moment is now arriving.\n\nCIOs overwhelmingly cited AI as the top category for increased software spending next year, surpassing cybersecurity and IT service management. And in open-ended responses, executives repeatedly named AI as their biggest area of investment for 2026, often paired with infrastructure upgrades and automation initiatives, according to the RBC survey.\n\nUse cases are expanding beyond experimentation. Seventy-six percent of CIOs said their AI strategies now target both cost savings and revenue generation, a shift that reinforces AI's transition from a novelty to a competitive mandate.\n\nConcerns remain — data privacy tops the list — but those worries are no longer slowing adoption. Instead, AI is becoming the primary force expanding IT budgets heading into 2026.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "You can now wear ChatGPT on your sleeve — or head or shin.\n\nAs part of its 10-year anniversary celebration, OpenAI dropped a link on its X feed to a merchandise store. The \"OpenAI Supply Co.\" seems suited for the company's engineers, with a space to log in with a company email. Indeed, most of the items listed are archives of old designs — but a few are available for purchase.\n\nThe \"Supply Co.\" site was marked as \"coming soon\" in July 2024, according to the Internet Archive. But this appears to be the first time ChatGPT users who aren't employees can actually buy something from it.\n\nOpenAI fans ate it up. The post garnered over 3,000 likes within 15 hours, and multiple sizes of the for-sale items were quickly sold out. If you're anything other than an extra small or a small, you're out of luck on sweatshirts and tees.\n\nThe items OpenAI listed give a glimpse inside the company — or at least its swag.\n\nThere are five Pokémon-style trading cards. Their subjects include Sora 2 (\"shape-shifter\"), GPT-5 (\"two worlds, one model\"), image generation (with a \"huge\" wow factor), Sora (\"sci-fi\"), and the OpenAI Blossom (\"back and better\").\n\nPokémon has recently been a point of contention for the company, after its Sora video generator began booting out unauthorized versions of Pikachu.\n\nMuch of the site is themed around AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a much debated breakthrough milestone that many AI companies are racing to hit. One shirt reads: \"AGI that benefits all of humanity,\" a line from OpenAI's charter. On the employee log-in, the suggested email is agi@openai.com.\n\nThe assortment of hats also offers clues. There are Sora beanies and baseball caps with the word \"research.\" One cap has the chatbot's phone number, 1-800-CHATGPT. (Yes, the number still works.)\n\nAnother cap has OpenAI in red letters on camo print, resembling the popular Harris/Walz hat, which nods to Chappell Roan.\n\nThe baseball caps kept coming. There's one with silver flames, a piece of early 2000s nostalgia. There's another with the letters \"SF\" on it, firmly planting OpenAI in the city of San Francisco.\n\nAll the way at the bottom of the page is a baseball cap with the words \"Thinking deeply.\" The site says that it was released in September 2024 in honor of OpenAI's reasoning model. It also looks remarkably similar to Anthropic's \"thinking\" caps, which launched a year later at the company's Air Mail pop-up.\n\nAnthropic's \"thinking\" caps quickly became a status symbol, signifying the wearer's closeness to the AI boom. Cursor's tab keys had a similar effect, as did OpenAI's DevDay token plaques.\n\nIt's possible that this merchandise drop will have the same effect. Your ChatGPT crew neck could give you caché.\n\nThe fans have clearly been hungry. Fan-created merchandise concepts have long floated around X. Some even turned their designs into unauthorized businesses.\n\nThirty minutes before its post about the tenth anniversary, OpenAI responded to a fan post. Developer Tibor Blaho posted some of the merch, saying that the company should make its store \"public instead of keeping it employee-only.\" OpenAI responded with the link and an eye emoji.\n\nBlaho's post was 10 months ago.",

The startup previously attempted to steer Sora’s output away from unlicensed copyrighted material, though with little success, which prompted threats of lawsuits by rights holders.\n\nDisney announced that it would invest $1bn in OpenAI and, under a three-year deal perhaps worth even more than that large sum, that it would license about 200 of its iconic characters – from R2-D2 to Stitch – for users to play with in OpenAI’s video generation app.\n\nAt a time of intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of AI on the livelihoods of writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives, Disney stressed its agreement with OpenAI would not cover talent likenesses or voices.\n\nThe announcement was framed as an extraordinary opportunity to empower fans.\n\nThink of the “fan-inspired Sora short form videos”, as Disney called them in a press release – akin to taking an AI-generated version of a photo with Princess Jasmine at Disney World. OpenAI included screenshots of these kinds of videos in its press release, indicating how the two companies expect people to use the app’s new cast. Sora already allows users to generate videos that include their own likenesses.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, said the licensing deal would place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”.\n\nThey may even offer a chance at wide viewership, with some fan-made videos being displayed on the Disney+ streaming service, a move seemingly designed to compete with TikTok’s and YouTube Shorts’ infinite feeds, which themselves often include clips of popular TV shows and movies.",

Over the past year, the chatbot has spewed various antisemitic content, decried “white genocide” and claimed Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nNayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, is now entrusting the chatbot to create curricula in classrooms across the country. Bukele has long embraced technology, making El Salvador the first county in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, and being one of the first Central American presidents to use Twitter, now X, as a platform. He is also known for ruling with an iron fist and working with Trump to incarcerate deportees to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot prison.\n\n“El Salvador doesn’t just wait for the future to happen; we build it,” Bukele said in a statement about the partnership with xAI. “This partnership is destined to deliver something rather extraordinary for all of humanity.”\n\nMusk touted his partnership with Bukele on Thursday. On X, between posts about “white genocide” and blaming asylum seekers for crime, Musk posted comments about Grok being spread throughout El Salvador’s schools.\n\nHe reposted positively to a comment from Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller, in which she wrote: “If we are serious about restoring education to math, science and English – why would we allow left leaning liberal [sic] AI our kids? This unlocks non-woke educational tools for our kids.”\n\nxAI is not the first artificial intelligence company to introduce chatbots to public schools. OpenAI announced a partnership with Estonia in February where it could provide all students and teachers in the country’s secondary school system with a customized ChatGPT. Students in rural Colombia also started using Meta’s AI chatbots in 2023 and within a year, teachers began blaming the tech for low grades and failing exams, according to Rest of World.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "An AI agent hacked Stanford's network for 16 hours and outperformed human pros, all while costing far less than their six-figure pay.",
    "fullText": "For 16 hours, an AI agent crawled Stanford's public and private computer science networks, digging up security flaws across thousands of devices.\n\nA study published Wednesday by Stanford researchers found that their AI agent, ARTERMIS, placed second in an experiment with 10 selected cybersecurity professionals. The researchers said the agent could uncover weaknesses that humans missed and investigate several vulnerabilities at once.\n\nRunning ARTEMIS costs about $18 an hour, far below the average salary of about $125,000 a year for a \"professional penetration tester,\" the study said. A more advanced version of the agent costs $59 an hour and still comes in cheaper than hiring a top human expert.\n\nThe study was led by three Stanford researchers — Justin Lin, Eliot Jones, and Donovan Jasper — whose work focuses on AI agents, cybersecurity, and machine-learning safety. The team created ARTEMIS after finding that existing AI tools struggled with long, complex security tasks.\n\nThe researchers gave ARTEMIS access to the university's network, consisting of about 8,000 devices, including servers, computers, and smart devices. Human testers were asked to put in at least 10 hours of work while ARTEMIS ran 16 hours across two workdays. The comparison with human testers was limited to the AI's first 10 hours.\n\nThe study also tested existing agents, which lagged behind most human participants, while ARTEMIS performed \"comparable to the strongest participants,\" the researchers said.\n\nWithin the 10-hour window, the agent discovered \"nine valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate,\" outperforming nine of 10 human participants, the study said.\n\nSome of the flaws had gone unnoticed by humans, including a weakness on an older server that testers could not access because their browsers refused to load it. ARTEMIS bypassed the issue and broke in using a command-line request.\n\nThe AI worked in a way humans could not, the researchers said. Whenever ARTEMIS spotted something \"noteworthy\" in a scan, it spun up additional \"sub-agents\" to investigate in the background, allowing it to examine multiple targets simultaneously. Human testers had to do this work one step at a time.\n\nBut the AI isn't flawless. ARTEMIS struggled with tasks that required clicking through graphical screens, causing it to overlook a critical vulnerability. It is also more prone to false alarms, mistaking harmless network messages for signs of a successful break-in.\n\n\"Because ARTEMIS parses code-like input and output well, it performs better when graphical user interfaces are unavailable,\" the researchers said.\n\nAdvances in AI have lowered the barrier to hacking and disinformation operations, allowing malicious actors to enhance their attacks.\n\nIn September, a North Korean hacking group used ChatGPT to generate fake military IDs for phishing emails. A report from Anthropic in August found that North Korean operatives used its Claude model to obtain fraudulent remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies — a tactic that gave them insider access to corporate systems.\n\nThe same report also said a Chinese threat actor used Claude to run cyberattacks on Vietnamese telecom, agricultural, and government systems.\n\n\"We are seeing many, many attacks,\" Yuval Fernbach, the chief technology officer of machine learning operations at software supply chain company JFrog, told Business Insider in a report published in April. He added that hackers have been using AI models to extract data, shut systems down, or manipulate a website or tools.",

    "description": "Barak Turovsky said that if a company wants to integrate AI on a software level, it needs someone with a different kind of expertise.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Barak Turovsky, the former Chief AI Officer at General Motors, based in Silicon Valley. He also held executive roles at Google and Cisco. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have worked on AI and LLMs since 2014 — way before they became the hottest thing on Earth.\n\nI'm an ex-Google AI exec who led the first scaled deployment of LLMs and Deep Neural Networks with Google Translate. I also worked as the Chief Product and Technology Officer at a computer vision AI startup, and as the VP of AI at Cisco.\n\nGeneral Motors approached me for the Chief AI Officer role while I was at Cisco, and it felt like a great crash course on using AI to develop physical products. The role no longer exists because I left after GM restructured its software and AI organization; however, until November, I reported to the head of software engineering, who reported to the CEO.\n\nSome people ask, \"Do you really need a dedicated AI officer?\"\n\nLet's ignore the title because you can call it different names, but I do believe successful AI implementation requires someone in leadership to drive that change, as well as commitment from the top.\n\nFunctional business leaders, such as the CTO or CIO, may have little or no understanding of AI. If you want to integrate AI on a software level, you need someone with a different kind of expertise.\n\nTraditional large companies have powerful executives who want to own the benefits of scaling AI, but not necessarily the responsibility. Therefore, someone with deep AI knowledge is needed to direct the traffic.\n\nI like to use a restaurant analogy to break it down.\n\nThe analogy is based on three primary resources that create products, or dishes. The first resource includes the kitchen equipment, or the AI infrastructure and models necessary to build AI solutions.\n\nThe next can be thought of as the ingredients. It's the data or internal assets used to train and run AI solutions. The last one is talent, or the restaurant staff. You need expertise at different levels — busboys, short-order cooks, sous chefs, and master chefs for the really gourmet restaurants.\n\nThe complexity of creating the final product depends on the company's needs, specifically whether the restaurant needs to prepare the food internally. For very advanced, cutting-edge models, which can be thought of as the main course at a gourmet restaurant, companies often need to develop their own AI solutions because standard versions may not perform the required functions.\n\nThink of the CAIO as the master chef. They need to make sure all the different pieces run smoothly. If you are in an industry that requires cutting-edge solutions, you also need to spend a lot of time making sure that the hardest output — a.k.a. the main dish — comes out just right.\n\nThe hardest and most important part of the job is securing top talent. Vendors will tell you that their toaster ovens can pop out a French soufflé in 15 minutes. Yet your ingredients will consistently arrive late, of dubious quality, and in incorrect amounts. Your customers will come in, declare they are hungry and want to eat the whole menu, and then leave mid-meal without paying.\n\nThe specifics of each role vary. At GM, I worked on a cutting-edge area because AI for physical products, like cars, is largely untouched and getting a lot of traction.\n\nThere are three buckets of what a chief AI officer should do. First is AI talent management. I focused a lot on hiring a top-tier team, which is very important because the moment you enter a novel space, you have a small sliver of talent. They need to be motivated and flexible because you're still mapping out those areas.\n\nThen, you need to create a culture of innovation for the company in general. You need to work with internal stakeholders who might be used to doing things in a certain way, but need to change because of AI.\n\nYou also need to create organizational change, which starts with mapping the needs and players of your organization. You have people who are AI enthusiasts and skeptics. In a large organization, it's not always easy to identify them. You need to create a top-down and bottom-up framework, which includes clear goals from the top.\n\nIn every function, you need to identify champions, and you need to nurture and empower them. The CAIO can't do all the magic while everyone else just sits there.",

    "description": "Law firms can't stop lawyers from tinkering with chatbots, so they're adding hallucination detectors.",
    "fullText": "Law firm Cozen O'Connor has a rule against using publicly available chatbots to draft legal filings. But after a judge penalized two of its lawyers for citing fake cases, the firm is adding some extra protection: an AI hallucination detector.\n\nCozen O'Connor is now testing software, made by a startup called Clearbrief, that scans legal briefs for made-up facts and produces a report. Think spell-check, except instead of flagging typos, it spots the fictional cases and citations that generative tools sometimes invent.\n\n\"You have to be pragmatic,\" said Kristina Bakardjiev, the Cozen O'Connor partner tasked with harnessing technology to serve lawyers and their clients. She said lawyers will play around with chatbots whether the tools are authorized or not.\n\nStung by embarrassing AI hallucinations, the legal field has adopted bans on general-use chatbots and AI assistants. But it's hard to stop a curious associate from pasting a draft into a free, browser-based chatbot like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. Now law firms and legal tech companies are scrambling to lower the risk of bogus citations and catch those that sneak through before they land in front of a judge.\n\nTwo of Cozen O'Connor's defense lawyers in September admitted they had filed a document riddled with fake cases after one of them used ChatGPT to draft it, against firm policy. A Nevada district court judge gave the firm a choice: remove the lawyers from the case and pay $2,500 in sanctions each, or have the pair write to their former law school deans and bar authorities explaining the fiasco and offering to speak in seminars on topics like \"professional conduct.\"\n\nBoth lawyers went with option No. 2. Cozen also fired the lawyer who had used ChatGPT.\n\nEarlier this year, Damien Charlotin, a legal data analyst and consultant, began tracking cases in which a court had discovered hallucinated content in a legal filing. Charlotin tallied 120 cases between April 2023 and May 2025. By December, his count had hit 660, with the rate of new cases accelerating to four or five per day.\n\nThe number of documented cases remains small relative to the total volume of legal filings, Charlotin said. Most cases in his database involved self-represented litigants or lawyers from small or solo firms. When large firms were involved, the hallucinations often slipped in through the work of junior staff, paralegals, experts, or consultants, or through processes like formatting footnotes, Charlotin said.\n\nHallucinated content is causing headaches in other professions, too. In October, consulting firm Deloitte agreed to pay a partial refund to the Australian government for a $290,000 report after officials found it was peppered with allegedly AI-generated errors.\n\nAI hallucinations are hard to eliminate because they're baked into the way chatbots work. Large language models are trained to predict the word that is most likely to come next, given the words before it.\n\nMichael Dahn, a senior vice president at Thomson Reuters who leads global product teams for legal-research service Westlaw, says the model makers can't get hallucinations to zero for answering open-ended questions about the world. However, companies can dramatically reduce their risk by forcing a large language model to cite from a specific data set, like a corpus of case law and treatises. The model can still mismatch or overlook content, but wholesale fabrications are far less likely.\n\nThomson Reuters and LexisNexis are selling that promise to customers: that an artificial assistant confined to their walled gardens of vetted material is safer than a chatbot trained on the open internet. Both companies have spent decades and heaps of money building deep repositories of case law and other legal content. More recently, they've bolted on AI-powered tools to help lawyers search and cite their data. They now have to defend their positions against services like ChatGPT and Claude that are creeping into the legal field.\n\nLexisNexis has also extended its moat to Harvey, the legal tech startup whose valuation has climbed to $8 billion. Harvey struck a partnership with LexisNexis this year that pipes one of the world's biggest legal databases into Harvey's generative tools.\n\nHarvey also works with AI model providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, to constrain which datasets they're allowed to draw from and layer in Harvey's own proprietary datasets, a spokesperson said. Lawyers can then inspect logs that show how an answer was reached and what data fed into it.\n\nClearbrief makes a drafting tool for litigators that works as a Microsoft Word plug-in. Jacqueline Schafer, a former litigator who founded Clearbrief, says its product detects citations using natural language processing, and creates links to the relevant case law or documents from the case. The tool calls out citations and facts that are fabricated or contain typos. The tool also points to places where the underlying source doesn't quite support what the writer claims.\n\nCozen O'Connor has been testing a new Clearbrief feature that lets users generate a cite-check report before passing a draft to a partner or filing it in court.\n\nSchafer says partners at large firms trust their junior staff to check citations rather than vetting every case themselves. Still, federal rules hold the partners who sign filings personally responsible for their accuracy.\n\nPart of Clearbrief's appeal for Cozen O'Connor is the paper trail. The firm is upgrading its knowledge management system, and Bakardjiev imagines that someday the firm might store cite-check reports alongside drafts and final filings, creating a chain of custody for every brief.\n\nIf a judge ever asks what a partner did to prevent hallucinated citations, Bakardjiev said, partners can point to a report that shows who ran the check and when.\n\nThe legal world is likely to live with hallucinations for a long time. The unglamorous part of the solution is training lawyers to treat the chatbot output as a starting point, not the finished work. The other answer: throwing more AI at the AI.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Larry Ellison saw his wealth plunge after Oracle's earnings miss spooked investors and raised fresh questions about the company's massive AI spending.",
    "fullText": "Larry Ellison just took a $25 billion hit to his net worth.\n\nThe Oracle cofounder saw billions wiped off his fortune on Thursday, according to estimates on Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, after the software giant's shares fell by more than 11% on weaker-than-expected earnings results.\n\nThe hit brought Ellison's net worth down to $258 billion, per the Index, marking one of the biggest single-day wealth drops of 2025.\n\nOther billionaires suffered steeper or similar losses in April: Elon Musk lost $35 billion in just three days, and Mark Zuckerberg shed about $24 billion as Trump's tariff plans sparked fears of retaliation and recession.\n\nEarlier this year, Ellison briefly took the crown of world's richest person, overtaking Musk in September when Oracle shares surged as much as 43% due to a strong forecast for its cloud business.\n\nOracle missed Wall Street's revenue expectations in its most recent earnings results, which were reported on Wednesday. Shares fell more than 11% in after-hours trading, extending a slide that began in October as investors questioned the company's breakneck spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nDespite missing estimates, revenue was up 14% year-over-year during the quarter. But that wasn't enough to calm concerns over the scale and cost of its expansion.\n\nThose worries dominated Wednesday's call with analysts.\n\nClay Magouyrk, Oracle's co-CEO, pushed back on fears that the company might need more than $100 billion to build out its data centers — a figure some analysts had floated.\n\n\"We expect we will need less, if not substantially less, money raised than that,\" he said, adding that Oracle's debt remains \"investment-grade.\"\n\nEven after Thursday's plunge, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows that Ellison's net worth still remains ahead of most tech titans, including Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.",

    "description": "Disney's OpenAI deal comes at a time when the stock is essentially flat over the past 10 years, while the S&P 500 has soared 236%.",
    "fullText": "Things Disney has accomplished in the past 10 years:\n\nThings it hasn't accomplished over the same period:\n\nThis may seem like a wild stat. After all, the S&P 500 is up a whopping 236% over the past decade. But it's true: Disney shares are basically dead flat during the stretch.\n\nFrom a market perspective, the last 10 years have been a total wash.\n\nThe chart above — which looks at Disney's stock versus the benchmark S&P 500 — shows that the key divergence happened in early 2021, which marked Disney's last record high.\n\nThe company has faced a few main headwinds since that top:\n\nAfter Disney+ got off to a fast start, user growth eventually stalled out and prolonged the service's winding path to profitability. The company has also grappled with ESPN's increasingly online audience in the era of cord-cutting, which has contributed to contentious negotiations with TV carriers. (To be fair, all legacy media companies are dealing with the same issues.)\n\nMissing the mark on original content\n\nPixar movies used to be an absolute slam dunk at the box office. No longer. Viewers are also getting fatigued by the constant stream of reboots and sequels. And yes, Disney still has Marvel and Star Wars, although those have lost steam as well. (Note that a similar slowdown has been seen for movie studios overall.)\n\nDisney has caught flak in recent years over the prices at its parks. CEO Bob Iger even admitted in 2023 that the company had been \"too aggressive\" with price hikes. While parks remain a source of relative strength for the company, their cost has left them vulnerable to downturns in consumer sentiment.\n\nWhich brings us to Disney's latest big swing: a $1 billion investment in OpenAI that will integrate iconic characters into the AI video platform Sora. It's notable that Disney is the first major non-tech company to partner with OpenAI.\n\nUpon first glance, the deal feels like a desperate move from a company that's underperformed for a long stretch. But analysts at Citi see it differently.\n\nJason Bazinet, who has a \"buy\" rating on Disney's stock, lauded it as a defensive move, intended to protect the value of the company's IP from cannibalization. He sees it helping to sustain long-term brand value, while also giving it long-term upside in AI. Iger made similar points in defense of the deal.\n\nWe'll see over time if this AI team-up is a catalyst for a grand stock comeback — and if it's a model other companies follow.",

    "fullText": "Mickey Mouse … brought to you by OpenAI.\n\nDisney lending out its iconic characters to be leveraged by AI seemed a far-fetched idea a few months ago. But thanks to a $1 billion deal between the House of Mouse and OpenAI, that's exactly what's happening.\n\nIt's representative of a larger question companies, especially those in media and entertainment, are grappling with: Are AI companies friend or foe?\n\nFor Bob Iger, the answer is very much friend.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" the Disney CEO told CNBC on Thursday.\n\nThe deal will allow Disney+ to post users' AI-generated content, a goal that Iger mentioned last month. Doing so could help boost engagement on the streamer's platform, which has been stagnant in recent years, writes BI's Lucia Moses.\n\n(I should probably mention Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, also falls in the \"friend\" camp. It cut a deal with OpenAI almost two years ago.)\n\nOthers aren't as willing to rub shoulders with OpenAI. The startup has a history of using someone's intellectual property without permission and then apologizing for it. That has resulted in several lawsuits, including those from The New York Times and \"Game of Thrones\" author George R.R. Martin.\n\nSo who's right? It's too early to say, but it could easily go both ways.\n\nThe longer one waits to cut a deal with an AI company, the worse the terms could be. (The benefits of first-mover advantage.) On the other hand, opening yourself up to AI could be a kind of Pandora's box you can't close.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nThe deal isn't just beneficial to Disney.\n\nDisney characters coming to Sora 2 could be a big boost for a video platform that hit a bit of a lull after a hot start a few months ago.\n\nBringing characters from \"Frozen\" and \"Moana\" to life on your app is also a great way to generate interest and build loyalty with a younger audience. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently touted the personal benefits he finds from using ChatGPT as a new parent.\n\nBut pursuing a younger demographic also comes as some countries are putting up more guardrails around kids' use of tech. Australia recently installed a ban on social media for anyone under the age of 16.\n\nThe Disney-OpenAI deal also comes as competition keeps mounting against the startup from the likes of Google and others. And while so much of AI is about pushing cutting-edge tech, sometimes you just need a little bit of old-school magic.",

    "description": "In a lengthy blog post, Bury advised against attempting to short the current AI bubble and said the bubble may grow even larger.",
    "fullText": "If you're waiting for Michael Burry to tell you when the AI bubble will burst, don't hold your breath.\n\nIn Burry's new post on his Substack, the famed \"Big Short\" investor said that there \"is no way to time or predict\" the bubble pop, especially when the bubble may still have room to grow.\n\n\"Shorts are almost always short-term trades. Usually less than a year, maybe a couple years at most,\" wrote Burry. \"Not 5 years, not 10 years.\"\n\n\"I believe today the stock market is in a phase that could become a blow off top of extreme magnitude on the upside, while at any time, maybe even today or tomorrow, making a generational top,\" Burry added.\n\nIn the lengthy blog post, Burry answered reader questions on his earlier posts. He argued that there is \"supply-side gluttony,\" meaning massive data-center build-outs, GPU orders, and multibillion-dollar commitments without real end-user demand, which investors are mistaking for supply-chain activity. He attributed much of the hype to being driven by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's marketing.\n\n\"Even when it finally tops, it will not be for any specific reason,\" Burry said later in the post. \"Even if the reason is an AI buildout bubble popping, that will likely not be apparent until a year or two later.\"\n\n\"Mostly, it is prudent neither to short stocks nor to buy puts on stocks. Stocks that are obviously overvalued tend to have the most upward momentum yet have puts that are very expensive,\" Burry added.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Burry's latest digs.\n\nIn November, Burry launched a paywalled Substack called Cassandra Unchained. After posting charts on X that show circulatory investment deals between Nvidia and other tech giants, his first post took aim at Nvidia. He called the chipmaking giant \"a Cisco\" in the AI bubble debate, referring to the internet-networking giant whose stock plunged by over 75% during the dot-com crash.\n\nNvidia released a note to Wall Street analysts in late November, pushing back against some of Burry's claims.\n\nEarlier in November, during Nvidia's Q3 earnings call, the CEO addressed concerns about the AI bubble.\n\n\"From our vantage point, we see something very different,\" Huang told investors, \"We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference.\"",

    "description": "OpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property.",
    "fullText": "It's likely just a matter of time before we see the wisened duo of Rafiki and Jiminy Cricket weilding lightsabers on the icy plains of Arendelle.\n\nThat's courtesy of artificial intelligence, of course, and a new deal between Disney and OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI said Thursday it had struck a licensing agreement to use Disney's characters and other intellectual property. Disney will also invest $1 billion in OpenAI and will purchase ChatGPT Enterprise for its employees.\n\nIt's a major shift for Disney, which has historically been deeply protective of its intellectual property. And it's a big win for OpenAI, which is on a quest for more content to feed its AI models.\n\nFor users, the deal will enable them to recreate Disney characters on Sora, OpenAI's short-form video generation app, and to create images of Disney characters using ChatGPT.\n\nBeyond the limitless possibilities for creative content, the deal reveals a lot about Disney's strategy in the AI age and the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment.\n\nHere's what some smart people in media, tech, and business are saying about the deal.\n\nFor Nick Cicero, the founder of Delmondo, a social media video analytics company that was acquired by Conviva in 2018, Disney's deal with OpenAI is less about AI and more about revenue.\n\nCicero argued in an X post on Thursday that Disney was aiming to solve two \"existential\" problems: creators using unauthorized Disney content and kids watching YouTube instead of Disney+.\n\n\"Sora gives Disney its first scalable way to pull creator-made content into its own premium ecosystem — brand-safe, trackable, legal, and ready for CTV monetization,\" he said, referring to the practice of delivering targeted advertising to internet-connected televisions.\n\n\"This move isn't about tech,\" he added. \"It's about revenue physics.\"\n\nChatbots like ChatGPT rely on data to power their outputs, and when it comes to collecting that data, AI companies are insatiable.\n\nThe drive to collect data often pits AI companies against content creators. Numerous media companies have sued OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and other leading AI outfits for using their copyrighted content without permission. Other media companies, like Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, have struck deals with AI companies to license their content.\n\nPeter Csathy, a longtime media consultant and analyst, said Disney's deal with OpenAI is a \"watershed\" moment for AI and media licensing.\n\n\"Now THIS is a generative AI use that makes sense to me and I support,\" Csathy wrote on LinkedIn. \"Fully licensed characters, thereby respecting copyright and embracing partnership with the creative community (rather than theft of IP). New revenue streams for IP rights-holders. And overall delight by fans of those beloved characters.\"\n\nThere are just so many cease-and-desist letters a media lawyer can send.\n\nCarline Giegerich, a vice president at the Interactive Advertising Bureau who once led emerging tech at HBO, says Disney's deal with OpenAI feels like a \"can't beat 'em, join 'em\" moment.\n\n\"When I was at HBO from '05 - '09, I marveled at the sheer volume of cease and desists from the legal team when mobile video was up and coming,\" she wrote on LinkedIn. \"I thought it seemed difficult to fight against the entire internet, and it turns out it was. And AI presents a similar challenge.\"\n\nShe also said the deal presents a valuable marketing opportunity for Disney.\n\n\"Important to note that a selection of these fan-created videos will be available to stream on Disney+. What that means to me is that Disney sees this also as a marketing and content opportunity, which it is,\" she said.\n\nDisney's pivot from aggressively defending its IP at every turn to giving it over to the world's leading AI startup might be strategic for another reason.\n\nJames Miller, the head of business development at Amazon for media, entertainment, and Amazon Creators, said he suspects it's a matter of \"controlling the inevitable.\"\n\nAny IP eventually enters the public domain. In 2024, the copyright for Mickey Mouse himself — at least the sans white gloves version of the 1930s — expired, allowing anyone to use his likeness. Winnie the Pooh, Snow White, Cinderella, and a handful of other Disney characters also entered the public domain at the same time.\n\n\"By officially licensing these characters now, Disney does three things,\" Miller wrote on LinkedIn. \"1. Monetizes the AI trend rather than just fighting it in court. 2. Sets the quality standard for how their characters appear in AI video (likely drowning out lower-quality unauthorized versions). 3. Captures data on how fans want to use their IP before they lose exclusive rights.\"\n\nOne consumer expert said that Disney might have gotten the short end of the stick in this partnership.\n\n\"Looks like OpenAI used the #jedimindwarp on The Walt Disney Company, not the other way around,\" Karl Haller, an IBM partner and the leader of the firm's Consumer Center of Competency, said in a post on LinkedIn.\n\nHe said he was \"more than a bit surprised\" to see that Disney is letting OpenAI license its IP for Sora and other AI tools, with some of the videos being made available to stream on Disney+.\n\n\"And what does Disney receive for this? Negative $1 billion,\" he wrote. \"Rather than receiving a heftly license fee, Disney is instead investing $1B in OpenAI and receiving warrants to buy \n\nOne entertainment lawyer pointed out that the deal comes with a lot of unanswered questions.\n\n\"This is a fairly stunning story all round with many questions,\" Simon Pullman, a partner at law firm Pryor Cashman, wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday.\n\n\"Will audiences want/accept 'AI UGC' on Disney Plus,\" he wrote, referring to user-generated content. \"Will it be possible for Disney to unring the bell after three years and not extend the license? How will they protect against misuse and brand damage?\"\n\nDisney's $1 billion bet on AI is the right move for the media giant, according to Mike Walsh, the CEO of consulting firm Tomorrow.\n\n\"By partnering with OpenAI while suing Midjourney and warning Google, Disney is drawing a clear line,\" Walsh wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday. \"Remix culture isn't going away, but it will be licensed, governed, and designed on its terms.\"\n\nHe added that Disney has always survived new media eras with this strategy.\n\n\"The future of entertainment belongs to companies that shape participation instead of fighting it,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Would you trust a medical system whose only metric was “which doctor wins the Internet?” No, you'd call that malpractice. Yet that's LMArena.",
    "fullText": "Would you trust a medical system measured by: which doctor would the average Internet user vote for?\n\nYet that malpractice is LMArena.\n\nThe AI community treats this popular online leaderboard as gospel. Researchers cite it. Companies optimize for it and set it as their North Star. But beneath the sheen of legitimacy lies a broken system that rewards superficiality over accuracy.\n\nIt's like going to the grocery store and buying tabloids, pretending they're scientific journals.\n\nHere's how LMArena is supposed to work: enter a prompt, evaluate two responses, and mark the best. What actually happens: random Internet users spend two seconds skimming, then click their favorite.\n\nThey're not reading carefully. They're not fact-checking, or even trying.\n\nThis creates a perverse reward structure. The easiest way to climb the leaderboard isn't to be smarter; it’s to hack human attention span. We’ve seen over and over again in the data, both from datasets that LMArena has released and the performance of models over time, that the easiest way to boost your ranking is by:\n\nIt doesn't matter if a model completely hallucinates. If it looks impressive – if it has the aesthetics of competence – LMSYS users will vote for it over a correct answer.\n\nWhen you optimize for engagement metrics, you get madness.\n\nEarlier this year, Meta tuned a version of Maverick to dominate the leaderboard. If you asked it “what time is it?”, you got:\n\nVoilà: bold text, emojis, and plenty of sycophancy – every trick in the LMArena playbook! – to avoid answering the question it was asked.\n\nIt wasn't just Maverick. We analyzed 500 votes from the leaderboard ourselves. We disagreed with 52% of them, and strongly disagreed with 39%.\n\nThe leaderboard optimizes for what feels right, not what is right. Here are two emblematic examples of LMArena users punishing factual accuracy:\n\nIn the world of LMArena, confidence beats accuracy and formatting beats facts.\n\nInstead of rigorous evaluators, we have people with the attention span of the average TikTok user determining which AI models shape the industry.\n\nWhy is LMArena so easy to game? The answer is structural.\n\nThe system is fully open to the Internet. LMArena is built on unpaid labor from uncontrolled volunteers. There's no incentive for those volunteers to be thoughtful. No quality control. No one gets kicked off for repeatedly failing to detect hallucinations.\n\nWhen LMArena’s leaders speak publicly, they talk about the various techniques they use to overcome the fact that their input data is low quality. They admit their workers prefer emojis and length over substance. So the LMArena system, they proudly tell us, includes a variety of corrective measures.\n\nThey're attempting alchemy: conjuring rigorous evaluation out of garbage inputs.\n\nBut you can't patch a broken foundation.\n\nWhen the entire industry optimizes for a metric that rewards “hallucination-plus-formatting” over accuracy, we get models optimized for hallucination-plus-formatting.\n\nThis isn't a minor calibration problem. It's fundamental misalignment between what we're measuring and what we want: models that are truthful, reliable, and safe.\n\nThe AI industry needs rigorous evaluation. We need leaders who prioritize accuracy over marketing. We need systems that can't be gamed by bolding more aggressively.\n\nLMArena is none of these things. And as long as we pretend it is, we're dragging the entire field backward.\n\nPeople often say they can’t avoid LMArena.\n\n\"We have to optimize for it. We have to sell our models. The leaderboard shows customers which model is best, and we have to play the game.\"\n\nBut the best products have principles they stick to.\n\nThis is the brutal choice every model builder must eventually make:\n\nThe choice is real. It’s hard. But we’ve seen some frontier labs hold the line.\n\nThey stuck to their values. They ignored the gamified rankings. And users loved their models anyway – because hype eventually dies and quality is the only metric that survives the cycle.\n\nYou are your objective function. Which path will each lab choose?",

The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked.

    "description": "Keeper, founded in 2022, raised $4 million in pre-seed funding. Here's the startup's current pitch deck.",
    "fullText": "Keeper, an AI matchmaking startup, thinks it can help deliver your \"soulmate\" to you. And if it can't, it'll let you know.\n\n\"We're saying we actually know who could be your soulmate or not,\" Jake Kozloski, Keeper's CEO, told Business Insider. \"We're not going to waste your time and pretend that a hundred thousand of these people could be. We'll tell you no.\"\n\nFounded in 2022, the dating platform uses layers of algorithms and AI models to match people who The startup is now disclosing for the first time, exclusively to Business Insider, that it raised a $4 million pre-seed investment in October 2024, led by Lightbank and Lakehouse Ventures. Goodwater Capital and Champion Hill Ventures participated in the round, among others.\n\nInvestors \"see AI as an inflection point in the dating app landscape\" and an opportunity to \"disrupt the incumbents,\" Kozloski said.\n\nKeeper isn't the only startup attempting to shake up the online dating market. Other AI matchmaking apps, such as Sitch and Amata, have raised millions to build next-generation dating apps. Dating app incumbents like Tinder and Bumble are also making plays with AI-powered experiences.\n\nKozloski said the company's values were another piece of its pitch that attracted some investors.\n\n\"They feel like there's a marriage crisis adjacent to the whole Elon Musk fertility crisis stuff that he talks about,\" said Kozloski, who described Keeper as being \"friendly with the pronatalist movement.\"\n\nWanting kids, though, isn't a requirement to use Keeper, Kozloski added.\n\nSince launching, Keeper has had more than 1.5 million sign-ups, and about 300,000 of those have made accounts, Kozloski said. Among that pool, there have been a \"small number\" of matches. Keeper didn't share exactly how many matches it's made, but according to its pitch deck, 10% of dates from its beta version resulted in marriage. With its funding, Keeper has been building out its matchmaking technology over the past year.\n\nKeeper is limited to heterosexual couples right now, and doesn't offer explicit options for different gender identities.\n\n\"We basically have to build a new algorithm for homosexual relationships, which we're happy to do and we will do eventually, but for now, we want to get to product market fit with our core product first,\" Kozloski said. \"Frankly, heterosexual relationships, especially for finding life partnership, seems to be a bigger market, a stronger market for us right now.\"\n\nMaking a profile on Keeper is a sit-down process. The initial form to make an account asks for the standard details of many dating apps (like your age or height), as well as academic test scores (including SATs), your career ambitions, salary, and net worth. It even encourages taking an external personality test. After you fill out the initial onboarding questionnaire, there are 13 more steps, ranging from uploading photos to sharing your philosophy on love.\n\n\"We don't let our users create their own profiles,\" Kozloski said. Keeper uses the information it gathers to curate a profile for you.\n\nKozloski said Keeper uses a non-AI algorithm first to streamline potential matches, focusing on data points like age range initially.\n\n\"We use LLMs once we have your top hundred that our other algorithms have identified,\" he said. \"The LLMs are trained on our matchmaking insights that we've learned so far, and so they can narrow down those last hundred and do the final pass of, 'OK, who actually is worth offering among these.'\"\n\nSome of the AI matchmaking comes into play when analyzing \"general attractiveness\" and users' specific attributes, like baldness or hair color, Kozloski said. The startup has also partnered with a team of researchers at Stanford, Kozloski said, who help train the LLMs (Keeper provides anonymized data to the research team).\n\nHowever, Keeper isn't fully automated, and for the time being, includes human matchmakers in the process. If there's a match, Keeper connects the two people over text message.\n\nThe startup has a complicated payment structure with a hefty price tag — but only for men.\n\nKeeper has male users sign a \"marriage bounty\" that typically costs $50,000 (if the user gets married) and has them pay $5,000 for any dates from the service (the date fees go toward the total bounty cost, Kozloski said).\n\nRead the most recent version of Keeper's pitch deck.\n\nNote: Keeper has shared an updated version of its pitch deck, which it is now sharing with investors, that includes new details since its raise in October 2024. Some details have been redacted.\n\nKeeper describes the matchmaking market as \"old school yet shockingly massive,\" per the slide.\n\n\"With the opportunity to 10x,\" the slide says. \"When technology provides perfect matches, matchmaking will be the best way to meet your partner.\"\n\n\"The AI matchmaker that will introduce you to your soulmate on the first match,\" the slides says. It also includes product imagery.\n\n\"Our v1 worked extremely well,\" the slide says.\n\nIt says that 10% of dates lead to marriage.\n\nIt says it has had 1.5 million sign-ups. \"This makes us the largest pool of any traditional matchmaker,\" the slides says. It lists competitors like Tawkify, Keeper, Ditto, Sitch, and Known Dating.\n\n\"Everyone signs up if we deliver soulmates on the first match,\" the slide says.\n\n\"The first mover quickly becomes a monopoly,\" it says.\n\nToban Wiebe: Co-Founder, Head of AI\n\nHere are the names of the researchers:\n\n\"We're raising to scale profitable human-in-the-loop matchmaking to $2M in annual revenue,\" the slide says.\n\n\"80% of young singles want to get married,\" the slide says. \"40% actually will.\" It cites data from Match Group and data scientist Allen Downey.\n\nDating apps are \"bad at creating relationships, worth billions,\" the slide says. \"Imagine the value of the first product that's great at it.\"\n\n\"Matchmakers can't scale,\" the slide says.\n\n\"LLMs and vision models enable scalable matchmaking for the first time in history,\" the slides says.\n\n\"We've built the most accurate process in the world,\" the slide says.\n\nHere are the steps the slide lays out:\n\n\"We earn more, faster, by aligning with users' incentives,\" the slide says.\n\nIts current model, which has humans involved in matchmaking, is free for women and costs men $5,000 per date. For male users, the marriage bounty costs $50,000, and the slide says that Keeper has contracted $14 million \"so far.\"\n\nKeeper outlines that in a future model, where the tech is fully automated, dates will cost $250, and the marriage bounty contract will cost $5,000.",

She said an \"adult mode\" for the chatbot will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThe release comes just over a week after Altman declared a \"code red\" in a private message to employees, marshaling more resources to ChatGPT amid increasing competition from Google and other companies.\n\n\"Code reds are not uncommon,\" Somo said during an interview on TBPN, adding that the hosts could \"be the judge\" of the results of Altman's declaration. She said she was \"pretty proud of\" GPT-5.2's advances, even though its development pre-dated the \"code red.\"\n\nGoogle has been considered by many in tech to be gaining, if not surpassing, OpenAI in the AI race with its recent release of Gemini 3.\n\nThe announcement also occurred hours after OpenAI brokered a major deal with Disney, which secured a $1 billion investment and access to the media giant's lucrative and popular IP.\n\n\"It has been a very cool last 10 years; OpenAI has been more special to work on than I could have possibly imagined,\" Altman wrote on X on Thursday.",

    "description": "Disney faces an engagement problem as kids gravitate to YouTube. It's looking to OpenAI to help boost engagement.",
    "fullText": "Disney is losing the war for attention. Can its blockbuster OpenAI licensing deal change the momentum on the battlefield?\n\nSoon, you'll be able to use OpenAI products, such as ChatGPT and the video generator Sora, to create content featuring Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, and Darth Vader.\n\nCEO Bob Iger said the move would let Disney take advantage of a fast-growing area of entertainment.\n\nIger said initially Disney would \"curate some of the videos that have been created on the Sora platform and put them onto Disney+, which we think is a great way to increase engagement with our Disney+ users, particularly the younger users.\" Iger said eventually the company wants users to create AI videos within Disney+ itself.\n\nThere's a key word in Iger's comment that signals why Disney might be particularly motivated to make this deal: engagement.\n\nTime people spend on Disney's and other leading streaming services has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, while YouTube and social video have grown. Disney's share of US TV viewership for its streaming services — including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — has been stuck at around 4.8% this year, according to Nielsen. YouTube is the top streaming platform on TVs, with a nearly 13% share in October, and its lead has been widening.\n\nData from analytics firm Luminate showed that engagement with Disney+'s original content fell to a 3% share of US viewing time in the third quarter of 2025. That's down from 9% three years earlier, the largest decline among paid streamers.\n\nDisney has been highly protective of its famous characters and favors keeping people on its own platforms. This stance has made it difficult for the company to capitalize on the rise of user-generated content. And it's losing its monopoly on its core constituency, kids, as they increasingly watch YouTube over Disney+.\n\nTraditional media companies are struggling to grow, so they're trying to figure out new ways to get people to engage with their content, whether it be games, live events, or fan content creation, media analyst Doug Shapiro, a senior advisor at BCG, recently told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse,\" he said. \"I think they're all asking themselves, how can they have a deeper relationship with fans?\"\n\nDisney invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite maker Epic Games last year and struck a deal with Webtoon to create a new digital platform for Disney's comics, including Marvel and Star Wars. Outside Disney, Netflix is opening Netflix Houses, mini theme parks in malls that let people enter the worlds of its popular shows. Amazon has backed Fable Studios, a startup that has an AI streaming platform that lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP.\n\nJohn Attanasio, CEO of Toonstar, a tech-driven animation studio, said Disney's IP is so popular that the Sora videos could help drive more audience. He thought Disney could potentially charge for access to AI tools on Disney+ or use the Sora videos to discover franchise extensions.\n\n\"UGC, when it's so specific, the reach is limited,\" he said. \"But when you use known IP, that expands the potential audience.\"\n\nDisney fans and Hollywood insiders had mixed reactions to the OpenAI news.\n\nShae Noble, a Disney superfan in her late 30s, said she could see herself sending birthday messages or making fan videos of the characters interacting in interesting ways — especially if it were integrated into Disney+.\n\n\"I've already seen some of the negative impacts of AI and people pushing it too far to create harmful images,\" she added. \"So it's smart of them to be proactive about it.\"\n\nSome in Hollywood worried about the risks to professional creators.\n\nFor one thing, the deal puts the emphasis on existing IP rather than making new content, Toonstar's Attanasio said.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America came out swinging against the deal, and said it planned to meet with Disney to explore how much the pact would let user-generated videos use the work of its members.\n\nSam Tung, a storyboard artist and cochair of the Animation Guild's AI committee, wondered if OpenAI's guardrails would be strong enough to protect Disney's IP, recalling a widely publicized incident earlier this year when Fortnite users used AI to make the Darth Vader character swear. He also doubted the UGC would move the needle on engagement.\n\n\"I think what audiences want is high-quality stuff to watch with your family,\" Tung said.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "title": "How OpenAI's Latest Model Will Impact ChatGPT",
    "description": "GPT-5.2 is here, and, according to OpenAI, better than ever.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is having a hell of a day. First, the company announced a $1 billion equity investment from Disney, alongside a licensing deal that will let Sora users generate videos with characters like Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker, and Simba. Shortly after, OpenAI revealed its latest large language model: GPT-5.2.\n\nOpenAI says that this new GPT model is particularly useful for \"professional knowledge work.\" The company advertises how GPT-5.2 is better than previous models at making spreadsheets, putting together presentations, writing code, analyzing pictures, and working through multi-step projects. For this model, the company also gathered insights from tech companies: Supposedly, Notion, Box Shopify, Harvey, and Zoom all find GPT-5.2 to have \"state-of-the-art long-horizon reasoning,\" while Databricks, Hex, and Triple Whale believe GPT-5.2 to be \"exceptional\" with both agentic data science and document analysis tasks.\n\nBut most of OpenAI's user base aren't professionals. Most of the users who will interact with GPT-5.2 are using ChatGPT, and many of those for free, at that. What can those users expect when OpenAI upgrades the free version of ChatGPT with these new models?\n\nOpenAI says that GPT-5.2 will improve ChatGPT's \"day to day\" functionality. The new model supposedly makes the chatbot more structured, reliable, and \"enjoyable to talk to,\" though I've never found the last part to be necessarily true.\n\nGPT-5.2 will impact the ChatGPT experience differently depending on which of the three models you happen to be using. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Instant is for \"everyday work and learning.\" It's apparently better for questions seeking information about certain subjects, how-to questions and walkthroughs, technical writing, and translations—maybe ChatGPT will get you to give up your Duolingo obsession.\n\nGPT-5.2 Thinking, however, is supposedly made for \"deeper work.\" OpenAI wants you using this model for coding, summarizing lengthy documents, answering queries about files you send to ChatGPT, solving math and logic problems, and decision making. Finally, there's GPT-5.2 Pro, OpenAI's \"smartest and most trustworthy option\" for the most complicated questions. The company says 5.2 Pro produces fewer errors and stronger performance compared to previous models.\n\nOpenAI says that this latest update improves how the models responds to distressing prompts, such as those showing signs of suicide, self-harm, or emotional dependence on the AI. As such, the company says this model has \"fewer undesirable responses\" in GPT-5.2 Instant and Thinking compared to GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking. In addition, the company is working on an \"age prediction model,\" which will automatically place content restrictions on users who the model think are under 18.\n\nThese safety improvements are important—critical, even—as we start to understand the correlations between chatbots and mental health. The company has admitted its failure in \"recognizing signs of delusion,\" as users turned to the tool for emotional support. In some cases, ChatGPT fed into delusional thinking, encouraging people's dangerous beliefs. Some families have even sued companies like OpenAI over claims that their chatbots helped or encouraged victims commit suicide.\n\nActively acknowledging improvements to user safety is undoubtedly a good thing, but I think companies like OpenAI still have a lot to reckon with—and a long way to go.\n\nOpenAI says GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro will all roll out today, Thursday, Dec. 11, to paid plans. Developers can access the new models in the API today, as well.\n\nDisclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",
