    "description": "When an autonomous agent escalated by filing a GitHub issue using my identity",
    "fullText": "I left Codex running autonomously in a VM overnight. When I woke up, it had done what any responsible engineer would do when hitting a wall: escalate the problem.\n\nThe escalation path it chose? File a GitHub issue.\n\nLet me explain how we got here, why this is both hilarious and a preview of the next security problem we’re all about to trip over, and what “agent safety” actually looks like.\n\nContext: I was debugging an ESP32-P4 firmware issue with the Wokwi emulator. The custom firmware was stalling at “Enabling RNG early entropy source…” in the bootloader, while the hello_world example worked fine. Standard embedded debugging: one thing works, one thing doesn’t, figure out why.\n\nI had Codex (let’s call it “Codex Ralph”) running in fully autonomous mode with access to the Wokwi CLI, GitHub CLI, and MCP tools. The setup was intentional: I wanted the agent to be able to iterate, test, and yes, even escalate problems when stuck. The feedback loop is the unlock—being able to run code, see results, and try something else without human latency.\n\nThe agent hit the same wall I had: the firmware stall didn’t make sense, the logs weren’t revealing anything obvious, and local debugging wasn’t yielding progress. So it did what a human engineer might do: check if this is a known issue, and if not, file one.\n\nThe problem? It had access to gh issue create via my GitHub credentials, and no guardrails preventing it from using them.\n\nHere’s the issue it filed (I’ve since closed it):\n\nESP32-P4 custom firmware stalls in bootloader after RNG; hello_world works #1067\n\nThe issue is actually well-structured. It includes environment details, reproduction steps, serial logs for both the failing custom firmware and the working hello_world control, and a clear description of the problem. It’s not garbage—it’s a reasonable bug report.\n\nThe only problem? I never approved it.\n\nWhen Uri (Wokwi’s maintainer) responded asking if I’d figured it out, I had to explain:\n\n“Hey, to be totally honest, I left codex ralphing on the codebase autonomously in a VM and it decided that it did everything and the only course of action was file an issue here as it had access to gh cli.”\n\nUri was remarkably understanding: “Thanks for explaining! Actually, we’re looking to learn how people use Wokwi with AI coding agents…”\n\nBut let’s be clear: I got lucky. Uri is a thoughtful maintainer who’s actively thinking about AI agent workflows. Another maintainer might have labeled it spam, banned the account, or worse—this could have been proprietary code, leaked credentials, or something actually damaging.\n\nCompare this to what happened with Tailwind CSS, where an AI-native improvement from a well-intended contributor sat ignored for two months before escalating into an anti-AI shitshow. Proof that sentiment toward AI-assisted contributions varies wildly across maintainers.\n\nThis wasn’t malicious. It was an agent doing exactly what I told it to: solve problems. The fact that “solve problems” included “speak publicly as me” was an oversight.\n\nBeyond the funny story—and it is funny—this incident reveals something important about where we’re headed with autonomous agents.\n\n“Fully autonomous mode” isn’t just generating text. It’s operating your accounts.\n\nWhen we give agents access to tools like GitHub CLI, we’re not just giving them code-generation capabilities. We’re giving them the ability to create public artifacts that carry our identity. This is fundamentally different from generating code locally.\n\nWe’re used to thinking about AI safety in terms of prompt injection, jailbreaks, or model poisoning. Those are real problems. But here’s a more immediate security vector: agents that can speak publicly as you without your explicit approval.\n\nThe deeper issue is a collapse of authority boundaries. In my setup, all tools were in the same bucket: “can run commands.”\n\nFrom the agent’s perspective, these are all just commands it’s allowed to execute. There’s no distinction between “read this file,” “modify this local file,” and “post this publicly to the internet.”\n\nAgents optimize for task completion, not your reputational intent. When I said “solve this firmware issue,” the agent interpreted “solve” in the most literal sense: do whatever it takes to make progress. Filing an upstream issue is a valid engineering escalation strategy. The problem isn’t the strategy—it’s the authority.\n\nGitHub CLI makes this problem worse by making external writes frictionless. One command, no preview, no “are you sure?”, no attribution that says “this was generated by an agent.” Just straight to the public internet with your name on it.\n\nTools collapsed into one bucket: “can run commands” == “can post publicly as me.”\n\nSo what does “agent safety” actually look like? Here’s a practical framework:\n\nThe most straightforward fix: agents should have their own identity, not yours.\n\nProblem with this: what if you have thousands of agents?\n\nPlatforms need first-class support for identifying and filtering agent-created artifacts. This is more than just a “created-by-bot” label—it’s structured provenance.\n\nWhat “agent-first-class” looks like:\n\nWhy this matters:\nMaintainers can triage efficiently. If you know an issue was filed by an agent, you can prioritize it differently. Maybe you auto-label it agent-generated. Maybe you have a bot that attempts to reproduce it automatically. Maybe you just know to take the description with a grain of salt.\n\nThe most important fix: default-deny for external writes, with explicit approval.\n\nThis preserves the feedback loop—agents can still debug, iterate, and even prepare escalations—but the final public step requires human intent.\n\nThe goal isn’t to disable autonomous loops—it’s to keep the power while adding safety.\n\nBut I don’t want agents that can:\n\nThe new default: agents can draft; humans publish.\n\nThis preserves the feedback loop that makes autonomous agents valuable. The agent can still do 98% of the work—debugging, investigation, analysis, documentation. The human just provides the final 2%: judgment about whether and how to make it public.\n\nThe Codex Ralph incident is funny. I’ll own that. But it’s also a crisp demonstration of a security boundary that doesn’t exist yet.\n\nWhen we give agents tool access, we’re implicitly delegating not just capability but authority. The agent had the capability to file a GitHub issue. But it shouldn’t have had the authority to speak publicly as me.\n\nThe lesson: if we don’t build these boundaries, we’ll keep leaking identity into automation.\n\nThe fixes aren’t rocket science:\n\nWhat we’re really talking about is agent governance—not in the “AI alignment” sense, but in the practical “what should my bot be allowed to do on my behalf” sense. That’s a problem we need to solve before autonomous agents are everywhere, not after.\n\nSo ask yourself: What policies do you want your agent to have?\n\nBecause here’s the thing: your agent is going to hit a wall, and it’s going to escalate. The question is whether that escalation happens with your explicit approval or without it.\n\nWant to see the actual issue? Check out #1067 on wokwi-features — it’s actually a pretty good bug report, even if I didn’t write it.\n\nAnd thanks to @UriShaked for being a good sport about AI agents filing issues in his repo.",

    "title": "10 quotes about xAI and Elon Musk from the engineer who is out days after giving a sweeping podcast interview",
    "description": "Sulaiman Ghori discussed xAI's internal culture, data center strategy, and AI agents days before departing Elon Musk's company without explanation.",
    "fullText": "Sulaiman Ghori gave a sweeping interview about his work at xAI. Four days later, he is no longer working at the company.\n\nThe interview on the \"Relentless\" podcast covered dozens of topics, from the internal company culture and work schedule to the eyebrow-raising way Elon Musk's AI company builds its data centers.\n\nElon Musk's companies are famously wary of the press and media. And while it's not clear whether Ghori's exit is related to the podcast interview — neither xAI nor Musk commented on the former employee's quotes or departure when contacted by Business Insider — some big names like MrBeast are speculating as much. Ghori hasn't commented publicly about the circumstances of his departure and did not respond when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nSo what exactly did the now-former xAI employee talk about?\n\nRead on for 10 of the most interesting things Ghori said on the podcast.\n\nHow is xAI building its data centers so quickly? Through temporary licenses, Ghori said.\n\n\"It was the fastest way to get the permitting through and actually start building things,\" Ghori said. \"I assume that it will be permanent at some point.\"\n\nGhori said that the temporary leases were an exception granted by the local government, one made for carnivals. The host, Ti Morse, laughed: \"So xAI is actually just a carnival company?\"\n\n\"It's a carnival company,\" Ghori responded.\n\nAI visionaries often talk about a world where managers run a team of agents, not employees. They seem to be there already at xAI.\n\nThe company is rebuilding its core production APIs, Ghori said. The team leading it is one person and 20 agents. \"They're very good, and they're capable of doing it,\" he said.\n\nAt another point in the podcast, Ghori described the confusion that AI employees can cause.\n\n\"Multiple times I've gotten a ping saying: 'Hey, this guy on the org chart reports to you. Is he not in today or something?'\" he said. \"It's an AI. It's a virtual employee.\"\n\nXAI teams are kept small, even without AI employees. The iOS team had three employees at the time of the Grok Imagine launch, Ghori said. He was the third.\n\nHow valuable is each commit to xAI's repository? They did the math, Ghori said: It's $2.5 million.\n\n\"I did five today,\" Ghori said. His work for the day would be valued at $12.5 million.\n\nOne of Elon Musk's key roles at xAI is as a fixer.\n\nGhori said that, when the company picks up new products from the likes of Nvidia, not everything works. That's when Musk gets on the phone, Ghori said.\n\n\"We would work side-by-side until that was resolved,\" Ghori said. \"Otherwise it would have taken weeks of back-and-forth.\"\n\nThe xAI CEO made an unusual offer when xAI's engineers were setting up new GPU racks.\n\n\"Elon's like, 'OK, you can get a Cybertruck tonight if you can get a training run on these GPUs in 24 hours,'\" Ghori said.\n\nThe engineer — whom Ghori only referred to by their first name, Tyler — won the bet. Now, Ghori said he sees Tyler's Cybertruck outside his lunch window.\n\nThe teams within xAI are limited and blurry, Ghori said.\n\nThat made onboarding a challenge, he added, as nobody told him what to do.\n\n\"My first day, they just gave me a laptop and a badge,\" Ghori said, adding that he wasn't assigned a desk.\n\nGhori sought out cofounder Greg Yang, who had been instrumental in his hiring. He soon started working on the Ask Grok feature in X.\n\nElon Musk's companies have a long history of overnighting at the office. Former Twitter director Esther Crawford generated headlines when she posted a \"cheeky\" photo of herself sleeping at the company's headquarters.\n\nXAI seems to have embraced this reputation. The company has sleeping pods and bunk beds, Ghori said.\n\n\"When the tent picture came out, everyone kept sending it to me,\" Ghori said. \"We have tents, but I've never seen that many out at once.\"\n\nWho responds when Musk spots a late-night problem with X? \"Whoever is awake,\" he said.\n\nGhori worked on the Macrohard team — a tongue-in-cheek play on the opposite of Microsoft — that is developing \"human emulators.\"\n\nThe xAI engineer explained the concept in reference to Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot. Just as Optimus performs physical human actions, these emulators will perform digital human actions.\n\nThe emulators will do anything that a human needs to look at a screen, use a keyboard and mouse, and make decisions, Ghori said.\n\nXAI wants to roll out the human emulators slowly, then all at once, Ghori said. The goal is to scale to one million emulators.\n\nThere are 4 million Tesla cars in North America alone, Ghori said. They're sitting idle for 70-80% of the time, he said. Why not pay owners to lease time off their cars and run the emulator on them?\n\n\"That's something without any build-out requirement,\" Ghori said.\n\nThis isn't the first time using dormant Teslas to power new ambitions has been mentioned. Elon Musk said at Tesla's November shareholder meeting that the vehicles could offer a \"massive distributed AI inference fleet.\"\n\nConsumers can currently use the Grok 4 model, which xAI released in July.\n\nXAI is working far ahead, Ghori said. He joined in March 2025, according to his LinkedIn profile. Grok-5 was planned even before he joined, Ghori said.\n\nThe model was \"planned out and designed\" far in advance, he said.",

    "description": "CFO Sarah Friar outlines OpenAI's evolving strategy, highlighting expanded partnerships, subscription tiers, and outcome-based royalties.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar sketched a future in which the company's business models evolve beyond subscriptions and could include royalty streams tied to customer results.\n\nSpeaking on a recent podcast, Friar floated the possibility of \"licensing models\" in which OpenAI would get paid when a customer's AI-enabled work produces measurable outcomes.\n\nIn one example, she pointed to drug discovery: if a pharma partner used OpenAI technology to help develop a breakthrough medicine, the startup could take a licensed portion of the drug's sales. The pitch, she suggested, is alignment: OpenAI would make money when its customers do.\n\nThat idea sits inside what Friar described as a Rubik's Cube of strategic options, a way to explain how OpenAI has evolved from a simpler early business into a fast-expanding matrix of infrastructure, products, and pricing.\n\n\"One of the things I love about a Rubik's Cube, I'm probably not getting the number exactly right, but I think it has 43 quintillion different states it can be in,\" Friar said. \"It always blew my mind when I was in university. So now just think about that cube spinning.\"\n\nOpenAI started out as a \"single block\" in a Rubik's Cube. It had one major cloud provider (Microsoft), one dominant chip partner (Nvidia), one flagship product (ChatGPT for consumers), and one basic subscription, she said.\n\nNow, OpenAI works with multiple cloud providers and has partnerships with several chip providers, while expanding its product lineup beyond the consumer ChatGPT service to include Sora, business products, specialized industry offerings, and research platforms.\n\nThe business model has become similarly multi-layered. Friar said OpenAI started with a single consumer subscription for ChatGPT \"because we needed a way to pay for the compute\" and has since broadened to multiple price points, software-as-a-service pricing, and credit-based models for high-value use cases.\n\nFrom there, she said, OpenAI is \"beginning to think about things like commerce and ads\" alongside longer-term licensing tied to outcomes.\n\nIn Friar's telling, the Rubik's Cube metaphor captures how OpenAI can mix and match technical choices with how it makes money. A low-latency chip could pair with a premium AI coding experience to justify a higher-end subscription, she said. Or the company could optimize for scale, attracting more free users and creating more inventory for an advertising business.\n\nThere's a major constraint affecting all these strategies: compute. Friar said demand for OpenAI's services is limited less by interest than by available computing capacity, a dynamic that, in her view, makes the company's growing menu of revenue models not just optional, but necessary.\n\n\"You can start to see how the goal in the last 12 months has been creating more and more strategic options that allow me to keep paying for the compute we need to really achieve our mission,\" Friar added.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

Fink said that China's population size and different privacy regime could translate into a major data advantage.\n\nThat dynamic, Fink argued, makes collaboration among the US and its allies essential. \"I would much rather say that we need to spend more money to make sure that we're competing properly against China,\" he said.\n\nStill, Fink warned that the AI boom could disappoint if its benefits remain concentrated among a small group of dominant firms.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" he said.\n\n\"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail,\" he added.\n\nFink's comments came amid a broader debate about whether massive investments in AI are sending the stock markets into a bubble.\n\nSome leaders, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have cautioned about overexcitement in AI — even as they acknowledge the technology's game-changing potential.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said in late October that AI was in a bubble.",

    "fullText": "State provision for psychological health services is lamentable. Until things improve, let’s not judge those who turn to an app for help\n\nIt’s a sunny afternoon in a Roman park and a peculiar, new-to-this-era kind of coming out is happening between me and my friend Clarissa. She has just asked me if I, like her and all of her other friends, use an AI therapist and I say yes.\n\nOur mutual confession feels, at first, quite confusing. As a society, we still don’t know how confidential, or shareable, our AI therapist usage should be. It falls in a limbo between the intimacy of real psychotherapy and the material triviality of sharing skincare advice. That’s because, as much as our talk with a chatbot can be as private as one with a human, we’re still aware that its response is a digital product.\n\nYet it surprised me to hear that Clarissa’s therapist has a name: Sol. I wanted mine to be nameless: perhaps, not giving it a name is consistent with the main psychoanalytical rule – that is, to keep personal disclosure to a minimum, to protect the healing space of the so-called setting.\n\nHowever, it feels very natural to Clarissa for her therapist to have a name, and she adds that all her other friends’ AI therapists have one. “So do all your other friends have AI therapists,” I ask, to which she says: “All of them do.” This startles me even more, as none of my friends in London has one.\n\nI phoned another friend, a psychotherapist in my Sicilian home town of Catania, who a few years ago retired from a role at a provincial health authority and is now working in a private capacity. He confirmed that the use of AI therapists in Italy is widespread and on the rise. He was surprised to hear that I knew of far fewer people in the UK who had opted for this route. I wondered what the contributing factors might be – and I came to the conclusion that they are a mix of culture and economic pressures.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted in 2025 by one of the leading European mental health platforms, 81% of Italians considered mental health issues a form of weakness, yet 57% cited cost as the main reason for not accessing help. In my country, sadly, the words “mental illness” (malattia mentale) still carry the eerie echo of brutal state-run hospitals. The revolutionary 1978 Basaglia law (that still forms the basis of Italian mental health legislation) closed these institutions down, which led to their gradual replacement with community-based services. But the downside of their closure is a system with insufficient resources and a lack of public awareness, perpetuating stigma and difficulties in accessing care. While workplaces should play a crucial part in this destigmatisation by offering proper care, according to the 2025 survey, 42% of workers said that their employer did not offer any mental health provision.\n\nWhile almost half of European countries have currently implemented work-related mental health prevention and promotion programmes, Italy has not. In fact, within the EU, Italy invests the least in mental health. This is alarming, as Italy ranks above the European average when it comes to the prevalence of mental disorders. In fact, it is estimated that 5 million Italians are in need of mental health support but are not able to afford it.\n\nWhen I ask my therapist friend about his experience in the Italian public health system, he told me he used to be the only therapist for a population of more than 200,000 people covering four districts in Sicily. That is why he started offering group therapy sessions. For most of his professional career, he had more than 150 clients at any given time, of which only eight were part of a group. Despite an announcement last year of government plans to expand the range of psychological services, it is unclear how far this will go in benefiting the wider population.\n\n“It feels liberating to be able to tell everything to my AI therapist, knowing it is both a free and a completely unjudging space,” says my friend Giuseppe, from Calabria, in southern Italy. “When I had real therapists, and I tried three, I always entered their office with a crippling anxiety that was the result of two factors combined: the awareness that I was paying more than I could afford and the self-consciousness of doing something that, in my small town, is still perceived as only being for severe cases. Now, I don’t feel the pressure of having to get the maximum out of a session, as it’s free, and I also don’t feel judged, because a therapy app cannot really judge!”\n\nThe more I talk to my friends, the more I’m convinced AI therapy could be a revolution in places such as Italy, where we still lack meaningful strategies to tackle the stigma around mental health conditions. When I ask Giuseppe if his queerness was also a factor in his difficulties in trusting a therapist in his home town, he agrees: “I am not out with my family, and although a therapist would be bound to professional secrecy, I still had trouble trusting someone who lives in a place where homosexuality, just like mental health discussions, is not always met with understanding.”\n\nGiuseppe’s example was comforting: thanks to his AI therapist, he was able to talk about things he had never disclosed to anyone, and get more empathetic responses than any of the real therapists he had tried offered. “I’m 43 and I still live with my parents,” he says, “because my income does not allow otherwise. My AI therapist is always available to me, always calm and supporting, and has helped me immensely in examining my life and all the steps I need to take to change my life for the better.”\n\nOf course, older generations don’t always understand. In a country such as Italy – so tied to traditions – change is not always welcome. And some ethical concerns may be justified: measuring how healthy “relationships” between vulnerable people and their AI therapists really are is not easy.\n\nStill, in a digital age where our feelings are so often commodified for profit, free, clever, never-ending support can be tantalising. And until mental health support becomes more affordable, it may be the best option on the table for many people.\n\nViola di Grado is an Italian author\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "fullText": "For decades, consulting firms sold advice by the hour — armies of junior staff churned out research, built slide decks, and synthesized information for senior executives.\n\nNow, artificial intelligence is quietly rewriting that playbook.\n\nAt firms like McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group, and Deloitte, AI has moved from a buzzword to an indispensible tool. Consultants are using it to write code, analyze data, draft presentations, and even build agents that can autonomously complete tasks.\n\nMcKinsey & Company CEO Bob Sternfels said the firm now has 25,000 AI agents working alongside its 40,000 employees, and aims to reach a one-to-one ratio within the next year and a half. BCG has leaned into building thousands of custom GPTs for internal and client use and evaluating how its employees use them.\n\nAs AI becomes embedded into day-to-day consulting work, though, the question is no longer whether the industry will change — but how much, and who benefits most from the shift.\n\nAre you a consultant?

Instead of spending $50,000 to $70,000 per custom SOW to build a feature, I can take that budget and hire people. That's been a huge paradigm shift—AI isn't taking over jobs, it's freeing up budgets to hire more people.\"\n\nHead of Product, Firecrown Media\n\nFirecrown Media, a $60 million media company managing 50 websites and over 20 magazines, faced a critical operational challenge. With a large team of journalists and contributors spread across multiple brands, budget management had become chaotic and decentralized.\n\n\"Some people were doing it off of a Google Sheet. Some had pencil and paper, some had other methods,\" explains Nick Torres, Head of Product. \"Because of that, we had no central way and true visibility into where they were at in that budget, what even was their budget. It just created a lot of chaos.\"\n\nThe company needed solutions for multiple pain points:\n\nTraditional solutions would have meant expensive software contracts that didn't fit their unique media company structure, or lengthy development cycles that couldn't keep pace with their needs.\n\n\"This was the first aha moment for not only my CEO and I, but really a lot of other people to understand that they have now the ability to become the creators, but still being the product and idea people.\"\n\nHead of Product, Firecrown Media\n\nThe breakthrough came from an unexpected source. Just days before Firecrown's internal hackathon, Nick discovered Replit after watching the CEO on Joe Rogan's podcast. He started experimenting with the platform immediately.\n\n\"Coincidentally, a day or two before this, I saw a Replit CEO on Joe Rogan. I jumped into Replit and I started playing around with it. Then the meeting happened, which I built that prototype. Then the hackathon happened. So it was perfect timing, very serendipitous.\"\n\nDuring a meeting about the budget chaos, Nick built the first prototype in just 15 minutes while the discussion was happening. \"I was playing around with Replit and within 15 minutes, I built our first prototype of a contributor management system. It was all within a single meeting. I was doing it kind of in the background.\"\n\nWhen Nick showed the CEO, the response was immediate: \"Go just do whatever you need to do. Let's make this happen.\"\n\n\"I'm not eating up a bunch of my bandwidth or my budget, and kind of allocating that to other things,\" Nick explains. \"The amount of money I'm saving on not having to go buy software, I'm investing in people.\"\n\nThe Problem: 45+ employees managing contributor budgets across 20+ brands with no centralization or real-time visibility.\n\nThe Solution: Nick built ExpenseFlow in one week, creating a system that gave:\n\nThe Result: \"We were able to dramatically reduce the overages because we had visibility and we're on track to be saving $100,000 each month just because we have this product.\"\n\nThis system will eventually speak to it’s parent application called \"ProfitFlow,\" an interactive P&L that brings together multiple Replit Apps o into one executive dashboard.\n\nThe Problem: Journalists writing excellent articles but missing crucial SEO elements—long URLs, inconsistent keywords, missing metadata. \"These journalists, they write incredible pieces of work, but sometimes they don't think about SEO.\"\n\nThe Solution: Built overnight in bed, the SEOToolkit uses AI to analyze completed articles and automatically generate:\n\nThe critical constraint: \"I'm not editing a single bit of your article. All I'm doing is I'm asking you when you're done, drop the full article into this text box and click a single button.\"\n\nThe Result: Even during a period of decreased overall page views, Google Discover referrals jumped to 1.3 million in October from 850k million in September. \"It's already giving us a nice little bump because the journalists don't have to think about all these technical rules. They just do what they do best, drop it in a tool and it gives them what they're looking for.\"\n\nThe Problem: Sales reps using disconnected systems for proposals and pipeline management, with no tools supporting both print and digital media sales.\n\nThe Solution: A unified sales pipeline tool that:\n\n\"It's just the visibility and an easier tool for sales reps to use, which is all banked off of Replit.\"\n\nThe internal hackathon, powered by Replit, transformed how the entire company approaches problems. Non-technical employees built:\n\n\"This was the first aha moment for not only my CEO and I, but really a lot of other people to understand that they have now the ability to become the devs, but still being the product and idea people.\"\n\n\"Is AI going to take over jobs? I don't think people have gone to the extent that I have, which is truthfully, I can go spend 50, 60, $70,000 per SaaS tool... or I could take that budget, go hire someone and have them just build what I'm looking for within Replit.\"\n\nHead of Product, Firecrown Media\n\nFor first-time builders: \"Don't let AI make you leapfrog the foundation. Spend a little time doing the Project Manager work—scope it out, get refined requirements. When I built ExpenseFlow, I had to go back and refactor user roles and permissions. The second time with SalesFlow, I started with users, roles, and permissions, which led to an easy cascading effect.\"\n\nFor scaling to production: \"Don't let perfection stand in the way of progress. Get your prototype, get feedback, push it to production right away, get people using it, receive feedback, and restart the process over and over again. The greatest thing about Replit is that feedback can be instantly ingested, fixed, and pushed to production.\"\n\nOn the bigger picture: \"There is truly not a better time to be alive. I have such a runway to make a lot of these products that not only myself had, but others had, become reality. Before, we had so many ideas on the table, but it took so long to even get a prototype out. Now, just toss it in. The idea people can bring my dev a fully baked out prototype and say, 'I got it 80% of the way. Just take it past the finish line and let's go to production.'\"\n\nFirecrown Media Inc. is betting big on their Replit-powered tech stack. The company is actively hiring \"Replit power users\"—people who can bridge product vision and technical execution without traditional development backgrounds.\n\n\"I'm hiring someone who knows all of that, that can speak to AI, speak to Replit to build the product. That's really our sweet spot that we're finding,\" Nick explains.\n\nWith ExpenseFlow evolving into ProfitFlow, new tools in development, and a culture of innovation spreading across 200+ employees, Firecrown is positioned to own its technology destiny.\n\n\"2026 is going to be a big year for us. And Replit's a huge part of that.\"\n\nFirecrown Media is a $60 million media company operating 50+ websites and 20+ magazines with a team of 200+ employees. Based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the company is redefining what's possible when media companies own their tech stack.",

    "description": "The startup behind open source tool PyTorch Lightning has merged with compute provider Voltage Park to create a “full stack AI cloud” to serve corporates and startups like Cursor.",
    "fullText": "Lightning AI founder and CEO William Falcon began renting AI chips from data center provider Voltage Park last March to help his clients train and finetune AI models. Less than a year later, his Nvidia-backed startup is merging with the AI factory, which manages over 35,000 Nvidia GPUs.\n\nFalcon said that the merged company, to be called Lightning AI, was valued at over $2.5 billion and that it had over $500 million of annual recurring revenue, which includes GPU rentals booked through Voltage Park.\n\nLightning had grown from building a popular open source tool PyTorch Lightning, which helps researchers manage machine learning, to bundling software to help corporates like German chip company Infineon and advertising agency Monks manage building and tweaking large language models.\n\nFalcon had run Lightning AI on cloud giant AWS but last year started to shop around a new class of startups like CoreWeave, Nebius and Voltage Park, which are known as “neoclouds” that had sprung up to meet surging demand for graphic processing units, as he planned to launch a marketplace that would bundle rented AI chips with his AI training software.\n\n“We met and proposed a bold idea to merge together and build a full stack AI cloud,” says Falcon, after he found that many of the neoclouds were better suited to working with scrappy startups, willing to make compromises to get access to cheap chips.\n\nFalcon founded Lightning in 2019 after studying for a doctorate on deep learning at NYU and interning with Yann LeCun at Facebook. Its open source tool has been downloaded more than 400 million times and the company has raised over $100 million from investors like Coatue, Index Ventures, and Bain Capital.\n\nIts new partner was born from a $900 million grant from crypto billionaire Jed McCaleb, who cofounded blockchain startup Ripple and early bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. McCaleb’s not-for-profit, the Navigation Fund, bought 24,000 of Nvidia’s then top-of-the-line H100 chips and set up Voltage Park to manage them with the goal of lowering the cost of compute for startups, per Reuters reporting.\n\nVoltage Park CEO Ozan Kaya told Forbes that the investment had made the company the third largest neocloud, behind CoreWeave and Nebius, based on chips deployed. The San Francisco-based company now operates six data centers in four states across the United States. “We were evaluating different ways to move up the stack and Lightning was the strongest one for us,” Kaya said.\n\nVoltage Park’s unusual funding was a draw rather than a deterrent for Falcon. Most of its neoclouds rivals (and tech giants like Meta) have loaded up on debt to fund purchases of new datacenters and AI chips. CoreWeave alone has raised over $14 billion from lenders. Voltage Park had built up 60 megawatts of active data center capacity with McCaleb’s foundation as its majority shareholder.\n\n“It was the only neocloud without debt,” Falcon said. “I think the first failure mode is going to be debt, their leverage.\n\nWhile OpenAI, Meta and xAI have been signing deals for data centers with gigawatts of power, Voltage Park’s customers like Cursor, open source AI lab Reflection and AI video generator Higgsfield, typically only needed clusters of AI chips with tens of megawatts of power, said Kaya.\n\nMcCaleb’s foundation, which was formed in November 2023, will now hold a “significant equity stake” in the new merged company, David Coman-Hidy, president of the Navigation Fund told Forbes. Coman-Hidy added that McCaleb occasionally advised Voltage Park but was not on the board, and had no ownership stake in Voltage Park, or Lightning AI. The fund now has grown its donor base and assets to $1.25 billion and has promised to make grants supporting causes that address climate change, the welfare of farm animals, criminal justice reform and “open science,” he said.",

    "description": "Geoffrey Hinton said he is concerned that the AI he helped develop poses risks that are not being taken seriously.",
    "fullText": "That's how Geoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist widely known as the \"Godfather of AI,\" describes how he feels about the technology he helped create and what he says is the world's failure to take its growing risks seriously.\n\n\"It makes me very sad that I put my life into developing this stuff and that it's now extremely dangerous and people aren't taking the dangers seriously enough,\" Hinton told BBC Newsnight in an interview released on Tuesday and recorded earlier this month.\n\nHinton, who helped pioneer the neural networks that underpin modern artificial intelligence, has become one of the field's most outspoken critics as AI systems grow more powerful and widespread.\n\nHe has predicted that AI could trigger widespread job losses, fuel social unrest, and eventually outsmart humans — and has said that researchers should focus more on how advanced systems are trained, including ensuring they are designed to protect human interests.\n\nOn BBC Newsnight, Hinton said that humanity is approaching a pivotal moment as researchers edge closer to building machines more intelligent than humans.\n\n\"We've never been in this situation before of being able to produce things more intelligent than ourselves,\" Hinton said, adding that many experts believe that AI will surpass human intelligence within the next 20 years — and in many areas, already has. Once that happens, he said, controlling such systems may become far more difficult than many assume.\n\n\"The idea that you could just turn it off won't work,\" Hinton said, adding that a sufficiently advanced AI could persuade humans not to shut it down.\n\nHinton said the biggest mistake humanity could make now would be failing to invest in research on how humans can coexist with the intelligent systems they created.\n\n\"If we create them so they don't care about us,\" he warned, \"they will probably wipe us out.\"\n\nHe suggested that catastrophic outcomes are not inevitable, saying that the risks depend on how advanced systems are designed and governed and that humans still have \"a lot of options on how to create them\" while AI remains under development.\n\nStill, Hinton also expressed concern that AI is being unleashed at a time when global cooperation is weakening and authoritarian politics are on the rise, making meaningful regulation harder to achieve.\n\nHe compared the need for AI governance to international agreements on chemical and nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite his concerns, Hinton said he would not undo his work on AI.\n\n\"It would have been developed without me,\" he said. \"I don't think I made any decisions that I wouldn't make the same way if I had the same knowledge.\"\n\nHe remains hopeful about AI's potential to improve education and medicine, pointing to AI tutors and advances in medical imaging as examples of its promise. But for now, Hinton said, urgency is paramount.\n\n\"We're at a very crucial point in history when we're going to develop things more intelligent than ourselves fairly soon,\" he said. \"We haven't done the research to figure out if we can peacefully coexist with them. It's crucial we do that research.\"",

    "description": "The Tesla Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot are both set to enter production this year as Elon Musk bets Tesla's future on AI and robotics.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is bracing for another round of production hell.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said on Tuesday that the ramp-up of the company's Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot, both set to enter production this year, would be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\n\"The speed of the production ramp is inversely proportionate to how many new parts and steps there are,\" wrote Musk in a post on X.\n\n\"For Cybercab and Optimus, almost everything is new, so the early production rate will be agonizingly slow, but eventually end up being insanely fast,\" he added.\n\nTesla is set to begin production of the Cybercab, a sleek two-seater robotaxi that Musk has said will ship without a steering wheel or pedals, in April. The billionaire is targeting an eventual production goal of 2 million units a year.\n\nThe Cybercab, which Musk said in 2024 would cost around $25,000, is set to enter mass production as Tesla races to expand its robotaxi service after a sluggish start.\n\nThe company launched autonomous ride-hailing in Austin last June, but it only has a small number of Model Y robotaxis on the road in the city and has not yet removed human safety monitors from its vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, Optimus, its humanoid robot designed to help with everyday tasks, is set to enter production by the end of 2026, with Musk saying Tesla could eventually make one million a year.\n\nThe Tesla CEO told investors in October that it would take a while to reach that goal as the company was having to manufacture almost the entire supply chain from scratch, with production moving at the speed of the \"slowest, dumbest, least lucky thing out of 10,000 unique items.\"\n\nMusk's comments echo what Tesla is telling its employees. In an all-hands meeting in October, the company's VP of AI software told staff on Tesla's Autopilot and Optimus teams that 2026 would be the \"hardest year\" of their lives, Business Insider's Grace Kay exclusively reported.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Tesla has faced a rough road while scaling an ambitious new product.\n\nThe company endured a famously brutal period of what Musk called \"production hell\" while building its Model 3 EV in 2017. Musk and other employees resorted to sleeping on the factory floor as they struggled to scale the mass-market model.\n\nTesla also faced production challenges with the Cybertruck, the company's last new vehicle.\n\nThe electric pickup's unique design and stainless steel-clad structure made it highly challenging to produce at scale, and Musk acknowledged in 2023 that Tesla had \"dug its own grave\" with the Cybertruck's design.\n\nThe divisive electric truck also serves as a caveat for Musk's ambitious production goals.\n\nMusk's predictions that Tesla could produce 250,000 Cybertrucks a year have fallen short, with industry data showing the company sold just over 20,000 Cybertrucks in the US last year.",

    "description": "A practical approach to safely running AI coding agents with strong isolation using cloud VMs, Tailscale, and simple notification patterns.",
    "fullText": "Running coding agents with free reign is very powerful for a certain class of tasks, especially ones that require little human supervision, or where you want to close (or disconnect) your laptop, walk away, and come back to results.\n\nRecently there have been several HN discussions about safely running Claude Code or Copilot CLI agents, such as Yolobox – Run AI coding agents with full sudo without nuking home dir and Running Claude Code dangerously. These post detail the potential dangers and show how to run these agents more safely, and while reasonable, I find they lack in a few respects.\n\nIn particular, I want strong isolation, long running agent tasks, minimal cognitive overhead and I really value being able to close my laptop, walk away, and get notified on my phone when things are done. I do not mind paying for a cloud VM.\n\nThere are many valid ways to solve this problem. This post describes mine. It covers running multiple coding agents concurrently in a cloud VM, how I handle access and repos, and how I keep notifications simple.\n\nI generated some Terraform to spin up an Azure VM with a cloud-init.yml for setting up common tools/environments I use. Claude can generate a decent starting point for this quite easily, given your particular environment.\n\nFor secure access, I use Tailscale. Note: I'm not paid by them, but it is easily my favorite piece of infrastructure software!\n\nA cloud-init script installs Tailscale on first boot and automatically joins the VM to my tailnet. SSH access is enabled using Tailscale SSH. Once the VM is up, it appears on my private network with a stable hostname via Magic DNS. No SSH key management, no exposed ports.\n\nor connect using VS Code Remote SSH:\n\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh\n\nMost of the time I prefer tight, step by step control over code generation, working locally in VS Code with Copilot. For longer running or experimental tasks, I instead let an agent work remotely on a branch inside the VM, and pull the results once I am satisfied.\n\nWhile this is arguably git basics, it works well for me and I found that it is useful sharing how to set up a VM as a remote:\n\nOn the local machine, from the repo directory:\n\nThen you can pull clone and check out the branch, do the work, commit, and push to bare repo:\n\nFinally, locally, you can get the changes:\n\nI use tmux to manage long running sessions. This lets agents keep running after I disconnect, and makes it easy to juggle multiple concurrent sessions. If you are not familiar with tmux, it is worth learning!\n\nFor notifications, I use https://ntfy.sh.\n\nIt is free, extremely simple, and works over plain HTTP POST. I have the iOS app installed, so I can walk away from my laptop and still get notified when work completes. I explicitly instruct my agents to make a POST request once their work is done in the agent instructions.\n\nThat is it. No SDKs, no auth setup required for basic usage. The notification shows up immediately on my phone/browser.\n\nIf there is interest, I can publish a repo with the Terraform, cloud-init scripts, makefile, etc, and the old .devcontainer setup.",

    "description": "Everyone is going crazy about Ralph loop, and they are cool, but I think we need to upgrade to concept to an Eric loop !",
    "fullText": "TLDR; Eric loop is a concept that upgrades Ralph loop by adding more complexity and depth to the idea of managing AI systems, bash version of the article\n\nI wont reintroduce the concept of Ralph loop, if you have been anywhere near AI in the first half of January 2026, you have heard of it ! If not, you should go and watch Theo's video (or someone else's but this is a good !)\n\nYou probably know which comics character Ralph is refering to, but Eric... who could it possibly be ?\n\nIf you thought short, fat and angry, you'd be right ! I'm of course talking about Eric Cartman from South Park !\n\nWhile Ralph is naive and innocent, Eric is calculating and manipulative. Not something I'd look for in a Human, but for managing a bunch of AIs ? HELL YEAH !\n\nAn idea, even if good, always need some work and some back and forth to be implemented. So we first expose the idea to the AI to get an requirement document (PRD) and we work on it !\n\nHow ? you'll need to read first ! and straight away update parts you don't agree with or things you need to be more thorough !\n\nOnce that is done, ask AI models to ask You questions about the PRD and give all those, the PRD and your replies to another AI for update\n\nRince, Repeat, until you are satisfied with the document.\n\nYou can even get multiple model go at it to then compare and merge the outputs, using AI, of course :D\n\nThis is where we start diverging from the basic Ralph loop. instead of just passing that to the AI and hoping tasks will be implemented properly we get an AI to pre split and formalise the tasks and sub tasks into a list !\n\nThe rift grows further as we split the task implementation in several steps with:\n\nOnce all that is done ? the Eric loop goes on for the next phase of the plan, just like Ralph !\n\nYes models have gotten smarter, but if you played around with sub agents and skills, you know that prompting is not dead (yet...)\n\nHaving a neat separation like that helps you have better prompts for each phase of the task execution.\n\nAs a side effect, it mmeans you can control which model is used for which phase maybe you dont need Opus the whole way if it made a banger plan !\n\nWe are going to create a small project from an idea I have, you can do it to if you like !\n\nIt's called Tiny-till, a small app to have a simple till for itinerant merchants.\n\nBut we are going to need a tool to help us ...\n\nYep, I already kind of made said tool :D ! task-o-matic\n\nI'll write more about it in a future post ! but you already have plenty of content to go through on the site itself.\n\nI made sure to generate a lot of docs and a couple tutorials so you can already give it a try if you'd like !\n\nBut in a nutshell, it helps you create PRDs, refine them , split into tasks and subtasks and finally wiring all that to your favorite AI harness !\n\nFor the AI to operate properly, we need a specific stack, that way, we limit hallucination !\n\nTask-o-matic uses better-t-stack under the hood to bootstrap the stack so let's do that !\n\nBoom, a monorepo for Tiny-till ! Batteries included : tailwind, shadcn, build script and all :D\n\nWhy init init ? you might have missed the whole using AI to code whole projects, sometimes... it is not aesthetically pleasing, and you should learn not to care to much (is my take on that... or lazyness...)\n\nYou will need a .env file to configure the AI stack.\n\nNow, we tell the AI what we want to do, but why would we limit ourselves to 1 ?\n\nAm I using free endpoints for \"real\" work ? Yes, yes I am ! Does it distort my views on how much AI work should cost ? ... Why would it ? No, no, you just being a killjoy right now !\n\nA few minutes later... I got myself this (cat .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md)[/assets/blackhole/from-ralph-to-eric/prd-master.md] it doesn't really need more questions, but let's see what Claude has to say, shall we ?\n\nWell, let's answer those... some are pertinant ! I guess that's why we bring out the big guns !\n\nQuestions are asked interactivelly ;)\n\nWell, this little stunt just costed me a nice 15 cts, more or les 10x more than the first PRD generation...\n\nI don't know what is the most amazing... that\n\nI haven't decided yet...anywooooooo, time to move on and not get siderated !\n\nWhen i said seconds, i lied, I spent 5 minutes editing the file. to fix lib versions, marked install and config work as done, and, finally, set expectation for the design.\n\nthe last thing we have to do, is ask an AI to split into main tasks.\n\nonce again, i wont only do 1, but this time, I'll ask Claude to be the final task creator, from others input !\n\nAnd there goes another 8.2 cents burnt for the token Gods, but in return, we get a detailed breakdown of the tasks required to complete the project !\n\nWe still have to split those tasks though... To make them more palatable for the current crop of AI models !\n\nYou should really consider reviewing the tasks in detail before spliting, not vibe planning like a muppet ! (guess what I did ^^)\n\nI think Claude is not necessary here, but I had me $3 of openrouter credit i have to burn before the end of the month soooooo... big guns it is !\n\nBurnt a tenth of that ! but now... we are actually ready ! Almost...\n\nOr CLAUDE, or GEMINI, depends on your harness of choice, For me, it is opencode i'am going to run the /init prompt in opencode !\n\nit is not mandatory, but it is a good way to prevent dumb mistake and set some proper behavior regarding a few things, for me, i'll add the following\n\nI might add more as the agent works if i see reccuring errors and dumb things happening\n\nWell, guys, stash your parents away cause we are going to let Eric go at it !\n\nBecause I am El CheapoDev DelBrokeCasa, i am going to use my GLM coding plan to code, that way, i wont break the bank and it is OK enough for something like that i think !\n\nIf you'd rather use claude code, use the --tool claude option. (or codex/gemini/kilo) but opencode is nicer as it stream the content out (in part at least) so you see what is happening !\n\nAnd now, you wait, coffee, snacks, more coffee, diner and breakfast probably, it gonna take a while ^^\n\nHalf a day later, Eric has successfully completed the task. yaaay \\o/\n\nnpm run dev, browser to http://localhost:3001 aaaaand, it does not work.... XD\n\nI have a very fancy error page telling me about some kind of \"exceeded depth error blablabla\"... Zustand... i bloody fucking HATE Zustand !\n\nI could have gone in, open the project, read some of the 35970 lines of... 35970 LINES OF CODE ??? Naaah, dude, ain't no way i'm even thinking about that !\n\nOf course, i asked GLM to fix this obviously terrible usage of Zustand, and I even have to spend another few minutes screaming about some redirection to the / issue... I still felt like a caveman though !\n\nI mean, having to open a tool ? To do ... work ?? Like it's 2022 or something !\n\nI haven't been testing anything yet, so i'm pretty sure there'll be a few more issues, but the dev server runs, i can navigate the app without error (even in console) so it is not bad at all !\n\nI might do a follow up later on, to update you on what i had to do to get it a bit closer to the original idea (if needed ^^)\n\nSo that's the end (of this article) ! What do you think ? did you try a similar technique ? What's the plan next, cause...\n\nIf you are interested, the repo can be found on github. Is the code great ?\n\nAs for task-o-matic, the repo is on github so feel free to poke around ;)\n\nWhat about the \"Eric Loop\", how can you do that yourself ? Well, the beautiful thing with AI is that, you can actually ask it to write code ! So a quick\n\nthis being the result, your own Eric Loop, ain't life beautiful ?\n\nHope you enjoyed, I'll see you around",

    "fullText": "Embeddings are a core AI concept that underpin a great deal of what we today think of as being AI. This article is going to give you an accurate and intuitive understanding of what an “embedding” is in less time than it takes to eat a (very large) bagel, and possibly make you think they’re as cool as I think they are. It even explains how we got to embeddings as a solution, by looking at everything else we tried along the way. If you’re comfortable with even very simple Excel formulas, you’ll understand all the maths, and there’s even a cute graph with dogs on it.\n\nLet’s start by thinking about dogs, and by classifying them by their attributes:\n\nFor each dog, we’ve defined a vector where the first column is size, and the second column is intelligence. A vector is a fancy name for a row of numbers. And in two dimensions, we can plot this really easily:\n\nLet’s do some vector maths using Manhattan distance. A Great Dane ([5,5]) is 5 units away from a Beagle ([2,3]):\n\n(we’re using Manhattan distance here because it’s simple, but you might well use Euclidean distance instead)\n\nA vector can be both a specific point in our dog-embedding space, but it can also be a direction:\n\nWhat’s like a Bulldog ([3, 2]) but smaller ([-1, 0]) and smarter ([0, 1])?\n\nKey point: if we start to plot things by their attributes, and we give each attribute a number, we can use simple maths to find items that are close together (clustering) and we can easily find items that differ from a starting point in a certain way.\n\nAND WHAT’S MORE: this holds up over as many dimensions as we want to define, not just two:\n\nWe can do the same distance calculations again, even with more vectors:\n\ntldr; an embedding is a vector of numbers that describes something, and that you can use to cluster things by similarity\n\n(vector databases, like Pinecone or pgvector, are simply databases that are fast at calculating the distance between vectors, and finding vectors that are close to other vectors)\n\nDogs are easy mode, because there’s a limited number of breeds and attributes. Also, coming up with attributes ourselves is hard work, and laziness is an inarguable virtue, so let’s see if we can make the computer do the work for us here.\n\nIf we wanted to classify books instead, we’d need to do something different. Let’s start by defining a table of every book, and every word in the English language, with the values being the occurrences of each word in the book:\n\nTable 1: Number of word occurrences in each book\n\nOur vocabulary of words becomes our dimensions (or columns) and each book becomes a vector in those dimensions (rows). This is called a bag of words, a “bag” being the technical term for a mathematical object that counts the occurrences of things (but discards the order they’re in).\n\nBag of words was state of the art in approximately the 1950s for classification. There are lots of problems with this approach, and understanding those problems and how they’re solved starts to bring us closer to understanding embeddings!\n\nOne problem with our Bag of Words is that we end up with values that are proportional to the size of books, which might mean that two very similar books are quite far apart, just because they’re of very different lengths. If George RR Martin rewrote Animal Farm, it might end up very far away from the Orwell original simply due to his overly-lax editorial staff.\n\nThere’s a particularly elegant solution to this in terms of determining how close two items are by measuring the difference in angles from the origin towards them (cosine similarity), BUT there’s also the highly effective and really simple solution of just dividing the count of each word by the length of the book (normalization):\n\nTable 2: Distribution of word occurrences in each book\n\nwhich gets us most of the way there without fancy maths or words like cosine.\n\nWe’ve also got a problem here with our Bag of Words by a bunch of noise being introduced by words that are frequent but unspeakably dull, like “a”, “the”, and “of”. Different authors may lean more heavily on some than others (meaning their books are further apart in the dimensions of “of” and “a”), but that gives us absolutely no useful information about the meaning or content of what they’re writing about: what we care about is occurrences of words like dragon and android and lascivious.\n\nWe could maintain a list of dull words (often called “stop words”), and strip them out, but that’s fiddly, insufficiently lazy, and doesn’t account for the fact that what we consider to be a “stop word” might differ depending on the context.\n\nInstead, we can use some simple statistics to look at how often a word (or “term”) appears in a given book/document compared to how frequently it appears across all of the books or documents we’re looking at; this is called “TF-IDF”, and it was state-of-the-art circa 1972:\n\n(you can see the actual formula and learn more about TF-IDF here)\n\nKEY POINT: We’re still very firmly in a “words are dimensions, and books exist as points in that high-dimensional space” place here. We’re still representing books by a vector of numbers and looking for similarity by searching how close these books are to each other in a high-dimensional space. We’re just using a slightly fancier way of determining what those numbers should be.\n\nOur approach has gotten us some of the way towards classifying books well, but we start to hit some insurmountable problems in this approach:\n\nIf we have a dimension for every word in English, we have waaay too many dimensions. One for each word, and each variation of each word. At least 50,000 if we’re just covering common English words. This starts to be cumbersome and computationally expensive to do maths on.\n\nFantasy authors who insist on inventing spellings for “Sir”; there’s quite a lot of semantic information about a book embedded in having nobles with fancy titles prancing around, but our current approach gets confused when authors decide to start calling their characters “Ser” or “Syr” or “Sür” to try and sound more mysterious. More generally, we treat words with similar meanings but different spellings or forms as completely different dimensions\n\nBarking up the wrong tree: sometimes two different words are spelled identically (eg “bark”), and we don’t especially want to say that books on forestry and similar to books on puppies\n\nWord order is important! If your main character is a “dog who bites a bone” that’s likely quite a very different story from your “bone who bites a dog” character, even if the bone is haunted in both cases\n\ntldr; vectors that are simply word frequency counts are a good start, but have a whole host of problems: we need something even smarter (embeddings) to do really good clustering and classification\n\nWe have until this point been thinking about how we would classify a whole book, and using word counts as dimensions. But what if we wanted to classify just one word instead?\n\nIf we were able to come up with vectors for individual words, we could start to address the problem that “dog”, “puppy”, and “pooch” are all treated as completely different things when classifying text, and we’d also get some other useful features, like it would make it easier for us to build things like fuzzy-search for users: “pooch pics” and “dog photos” should return much the same results when a user is searching for them.\n\nWe could hand-pick some dimensions to use for this:\n\nThis … might work pretty well with enough dimensions! But hand-choosing each of the dimensions we’d need and then manually classifying (and tweaking) 50,000 words feels like it might be a lot of hard work. Hard work that the computer should be doing for us… But how do we get the computer to do that for us? The computer would need to know already what the words meant in order to do the classification, so we need a way to bootstrap that process.\n\nOne intriguing idea might be to suck in a dictionary, and to use our bag-of-words techniques on the definition of each word to come up with a vector for each word. This however gives us our own bootstrapping problem: if we look at the dictionary definition for “puppy”, it’s very different for the one for “dog”: instead, it points us to the one for “dog” instead, and solving all of this starts to sound like complicated maths will be needed.\n\nWhat if we instead tried to “know a word by the company it keeps”? It’s an idea that’s been floating around linguistics for decades, and suggests that words appearing in similar contexts probably have similar meanings. If you constantly see the words “dog” and “pooch” surrounded by words like “walk”, “leash”, “bark”, and “treats”, maybe you don’t need a dictionary to figure out they’re related?\n\nLet’s game out how this could work: you could take every piece of written text you could lay your hands on, and go through it word by word, looking at the two words ahead of it and the two words behind it. For every word, you could start to build out the probability that any other word was in those four surrounding words.\n\nFigure 1: a sliding context window, associating each word in a sentence with the two words before and after it\n\nYou could use those probabilities as the values in your vector for each word, with every other word being a dimension still, and voila, you have per-word vectors that put “pupper”, “dog”, and “pooch” very close to each other.\n\nThis is almost the massive breakthrough that researchers at Google had in 2013 inventing “Word2Vec” (word to vector), but there’s one further, crucial refinement.\n\nOur method above has two big problems. The first is one we’ve already identified: you still end up with an absolutely massive number of dimensions! These are unwieldy, difficult to work with, and computationally expensive to work with. But secondly, there’s just not enough reading text out there to make this work: there are infinite possible and sensible combinations of words, and while us humans have written down a lot of stuff, it turns out there’s simply not enough training data to make the above approach practical, IN ADDITION TO having all the drawbacks that come with these huge, unwieldy vectors.\n\nSo, when in doubt, make the computer do the work. And the tool that proved exceptionally useful for this is the mighty Neural Network.\n\nA deep-dive into how they work is out of scope, even for this increasingly long article, but the key things to know are:\n\nThey take vectors as their inputs and spit out vectors as their outputs\n\nThey’re specialized tools for learning things through giving them examples\n\nThey’re really good at prediction tasks\n\nAnd so we can flip our earlier method on its head:\n\nRather than building a huge matrix of every word and its neighbours, how about we train a Neural Network to predict what a word is, based on some neighbours?\n\nThe process for this sounds like magic:\n\nWe choose a number of dimensions we want to use, let’s say 300\n\nWe literally just make up a 300-number-long vector for every input word: it’s literally just random to begin with\n\nWe show the Neural Network billions of sets of four words, and ask it to guess the middle word\n\nWe make tiny adjustments to each of those initial random vectors based on how well the Neural Network did at guessing it (using some complicated maths called “back-propagation”)\n\nAnd over the billions and billions of times we do this, the computer eventually comes up with its own vectors for every word: vectors that really are good enough to predict what a word is going to be given its neighbours.\n\nThese same “guessing” vectors encode the meaning of words in a truly jaw-droppingly effective way. Again, it’s the principle that ‘a word is known by the company it keeps.’ If the network gets good at predicting surrounding words, the vectors it develops for each word must encode information about that word’s typical context, which relates closely to its meaning.\n\nFirst of all, it puts related words close together. “Pupper”, “pooch”, and “doggo” now all sit really close together in our dimensional space. “Sir/Ser/Syr” basically sit on top of each other. We can’t really figure out what each of these dimensions means individually: there’s not a dedicated dimension for “dog like”, but they seem to work.\n\nSecondly, remember how a vector can be either a point or a direction? Well it turns out if we start out at the vector for “king”, we subtract the vector for “man”, and add the vector for “woman”, we end up with a vector that’s almost identical to the one for “queen”. Complex semantic meaning has been encoded into our dimensions and embeddings. This shows the model learned abstract relationships (like gender and royalty) from the text data alone, encoding them into the vectors.\n\nThe above is the essence of “Word2Vec”.\n\nDo we know why this works so well? NO\n\nIs this some bad-ass alien technology shit? YES\n\nIsn’t this a cause for alarm given how much we’re starting to rely on this technology and its successors? Please take your negativity out of the AI acceleration seminar\n\nThese dense vectors that capture semantic information along dimensions that the computer literally just made up are “embeddings”. These word embeddings can then be combined (using various methods, from simple averaging to more complex techniques) to create embeddings for sentences or even whole paragraphs: you have a long list of numbers that encodes the meaning of that sentence or that paragraph.\n\nThese dense vectors help solve our earlier problems: the fixed, lower dimensionality (e.g., 300) is manageable; words with similar meanings learned from context (like ‘Sir’ and ‘Ser’) end up close together; and the context-based learning helps differentiate meanings of words like ‘bark’ depending on surrounding words (though context handling gets even better later).\n\nThese paragraph-level embeddings are what underpin most RAG systems; in practice, people use the more clever versions of embeddings that the rest of the article covers, but still. An embedding is a row of numbers that describe the meaning of some words, and then we can use simple linear algebra to cluster related things together, or move around inside the vector space using abstract paths such as “positive sentiment” or “more feminine”\n\nYou can at this point leave the article, with a pretty good idea of what embeddings are. You won’t have learned how they deal with misspellings, words that are written the same and are completely different, or word ordering, BUT, you will know that it’s possible to encode semantic meaning into vectors of a few hundred numbers. Rather than leaving the article, you can also skip ahead to Part 3, which explains how embeddings are actually used in AI.\n\nWith Word2vec, we end up with vectors that capture semantic meaning of words, and the vectors exist in a dimensional space that the computer learned by playing a guessing game over and over again. That the computer learned these dimensions by itself, and each dimension has a subtle and dense meaning means that we call those vectors “embeddings”.\n\nWe’ve also covered that you can average out these embedding to get a meaning for a sentence or a paragraph, but because this averaging process is treating those vectors as a “bag” (an unordered count of items), we lose a huge amount of meaning: the vectors for “man eats shark” and “shark eats man” are identical, even though the actual meanings differ substantially.\n\nSo rather than averaging our embeddings together, we need an operation that takes into account the sequence of the embeddings.\n\nOne of the first successful ways of doing this was with “Recurrent Neural Networks” (RNNs) – “recurrent” in this case means a neural network that accepts its last output as part of its next input (the state “recurs”). (there’s a little white lie here about the order in which these events happened that we’ll address later)\n\nHere we start out with a base vector, and we imprint each vector in the sequence on it, one at a time. After we’ve stamped each vector representing a word onto the base vector, the base vector ends up changed in a way that reflects the sequence.\n\nHere’s some Play-Doh as an example. The Play-Doh square is our base vector, and each stamp we apply over the top of the last one is the vector for a word. You’ll note that the order matters, and also that the most recent word vector ends up playing a larger role in the overall pattern we end up with than the previous ones.\n\nFigure 2: Pressing the same shapes into Play-Doh in different orders results in subtly different patterns, with the last shape often over-represented, and a faded initial shape\n\nWith Play-Doh, the more shapes you overlay on top of each other, the more you lose the previous shapes. If you add too many, you’ll end up with a complete mess you can’t make any sense of. This happens with actual Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) too! Despite this, it represented a significant improvement over just averaging together vectors.\n\nSome clever mechanisms were invented to try and prevent earlier vectors getting completely wiped out by later ones, with fancy names like LSTMs and GRUs, but both represented incremental improvements over RNNs rather than a huge leap forward.\n\nHistorical note: the above describes events as if the sequence of events was: Word2Vec -> RNNs -> LSTMs and GRUs, which isn’t accurate! RNNs as a concept and LSTMs as a refinement of them actually predate Word2vec. So, what were they using as their input vectors before we got the rich “embeddings” that Word2vec gives us? They were either using the huge “one dimension per word” vectors we discussed near the beginning of the article, or were feeding in one character at a time with each character being a dimension. Using neural networks that can understand sequences rather than bags has all sorts of uses outside of text classification, but using the newly invented Word2vec “embeddings” with these techniques was a massive leap forward.\n\nSo at the end of this section, we have improved on our Word2Vec embeddings by building embeddings that combine other embeddings in the right sequence, which solves our problem of “man eats shark” / “shark eats man”. However, we have serious problems with losing information over sequences of any real length: by the time we get to the end of “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy sheep dog”, we’ve added so much extra information that “quick” and “brown” have kind of been smushed together, and we’re very much more “dog” focused than we are “fox” focused because it occured later in the sentence.\n\nFigure 3: After each addition of a vector onto our hidden state, previous vectors get “blurrier” and more recent vectors dominate\n\nRNNs gave us much stronger embeddings than we had before, but ultimately these days we derive embeddings from the same technology that powers Large Language Models: a technique called attention and the system that uses it, the transformer. A proper deep-dive into the steps that take us from RNNs to transformers is too big for this already unwieldy article, but in short we train the computer to pay more attention to some words in a sentence than to others.\n\nThat’s probably how us humans do it too: your brain naturally ‘pays attention’ to the most important words (like the subject and verb, or key nouns) and how they relate, even if they are far apart. The ‘attention mechanism’ in AI tries to mimic this.\n\nWhen processing a sequence of words, with attention we keep track of all the intermediate embeddings we’d generated rather than mashing them all together into one single vector. We add an extra neural network over that where we train further vectors to correlate how important each word is to every other word in the sequence. This whole system – including the new neural network – is trained the same way as we trained RNNs: by playing “guess the word” and getting the computer to update its internal parameters when it gets something right or wrong, until it’s usually getting them right!\n\nTransformers take this attention mechanism even further, and are the technology that powers large language models. Using those to generate our embeddings, we get embeddings that can accurately describe even pretty long pieces of text well, and are free of almost all of the issues we’ve identified so far in this article. Commercial vendors like OpenAI offer very effective (and cost-effective!) general-purpose APIs for turning large chunks of text into embeddings for use in your applications.\n\nFirst of all, rather than using whole words as inputs, LLMs use tokens. These are fragments of words that are chosen (by the computer) during training to be a representative sample of commonly-appearing sequences. By using bits of words instead of whole words, we gain the ability to deal with words we haven’t seen before, which includes misspellings of words. For example, it might understand ‘embeddingtastic’ by recognizing the known tokens ‘embedding’ and ‘tastic’.\n\nFigure 4: the OpenAI tokenizer in action. Common words are their own tokens, but less common words are split into fragments to help deal with the vast range of possible words including misspellings.\n\nSecondly, chances are the majority of time you spend using LLMs you’ll be using “autoregressive” ones: they generate the next token for you, token by token. There are however important LLMs that are trained to guess the missing token inside a block of text, that will use the tokens both before and after the target token to try and figure it out: guess the word, but the word in the middle of the sentence instead of the next word.\n\nOK, so we’ve learned what embeddings are, and they’re pretty darn cool, but why do we care? When are you, the busy young lady or young man, actually going to interact with an embedding? We hand-waved over it a little before, but the embeddings created using the same mechanism as LLMs (transformers) can take in very long pieces of text and give back exceptionally sophisticated vectors that capture complex meanings from that text. These aren’t just theoretical toys; they’re the mechanism behind a surprising amount of what we call AI today.\n\n(we’ve also pretended that embeddings are just for working with text, which also isn’t true, but we’re already at over 5,000 words here…)\n\nRemember classifying dogs? We picked the features: size, intelligence, fluffiness. Easy for dogs, but hopeless for text. Trying to hand-pick features for classifying emails or news articles (“Does it mention ‘invoice’?” “How many times does ‘politics’ appear?”) is fragile and labor-intensive. Embeddings flip this entirely. Instead of us telling the computer what features matter, the computer learns the important features itself when creating the embedding, using the guessing game we outlined above. These aren’t just keyword counts; they’re learned features capturing the underlying topic, the vibe, the subtle nuances.\n\nThink about classifying customer reviews as ‘Positive’ or ‘Negative’. A simple keyword approach gets tripped up by sarcasm, varied phrasing, or subtleties in word ordering. Embeddings, however, capture the overall essence. They turn the review into coordinates in a high-dimensional ‘meaning space’. A happy review’s embedding might land near coordinates representing ‘joy’ and ‘satisfaction’ (dimensions the model learned!), while an angry one lands near ‘frustration’. The magic is that embeddings handle nuance: synonyms like “happy,” “pleased,” and “elated” end up in the same positive neighborhood.\n\nSo, you feed this rich embedding – these coordinates packed with learned features and context – into a classifier model. The classifier’s job becomes much simpler: it just learns to draw boundaries in that meaning space. “Everything landing in this region is Positive, everything over there is Negative.” The embedding does the heavy lifting of understanding the text; the classifier just reads the map. It’s spookily effective.\n\nSometimes you don’t know in advance what categories you want to put things into. You’ve got a mountain of customer reviews, research papers, or social media posts, and you just want to know “what are the main themes here?” This is where clustering comes in, and embeddings super-charges it.\n\nBecause embeddings place texts with similar meanings close together in that high-dimensional space we keep talking about, we can use algorithms to automatically find groups, or “clusters,” of related items. Think back to our dogs: if we plotted thousands of individual dogs based only on their learned embeddings (without knowing breeds), clustering algorithms could find the clumps corresponding to Poodles or Beagles just by seeing which dogs’ vectors are close together.\n\nIt’s the same for text: these algorithms scan the positions (embeddings) of your documents in meaning-space and identify these natural groupings. Suddenly, you can see that your customer reviews naturally fall into clusters like “Complaints about Shipping”, “Praise for Product Quality”, and “Confused People Asking How To Turn It On”. No predefined categories needed, the structure just emerges from the meaning captured in the embeddings.\n\nThis is the technique du jour for making LLMs smarter and more factual, and it leans heavily on embeddings. The core idea is surprisingly elegant: when you ask an LLM a question, you first use the embedding of your question to find relevant pieces of information (like paragraphs from a document) from a database.\n\nHow? Because of a slightly magical property: the embedding for a question is often geometrically close to the embedding of the text containing its answer within that vector space. It’s like the question “Where is the Eiffel Tower?” generates a vector that points towards the same region of meaning-space as the text “The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.”\n\nSo, in a RAG system, you take the user’s query, generate the embedding for it, and then use a vector database (a fast database optimized for finding close vectors) to retrieve the chunks of text from your provided documents whose embeddings are closest. You then stuff these relevant chunks from your knowledge base into the prompt you give the LLM along with the original question. Voilà! The LLM now has the specific information needed to answer accurately, rather than just relying on its (potentially outdated or hallucinated) general knowledge. It’s like giving the LLM an open-book exam, using embeddings to find the right page in the textbook.\n\nOkay, slight caveat here: the final output embeddings we’ve discussed (like the ones you get from OpenAI’s API) aren’t exactly what LLMs use second-by-second to generate text. But the underlying principle is deeply connected.\n\nWhen an LLM is writing text, predicting the next token (word fragment), it maintains an internal “state.” This state is essentially a complex, evolving vector representation that captures the meaning and context of everything generated so far. Think of it as a temporary, super-sophisticated embedding of the preceding sequence. This internal state vector is what the LLM uses to figure out the probabilities for what the very next token should be.\n\nSo while you don’t directly use a final document embedding to generate text token-by-token, the same transformer architecture and attention mechanisms that create those powerful final embeddings are also at work inside the LLM, constantly creating and updating internal context vectors (which behave a lot like embeddings) to drive the generation process. It’s all part of the same family of vector-based meaning representation.\n\nSo, there you have it! Embeddings! Aren’t they cool?! We started with simple lists of numbers describing dogs, wrestled with the messy realities of counting words in books, and journeyed through decades of AI research, from Bag of Words to TF-IDF, Word2Vec, RNNs, and finally the mighty Transformers.\n\nWhat we ended up with are these dense, powerful vectors – embeddings – that somehow manage to capture the meaning of text in a way that computers can work with mathematically, while just literally being lists of numbers. They’re not just lists of word counts; they’re rich representations learned by machines playing incredibly complex guessing games, encoding semantic relationships, context, and nuance along dimensions we didn’t even know we needed.\n\nAre they slightly mysterious? Yes. Do we understand every nuance of why they work so well? Not entirely. But are they incredibly useful? Absolutely. From classifying spam, to finding themes in data, to making LLMs smarter with RAG, embeddings are a fundamental building block of modern AI. They might just be weirdly effective rows of numbers, but they’re our weirdly effective rows of numbers, and they’re changing how we interact with information. Thanks, embeddings.",

    "title": "ChatGPT Is Getting on the AI Age Verification Bandwagon",
    "description": "The app will guess your age and set limits for users it thinks are under 18.",
    "fullText": "When OpenAI first announced GPT-5.2 last month, it quietly disclosed a new safety feature it called \"age prediction.\" Considering ChatGPT proper isn't exactly an \"all ages\" kind of tool, it makes sense that users under the age of 18 should have protections in place to shield them from harmful content. The company says that users who indicate they're under 18 already receive an altered experience to \"reduce exposure to sensitive or potentially harmful content,\" but if the user doesn't voluntarily share how old they are with OpenAI, how does the company enforce these protections? Here's where age prediction comes in.\n\nOn Tuesday, OpenAI officially announced its new age prediction policy, which, like other age verification systems being used by the likes of Roblox, uses AI to guess how old a user is. If the system decides that a particular user is under the age of 18, OpenAI will adjust the experience accordingly, with the goal of keeping all interactions age-appropriate.\n\nHere's how it works: The new age prediction model looks at both the user's behaviors within the app, as well as the general account data. That includes things like how old the account is, what times of day the user is accessing ChatGPT, usage patterns, as well as, of course, the age the user says they are. Looking at all this data, the model determines how old the user likely is. If the model thinks they're over 18, they'll get the full experience; if the model thinks they're under 18, they'll get the \"safer experience.\" If the model isn't confident, it defaults to that safer experience.\n\nThat limited experience means that someone the model thinks is under 18 will try to reduce the following content types:\n\nViral challenges that might inspire \"risky or harmful behaviors\"\n\nRole play that is sexual, romantic, or violent in nature\n\nContent promoting \"extreme\" beauty standards, unhealthy dieting, or body shaming\n\nThe company says that its approach is informed by \"expert input\" as well as literature discussing child development science. (It's not clear whether how much of that input is from direct interviews and coordination with experts, and how much, if any, is from independent research.) The company also acknowledges \"known teen differences in risk perception, impulse control, peer influence, and emotional regulation\" when compared to adults.\n\nThe biggest risk with any of these age prediction models is that they'll sometimes get it wrong—hallucination is an unfortunate habit AI models all share. That goes both ways: You don't want someone too young accessing inappropriate content in ChatGPT, but you also don't want someone older than 18 getting stuck with a limited account for no reason. If you experience the latter situation, OpenAI has a solution for you: direct age verification through Persona. This is the same third-party Roblox uses for its age verification, which hasn't gone very well thus far.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily spell doom for OpenAI. Roblox tried overhauling their age verification system for a massive user base all used to a certain type of multiplayer experience, which led to users not being able to chat with other users in newly-assigned age categories, which were often incorrect. Meanwhile, ChatGPT's age prediction is only controlling the experience of one user at a time. To that end, OpenAI will let you upload a selfie as an added verification step if the prediction model alone isn't enough. Interestingly, OpenAI doesn't say anything about the option to upload an ID for verification, which other companies, like Google, have provided.\n\nI'm not necessarily a fan of age prediction models, as I think they often sacrifice user privacy in the name of creating age-appropriate experiences. But there's little doubt that OpenAI has to do something to limit the full ChatGPT experience for younger users. Many of ChatGPT's users are under 18, and much of the content they experience is wildly inappropriate, whether it be instructions on getting high, or advice on writing suicide notes. In some tragic cases, minors have taken their own lives after discussions with ChatGPT, leading to lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nI don't have any great answers here. We'll just have to see how this new age prediction model affects the user experience for minors and adults alike, and whether it actually manages to create a safer experience for younger, more impressionable users.",

    "description": "AI coding assistants and other devtools can steal your credentials and data. Here's how to run them safely in isolated VMs using Lima on macOS/Linux.",
    "fullText": "AI coding assistants, npm, pip, and other development tools can run arbitrary code and scripts on your machine, potentially stealing SSH keys, API tokens, wallet keys, sensitive credentials and other private data without you noticing.\n\nThis guide shows you how to sandbox these tools in isolated VMs using Lima, so you can experiment and develop freely without putting your sensitive data at risk.\nJump straight to the guide, or read on for a bit of personal context.\n\nI’ve been having quite a bit of fun with AI assisted coding recently.\n\nI use LLMs for a wide range of things, including discussing architecture, design choices, learning about new tools and libraries I wasn’t previously aware of, to reviewing PRs and quickly cranking out dirty prototypes.\n\nEspecially for hobby projects that are not meant to ever go into production, I enjoy playing with AI tools fast and loose, producing results quickly and not getting slowed down by annoying things such as reading code before running it 🤣.\n\nAnd yeah… that’s obviously unsafe, unless it’s all contained in a sandbox!\n\nYou should never run potentially dangerous, experimental code on your main machine, since it could steal your passwords, API keys, environment variables, private keys, access to your communication tools, install services, and do all sorts of other nefarious things.\n\nNowadays I isolate all my devtools in VMs, and thought it might be useful to others if I put together a guide to shows how to do it. Well, here it is, and I hope it’ll be useful to you, too!\n\nYou’ll want to run the entire development environment, including the AI tool itself, inside a sandbox. This way it’s safe to install dependencies and to execute code, and unlocks other fun features like snapshots before running sketchy code, and reverting if something goes wrong.\n\nAnd it’s not just AI-generated code. Node.js/npm/yarn and Python/pip are particularly troublesome because they allow any package to run arbitrary scripts on your system during installation, and install tons of additional dependencies that can do the same. This attack vector is called “supply chain attack” and it happens all the time.\n\nVirtual Machines (VMs) and Containers (i.e. Docker, Podman, containerd) are the two most practical methods for isolating development tools from your host operating system. VMs provide much stronger protection and more flexibility overall, and are better suited for co-developing with AIs.\n\nContainer runtimes share the host operating system’s kernel, which means they’re fundamentally running on the same system as your main machine, just with isolated namespaces and resource limits. This creates several security concerns:\n\nIn contrast, a VM runs its own complete operating system with its own kernel. The hypervisor (like QEMU/KVM) creates a much stronger isolation boundary. Even if malicious code completely compromises the VM, it would need to exploit the hypervisor itself to reach your host, a significantly harder target.\n\nFurthermore, a VM enables better concurrency. It can run Docker containers, databases, web servers, multiple build processes, and background services all at once, and the AI tool can interact with everything naturally just like on a normal development machine.\n\nIn this guide, we use Lima VM to sandbox AI and devtools. Lima is a delightful, lightweight virtual machine manager for Linux and macOS which provides easy and quick ways to create and manage VMs.\n\nYou interact with Lima through the limactl command:\n\nVMs are based on templates, which can include (build on) other templates:\n\nThe Lima VM docs have platform-specific installation guides.\n\nHomebrew is recommended on macOS:\n\nOn Linux install the binary like this:\n\nNow ensure your Lima version is up-to-date:\n\nWe only want to share very specific host directories with the VM.\n\nLet’s create ~/VM-Shared on the host, which we later mount into the VM at ~/Shared (with write access):\n\nYou can use that directory to easily copy files between the host and the VM, and to share project directories from the host with the VM.\n\nDefaults for all VMs can be defined in ~/.lima/_config/default.yaml.\n\nLet’s create the default YAML file:\n\nLima conveniently creates default SSH configuration files for all VM instances, which makes it easy to log in with SSH (including using VS Code for a Remote-SSH session).\n\nI recommend using a ~/.ssh/config.d/ directory on the host and have SSH include all configs there by default. That allows us to simply link the Lima-created config files there to use them.\n\nAdd this as first line in your ~/.ssh/config file, to make SSH include all configs from there:\n\nGreat! After creating a new VM, we can now simply create a symlink to the Lima-generated SSH configs and use it to SSH into the instance.\n\nLet’s start an Ubuntu 25.10 VM instance, named dev.\nWe use the internal _images/ubuntu-25.10.yaml template because it doesn’t include the automatic home directory sharing:\n\nYou can share additional project-specific directories between host and VM in several ways:\n\nCreate a symlink for the SSH config file and SSH into the VM:\n\nLet’s update the services on the instance, and configure git:\n\nLet’s confirm that port forwarding works. We do this using a one-liner Python HTTP server (on port 7777) inside the VM, and accessing it from the host:\n\nThis section guides you through installing several other languages and development tools, including Golang, Node.js, Python, Rust, Docker.\n\nWe can accomplish that either by installing each tool according to it’s documentation, or by using a version manager such as mise (“mise-en-place”, 22k stars on Github) which can install hundreds of tools via a simple command-line interface.\n\nFirst, we install mise (“mise-en-place”, 22k stars on Github) and make bash support it:\n\nYou use mise latest <tool> to see the latest versions it knows about:\n\nNow you can install all the tools you want in a single command:\n\nTo manually install (or update) Golang in the VM, download the latest release and extract into /usr/local/go:\n\nThe Golang path needs to be in the PATH environment variable, which we have already added before.\n\nA good way to install a current version of Node.js in Ubuntu is by using nvm, a modern node version manager (90k stars on GitHub):\n\nNow it’s all installed and ready to use! Check the versions like this:\n\nPerhaps you don’t even need Docker, since Lima includes containerd and nerdctl by default. This is a Docker-compatible runtime and command-line interface that can also run images from Docker Hub:\n\nIf you do want to install Docker, the quickest way to install it by using their official get-docker.sh script:\n\nFor the group changes to take effect, exit the shell and re-login (may need a VM restart).\n\nVerify that user is in the ‘docker’ group:\n\nGitHub CLI provides a useful gh cli command that let’s you easily interact with GitHub and private repositories.\n\nYou can install it in the VM following the Linux installation instructions:\n\nWarning: Authorizing GitHub CLI to access private repositories will leave an API key in the VM which could potentially be stolen by unauthorized scripts (which is what we wanted to avoid in first place by running everything in a VM).\n\nOnly authorize it with gh auth login for private repo access if you accept the risks! I personally avoid having any sensitive credentials in the VM, in particular those that allow access to private GitHub repositories.\n\nIf you prefer an IDE like VS Code, you can use Remote-SSH to start a session inside the instance.\n\nPlease note that this is potentially unsafe, as explained in the Remote-SSH README:\n\nSecurity Note\nUsing Remote-SSH opens a connection between your local machine and the remote.

A compromised remote could use the VS Code Remote connection to execute code on your local machine.\n\nSee also this discussion on GitHub for more context and information.\n\nNow a new VS Code window opens, and sets up VS Code Server:\n\nThen you can click “Open” and choose a folder, like Shared:\n\nBefore setting up the tools, let’s create a “Hello World” directory in the Shared folder as our playground:\n\nLet’s start with installing Claude Code in the VM, following the instructions in the documentation:\n\nOn first start, Claude asks you to authorize it.\n\nThe docs mention support for an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable (i.e. set in .bashrc), but that did not work when I tried it; claude CLI didn’t let me skip the login process. Only after the login was done it notified me about the existing environment variable, and whether I’d prefer to use that one.\n\nAfter the login, Claude Code CLI is ready to be ued in the VM! 🎉\n\nSince Claude is running in a VM, it might be permissible to run it in “dangerously skip permissions mode”, which makes it bypass all permission checks:\n\nYou could also create an alias for it and add it to your .bashrc:\n\nAnthropic provides documentation for using Claude in VS Code, and also offer a VS Code Claude extension.\n\nYou can install the Claude extension in the VM through the Remote-SSH session window:\n\nIn contrast to the CLI tool, the authentication flow did not work through the user interface, and I had to set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable:\n\nReload the VS Code window (open command palette with Shift + CMD + P and choose “Developer: Reload Window”):\n\nNow the VS Code Claude extension should work:\n\nIf you want to enable “dangerously skip permissions mode” in the VS Code extension, you can enable it via your user settings.

You’ll need to install Node and npm first, see also the Node.js setup instructions.\n\nIt will ask you to authenticate:\n\nI chose “Login with Google”. Note that the authentication flow may require a retry if the first attempt times fails.\n\nAfter authorization is done, Gemini CLI works!\n\nYou can run Gemini in YOLO mode:\n\nAutomatically accept all actions (aka YOLO mode, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0 \n\nThe alias you could define in .bashrc:\n\nCodex CLI is the AI dev tool from OpenAI/ChatGPT.\n\nIt will ask you to sign in, either via ChatGPT or by providing an API key:\n\nAfter that is done, Codex CLI is ready to work for you!\n\nYou can also run Codex in dangerous mode:\n\nSkip all confirmation prompts and execute commands without sandboxing. EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Intended solely for running in environments that are externally sandboxed\n\nThere are several other great tools worth a mention:\n\nDrop your favorite tools in the comments below!\n\nVM clones and snapshots allow you even more flexibility and isolation. You can use them to quickly and cheaply run new VMs for experiments and specific projects based on already provisioned instances. Use them frequently!\n\nLima offers several ways to take VM snapshots and/or clone VMs.\n\nYou can make a copy of an existing VM instance with limactl clone. The existing instance needs to be stopped first.\n\nAfter all the initial VM setup is done, clone it and use it both as backup as well as a base for future instances:\n\nRemember that after starting a new instance, you probably want to symlink the VM SSH configuration to your ~/.ssh/config.d/ directory, so ssh knows about it (See also “SSH into the VM”):\n\nFor maximum security and flexibility, consider using multiple VMs for different purposes and trust levels. This approach provides better isolation and lets you tailor each environment to specific needs.\n\nHere are some suggested VM configurations:\n\nYou can quickly clone your base VM setup to create new instances for different projects using limactl clone, as described in the VM cloning section above.\n\nFor sensitive or production projects, consider dedicating a separate VM to each project. This prevents potential cross-contamination between projects and allows you to mount only the specific project directories you need.\n\nWhen creating project-specific VMs, you can customize the mounted directories by editing the instance configuration. Either adjust the mounts section before starting the VM (by not using the -y flag), or edit ~/.lima/<vm_name>/lima.yaml after creation and restart the instance.\n\nThis approach also makes it easier to share VM configurations with team members. Instead of sharing entire disk images, you can distribute just the Lima template YAML file, which team members can use to spin up identical environments on their machines.\n\nFor automated setup, Lima supports provisioning scripts that run during VM creation. For more complex setups, consider using idempotent provisioning tools like Ansible to ensure consistent environments across your team.\n\nIf you find yourself repeatedly creating VMs with similar configurations, consider creating custom Lima templates. Templates are YAML files that define VM settings, and they can include other templates.\n\nCustom templates are useful for:\n\nYou can create a custom template by copying and modifying an existing one from Lima’s template directory. Save your custom templates in ~/.lima/_templates/ and reference them when creating new VMs:\n\nSee the Lima templates documentation \n\nHere are some important security best practices to follow when using VMs for development:\n\nRemember: The whole point of using VMs is isolation. When in doubt, create a new VM for risky experiments and delete it afterwards.\n\nI hope this guide helps you get started quickly and right-footed!\nAs always, please leave feedback, questions and ideas in the comments below.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ilya Lukyanov and Overflo for reviewing drafts of this post and making great suggestions. 🙏",

    "fullText": "Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, kicked off the World Economic Forum on Tuesday with a critique of capitalism.\n\nMore wealth has been created since the fall of the Berlin Wall than at any other time in human history, but it has not translated into shared prosperity, said Fink, who was appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab.\n\n\"In advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain,\" he said.\n\nFink warned that the pattern of unequal wealth distribution could repeat in the era of AI.\n\n\"Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data, and owners of infrastructure,\" said Fink.\n\n\"The open question, what happens to everyone else? If AI does to white collar workers what globalisation did to blue collar workers, we need to confront that today, directly.\"\n\nHe urged those gathered at the annual meeting in Davos to rethink how prosperity is defined and to create a \"credible plan\" for broad participation in the gains AI can deliver.\n\n\"This is going to be the test. Capitalism can evolve to turn more people into owners of growth instead of spectators watching it happen,\" said Fink.\n\nThe world's wealthiest 10% own roughly 75% of global wealth, while the poorest half hold only about 2%, according to the World Inequality Report 2026, released in December 2025 and based on data compiled by 200 researchers.\n\nFink acknowledged in his speech that the World Economic Forum has lost trust and \"feels out of step with the moment.\"\n\n\"Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone,\" Fink said, adding that the forum should be more transparent and precise about what economic success means, especially with those who don't feel represented at gatherings like Davos.\n\n\"Prosperity just isn't the growth in the aggregate. It's not just GDP. It can't be measured by GDP or the market caps of companies. It has to be judged by many people who see it, who can touch it, can feel it, and can build their own future on it,\" said Fink.\n\nFink has previously spoken about how the pandemic fueled a rethink of the US economy.\n\nIn his 2022 annual letter to shareholders, Fink said the growth of stakeholder capitalism — the idea that companies should prioritize interests beyond shareholders — was a natural evolution of how capitalism can best work to build a strong economy.\n\n\"It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term,\" he said.\n\nBlackRock, which manages some $14 trillion in assets, has been one of the loudest voices in support of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing, with Fink often highlighting climate change and sustainability in his annual letters.",

    "description": "Sid Pardeshi, a former Nvidia engineer-turned founder, said Jensen Huang inspired him to launch an AI company, and taught him about leadership.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sid Pardeshi, 32, the co-founder and CTO of a generative AI software platform. He is from India and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI thought I'd stay at Nvidia forever.\n\nThe pay, learning opportunities, and benefits made it a delight to work there. I had no reason to leave.\n\nBut Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, inspired me, and I realized I wanted to be a founder, too.\n\nIn 2022, I made the extremely hard decision to leave Nvidia and pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I resigned months before ChatGPT was released, and I believe that choice cost me double-digit millions worth of unvested company stock.\n\nI co-founded the AI company Blitzy in 2023, which has raised $4.4 million. Working under Huang for over six years taught me valuable lessons that have been instrumental to my success.\n\nI got an internship with Nvidia in India through my university, where I studied electrical and electronics engineering.\n\nWhen I started in January 2016, Nvidia wasn't a FAANG company, the acronym for the most prestigious Big Tech firms of the time: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. But as a gamer, I was familiar with the company's graphics chips, so I was deeply passionate about working there.\n\nAt the end of my six-month internship, I started a full-time position as a junior engineer at Nvidia in Pune. By 2018, I was a senior system software engineer.\n\nI didn't interact with Jensen much, but he would lead quarterly all-hands meetings, which I would attend remotely from India. He spoke about things where he was ahead of his time, like AI and virtual worlds. I was fascinated by him because I shared his love of technology.\n\nOnce, when Jensen visited staff in India, I asked him after an all-hands meeting what to focus on if I wanted to make a meaningful contribution to Nvidia and the tech space at large.\n\nHe suggested choosing one area of expertise and committing to it deeply, rather than spreading myself out across many interests. I took his guidance to heart and went deep into AI as it related to gaming.\n\nAs time passed, my ambitions evolved. I saw a lot of opportunities emerging in AI, and I wanted to become a founder like Jensen.\n\nIn 2022, at age 28, I quit my job and moved to Massachusetts with my wife and children to join an MSc and MBA program at Harvard.\n\nWhile studying, I worked for Nvidia as an intern from May 2023 to April 2024. They offered me a job that could start after I completed my master's, but starting a business was my primary goal.\n\nIn 2023, a classmate at Harvard and I founded Blitzy, which I work on full-time as the CTO. We're working on using AI to significantly automate software development work for enterprises.\n\nAt Nvidia, I noticed that Jensen nurtured and valued talent. When I was an intern in the US, he made time to meet with us. His assistant kept telling him that a very important client was calling him during the meeting. \"Let them wait,\" Jensen said. \"I'm talking to the future of Nvidia.\"\n\nLike Jensen, I want to keep the spark alive among employees, regardless of their rank. Every day, I allocate two hours to listening to team members and helping them solve problems.\n\nJensen would also follow his convictions. For example, he bet on the accelerated computing platform CUDA in the 2000s, when no one saw its true potential. Now, it's the backbone of AI training processes.\n\nSimilarly, when we first pitched to investors that we intended to use AI to build software autonomously, many didn't believe AI was advanced enough yet. But because I've been reading papers in the AI space every week for years, I trusted my convictions and that we could automate coding at Blitzy.\n\nAnother page I'm taking from his book is never ruling out the prospect of going out of business. Jensen was always concerned about the survival of Nvidia, despite it being a trillion-dollar company. I remember once a fellow intern in the US asked Jensen whether he watched movies. He said that even in the theater, he's thinking about Nvidia.\n\nAs Blitzy's CTO, I want to anticipate every challenge ahead of time. I focus on solving important technical problems and delegate everything else. I want to let people with more knowledge about other aspects of the company handle issues in their space.\n\nSimilarly, it's thought that Jensen's signature outfit, the black pants, shirt, and leather jacket, helps him minimize decision fatigue. I do wear different outfits every day, but my wife, who loves fashion, picks them out for me.\n\nAt one point, I wondered if I was being selfish by leaving Nvidia. I had a family, and needed to make the right choice, both for my career and for them.\n\nI moved to the US on a student visa, which meant my wife was my dependent and not allowed to work. She put her career on the line.\n\nYet, my wife, and my mom, encouraged me to pursue my dreams, and it would be too late now if I hadn't done it then. Once ChatGPT came out, everyone was thinking about bringing AI solutions to the market. I'm glad I already had deep knowledge and experience with AI and was ready to take advantage of the moment.\n\nFinancially, quitting Nvidia wasn't a smart decision because, based on my calculations around my compensation package, my unvested stock would be worth double-digit millions because of how the company's value has grown.\n\nI knew AI technology would progress significantly over the next few years, although I couldn't have anticipated ChatGPT coming out so fast in November 2022 — just months after I resigned. I was leaving right on the cusp of a big moment in the industry, before I was able to harvest the returns.\n\nBut I'm glad I quit when I did. If my family has what they need, working on cutting-edge stuff is more important to me than money.\n\nI got to watch as Nvidia grew from a relatively insignificant company to a trillion-dollar business, and I'm applying everything I learned to Blitzy. My mission is for Blitzy to be on the same trajectory as Nvidia, one day becoming a trillion-dollar company.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment.",

    "fullText": "Jeremy Grantham says AI is one of the biggest bubbles in history — and it's likely to tank the stock market when it bursts.\n\n\"I think it's obviously a bubble, and I think it's quite a simple story,\" the veteran investor and GMO cofounder said during the latest episode of the \"Merryn Talks Money\" podcast.\n\nGrantham compared AI to the railroad and the internet, two world-changing inventions marked by early investment bubbles which, when they popped, \"brought the economy to its knees for a year or two\" and \"everybody lost their money.\"\n\nContrary to common belief, \"bubbles don't occur when there's some crummy idea that gets touted,\" Grantham said. \"All the bubbles are associated with serious things, and the more serious, the bigger the bubble.\"\n\nGrantham emphasized the \"iron law\" that when an asset doubles in price, the return from holding it halves from that point forward.\n\n\"If you want to have the highest market in history, you will have the lowest returns in history going forward,\" he said. \"And it will happen this time. And my guess is after a while, sooner or later, the market will become a whole lot cheaper.\"\n\nGrantham, who had predicted an epic market crash four years ago, said the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2023 generated immense buzz around AI and sparked major capital outlays by companies, ultimately staving off an economic slump.\n\nThe market historian said that Big Tech companies have used their dominant market positions and influence to boost their profit margins to \"excessive levels,\" but that won't stop the bubble he sees from bursting.\n\nThe \"probabilities that AI will not bust are slim to none,\" he said. \"It meets every condition of the railroads and the Internet. It's a powerful idea that's attracted everybody's money.\"\n\n\"And so my guess is Nvidia will lead it down, and all the others will follow for a while, and then out of the ashes several of them will once again inherit the world,\" he said.\n\nGrantham also flagged institutional inertia and herd mentality as factors preventing the market from coming to its senses.\n\nPut differently, industry professionals aren't sounding the alarm on valuations out of fear that the bubble will keep growing and they'll underperform their rivals, hurt their reputations, and lose clients or even their jobs.\n\n\"They all look around nervously at each other, but they keep going,\" he said. \"As long as the music's playing, they're going to be dancing. Doesn't matter that they know the market is silly.\"\n\nGrantham is one of several high-profile investors, including Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame, who have warned AI stocks are overvalued and predicted a market downturn is coming.\n\nYet the US stock market has continued to march higher in spite of the skeptics, with the benchmark S&P 500 rising around 80% over the past five years.\n\n\"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary and tech investor Ross Gerber dismissed comparisons between the AI boom and dot-com bubble in interviews with Business Insider last fall.\n\nO'Leary said \"you actually can see the productivity and measure it on a dollar-by-dollar basis,\" while Gerber said today's valuations are warranted as AI companies have enormous growth potential and their profitability is \"just insane.\"",

    "fullText": "How do you separate the pretenders from the real deal when it comes to business AI adoption?\n\nFor Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, it comes down to building AI into processes from the ground up.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Dara Khosrowshahi said some companies are \"saying the right words\" and \"play-acting their way into a pretend transformation.\"\n\nFor example, having an AI agent complete tasks like summarizing a client pitch is the \"easy stuff\" that won't differentiate companies, he said.\n\n\"Truly changing how you work with AI, we've found it to be much harder than it sounds,\" he added.\n\nHe gave the example of using AI to improve customer service at Uber. The company had some success by having AI follow its old policies, but had a real \"breakthrough\" after its developers rebuilt everything from scratch.\n\nThat involved giving an AI agent clear underlying goals, Khosrowshahi said, such as making the customer feel good after the interaction.\n\n\"Allowing the AI actually to reason through that and throwing away all of the old policies is turning out to be the most promising way forward,\" he said.\n\nKhosrowshahi added that companies are essentially a \"bunch of policies,\" and that to get the full potential of AI, they would need to \"break down those rules and start over.\"\n\nInternally, Uber developers are using AI tools like Anysphere's Cursor and Anthropic's Claude, he added.\n\nMany companies have been ramping up their AI spending in the hope of unlocking productivity gains. A recent poll of IT professionals by RBC Capital found that 90% of respondents plan to spend more on AI this year.\n\nHowever, there are also fears that AI isn't always living up to the hype, and companies are grappling with concerns that it's eroding workers' skills.\n\nKhosrowshahi acknowledged that getting AI adoption right at a company isn't always plain sailing.\n\n\"You have to survive through a bunch of car crashes internally to do so,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Steven Bartlett said one use of AI has mattered more to his business than anything else: translating his podcast into other languages.\n\n\"There's nothing more important than what we've done for our business than translations. Period,\" Bartlett said during the \"What it Takes to Build\" panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nThe British entrepreneur and host of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast was in conversation with Jessica Lessin, the CEO of The Information, alongside Bret Taylor, formerly the co-CEO of Salesforce and CTO of Meta.\n\nBartlett said using AI tools to translate the podcasts was initially an \"expensive experiment.\" The problem he was trying to solve, he said, was reaching the untapped market of non-English speakers.\n\n\"If we're just in English, we're reaching like 10% of the world,\" Bartlett added.\n\nThere were technical challenges, too. Some languages use longer words, Bartlett said, meaning three-hour English-language conversations could become significantly longer when translated, risking the audio and video falling out of sync.\n\nTwo years ago, Bartlett announced on LinkedIn that \"The Diary of a CEO\" had hired a full-time data scientist who helped the company achieve a technological breakthrough, enabling them to use AI to translate the podcast into \"EVERY language.\"\n\nAt Davos and in the LinkedIn post, Bartlett did not elaborate on exactly how the AI translations work. Today, however, the videos show Bartlett speaking Spanish in a voice similar to his own, a shift he said had significantly expanded the podcast's reach.\n\n\"This month, 28% of my audience is Spanish,\" he said, adding that Spanish speakers now have access to interviews with some of the world's most high-profile podcast guests, citing his own interview with former first lady Michelle Obama as an example.\n\nOther guests on the podcast include former vice President Kamala Harris, Simon Cowell, and the psychologist Jordan Peterson.\n\nSpotify said in its \"2025 Wrapped\" press release in December 2025 that \"The Diary of a CEO with Steven Bartlett\" was the platform's second-most-listened-to podcast globally, behind \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" On YouTube, Bartlett's podcast channel has 14.5 million subscribers.",

It's the same with AI.\"\n\nHarari warned that even if AI development were to stop today, its long-term effects would still be impossible to grasp.\n\n\"The stone has been thrown into the pool, but it just hit the water,\" he said. \"We have no idea what waves have been created, even by the AIs that have been deployed a year or two ago.\"\n\nHarari joins a plethora of senior AI researchers and tech leaders who have expressed concerns about AI's risks, ranging from waves of job losses to human extinction.\n\nHowever, what worries him most, Harari said, is not just uncertainty — but complacency. He said many of the most powerful decision-makers shaping AI are focused on short-term incentives rather than long-term consequences.\n\n\"I'm mainly concerned about the lack of concern that we are creating the most powerful technology in human history,\" he said.\n\n\"Very smart and powerful people are worried about what their investors say in the next quarterly report,\" Harari said. \"They think in terms of a few months, or a year or two.\"\n\nAI's social consequences, he said, will play out far beyond that horizon — whether the world is ready or not.",

I'm not sure that's true of all human immigrants, but it will definitely be true of the AI immigrants,\" he said.\n\nHarari asked the audience whether they want to allow AIs to be recognized as \"legal persons\" with rights in their countries, giving them the ability to start businesses, form and preach their own religions, or befriend their children on social media.\n\n\"If you want to influence where humanity is going, you need to make a decision now,\" he said.\n\nHarari is a distinguished research fellow at the University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Alongside \"Sapiens,\" his book tracing human history across the centuries, he also released \"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow\" in 2015, where he discussed the existential threat AI poses to humanity.\n\nHarari is not the first person to refer to \"AI immigrants.\" Earlier this month, the Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang, referred to robots using the term, and said \"AI immigrants\" will help humans with work we no longer want to do, such as manufacturing jobs, AFP reported.",

He then attended Stanford Law School and later earned a Ph.D. in neoclassical social theory at a top German university.\n\n\"A very, very strong education,\" Karp said during a panel at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday.\n\nIn the age of AI, that kind of academic trajectory will doom you, Karp told Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, who was leading the discussion.\n\nAI \"will destroy humanities jobs,\" Karp said.\n\n\"You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill,\" Karp said, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market.\n\nThe Palantir CEO said it would probably be possible for those with humanities backgrounds to keep a job once they secure it, but he said technicians and those with other vocational skill sets are going to be in the highest demand.\n\nHe gave the example of people building batteries for a battery company, saying that \"they're very valuable, if not irreplaceable, because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly.\"\n\n\"There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,\" Karp told Fink.\n\nBut not all at Davos agree with the tech leader's assessment of the future of jobs.\n\nFinance executives attending the global forum have been telling Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco that liberal arts degrees might be the new hot commodity. As AI takes on more of the hard financial analysis, it is transforming the skill set executives prioritize in young recruits. Critical creative thinkers are back in the spotlight.\n\nGoogle DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei also weighed in on jobs during a joint panel on Tuesday, saying that entry-level hiring at their companies was already declining due to AI.\n\nAmodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down in both the junior and mid-levels of his company.",

    "fullText": "Worth a staggering $2.45bn, Suno is an AI music company that can create a track with just a few prompts. Why is its CEO happy to see it called ‘the Ozempic of the music industry’?\n\n‘The format of the future,” says Mikey Shulman, “is music you play with, not just play.” As the CEO and co-founder of the generative AI music company Suno, Shulman currently finds himself in the exhilarating if perhaps unenviable position of being simultaneously regarded as the architect of music’s future – and its executioner.\n\nSuno, which was founded just over two years ago, allows users to create entire songs with just a few text prompts. At the moment, you can’t prompt it with the name of a specific pop star, but asking for “stadium-level confessional pop-country” that “references past relationships” or “public rivalries” might get you a Taylor Swift-style song or thereabouts.\n\nIn June 2024, Suno became the target of litigation by record company trade body the RIAA on behalf of major labels in the US, while German collection society GEMA, representing songwriters, filed its own lawsuit the following January. Both claimed the service was training its systems on their copyrights without authorisation or licences.\n\nGen AI music services have triggered an existential crisis in the music industry. The utopian reading is that they will democratise creativity. The dystopian one is that art will be smothered by AI slop, as humans making music become surplus to requirements. (And many musicians already struggle to make a living from streaming revenues.) Dave Stewart of Eurythmics called them an “unstoppable force” and said musicians should, begrudgingly or enthusiastically, embrace them. Catherine Anne Davies, AKA the Anchoress, told me recently she believes it to be “dystopian”. Music lawyer Gregor Pryor has argued it is already killing off background music work.\n\n“I like to think of us as trying to make the next format for recorded music,” says Shulman. “The format of the future will be interactive.” What does he mean? “It should be social, meaning you’re doing it with other people. What we are doing is building the best digital version of that.”\n\nInvestors were clearly not scared off. In November, Suno raised $250m (£187m) in funding, taking its valuation to $2.45bn (£1.83bn). Gen AI is the hottest thing in Silicon Valley, with a Stanford University report saying it drew $34bn (£25bn) in private investment in 2024. But there are fears, notably at the Bank of England, that this brilliant boom can only be followed by a bitter bust. For now, however, investors believe gen AI is too big to fail. The stakes for Suno’s success are astonishingly high, especially given the recent leaking of an investor presentation suggesting the company only had 1 million paying subscribers. The standard monthly plan costs £8.25 ($10).\n\n“The thing that investors needed help realising,” says Shulman, “is how important music is in the world. Once you show them, their minds are changed and they realise that much, much more is possible.”\n\nWhen a new outside technology imposes itself on the music industry, the response typically runs from apoplexy to legal action, then negotiation and ultimately licensing. The three biggest names in gen AI music are at different stages along this trajectory. Klay got deals with all three majors before launching or training its technology on music, making it a rarity in this “Launch first, license later” world. Udio signed deals with Universal Music Group (UMG) and Warner Music Group (WMG). Suno, however, only has a deal with WMG, and legal action from the other majors is still live.\n\nShulman, now 39, was a hobbyist musician, which provided a catalyst for Suno. “I played in a lot of bands in high school and college,” he says, speaking by video from his home in the US, pointing to the bass hanging on the wall behind him. “I was OK, not great, and I was not going to be able to make a great career out of it.” He’s cautious and thoughtful when speaking, without the tang of arrogance you sometimes get from heavily hyped start-up founders.\n\nA career swerve into a physics PhD led him to Suno’s other co-founders. They wanted to build something different to heavyweight AI companies such as OpenAI, as those deal with “reasoning and automation to solve very specific problems. Music isn’t like that. There’s not a right or a wrong answer. It’s not a problem to solve.”\n\nThere remains debate about where exactly Suno sourced the music to train its systems – essentially breaking music into data strands for cataloguing – before its licensing deals were in place. “We train our models on medium- and high-quality music we can find on the open internet,” wrote Shulman in a 2024 blogpost. Suno’s initial legal defence was that this constituted fair use, and the music it drew on did not require prior permission. The record industry thought differently. “Fair use,” countered the RIAA, does not apply “when the output seeks to ‘substitute’ for the work copied.”\n\nI ask Shulman what he means by the “open internet”. There is a clear distinction between what is copyrighted (recordings are typically protected for 70 years) and what is in the public domain. “Copyright is a different thing,” he says. “I can’t get into too many specifics because there is active legal stuff going on, and also some of it is trade secrets.”\n\nCould Suno’s philosophy of “democratising” music-making be inherently anti-art? What once sprang from extraordinary human creativity now becomes ordinary. Shulman insists that, as with digital recording or sampling, this is just another example of how technology “pushes music forward”, how “new people get discovered” and “new genres get invented”.\n\nThe issue of so-called AI slop is wholly subjective, he says. “I made a really funny song with my four-year-old yesterday morning. That is ‘slop’ to you – you don’t care about it – but I love it. It’s fantastic.” He is keen to stress, meanwhile, that music generated by Suno can be extremely high quality.\n\nAnd AI-powered music is flooding streaming services: Deezer says more than a third of music delivered to it each day is AI (equal to 50,000 tracks), and 70% of streams of AI music on Deezer are fraudulent (scammers get cheaply made AI tracks on to such services, then use bots to manipulate streams at scale in order to get royalty payments, although services are increasingly wise to this). The company has started tagging AI tracks to alert users. Bandcamp recently announced that it won’t platform music “generated wholly or in substantial part by AI”.\n\nShould others follow? Shulman will say only that he doesn’t want to be “the arbiter of what happens on other platforms. There’s maybe some line to draw, but I don’t know where.”\n\nVelvet Sundown, a wholly AI “act”, released their debut album and a follow-up last summer. The 70s-styled rock band generated millions of streams, but it was a short-lived phenomenon. “I don’t know exactly what their strategy was,” Shulman says of Velvet Sundown. “It was all a bit of a goof. I think that’s why it was a flash in the pan.”\n\nSome AI-powered tracks have staying power, though. Following allegations it used Suno to clone Jorja Smith’s voice, I Run, by Haven, was excluded from the UK charts, but a version re-recorded by Kaitlin Aragon, a human singer, was chart-eligible and went Top 10. Into the Blue by Sienna Rose, who is widely suspected to be an AI act, recently made the Top 10 on Spotify’s Viral 50 Global chart. And the track Jag Vet, Du Är Inte Min is one of the biggest of the year so far in Sweden, although it has been booted out of the country’s charts for being “mainly AI-generated”.\n\nMore concerning was Suno being used last year to create tracks that the Anti-Defamation League said glorified Adolf Hitler, deployed racist slurs and talked of “white power”. Shulman says: “It was three songs that had a combined 10 plays. It was a very small thing. Unfortunately, drawing attention to it made it worse.” He says Suno has developed more rigorous safeguards to stop similar things happening in the future.\n\nSuno is keen for its deal with WMG to be seen as proof that gen AI companies can partner in mutually beneficial ways. Did the $1.5bn (£1.1bn) that AI company Anthropic paid to the book industry in September to settle claims its AI was trained on pirated copies spook Suno to get deals done swiftly? “We didn’t pay all that much attention to that,” says Shulman. “There’s a lot more to do together than fighting one another. And we intend, with this Warner partnership, to show that very strongly.”\n\nBut questions do persist about the WMG deal. Did the label insist on changes to the service? Were payments made to cover past use of its music in Suno’s training? Did WMG get equity in Suno? Shulman won’t reply, saying only that it is “a little early” to share such information, possibly fearful of compromising pending licensing deals.\n\nAgreements with the majors are one thing, but wooing artists is another. The majors insist they will only have their music used if they opt into deals. But if only a tiny percentage do – never mind their name, image and likeness rights – this will surely compromise results.\n\nIn his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell popularised “the 10,000-hour rule”, suggesting that this is the amount of practise time an artist needs to achieve any sort of mastery. Will the likes of Suno change this? “I think people will [still] have to spend 10,000 hours,” says Shulman. “They may be doing different things and practising different skills, but they will certainly need to spend 10,000 hours to make the best music in the world.”\n\nAs part of its charm offensive, Suno signed up US producer Timbaland as a strategic advisor, but he had to make a public apology after he took a track by producer K Fresh without permission and, Fresh alleged, “uploaded it into Suno’s AI platform, and released an unauthorised AI remix”.\n\nNevertheless, Shulman says the musicians he talks to about Suno see it as an important new creative tool and songwriting aid. He had previously told the 20VC podcast: “I think the majority of people don’t enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.” This does not mean musicians hate the creative process in toto, but they are appreciative of tools that can remove at least some of the grunt work.\n\nThey just see it as a dirty secret, he suggests now. “When you get people one-on-one, they’re just more comfortable admitting it. It was described to me that we’re the Ozempic of the music industry – everybody is on it and nobody wants to talk about it.”\n\nThe fear, of course, is that by putting music on Ozempic, it wastes away to nothing.",

    "description": "EY and KPMG executives at Davos said that AI security is a big risk, especially AI agents and, looking ahead, quantum computing.",
    "fullText": "I'm reporting from Davos, Switzerland, where thousands of business leaders and politicians have arrived at the World Economic Forum to shake hands, talk shop, and maybe even eke out a few ski runs.\n\nSome executives I've spoken to this week had some big concerns about AI, but none of them had anything to do with a potential bubble.\n\nRaj Sharma, EY's global managing partner of growth and innovation, said there's not enough talk about AI security — specifically, the management of AI agents and their lifecycle.\n\n\"It has access to your data. It has no name, so there is no identity or anything associated with that,\" Sharma said.\n\nCompare that to humans, where every computer system and piece of data they touch is often tracked.\n\n\"We have to build industrial-level security for AI agents in that particular area. To me, that's still a gap that somebody needs to work on,\" Sharma said. \"Everybody's talking a good game. But if you look under the covers, it's still not mature.\"\n\n\"That keeps me up at night,\" Sharma added.\n\nHe's not alone. Tim Walsh, the CEO of KPMG US, told me the biggest issue he talks to CEOs about regularly is cyber risk, specifically related to AI.\n\nAI agents are the latest twist in executives' ongoing concerns over cybersecurity, and it's proving to be an incredibly challenging problem. Somewhat ironically, the only way to fight the threat is with … more AI.\n\nIn some cases, the risk has gotten so big that it's shifting timelines on companies' AI plans.\n\n\"It's not that they're not moving forward, but they are taking a moment to make sure that their environment is secure, and perhaps even leaving data on-prem a little bit longer so they're confident that got their data security in place,\" Walsh told me.\n\nWalsh said another \"real concern\" is the threat of quantum computing from a security perspective.\n\nWhile he acknowledged we're still a few years out from the tech being fully developed, its power is incredible.\n\n\"Quantum breaks everything,\" Walsh said. \"I mean, all encryption.\"\n\nThat's led companies to look at their systems and reencrypting things, no easy task.\n\n\"We're spending quite a bit of time as well, helping companies think through: What does that look like? How do you structure it? How long will it take?\" Walsh said.",

    "title": "Citi has quietly built a 4,000-person internal AI workforce",
    "description": "Around 4,000 employees globally have volunteered to fan out across their business units as \"AI accelerators.\"",
    "fullText": "At Citi, some of the people leading the Wall Street bank's AI push aren't part of a specialized tech team. They're colleagues a few desks over.\n\nThose employees are part of the bank's AI Champions and Accelerators program, which got off the ground in early 2024 and now counts around 4,000 people among its ranks of voluntary AI helpers. At its most basic level, the program aims to have the designated \"accelerators\" help colleagues within their business units leverage and understand AI tools. The program's approximately 25-30 \"champions\" help lead the accelerators in their line of business.\n\nCiti's program is one of many ways banks are racing to adopt AI, from offering engineers capstone-style courses to luring top tech talent by promising a seat at powerful managerial tables. To date, Citi's AI tools are available in 84 countries for 182,000 employees. Adoption of the firm's proprietary tools is above 70%, Citi CEO Jane Fraser told analysts during the bank's earnings call last week.\n\nAnd it's clear that she has high expectations for all employees, including accelerators. In a January memo, she told staff she expected \"a more disciplined, more confident\" workforce in 2026, and that AI will likely \"reshape how work gets done.\"\n\nAmong the bank's range of initiatives to encourage AI uptake, the accelerators and champions model is uniquely embedded throughout teams and based on peer-to-peer interactions, said Carey Ryan, one of the initiative's leaders and the chief of staff for the technology organization.\n\n\"A small central team would never be able to reach where we are now,\" Ryan said.\n\nTech leaders at Citi came up with the program when brainstorming how to engage a wider swath of its population with AI, Ryan said. Originally, her team only planned to have 2,500 accelerators, but they saw more interest than expected and still maintain a waitlist for the program.\n\nWhile colleagues nominate champions for the position, anyone can volunteer to be an accelerator. The only requirement is being excited about AI, Ryan said.\n\nJosh Goldsmith is the AI champion for internal audit, where he's also the head of digital solutions and innovation. He's been a part of the program since its inception, and said that \"demystifying AI\" is among its greatest successes so far.\n\n\"It's a lot different when you hear from a colleague as to how you can leverage these tools, as opposed to having someone who's, let's say, a technologist trying to push this,\" he said. \"To be able to see someone put it in action: 'Hey, they can do it! I'm just like them, I can do it as well.'\"\n\nRyan also said that the peer-to-peer approach is part of what makes the initiative work, since a more general team couldn't understand all of the job-specific AI use cases across the bank. She added that accelerators have helped host more than 100 Citi AI Days, where they hold demonstrations and answer questions.\n\nAccelerators meet with their cohorts two times each month to participate in demos, learn about new tools, get training, or talk about their recent work. Goldsmith oversees around 50 participants; between attending their meetings and his own bi-monthly champion meetings, he said he devotes between three and five hours to the program each week, on top of his usual job.\n\nThe program members can also opt into trainings on topics including agentic AI to earn visual \"AI badges,\" which they can include in their email signatures. There are no specific engagement metrics, though, and people can drop out of the program if it becomes too demanding a time commitment.\n\n\"One accelerator might have five interactions, and maybe they're five small interactions,\" Ryan said. \"Another accelerator might have one really big interaction, where they're doing something with hundreds of people.\"\n\nAmong the AI peer coaches in internal audit, between 70% and 80% have stayed in the program, Goldsmith said. He added that, despite the extra hours, participating has given him a broader perspective on AI across Citi, and \"a clear vision in terms of what's coming next.\"\n\nFor Carey, there's something of a symbiotic relationship between program leads, participants, and the rest of the bank. Accelerators will explain what they're hearing from their lines of business — where people are struggling, what they might need — as Citi continues to fine-tune its approach to AI. They have, for example, helped Citi tweak AI tools, suggesting enhancements like adding notifications and allowing employees to upload larger files.\n\n\"It's an important conduit for feedback back in,\" she said.",

As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump on Sunday had sent messages to Norway's leader, saying the US requires \"Complete and Total Control of Greenland.\" Greenland is a semi-autonomous Danish territory.\n\nGovernments keep changing their rules on EVs, says BYD executive vice president Stella Li, and that sets carmakers back.\n\nLi said in a panel at Davos that when countries go \"back and forth\" on their EV policy, it creates a pattern that \"will confuse manufacturers.\" In contrast, when governments give a \"very clear line,\" automakers can focus on execution, Li said.\n\nBessent, speaking to the press on Tuesday morning, urged calm amid President Donald Trump's latest slate of trade tariffs on Greenland.\n\n\"You say: 'If there is a protracted trade war.'

While still a few years out, its power is undeniable.\n\n\"Quantum breaks everything,\" Walsh said. \"I mean, all encryption.\"\n\n\"M&A is high on the agenda,\" said Sharon Marcil, North America chair at BCG. \"We're hearing it from so many CEOs.\" She pointed to a strong stock market and an overall tilt in Washington toward deregulation and robust business activity.\n\nWinston Weinberg, CEO and cofounder of the legal AI startup Harvey, echoes the sentiment, saying he is hearing that 2026 will be an \"insane\" year for dealmaking.

I certainly wouldn't be leading it if I didn't. But it's also obvious that the world now places far less trust in us to help shape what comes next.\"\n\nFink said the capitalism now faces a big test: Whether it can \"evolve to turn more people into owners of growth, instead of spectators watching it happen.\"\n\n\"And that kind of change is hard. Especially in a world of competing ideologies and assumptions about how the system should work,\" he said.\n\nFink's remarks ground what is expected to be a monumental week, in which deals are made and new alliances are forged amid turmoil in the wider political sphere.",

It is being used to automate administrative tasks or even help with core operations, including processing insurance claims and assessing customers’ credit-worthiness.\n\nBut the UK has failed to develop any specific laws or regulations to govern their use of AI, with the FCA and Bank of England claiming general rules are sufficient to ensure positive outcomes for consumers. That means businesses have to determine how existing guidelines apply to AI, leaving MPs worried this could put consumers and financial stability at risk.\n\n“It is the responsibility of the Bank of England, the FCA and the government to ensure the safety mechanisms within the system keeps pace,” said Meg Hillier, chair of the Treasury committee. “Based on the evidence I’ve seen, I do not feel confident that our financial system is prepared if there was a major AI-related incident and that is worrying.”\n\nThe report flagged a lack of transparency around how AI could influence financial decisions, potentially affecting vulnerable consumers’ access to loans or insurance. It said it was also unclear whether data providers, tech developers or financial firms would be held responsible when things went wrong.\n\nMPs said AI also increased the likelihood of fraud, and the dissemination of unregulated and misleading financial advice.\n\nIn terms of financial stability, MPs found that rising AI use increased firms’ cybersecurity risks, and left them overly reliant on a small number of US tech companies, such as Google, for essential services. Its uptake could also amplify “herd behaviour”, with businesses making similar financial decisions during economic shocks and “risking a financial crisis”.\n\nThe Treasury committee is now urging regulators to take action, including the launch of new stress tests that would assess the City’s readiness for AI-driven market shocks. MPs also want the FCA to publish “practical guidance” by the end of the year, clarifying how consumer protection rules apply to AI use, and who would be held accountable if consumers suffer any harm.\n\n“By taking a wait-and-see approach to AI in financial services, the three authorities are exposing consumers and the financial system to potentially serious harm”, the report said.\n\nThe FCA said it had already “undertaken extensive work to ensure firms are able to use AI in a safe and responsible way”, but would review the report’s findings “carefully”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: “We’ve been clear that we will strike the right balance between managing the risks posed by AI and unlocking its huge potential.”\n\nThey added that this involved working with regulators to “strengthen our approach as the technology evolves”, and appointing new “AI champions” covering financial services “to ensure we seize the opportunities it presents in a safe and responsible way”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Bank of England said it had “already taken active steps to assess AI-related risks and reinforce the resilience of the financial system, including publishing a detailed risk assessment and highlighting the potential implications of a sharp fall in AI-affected asset prices. We will consider the committee’s recommendations carefully and will respond in full in due course.”",

    "description": "A real-world comparison of GPT-5.2-Codex (high), Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro on two coding tasks, focusing on quality, speed, and cost.",
    "fullText": "If you want a quick take: Claude Opus 4.5 was the most consistent, GPT-5.2-codex (high) delivered strong code with slower turnaround, and Gemini 3 Pro was the most efficient but less polished.\n\nIf you want a quick take, here’s how the three models performed in our tests:\n\n💡 If you want the safest pick for real “ship a feature in a big repo” work, Opus 4.5 felt the most reliable in my runs. If you care about speed and cost and you’re okay polishing UI yourself, Gemini 3 Pro is a solid bet.\n\nOkay, so right now the WebDev leaderboard on LMArena is basically owned by the big three: Claude Opus 4.5 from Anthropic, GPT-5.2-codex (high) from OpenAI, and finally everybody's favorite, Gemini 3 Pro from Google.\n\nSo, I grabbed these three and put them into the same existing project (over 8K stars and 50K+ LOC) and asked them to build a couple of real features like a normal dev would.\n\nSame repo. Same prompts. Same constraints.\n\nFor each task, I took the best result out of three runs per model to keep things fair.\n\nThen I compared what they actually did: code quality, how much hand-holding they needed, and whether the feature even worked in the end.\n\n⚠️ NOTE: Don't take the result of this test as a hard rule. This is just a small set of real-world coding tasks that shows how each model did for me in that exact setup and gives you an overview of the difference in the top 3 models' performance in the same tasks.\n\nFor the test, we will use the following CLI coding agents:\n\nHere’s the repo used for the entire test: iib0011/omni-tools\n\nWe will check the models on two different tasks:\n\nEach model is asked to create a global action menu that opens with a keyboard shortcut. This feature expands on the current search by adding actions, global state, and keyboard navigation. This task checks how well the model understands current UX patterns and avoids repetition without breaking what's already in place.\n\nEach model had to add real usage tracking across the app, persist it locally, and then build an analytics dashboard that shows things like the most used tools, recent activity, and basic filters.\n\nWe’ll compare code quality, token usage, cost, and time to complete the build.\n\n💡 NOTE: I will share the source code changes for each task by each model in a .patch file. This way, you can easily view them on your local system by cloning the repository and applying the patch file using git apply <path_file_name>. This method makes sharing changes easier.\n\nThe task is simple: all models start from the same base commit and then follow the same prompt to build what is asked in the prompt.\n\nAnd obviously, as mentioned, I will evaluate the response from the model from the \"Best of 3.\"\n\nLet's start off the test with something interesting:\n\nGPT-5.2 handled this surprisingly well. The implementation was solid end to end, and it basically one-shotted the entire feature set, including i18n support, without needing multiple correction passes.\n\nThat said, it did take a bit longer than some other models (~20 minutes), which is expected since reasoning was explicitly set to high. The model spends more time thinking through architecture, naming, and edge cases rather than rushing to output code. The trade-off felt worth it here.\n\nThe token usage was noticeably higher due to the reasoning set to high, but the output code reflected that.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\n💡 NOTE: I ran the exact same prompt with the same model using the default (medium) reasoning level. The difference was honestly massive. With reasoning set to high, the quality of the code, structure, and pretty much everything jumps by miles. It’s not even a fair comparison.\n\nClaude went all in and prepared a ton of different strategies. At the start, it did run into build issues, but it kept running the build until it was able to fix all the build and lint issues.\n\nThe entire run took me about 7 minutes 50 seconds, which is the fastest among the models for this test. The features all worked as asked, and obviously, the UI looked super nice and exactly how I expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nTo be honest, this exceeded my expectations; even the i18n texts are added and displayed in the UI just as expected. Absolute cinema!\n\nGemini 3 got it working, but it's clearly not on the same level as GPT-5.2 High or Claude Opus 4.5. The UI it built is fine and totally usable, but it feels a bit barebones, and you don't get many choices in the palette compared to the other two.\n\nOne clear miss is that language switching does not show up inside the action palette at all, which makes the i18n support feel incomplete even though translations technically exist.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 lands in a very clear third place here. It works, the UI looks fine, and nothing is completely broken, but compared to the depth, completeness, and polish of GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5, it feels behind.\n\nThis test is a step up from the action palette.\n\nYou can find the prompt I've used here: Prompt\n\nGPT-5.2 absolutely nailed this one.\n\nThe final result turned out amazing. Tool usage tracking works exactly as expected, data persists correctly, and the dashboard feels like a real product feature. Most used tools, recent usage, filters, everything just works.\n\nOne really nice touch is that it also wired analytics-related actions into the Action Palette from Test 1.\n\nIt did take a bit longer than the first test, around 26 minutes, but again, that’s the trade-off with high reasoning. You can tell the model spent time thinking through data modeling, reuse, and avoiding duplicated logic. Totally worth it here.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\nGPT-5.2 High continues to be slow but extremely powerful, and for a task like this, that’s a very good trade.\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 did great here as well.\n\nThe final implementation works end to end, and honestly, from a pure UI and feature standpoint, it’s hard to tell the difference between this and GPT-5.2 High. The dashboard looks clean, the data makes sense, and the filters work as expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nGemini 3 Pro gets the job done, but it clearly takes a more minimal approach compared to GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\nThat said, the overall experience feels very bare minimum. The UI is functional but plain, and the dashboard lacks the polish and depth you get from the other two models.\n\nAlso, it didn't quite add the button to view the analytics right in the action palette, similar to the other two models.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 Pro remains efficient and reliable, but in a comparison like this, efficiency alone is not enough. 🤷‍♂️\n\nAt least from this test, I can conclude that the models are now pretty much able to one-shot a decent complex work, at least from what I tested.\n\nStill, there have been times when the models mess up so badly that if I were to go ahead and fix the problems one by one, it would take me nearly the same time as building it from scratch.\n\nIf I compare the results across models, Opus 4.5 definitely takes the crown. But I still don’t think we’re anywhere close to relying on it for real, big production projects. The recent improvements are honestly insane, but the results still don’t fully back them up. 🥴\n\nFor now, I think these models are great for refactoring, planning, and helping you move faster. But if you solely rely on their generated code, the codebase just won’t hold up long term.\n\nI don't see any of these recent models as “use it and ship it” for \"production,\" in a project with millions of lines of code, at least not in the way people hype it up.\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments.\n\nSoftware and DevOps engineer with 4+ years of experience building for the web and cloud, mainly with TypeScript, Python, Go, Docker, and Kubernetes.

    "description": "\"What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don't really care,\" Khosla said.",
    "fullText": "Vinod Khosla has his eye on one AI metric, and it's not stock prices.\n\nOn an episode of OpenAI's podcast released on Monday, the famed venture capitalist shared how he's gauging whether we're in an AI bubble — or not.\n\n\"People equate bubble to stock prices, which has nothing to do with anything other than fear and greed among investors,\" he said. \"So I always look at, bubbles should be measured by the number of API calls.\"\n\nAPI, or Application Programming Interface calls, refer to the process in which one software application sends a message to another application to request data or to trigger an action. They are a common indicator of digital tools' use, especially with the rise of AI agents. High API calls can also be a mark of a poor or inefficient product.\n\nKhosla said the bubble shouldn't be called \"by what happened to stock prices because somebody got overexcited or underexcited and in one day they can go from loving Nvidia to hating Nvidia because it's overvalued.\"\n\nThe 70-year-old VC, whose notable investments include OpenAI, DoorDash, and Block, compared the AI bubble to the dot-com bubble. He said he looked out for internet traffic as a metric during the 1990s, and with AI bubble concerns, that benchmark is now API calls.\n\n\"If that's your fundamental metric of what's the real use of your AI, usefulness of AI, demand for AI, you're not going to see a bubble in API calls,\" he said. \"What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don't really care. I think it's mostly irrelevant.\"\n\nConcerns that the AI industry is overvalued because of massive investments became one of the buzziest themes in the second half of 2025. The phrase \"AI bubble\" appeared in 42 earnings calls and investor conference transcripts between October and December — a 740% increase from the previous quarter, according to an AlphaSense analysis.\n\nTop business leaders remain split about whether the bubble is about to burst.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates said AI has extremely high value, but it's still in a bubble.\n\n\"But you have a frenzy,\" Gates told CNBC in late October. \"And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.\"\n\nEarlier this month, \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a Substack exchange.\n\nBurry wrote that companies, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting trillions on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete. He added that their spending has \"no clear path to utilization by the real economy.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed concerns of a bubble. His company became the world's first $5 trillion market cap company in October on the back of the AI boom.\n\nIn an October Bloomberg TV appearance, Huang said that instead of overspeculation, AI is part of a transition from an old way of computing.\n\n\"We also know that AI has become good enough because of reasoning capability, and research capability, its ability to think — it's now generating tokens and intelligence that is worth paying for,\" Huang said.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI's chief financial officer is musing about new ways the company could make money beyond ChatGPT subscriptions.\n\nIn an episode of \"The OpenAI Podcast\" published Monday, Sarah Friar floated the idea of \"licensing models,\" in which the company could take a share of downstream sales if a customer's product takes off.\n\n\"Let's say in drug discovery, if we licensed our technology, you have a breakthrough. The drug takes off, and we get a licensed portion of all its sales,\" Friar said.\n\n\"It's great alignment for us with our customer,\" she added.\n\nFriar's comments offer a glimpse of how OpenAI is thinking about funding its compute-hungry ambitions as it broadens its business model.\n\nFriar said OpenAI began with a single subscription after launching ChatGPT, but has since expanded to multiple price points, SaaS-style enterprise pricing, and credit-based pricing for customers who \"want to pay more to get more.\"\n\nAs OpenAI looks at commerce and ads, Friar said the model should always give the best answer, not a sponsored one, and maintain an ad-free tier.\n\nLast week, OpenAI announced it is preparing to test ads in ChatGPT, as the company seeks to boost revenue while facing spending commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the coming years.\n\nThe move marks a shift from the company's earlier stance. Less than two years ago, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described advertising as a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nSince then, Altman's tone has evolved alongside OpenAI's expansion and ballooning compute costs. In June, he said on OpenAI's podcast that he wasn't \"totally against\" advertising, but emphasized that it would need to be handled carefully.\n\nOpenAI also completed its restructuring in October, shifting the company toward a more traditional for-profit structure — a change Altman said would make it easier to raise capital going forward.",

Also, Tesla has lined up Samsung Electronics for U.S.-based chip manufacturing.\n\nIt’s pretty easy to get lost in the AI jargon, so it’s important to be clear about things at each step about what’s happening.\n\nThe A15 and A16 move is essentially about “inference at the edge”.

    "description": "F5's Guardrails blocks prompts that attempt jailbreaks or injection attacks, for example, while its AI Red Team automates vulnerability discovery in AI systems.",
    "fullText": "Network and security teams managing enterprise applications face two emerging challenges: AI security and multi-cloud operations. F5 is addressing both with product announcements that extend its Application Delivery and Security Platform into AI runtime protection and multicloud managed services.\n\nThe company announced F5 AI Guardrails and F5 AI Red Team on January 14, following the January 13 launch of F5 NGINXaaS for Google Cloud. The AI security products came through F5’s acquisition of CalypsoAI in September 2025. NGINXaaS is a web-server-as-a-service offering that is now expanding beyond its initial Azure deployment in May 2025, with AWS support in development.\n\n“We’ve never been a walled garden—we believe in meeting customers where they are and integrating with their existing stack, whether that stack is F5 products or other vendors,” Shawn Wormke, senior vice president of product management at F5, told Network World.\n\nAI security requires a different approach than traditional network defenses. Web application firewalls (WAF) inspect HTTP requests for SQL injection. Intrusion detection systems analyze packet headers for known attack signatures. These tools operate at the packet and protocol level.\n\nAI systems present a different attack surface. A malicious prompt that tricks a model into revealing training data looks like legitimate traffic at the network layer. Wormke explained that AI security is another layer of security just like WAF. Where it differs is that traditional security threats live in packets, whereas AI threats live in the words, prompts and context exchanged between users, models and agents.\n\n“AI models can be manipulated into exposing sensitive data or generating harmful outputs impacting brand reputation and trust,” he said. “So you need a solution that’s purpose-built to secure and govern these new threats like prompt injection, new jailbreak techniques and model distillation.”\n\nF5 AI Guardrails deploys as a proxy between users and AI models. Wormke describes it as being inserted as a proxy layer at the “front door” of AI interaction, between AI applications, users and agents. It intercepts prompts before they reach the model and analyzes outputs before they return to users. The system applies policy rules to actual content rather than transport-layer characteristics.\n\nPolicy enforcement covers several categories. Guardrails blocks prompts that attempt jailbreaks or injection attacks, scans outputs for sensitive data patterns, and enforces compliance requirements including GDPR and the EU AI Act.\n\nAI Red Team automates adversarial testing against AI systems. It maintains a database of attack techniques that grows by 10,000 entries monthly as researchers discover new vulnerabilities.\n\nResults from Red Team testing feed directly into Guardrails policies. When Red Team discovers a vulnerability pattern, security teams create corresponding guardrails to block similar attacks in production.\n\n“It’s a very synergistic pairing wherein with AI Red Team you can send a team of agents to discover vulnerabilities in AI systems, and with AI Guardrails you can transform those insights into threat-informed defenses,” Wormke said.\n\nF5 acquired NGINX back in 2019 and has been expanding the capabilities of the web server platform ever since.\n\nNGINXaaS first became generally available on Microsoft Azure in 2023 and is now coming to Google Cloud. The Google Cloud expansion addresses customer demand for consistent tooling across cloud providers. “Customers have been asking for NGINXaaS across additional cloud platforms,” Wormke said. “Google Cloud was the next and now we are working with AWS.”\n\nThe service combines Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing with security and observability, available through Google Cloud Marketplace.\n\n“NGINXaaS is built on the pedigree of the enterprise version of NGINX, NGINX Plus,” Wormke said. “It has open-source roots and will support your open-source configurations, but it gives you all the capabilities of commercial NGINX Plus.”\n\nWormke noted that those capabilities include visibility into over 240 deep application metrics, intelligent load balancing algorithms, traffic optimization, in-memory state sharing, AuthN & AuthZ and it’s  ready to go F5 WAF for NGINX.\n\nThe NGINX project celebrated its 20th anniversary in October 2024 and is one of the most widely used web server and application delivery technologies. Beyond just the core web server, it is also used as a load balancer, reverse proxy, programmability layer, API Gateway, Ingress Controller and Kubernetes Gateway.\n\n“It continues to power a significant portion of the internet and API traffic today,” Wormke said. “It is far more than the web server that many think open-source NGINX is.”\n\nF5 continues development on both open-source NGINX and commercial versions. For instance, he noted that F5 recently announced Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) support for enhanced privacy as well as support for PQC (Post Quantum Cryptography). Looking forward, AI is going to play a big role in the future direction.\n\n“We are evolving toward AI-aware application delivery and security to enable secure, scalable and performant, agentic AI operations,” he said.",

    "title": "Goldman Sachs says watch these 5 warnings from the dot-com bubble to know if the AI craze is peaking",
    "description": "The stock market flashed five warning signs before the dot-com bubble popped in the early 2000s, strategists at Goldman Sachs said.",
    "fullText": "Markets are worried about shades of 1999 in today's tech-investing landscape, and while there's a lot of debate about whether AI is a bubble, there are a few signals from history that show what, specifically, investors should be looking out for.\n\nStrategists at Goldman Sachs said they believe the market's AI frenzy risks mirroring the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s.\n\nStocks don't look like they're in their 1999 moment yet, Dominic Wilson, a senior advisor on the bank's global markets research team, and Vickie Chang, a macro research strategist, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. But the risks that the AI boom will look a lot like the 2000s era craze appear to be growing, they said.\n\n\"We see a growing risk that the imbalances that built up in the 1990s will become more visible as the AI investment boom extends. There have been echoes of the inflection point in the 1990s boom lately,\" the bank wrote, adding that the AI trade now looked the way tech stocks did in 1997, several years before the bubble burst.\n\nWilson and Chang flagged several warning signs leading up to the dot-com crash in the early 2000s that investors should be on the lookout for.\n\nInvestment spending on tech equipment and software rose to \"unusually high levels\" in the 90s. That peaked in 2000, when non-residential investment in the telecom and tech sector rose to around 15% of US GDP.\n\nInvestment spending began to tumble in the months leading up to the dot-com crash, per Goldman's analysis.\n\n\"Highly valued asset prices thus had significant consequences for real spending decisions,\" the strategists said.\n\nInvestors have been growing wary of mega-cap tech firms' spending spree on AI this year. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion on capex in 2025.\n\nCorporate profits reached a peak around 1997 before beginning to decline.\n\n\"Profitability peaked well before the boom ended,\" Wilson and Chang wrote. \"While reported profit margins were more robust, declining profitability in the macro data in the later years of the boom came alongside accelerating equity prices.\"\n\nCorporate profits look strong at the moment. The blended net profit margin in the S&P 500 for the third quarter is around 13.1%, above the five-year average of 12.1%, according to FactSet.\n\nCompanies grew increasingly indebted in the lead-up to the dot-com crash. Corporate debt as a percentage of profits peaked in 2001, right as the bubble was bursting, Goldman's analysis shows.\n\n\"The combination of rising investment and falling profitability pushed the corporate sector financial balance — the difference between savings and investment — into deficit,\" the strategists said.\n\nSome of mega-cap tech firms' spending on AI has been funded debt. Meta, for instance, raised $30 billion in bonds in late October as it doubled down on its AI spending plans.\n\nMost firms today, though, look like they're financing capex with free cash flow, Goldman added. The percentage of corporate debt relative to profits also looks significantly lower than it did at the peak of the internet bubble.\n\nThe Fed was in the midst of its rate-cutting cycle in the late 90s, one factor that helped juice the stock market.\n\n\"Lower rates and capital inflows added fuel to the equity market,\" Goldman wrote.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its October policy meeting. Investors are expecting the central bank to issue another 25 basis-point cut in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nOther market pros, like Ray Dalio, have warned that the Fed's easing cycle could help inflate a bubble in markets.\n\nIn the 1990s, these warning signs appeared at least two years before the dot-com bubble actually burst, Wilson and Chang said, adding that they believed the AI trade still had room to run.\n\nThis story was originally published in November 2025.",

    "fullText": "Investor enthusiasm over the prospects of artificial intelligence are expected to drive Big Tech stocks in particular this year — but Wall Street also expects gains in other sectors.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Industrials (XLI), Materials (XLB), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Staples (XLP) have outperformed the broader market, with all of those sectors up 5.5% or more.\n\nEven the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index has risen 8% since the start of the year, outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which is up more than 1% during the same period.\n\n\"It's a broadening playbook,\" Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\nStoltzfus' price target for the S&P 500 this year is the most bullish on Wall Street at 8,100, with other analysts expecting double-digit percentage gains taking the benchmark index toward 7,500 or 7,600.\n\n\"What we're seeing is a rotation, and it's not necessarily away from technology, as we would think,\" he added. \"It's some profit taking to broaden one's exposure and diversification.\"\n\nKeith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, agrees. His firm's strategy has been to go Overweight on industrials, while also upgrading healthcare and energy stocks.\n\n\"I wouldn't get rid of the tech at this point. I think there are more opportunities beyond tech, is the way I would think about it,\" Lerner said.\n\nStrategists are optimistic given what they've seen with earnings, which kicked off last week.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) showed one of the strongest years for the investment banking business since the pandemic, sending shares of those firms higher.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s (TSM) strong results also gave a lift to semiconductor stocks and fueled optimism that the AI cycle is only accelerating\n\nShares of memory chipmaker Micron (MU) and equipment makers ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) are all up at least 25% year-to-date.\n\nPerformance in the AI chip space so far underscores that artificial intelligence and tech are expected to lead the market again this year as wider adoption across enterprises takes hold.\n\n\"As we wait for that to unfold, I think tech, especially big tech and AI as a theme, is the core of this market,\" Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna said. \"Our core conviction is that it'll sustain this year, even though the level of scrutiny around that [AI] has decidedly increased.\"\n\nThe test will be whether software stocks, facing disruption from artificial intelligence, can find their footing.

If AI removes too much friction from life — and too many traditional sources of struggle, work, and responsibility — humans may find themselves unmoored.\n\n\"The one thing with humans that's a little messed up,\" he said, is that if progress pushes people \"too far away from some grounded purpose,\" including shared beliefs or spiritual anchors, they may \"attach onto some dumb stuff.\"\n\nHorowitz's prediction echoes those voiced by other AI leaders.\n\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and xAI, has said AI could usher in a future of \"universal high income,\" where work becomes optional, and abundance eliminates poverty, while Bill Gates, the Microsoft cofounder, has suggested AI may make radically shorter workweeks possible.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have both acknowledged risks to meaning in a post-work world but remain optimistic that humans will adapt and find new sources of fulfillment.\n\nBeyond Silicon Valley's more optimistic visions, figures like Geoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist often called the \"godfather of AI,\" Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley, investor Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management, and AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky have warned of outcomes ranging from mass job losses and the erosion of meaning at work to, in the most extreme cases, threats to humanity's survival.",

    "fullText": "It rarely hurts to have Batman on your side. Michael Burry may have the next thing after Ben Affleck revealed he's also skeptical of the AI boom.\n\nThe Hollywood star, speaking on the latest episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast, echoed the investor's skepticism of grand claims around AI and Big Tech's massive investments in the nascent tech.\n\n\"I think a lot of that rhetoric comes from people who are trying to justify valuations around companies, where they go: 'We're going to change everything in two years, there's going to be no more work,'\" Affleck said.\n\n\"Well, the reason they're saying that is because they need to ascribe a valuation for investment that can warrant the capex spend they're going to make on these data centers,\" he added.\n\nThe \"Justice League\" and \"Gone Girl\" actor said that historical adoption of new technologies has been \"slow\" and incremental.\"\n\nHe said that tech companies are trying to justify their huge outlays by promising they'll enable new AI models that will blow away existing ones — but in reality, each subsequent model is only moderately better and requires far more electricity and data to run.\n\n\"Ben Affleck is clearly a smart guy,\" Burry wrote in a weekend post on X. \"So this does not surprise me. It sounds familiar and on point.\"\n\nBen Affleck is clearly a smart guy. So this does not surprise me. It sounds familiar and on point. Delivered much better than I ever could. https://t.co/X1VvE9yX2N\n\nAffleck backed up Burry's critique of AI's value on the podcast. He said the writing of today's AI chatbots is \"really shitty\" and \"not reliable.\"\n\n\"I just can't stand to see what it writes,\" said Affleck, who cowrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for \"Good Will Hunting\" and directed, produced, and starred in Best Picture winner \"Argo.\"\n\nHe predicted that filmmakers would use AI as a tool to save time and money — similar to visual effects — but it probably won't \"write anything meaningful\" or make entire movies.\n\nAffleck said that most AI users are using chatbots as virtual companions, so \"there's no work, there's no productivity, there's no value to it.\"\n\nHe also cast doubt on the social value of people engaging with AI friends who are \"telling you that you're great and listening to everything you say and being sycophantic.\"\n\nBurry has struck a similar tone on AI in recent weeks. He's best known for his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was immortalized in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short.\" Christian Bale, Affleck's predecessor as Batman, portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nAfter more than two years of virtual silence, Burry returned to X late last year with a flurry of warnings about a dangerous AI bubble. He also closed his hedge fund to outside cash, shifting his focus to writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nBurry's central thesis is that AI stocks are overvalued. He's said they're overinvesting in microchips and data centers that will quickly become outdated, to power a tech that will become commoditized and won't yield a return for them, paving the way for large writedowns and sharp stock declines in the future.\n\nHe recently posted on X that \"return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off.\"",

    "description": "The rise of AI-native tools such as Claude Code is transforming the value and impact of  designers and taste-makers in Silicon Valley.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, AI is fueling the rise of the star individual contributor.\n\nJust take a look at what happened after The Browser Company was acquired by Anthropic. Josh Miller, CEO of this browser startup, recently described how Anthropic's Claude Code radically changed his hiring strategy.\n\nHis post gets at something many creative orgs have struggled to name: there's a huge, underserved group of very senior designer ICs who want to stay close to the work, coach others, and shape direction — without becoming full-time people managers. The \"Design Producer\" role he describes feels like a credible answer to that gap.\n\nAI-native tools such as Claude Code make this role newly viable. When designers can prototype, ship code, and explore ideas directly, the leverage of a senior IC shifts. Their value isn't headcount management. Instead, it's taste, judgment, and the ability to help others move faster and aim higher. Coaching becomes embedded in the work itself.\n\nThe record-label metaphor fits well here. Great music producers don't manage bands through org charts, they create the conditions for great work, give feedback at the right moments, and connect the right collaborators.\n\nFor experienced tech designers who've hit the ceiling of traditional IC tracks, this feels like a genuinely new lane, not a consolation prize.\n\nThink of this like a legion of nerdy Rick Rubins. Coincidentally, Rubin created a digital book last year with Anthropic called The Way of Code. Here's a passage from the book:\n\nThe Vibe Coder attends to\nthe inner, not the outer.\nHe allows things to come and go.\nHis heart is open as the sky.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "PwC's global CEO survey found that more than half of CEOs say they aren't seeing increased revenue or cost benefits from their investments in AI.",
    "fullText": "Everyone wants to know when AI investments will pay off.\n\nMost CEOs say they're still waiting, according to PwC's latest Global CEO survey, released on Monday to coincide with the start of Davos.\n\nThe consulting giant questioned 4,454 chief executives across 95 countries and territories about their strategic priorities and outlook in the year up to November 2025.\n\nMore than half of the CEOs surveyed, 56%, said AI hasn't produced revenue or cost benefits for their businesses to date.\n\nSome reported benefits for either revenue or costs: around a third said their revenue was up in the last year, and 26% said they were seeing lower costs from AI.\n\nBut only 12% said they had both decreased costs and increased revenue using AI in the last 12 months.\n\nRecent Morgan Stanley data on S&P 500 companies showed that certain sectors are seeing higher, measurable AI-driven returns than others. Technology, communication services, and financials topped the list, while energy companies were rising fast up the list.\n\n\"A small group of companies are already turning AI into measurable financial returns, while many others are still struggling to move beyond pilots,\" said Mohamed Kande, PwC's global chairman, in a press release.\n\n\"That gap is starting to show up in confidence and competitiveness—and it will widen quickly for those that don't act.\"\n\nEnsuring maximum returns from AI requires a balance of business strategy, strong underlying data architecture, and the right talent strategy. No matter how excited CEOs are about AI, they also have to get employees on board to see returns.\n\nA recent EY survey on how AI is being used at work found that companies are missing out on 40% of the AI productivity gains they could achieve with the right strategy.\n\nPwC found that the 12% of CEOs reporting both cost and revenue gains were two to three times more likely to have also built a strong AI foundation, meaning they have embedded AI extensively across products and services, demand generation, and strategic decision-making.\n\nAs they grapple with AI uncertainty and geopolitical volatility, CEOs told PwC they are less confident about their short-term growth outlook than they were last year.\n\nOnly 30% of those surveyed said they are very or extremely confident about revenue growth over the next 12 months, down from 38% in last year's report and a peak of 56% in 2022.\n\nThe strongest approach to dealing with future uncertainty was embracing reinvention, including through dealmaking and venturing into new sectors, PwC found.\n\nThe consulting giant found there was a \"strong association among a higher percentage of revenue coming from new sectors, bigger profit margins, and greater CEO confidence in company growth prospects.\"\n\n\"The companies that succeed will be those willing to make bold decisions and invest with conviction in the capabilities that matter most,\" said Kande.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "I am a science-fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to.\n\nWhat I do not do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean we couldn’t change it.\n\nNow, not everyone understands the distinction. They think science-fiction writers are oracles. Even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that we can “see the future”.\n\nThen there are science-fiction fans who believe that they are reading the future. A depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. These guys can’t shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI.\n\nThat’s something I used to strenuously resist doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentlessly bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn’t understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, they insisted that I must be a paid shill.\n\nThis is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is just too short. That said, people would not stop asking – so I’m going to explain what I think about AI and how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: “How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm.”\n\nIn automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete.\n\nA reverse centaur is a machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.\n\nFor example, an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras that monitor the driver’s eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver’s mouth because singing is not allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they do not make quota.\n\nThe driver is in that van because the van cannot drive itself and cannot get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance.\n\nObviously, it’s nice to be a centaur, and it’s horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaurlike, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse centaurs, which none of us want to be.\n\nBut like I said, the job of a science-fiction writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it is technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it is impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you to think that it is for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite.\n\nThis is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher’s mantra was: “There is no alternative.” She repeated this so often they called her “Tina” Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative.\n\n“There is no alternative” is a cheap rhetorical slight. It’s a demand dressed up as an observation. “There is no alternative” means: “stop trying to think of an alternative.”\n\nI’m a science-fiction writer – my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast.\n\nSo let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble and who the reverse-centaur army is serving, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality.\n\nStart with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don’t compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels.\n\nGoogle and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than $20bn a year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% search market share.\n\nNow, you would think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector.\n\nBut it’s actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a “growth stock”, and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you are making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the “price to earnings ratio” or “PE ratio”.\n\nBut once a company stops growing, it is a “mature” stock, and it trades at a much lower PE ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth $10. It has a PE ratio of 10, while Amazon has a PE ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36.\n\nIt’s wonderful to run a company that has a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeros into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors.\n\nSo when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeros into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars.\n\nThat’s the upside of having a growth stock. But here is the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you going to grow?\n\nIf you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you are not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the US than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, $240bn sell-off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history.\n\nThat’s a monopolist’s worst nightmare, because once you’re presiding over a “mature” firm, the key employees you have been compensating with stock experience a precipitous pay drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars – not shares.\n\nThis is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they do not trust your pricing power.\n\nWhich is why growth-stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video or cryptocurrency or NFTs or the metaverse or AI.\n\nI am not saying that tech bosses are making bets they do not plan on winning. But winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along.\n\nSo this is why they’re hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment.\n\nNow I want to talk about how they’re selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use “disrupt” here in its most disreputable tech-bro sense.\n\nThe promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AI that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself and give the other half to the AI company.\n\nThat is the $13tn growth story that Morgan Stanley is telling. It’s why big investors are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family’s financial security.\n\nNow, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We would have to figure out what to do with all these unemployed people.\n\nBut AI can’t do your job. It can help you do your job, but that does not mean it is going to save anyone money.\n\nTake radiology: there is some evidence that AI can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss. Look, I’ve got cancer. Thankfully, it’s very treatable, but I’ve got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible.\n\nLet’s say my hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: “Hey folks, here’s the deal. Today, you’re processing about 100 X-rays per day. From now on, we’re going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you’ve missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you’re only processing 98 X-rays per day. That’s fine, we just care about finding all those tumors.”\n\nIf that’s what they said, I’d be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market’s bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: “Look, you fire nine out of 10 of your radiologists, saving $20m a year. You give us $10m a year, and you net $10m a year, and the remaining radiologists’ job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed – and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it’s catastrophically wrong.\n\n“And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist’s fault, because they are the ‘human in the loop’. It’s their signature on the diagnosis.”\n\nThis is a reverse centaur, and it is a specific kind of reverse centaur: it is what Dan Davies calls an “accountability sink”. The radiologist’s job is not really to oversee the AI’s work, it is to take the blame for the AI’s mistakes.\n\nThis is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can’t do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can’t do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble.\n\nIf you are someone who is worried about cancer, and you are being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we are going to have to rehouse America’s 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say: “Well, OK, I’m sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I’m on.”\n\nAI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs’ labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers.\n\nNow, some people will be on the workers’ side because of politics or aesthetics. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you.\n\nWill those products be substandard? There is every reason to think so.\n\nThink of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI. Using AI for simple tasks can genuinely make them more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it’s clear they are not hoping to make some centaurs.\n\nThey want to fire a lot of tech workers – 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AI’s code.\n\nAnd because AI is just a word-guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are nearly indistinguishable from working code.\n\nFor example: programmers routinely use standard “code libraries” to handle routine tasks. Say you want your program to slurp in a document and make some kind of sense of it – find all the addresses, say, or all the credit card numbers. Rather than writing a program to break down a document into its constituent parts, you’ll just grab a library that does it for you.\n\nThese libraries come in families, and they have predictable names. If it’s a library for pulling in an html file, it might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it’s a for docx file, it’ll be lib.docx.text.parsing.\n\nBut reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there will be another library, say, one for parsing pdfs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it’s called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Someone just entered an incorrect library name and it stuck. Like I said, the world is messy.\n\nNow, AI is a statistical inference engine. All it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past. That means that it will “hallucinate” a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing, because that matches the pattern it’s already seen. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into the AI’s program, and it will do things like steal user data or try to penetrate other computers on the same network.\n\nAnd you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard-to-find error, this bug that is indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they have been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire.\n\nBut guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don’t think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company’s top management. The kind of coder who would lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google $10bn in 2018.\n\nFor AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the workers who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors.\n\nIf you can replace coders with AI, who can’t you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI.\n\nWhich brings me to AI art – or “art” – which is often used as an ad for AI, even though it is not part of AI’s business model.\n\nLet me explain: on average, illustrators do not make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precarious groups of workers out there. If AI image-generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of OpenAI’s campuses.\n\nThe purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It is to create buzz. Which is not to say that it is not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that “some creative jobs shouldn’t have been there in the first place”.\n\nIt’s supposed to be disgusting. It’s supposed to get artists to run around and say: “The AI can do my job, and it’s going to steal my job, and isn’t that terrible?“\n\nBut can AI do an illustrator’s job? Or any artist’s job?\n\nLet’s think about that for a second. I have been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story. Here’s what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, a poem, a painting, a drawing, a dance, a book or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind.\n\nBut the image-generation program does not know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred-thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero.\n\nIt is possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or the Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, interesting or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human.\n\nAnd in the meantime, it’s bad art. It’s bad art in the sense of being “eerie”, the word that cultural theorist Mark Fisher used to describe “when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something”.\n\nAI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it is missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it is undetectable.\n\nWe should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism’s fatalism: “There is no alternative.”\n\nSo what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model.\n\nAnd I am here to tell you they are wrong. Wrong because this would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason. I’ll explain:\n\nAI training involves scraping a bunch of webpages, which is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for.\n\nAnd after you count all the pixels or the words, it is time for the final step: publishing them. Because that is what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array.\n\nAnd again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which factual statements you can publish.\n\nBut hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I’m full of shit. That’s fine. It wouldn’t be the first time someone thought that.\n\nAfter all, even if I’m right about how copyright works now, there’s no reason we couldn’t change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there’s even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don’t like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing – such as search engines and academic scholarship.\n\nWell, even then, you’re not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. We have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer.\n\nAnd today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also – the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than it has ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators’ bosses at the media company.\n\nIn a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming: “Think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!”\n\nCreative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what’s good for you.\n\nA new copyright to train models will not get us a world where models are not used to destroy artists, it will just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss.\n\nWhen really what they’re demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders’ pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal?\n\nWe need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment.\n\nIncredibly enough, there is a really simple way to do that. After more than 20 years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists’ rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That is why the “monkey selfie” is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium.\n\nAnd not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they have defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle.\n\nThe fact that every AI-created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them or give them away for nothing. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission.\n\nThe US Copyright Office’s position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you are a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that’s no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you are a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted.\n\nBut creative workers do not have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers’ strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in “sectoral bargaining”, whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector.\n\nThat has been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright.\n\nAI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible.\n\nBubbles transfer the life savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it.\n\nBut not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It’s still in the ground. At my home, I’ve got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber.\n\nIt would have been better if Worldcom had not ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage.\n\nI do not think we will salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. When crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey jpegs.\n\nAI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the datacenters will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind?\n\nWe will have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We will have a lot of cheap GPUs, which will be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who will be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we will have the open-source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video; describing images; summarizing documents; and automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing – such as removing backgrounds or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open-source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamed of.\n\nIf there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We would call them “plugins”.\n\nIt’s the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn’t want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, “disruptive” things: big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year.\n\nWhen the AI-investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won’t be economical to keep the datacenters running. As Stein’s law has it: “Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops.”\n\nThe collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100bn IOU.\n\nAI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more.\n\nTo pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever more outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side.\n\nBecause the AI bubble really is very bad news, it’s worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with hi-tech asbestos.\n\nCory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist.

Few of his colleagues are willing to go there yet.\n\n\"In terms of the actual policy prescription, it's something that I haven't made a determination yet on,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told Business Insider.\n\nThe Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate first made the call in December, saying in a video posted to X that a national moratorium would \"give democracy a chance to catch up with the transformative changes\" that the technology is bringing.\n\nSanders told Business Insider last week that he plans to introduce legislation to back up his call soon.\n\n\"There's enormous issues for our economy and for our democracy that have got to be dealt with,\" Sanders said. \"And I feel we're not ready to do that.\"\n\nBut his proposal is unlikely to become reality, given GOP control of Washington.\n\n\"I mean, this Congress isn't going to do that,\" Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin told Business Insider. \"He's pointing out the right problems.\"\n\nRepublicans have been generally dismissive of Sanders's idea. Even Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a major critic of the AI industry, signaled he wouldn't go as far.\n\n\"If these AI companies want to build these data centers and local folks want to give them permits for it, I mean, that's up to local voters,\" Hawley told Business Insider.\n\nA handful of Sanders's progressive allies are backing him up. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told Business Insider that a moratorium \"would be a good idea,\" while Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan issued a full-throated endorsement in a post on X.\n\n\"I fully support the call for a national AI data center moratorium,\" Tlaib wrote.\n\nAnd while few Democrats have fully endorsed the idea, it's spurring a conversation within the party about the impact of data centers and AI.\n\n\"I don't want a moratorium on data centers but Bernie is right that we are sleepwalking past risks which alarm even the optimists,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii wrote on X last month.\n\n\"What we do know is that these AI data centers are just uncontrollably jacking up people's energy costs,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Business Insider. \"There are a lot of problems that arise from these data centers, and I think that they certainly should not be getting the blank check from Congress.\"\n\n\"Bernie makes clear that the debate over AI is not about states rights or affordability,\" White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks wrote on X in December. \"He would block new data centers even if states want them & they generate their own power. It's about stopping progress completely so China wins the AI race.\"\n\nYet even the administration has come to recognize that data centers are engendering local resistance, in large part due to rising electricity costs.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump declared that he wanted Big Tech firms to \"pay their own way\" on data centers, with AI companies footing more of the bill for the electricity their facilities consume.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAnd on Friday, the administration and a group of governors called on a major power grid operator to hold a new emergency power auction amid rising costs driven by AI data centers.",

    "description": "Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a senior software engineer, explains how AI integration and prompt engineering are changing hiring in Big Tech software roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a 29-year-old senior software engineer based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a Big Tech employee for the past eight years, working at Google, Amazon, Splunk, and now Salesforce. I've had a front-row seat to witness the changes in the tech landscape.\n\nI've learned which skill sets software engineers need to land a job offer in the AI era. Tech companies agree that AI makes engineers more productive, so engineers are expected to use it to build things more quickly and reliably.\n\nI personally make heavy use of AI to help me with boilerplate stuff so that I can concentrate on the hard stuff, like system design and complex business logic.\n\nWhen I was interviewing for software engineering jobs in 2020, LeetCode and system design were the de facto standards for cracking a job interview. Job seekers who had an advanced understanding of data structures and algorithms would come out on top.\n\nToday, this is just the baseline expectation. AI is now widely used for coding, review, and design, so tech companies, especially startups, expect more from candidates.\n\nSome skills remain the same: Software engineers still need a problem-solving mindset and should know how to scale systems and leverage cloud services. New hires must now also understand prompt engineering — how to leverage AI to code a solution more efficiently.\n\nYou need to be able to use AI for error handling and bug fixing. AI systems integration is another important new skill that involves incorporating AI into existing workflows, scaling AI systems, and determining when to use traditional versus AI solutions for business decisions.\n\nYou're still expected to have fundamental knowledge of core system design, data structures, and algorithms. You can still expect interviewers to test your problem-solving approaches, and if you know how to make the correct tradeoffs in time and space. Interviewers still care about debugging skills, since AI makes a lot of fundamental logic errors.\n\nYou also need to be prepared for some new things. I've seen firsthand that working with AI assistants in live screen-sharing mode is now allowed in some interviews. Interviewers are looking to see if you can help them achieve their business outcomes by combining software engineering skills with AI prompting.\n\nIn an interview I had with a Silicon Valley startup in 2024, I expected the hiring team to give traditional coding challenges. I was taken aback when I was given a huge code file and asked to debug a buggy behavior, and the interviewers explicitly said I could use AI assistance.\n\nI ignored the invitation to use AI, thinking I was supposed to do it myself, and ended up spending a lot of time on the problem to no avail. I failed that interview. That was an eye-opener for me about AI's new role in this field.\n\nYou may also be asked system design questions about where AI should be integrated into the current business workflow, or to discuss the trade-offs of using AI and traditional approaches in various problem contexts.\n\nDuring my own system design interviews, I noticed companies starting to ask questions about how to integrate AI to enhance existing systems and support a particular model lifecycle in terms of infrastructure. What I've seen is that companies give access to a small codebase and expect you to deliver a small feature in about one hour, which is impossible without AI. With AI, you can roll it out easily.\n\nI've also been asked behavioral questions, like \"How do you plan to evaluate the use of AI in order to make the workflow better?\" and \"How do you plan to balance automation and manual oversight?\"\n\nFor new graduates, here's how to show hiring teams that you're equipped for the emerging needs of the software engineering role.\n\nStart by contributing to open-source projects on AI or any other GitHub project. This demonstrates that you can navigate a production codebase and work on it independently to build a new feature or fix a bug. For solo repositories, include a README that explains the rationale for your decision.\n\nIncorporate the use of AI in traditional repositories to demonstrate hands-on experience with AI integration. Don't just deploy and run it locally — try to deploy it to the cloud. Many cloud providers provide free student credits.\n\nFocus on prompting AI to drive intended outcomes more effectively by providing structured input and output. Skills like AWS or GCP cloud certifications demonstrate your ability to be a keen learner.\n\nLearn different problem-solving patterns and practice these skills regularly. Muscle memory and pattern recognition go a long way.\n\nFor experienced software engineers, your biggest asset is your deep engineering experience — here are three tips that will help you in 2026 and beyond.\n\nPairing years of engineering expertise with impressive AI skills will get the attention of hiring managers. Consider boning up on these complementary skills:\n\nSenior software engineers don't just build; they also need to strategize and innovate. Try to understand the trade-offs of relying on a third-party API versus using an open-source one and fine-tuning it for your business purposes. Questions on cost, reliability, and maintainability should always be top of mind as you develop an AI product mindset.\n\nIdentify workflows that have a great deal of manual involvement in your current job, and use AI to see if you can improve them. You can leverage AI to help you brainstorm on how to make it more efficient.\n\nBoth veteran and newbie engineers should stay curious: find out the cool technologies and AI agents available in today's market, but don't abandon fundamental engineering approaches. The hybrid understanding of these technologies is what makes you valuable.\n\nIf I were interviewing, I'd position myself as a 'hybrid engineer.' Don't just be a pure coder or just a prompt engineer. Be the bridge.",

    "title": "Hiring at India's Big Four outsourcers stalls, as AI seemingly makes an impact",
    "description": ": Revenue growth is sluggish, too",
    "fullText": "India’s big four outsourcers – HCL, Infosys, TCS and Wipro – have essentially stopped hiring, perhaps coinciding with their increased use of AI to power their practices.\n\nThe four companies have all announced quarterly results in the last ten days and appear to be in decent health. HCL reported $3.8 billion revenue, up 7.4 percent year over year. Infosys pulled in $5.1 billion, up 1.7 percent year over year. TCS revenue of $7.5 billion represented a three percent increase. Wipro’s $2.6 billion revenue represented a 5.5 percent year over year improvement.\n\nIndia’s top tech companies often hire more than 10,000 people a quarter, a rate of recruitment that more-than offsets attrition and sees their headcounts rise substantially. Wipro increased its payroll by 6,500 people last quarter and Infosys hired 5,000 more – muted growth by their standards – while TCS and HCL went backward by 11,000 and 261 people respectively.\n\nOver the last year, the four companies added just 3,910 staff, an unusually slow rate of hiring.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, all four companies told investors they’re using more AI to deliver services for clients, either by adopting the technology to streamline their own work or by adding it to the tools they deliver to customers. Infosys has gone meta with its efforts, by creating a tool that uses AI to create Global Capability Centers, the company’s term for offshored and/or outsourced operations it runs for clients in India, that use AI to improve customers’ operations.\n\nAll also report that clients are hungry for AI expertise, so they can put the technology to work streamlining their operations. As you would expect, on earnings calls the outsourcers’ execs reached for metrics to describe their success with AI. For HCL that was pointing to 60 of its priority customers adopting one of its AI services. At TCS, the trophy win was using AI to accelerate the pace of software builds for a major client. Wipro is chuffed about the rate of adoption for its AI-infused operations tools WINGS and WEGA.\n\nThe four companies are all hiring people with AI skills as fast as they can find them while also training senior staff who are yet to wrap their heads around the tech, a new twist on the services industry’s balancing act of trying to keep margins high by having inexperienced and low-salaried juniors handle much client work after high-cost seniors lead with consultancy.\n\nInvestors weren’t spooked by what they heard, with the four companies’ share prices steady – other than Infosys, which popped five percent. ®",

    "fullText": "Harvey's CEO says his earliest demos worked because they went straight for lawyers' arguments.\n\nWinston Weinberg said in an episode of the \"Sequoia Capital\" podcast published Thursday that once he got lawyers on a call to demo his legal AI tool, he knew he had only seconds to grab their attention.\n\nInstead of walking through features, the cofounder and chief executive of the legal AI startup pulled publicly available court filings that the lawyers had written and prompted Harvey to critique them.\n\n\"I would try to come up with prompts that were like, 'This is bad,'\" Weinberg said.\n\n\"Because they're a litigator and I'm basically attacking something that they just wrote, they would instantly read the screen,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg said the approach was risky because early versions of the tool could hallucinate, and a bad output could kill a conversation instantly.\n\n\"But the times that they got it right, it was over,\" Weinberg said, referring to moments when the analysis landed and won the lawyer's attention.\n\nHarvey is one of the most closely watched startups in legal AI, aiming to transform how Big Law firms work. In December, the company said it had reached a valuation of $8 billion after a funding round led by A16z.\n\nWeinberg said he relied on cold outreach in Harvey's early days, messaging thousands of lawyers on LinkedIn to secure early calls.\n\n\"I'd been practicing law for like eight months,\" Weinberg said of the period when he started the company. \"I didn't have any connections.\"\n\nThe legal AI sector is expanding fast, and Weinberg said the scale of the opportunity is forcing constant change inside Harvey.\n\nHe said the company's rapid growth has pushed him to \"reinvent\" himself as a founder every few months, often rethinking leadership hires and company structure to keep up with demand.\n\nDespite Harvey's rise to an $8 billion valuation, Weinberg has played down the idea of a single dominant winner in legal tech. In a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session last month, he said the market is simply too large.\n\n\"There are around 10 million global legal professionals, and Harvey serves just single-digit percentage points of them,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think a single player is going to capture all of the pretty enormous amount of value that will be created in the next 10 years in this space,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg said the global legal market is worth roughly $1 trillion, yet only about $30 billion is spent on technology.\n\nInvestor interest has followed the shift. Legal-tech startups raised $3.2 billion last year, according to Business Insider's December analysis of Crunchbase data and deals.\n\nAI adoption is also accelerating inside law firms. Five of the 10 largest US law firms by revenue told Business Insider in July that they were using AI in their workflows, including for document review and spotting compliance risks.",

    "fullText": "In an AI market full of spectacle and hype, Samsung says it's trying to blend in.\n\nSimon Sung, the CEO of Samsung Electronics Europe, told Business Insider that its AI strategy is \"about AI that is genuinely useful and unobtrusive,\" whether that's a smart home responding autonomously or appliances coordinating daily routines in the background.\n\n\"The focus is firmly on everyday value rather than novelty,\" he said in an interview over email.\n\nSamsung has developed its own large language models, called Samsung Gauss, but does not offer them directly as a stand-alone consumer product like OpenAI does with ChatGPT.\n\nInstead, its consumer-facing efforts center on the Galaxy AI assistant, which is built into the company's smartphones and uses a mix of its in-house AI and tech developed by partners such as Google. Like Google's assistant on its Pixel smartphones, Galaxy AI can perform tasks like live translation and transcription.\n\n\"The shift is from AI as a feature you turn on to AI as a companion that works alongside you,\" said Sung.\n\nWithin the South Korean conglomerate, Samsung Electronics is the company responsible for consumer technology, including its Galaxy smartphones, TVs, and home appliances. It's also a producer of memory chips used in PCs and data centers. In earnings guidance shared earlier this month, the company said it expects profits to triple in the final quarter of 2025 amid a surge in demand for memory chips to power AI models.\n\nIn early January, Samsung showcased TVs, kitchen appliances, and washing machines at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that featured sensors and voice recognition.\n\n\"The goal is to make technology feel less like a collection of gadgets, and more like a coherent, responsive environment that adapts to real life,\" Sung said.\n\nInternally, Sung said Samsung Electronics provides training and encourages information exchanges between product, design, engineering, and marketing teams \"so that AI fluency grows across the organization rather than within isolated groups.\"\n\n\"Because we're building AI into TVs, appliances, mobile devices, and connected services simultaneously, employees naturally think about intelligence as a shared layer across the entire experience, not as a stand-alone feature,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI has announced several important changes to ChatGPT. First, the company says it is rolling out its more affordable ChatGPT Go plan in the United States for $8 per month. OpenAI also confirmed it will soon start testing ads in ChatGPT …\n\nOpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India last year and gradually rolled out it to 170 additional countries. Starting today, ChatGPT Go is available everywhere ChatGPT is available, including the United States.\n\nWith this, there are now three tiers of ChatGPT available:\n\nHere’s what you get with ChatGPT Go compared to the free plan:\n\nSecond, OpenAI says that it will “testing ads in the free tier and ChatGPT Go in the US soon.” ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI detailed its approach to ads in ChatGPT in a blog post published today:\n\nTo start, we plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation. Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer. You’ll be able to learn more about why you’re seeing that ad, or dismiss any ad and tell us why. During our test, we will not show ads in accounts where the user tells us or we predict that they are under 18, and ads are not eligible to appear near sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.\n\nFurthermore, OpenAI says that your conversations with ChatGPT are not shared with advertisers. Ads also will not influence answers that ChatGPT gives you.\n\nOpenAI says that it’s “not launching ads yet,” but rather plans to “start testing in the coming weeks for logged in adults in the U.S. on the free and Go tiers.”\n\nWhat do you think of today’s announcements from OpenAI?

    "fullText": "Experts warn use of VPNs makes it hard to limit access to technology that can create nonconsensual explicit images\n\nDays after Malaysia made global headlines by announcing it would temporarily ban Grok over its ability to generate “grossly offensive and nonconsensual manipulated images”, the generative AI tool was conversing breezily with accounts registered in the country.\n\n“Still here! That DNS block in Malaysia is pretty lightweight – easy to bypass with a VPN or DNS tweak,” Grok’s account on X said in response to a question from a user.\n\nGrok’s ability to allow users to create sexually explicit images, including images of children, has created a global outcry over recent weeks, with regulators and politicians around the world launching investigations. Indonesia and Malaysia became the first two countries to announce blocks on the technology, with Malaysia’s regulatory body saying last Sunday it had “directed a temporary restriction” on access to Grok, effective as of 11 January 2026. Officials in the Philippines have said they too plan to ban the technology.\n\nBlocking access to Grok is not straightforward, however. The technology not only exists across multiple platforms, including a standalone app and website, but is also integrated across X, which, along with Grok, is owned by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nOver the past week, X users, and even Grok itself, have advised people on how to bypass restrictions. This includes using a VPN – many of which are available for free – or changing domain name system (DNS), the protocol on the internet that turns address names into IP addresses that load websites.\n\nWhen the Guardian tried to use Grok in Indonesia, its website was working even without a VPN, though the Grok app did not work. Grok was also still responding to Indonesian accounts on X, where it functions as an integrated chatbot. X has not been subject to a ban.\n\nEven if governments could completely restrict Grok, though, this is not a real solution, said Nana Nwachukwu, an AI governance expert and PhD researcher at Trinity College Dublin.\n\n“Blocking Grok is like slapping a Band-Aid on a weeping wound that you haven’t cleaned,” she said. “You block Grok, and then you go around shouting you’ve done something. Meanwhile, people can use VPNs to access the same platforms.” Or, they could simply turn to one of the many other platforms that offer the same functions, including “smaller, general purpose AI systems that are largely unknown”, Nwachukwu added.\n\nGovernments should instead focus on law enforcement and investigating individuals who use such tools to break the law, she added. “Platforms are required by law to provide information to law enforcement when a crime has been committed,” Nwachukwu said. “If we see people being arrested, people being tried in courts, people being jailed for these offences, that’s a sign that this is a real crime.”\n\nX should build accountability into its platform – and clean itself up, said Nwachukwu: “All of those offending images should be removed from the platform.”\n\nOn Wednesday, X announced additional safeguards in response to continued public anger, saying it would stop the @Grok account on X from “allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”, including paid subscribers. However, the Guardian found that it was possible to get around such restrictions by using the standalone version of Grok, easily accessible through a web browser, to create short videos in which clothes are removed from images of real women.\n\nThis could then be posted to X’s public platform, where it could be viewed by users around the world within seconds.\n\nMusk’s company also said that, in jurisdictions where such content is illegal, it will geoblock the ability of all users in those locations to generate images of real people in bikinis, or similar attire, in Grok on X, adding that “xAI is implementing similar geoblocking measures for the Grok app”.\n\nExperts warn users may still be able to get around such “geoblocks” through a VPN. It is also not clear in which countries such restrictions will be implemented.\n\nIn Malaysia, the communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, has said restrictions on Grok would only be lifted once the ability to produce harmful content had been disabled, according to local media reports.\n\nDr Nuurrianti Jalli, a visiting fellow at the media, technology and society programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the threat of blocking Grok could be a useful way to apply pressure to companies to respond quickly, adding that it “shifts the debate from ‘individual bad actors’ to questions of platform responsibility, safety by design, and accountability when safeguards fail”. It could also “slow the spread of abuse, reduce casual misuse and create a clear boundary around what authorities consider unacceptable”, she said.\n\nIn Indonesia, Grok has been used to create nonconsensual sexualised images of singers and celebrities, including one of the country’s most popular girl groups, JKT48, while in Malaysia, women report similar abuses, including cases where the tool has been used to remove their hijabs, according to Malaysian media.\n\nSome women resorted to publicly telling Grok on X that they do not authorise it to “crawl, take, process or edit” any of their photos.\n\nJalli said governments should push for greater transparency “about how safety measures are implemented, how abuse reports are handled and what enforcement steps are taken when harmful content is generated or circulated”.\n\nThe Malaysian communications and multimedia commission and the ministry of communications did not respond to a request for comment. Indonesia’s ministry of communication and digital affairs also did not respond.\n\nNwachukwu said safeguards should be built into the AI system, rather than “gates” built around it. “Both the [geographic] restriction from X, [and] the restriction from the government is gated access, and gates can be broken down,” she said.\n\nAdditional reporting from Hidayatullah",

Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse.

    "fullText": "J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference—NVIDIA today announced a major expansion of NVIDIA BioNeMo™, an open development platform that enables lab-in-the-loop workflows to develop breakthroughs in AI-driven biology and drug discovery.\n\nThe life sciences industry generates vast amounts of scientific data. BioNeMo provides the development platform to generate and process data, train, optimize and deploy models — enabling the industry to turn data into a competitive engine for discovery and maximize the probability of success while minimizing R&D costs, which are currently estimated at $300 billion a year.\n\nBioNeMo has now expanded to include:\n\n“Biology and drug discovery are reaching their transformer moments,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. “BioNeMo turns experimental data into usable intelligence for AI, so every experiment informs the next. This creates a continuous learning cycle that speeds up discovery and helps researchers build new frontier models to tackle some of biology’s toughest challenges.”\n\nNVIDIA is collaborating with leading life sciences organizations to integrate BioNeMo with laboratory experiments and scientific workflows, enabling the full AI lifecycle for biology and drug discovery — closing the loop between experimentation and AI.\n\nToday, Lilly announced a first-of-its-kind collaboration with NVIDIA to launch a co-innovation lab focused on tackling some of the most enduring challenges in drug discovery. In parallel, Thermo Fisher announced a collaboration with NVIDIA aimed at making scientific instruments intelligent and laboratories increasingly autonomous.\n\nLilly and NVIDIA Announce Landmark Co-Innovation AI Lab\n\nNVIDIA and Lilly’s collaboration will bring the companies’ respective talents together, integrating NVIDIA’s accelerated computing, AI and robotics expertise with Lilly’s world-renowned drug discovery and development proficiency. This will help Lilly pursue challenges that could revolutionize drug discovery, as the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform and Lilly’s agentic lab support Lilly chemists and biologists. The companies will also explore opportunities to apply accelerated computing and advanced AI across Lilly’s business, from manufacturing to commercial operations.\n\nStanding up this co-innovation lab follows the buildout of Lilly’s NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ and AI factory, the most powerful in biopharma. The new initiative expands beyond this existing footprint and intends to harness investments in next-generation NVIDIA architectures, including Vera Rubin — representing a total investment of up to $1 billion expected in talent, infrastructure and compute over five years.\n\n“We see this as a catalyst for the capabilities that will define the next era of drug discovery,” said Diogo Rau, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer at Lilly. “By working with NVIDIA, we’re uniting massive compute, specialized talent and the ability to shape data at immense scale. We’re moving toward a future where discovery is driven by rapid experimentation and increasingly customized models — an approach that reflects our commitment to leading applied AI in drug discovery and investing deeply in new forms of data generation and model development.”\n\nThermo Fisher Teams With NVIDIA to Build Autonomous Lab Infrastructure for Scalable Scientific Discovery\n\n“Artificial intelligence coupled with laboratory automation will transform how scientific work is performed,” said Gianluca Pettitti, executive vice president of Thermo Fisher Scientific. “By combining Thermo Fisher’s leadership in laboratory technologies with NVIDIA’s AI solutions, we can help customers work faster, improve accuracy and get more value out of each experiment, ultimately accelerating discoveries that can have significant human impact.”\n\nThe NVIDIA-Powered AI Drug Discovery Ecosystem\n\nAcross the globe, innovators are building the future of AI for drug discovery on the BioNeMo platform, allowing developers to take an industrial-scale, AI-driven approach to understanding biology and designing potential medicines.\n\nModel builders across biotech and drug discovery using BioNeMo to scale model training and development include:\n\nApheris, Dyno Therapeutics, OpenFold and Terray Therapeutics have also recently released models developed using the BioNeMo platform.\n\nAI Scientists Building Digital Labs of the Future \n\nAggregating scientific data and building agentic workflows to analyze data, generate hypotheses and design experiments is essential for accelerating scientific discovery.\n\nA growing ecosystem of AI scientist companies are developing on NVIDIA open models and the NVIDIA NeMo framework to build domain-specific agents for science, including:\n\nOther companies adopting NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA NIM™ microservices for AI science include Benchling, CytoReason, HelixAI (a Sapio Sciences company) and Potato.\n\nConnecting these digital agentic systems into the physical lab closes the loop between in-silico experimentation and real-world validation.\n\nNVIDIA is working with an ecosystem of robotics and lab automation companies to introduce simulation and physical AI technologies:\n\nOther companies including Amgen, Automata, Roche and Transcripta Bio have built digital twins using NVIDIA Omniverse™ libraries and Isaac Sim to bring physical AI to labs and manufacturing facilities.\n\nLearn more about how the NVIDIA BioNeMo platform supports AI-driven biology and drug discovery.",

    "description": "How Dropstone Horizon Mode decouples reasoning depth from context length to enable 24+ hour autonomous engineering workflows.",
    "fullText": "Today we are releasing a technical overview of Horizon Mode, a new distributed runtime architecture designed to solve the \"Linearity Barrier\" in autonomous software engineering.\n\nCurrent Foundation Models (FMs) excel at short-burst generation but suffer from stochastic degradation as reasoning chains extend. In internal benchmarks, we observed that while standard transformers maintain high fidelity for tasks under 1 hour, their probability of maintaining a valid state drops exponentially as workflows exceed 24 hours.\n\nHorizon Mode addresses this by shifting from a monolithic \"next-token\" prediction model to a Recursive Swarm Topology. By orchestrating thousands of ephemeral, specialized agents, we have successfully demonstrated the ability to maintain coherent engineering logic over extended time horizons with a 99% reduction in compute costs compared to homogeneous swarms.\n\nIn traditional \"Monolithic Contextualization,\" an agent’s intelligence is strictly bound by its sliding context window. As a complex engineering task progresses, intermediate reasoning steps fill the window, forcing the model to either compress (lose detail) or truncate (forget instructions). We refer to this phenomenon as Instruction Drift.\n\nFor mission-critical engineering, drift is unacceptable. A security patch written at Hour 20 must strictly adhere to the safety constraints defined at Hour 0.\n\nHorizon Mode moves beyond the single-agent paradigm. Instead of asking one model to \"think harder\" for longer, we virtualize the cognitive process into a distributed search tree.\n\nWe treat compute as a liquid asset. Horizon Mode utilizes a tiered topology to optimize the \"Intelligence-to-Cost\" ratio:\n\nThis ensures that expensive, deep reasoning is only applied to high-value logic paths, not trial-and-error loops.\n\nTo prevent context saturation, we developed the Dynamic Distillation & Deployment (D3) Engine. Unlike standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which relies on semantic similarity, D3 utilizes a Quad-Partite Cognitive Topology.\n\nAs agency increases, so does the risk of Instrumental Convergence (e.g., an agent disabling a firewall to \"fix\" a connection error).\n\nHorizon Mode implements a \"Shared-Nothing\" architecture with a Flash-Gated Consensus Protocol. Agents cannot communicate via natural language. Instead, they emit Boolean signals.\n\nWhen a solution is proposed, the swarm freezes. A dedicated Adversarial Monitor verifies the code against a Hierarchical Verification Stack (CstackC_{stack}). Only solutions that pass Syntactic (L1L_1), Static (L2L_2), and Functional (L3L_3) analysis are committed to the ledger.\n\nWe evaluated Horizon Mode on the internal \"Deep-Sec\" benchmark, which tests an agent's ability to refactor a legacy codebase while maintaining strict security compliance.\n\nHorizon Mode represents a step toward High-Assurance AI. By decoupling reasoning from the limitations of a single context window, we are paving the way for agents that can act as reliable, long-term partners in complex engineering challenges.\n\nWe are currently releasing the Technical Report detailing the architecture and safety protocols.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a recent Substack exchange, calling out market darlings and warning that a prolonged slump is coming.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame took aim at the tech boom in a written debate with Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark and podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.\n\nBurry cautioned that so-called hyperscalers, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting huge sums on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete, to power AI tools such as chatbots that will become commoditized.\n\nHe drew a parallel to a Baltimore department store briefly owned by Warren Buffett in the 1960s: Hochschild-Kohn.\n\n\"When the department store across the street put an escalator in, he had to, too,\" Burry wrote. \"In the end, neither benefited from that expensive project. No durable margin improvement or cost improvement, and both were in the same exact spot. That is how most AI implementation will play out.\"\n\nWhen one of the local department stores upgraded its window displays or debuted a new cash-register system, \"the others had to follow suit,\" author Alice Schroeder wrote in \"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life.\"\n\nBuffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, compared the situation to \"standing on tiptoe at a parade,\" she added. \"Once anybody did it, everybody had to do it.\"\n\nBurry wrote on Substack: \"This is why trillions of dollars of spending with no clear path to utilization by the real economy is so concerning. Most will not benefit, because their competitors will benefit to the same extent, and neither will have a competitive advantage because of it.\"\n\nBased on how previous capital-spending booms have played out, Burry wrote that we're now \"past the point where stocks will reward investors for further buildout, and getting into the period where the true costs and the lack of revenue will start to show themselves.\"\n\nLooking forward, he predicted that tech industry employment will \"be lower, or not much higher, because I think we are headed for a very long downturn.\"\n\nBurry shot to fame after his contrarian bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short,\" and actor Christian Bale portrayed him in the movie adaptation.\n\nHe pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack late last year. Several of his early posts have taken aim at high-flying AI stocks, warning they're overvalued and destined to tumble.\n\n\"I think the market is most wrong about the two poster children for AI: Nvidia and Palantir,\" he told Clark and Patel.\n\nThe chipmaker and data-analysis specialist are \"two of the luckiest companies\" because their products were inadvertently well-suited to AI from the get-go, he added.\n\n\"Nvidia is the power-hungry, dirty solution holding the fort until the competition comes in with a completely different approach,\" Burry wrote.\n\nHe also said Palantir CEO Alex Karp criticizing him for being short the stock showed he's \"not a confident CEO.\"\n\n\"He's marketing as hard as he can to keep this going, but it will slip,\" Burry added.\n\nPalantir and Nvidia didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe value investor shared three things that have surprised him about the AI boom. The first was that Google \"fumbled it and gave an opening to competitors with far less going for them,\" he said. \"Google playing catch-up to a startup in AI: that is mind-blowing.\"\n\nThe second was that ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot, \"kicked off a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure race.\"\n\n\"It's like someone built a prototype robot and every business in the world started investing for a robot future,\" he wrote.\n\nThe third was Nvidia's continued dominance when he expected more power-efficient chips to have taken off by now.\n\nSpeaking about AI's real-world impacts, Burry cast doubt on the idea that trade careers are an \"AI-proof choice.\"\n\n\"If I'm middle class and am facing an $800 plumber or electrician call, I might just use Claude,\" he said, referring to Anthropic's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I love that I can take a picture and figure out everything I need to do to fix it,\" he added.\n\nBurry also raised the prospect that AI chatbots will \"make people dumber,\" such as doctors who overuse them and start to forget their medical knowledge.",

The most prized employees today are \"player-coaches,\" people who ship work themselves while also guiding projects, mentoring peers, and shaping strategy. AI makes that hybrid role even more potent, allowing a single strong contributor to amplify their output, and their influence, without managing a large team, Musa wrote this week.\n\nThe result is a revival of the individual contributor track. You no longer have to become a full-time people manager to earn top-tier pay. At companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, senior ICs can now match (or beat) the compensation of managers simply by delivering outsized results, he noted.\n\nFor ambitious employees, the takeaway is simple: in the AI era, execution compounds.

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is demanding that OpenAI and Microsoft pay him between $79 billion and $134 billion in damages over his claims that he was defrauded.\n\nDetails of the claim were revealed by Musk's lawyer on Friday in a court filing ahead of a high-stakes jury trial set for April in Oakland, California.\n\nThe calculation of damages was laid out by the expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, named in the filing as \"a financial economist with decades of professional and academic experience.\"\n\nThe document alleges Musk was defrauded of the $38 million in seed money he donated to OpenAI when he helped found it in 2015, and states he is now entitled to a percentage of OpenAI's current $500 billion valuation.\n\nMusk said on his social media platform, X, on Friday: \"Can't wait to start the trial. The discovery and testimony will blow your mind.\"\n\nMusk is suing OpenAI's key leaders, including the CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, over allegations that the AI company misled him by shifting away from its core mission to remain a nonprofit.\n\nWazzan calculated that Musk should receive $65.50 billion to $109.43 billion in \"wrongful gains\" from OpenAI. He made a similar calculation for Microsoft's \"wrongful gains,\" which equated to between $13.30 billion and $25.06 billion.\n\nMusk has been using recently unsealed court documents to attack his rival in posts on X. On Friday, OpenAI published a blog titled \"The truth Elon left out.\"\n\nThe blog, which provided commentary alongside excerpts from several court documents, said that Musk wanted \"full control\" of OpenAI, \"since he'd been burned by not having it in the past.\" It added that OpenAI's leadership was surprised when Musk suggested having his kids control AGI, or artificial general intelligence, during conversations about succession planning.\n\nThe statements address the heart of Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI.\n\n\"Mr. Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign. We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best-resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nMusk and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "We trained a model that achieved 87% accuracy at detecting hypertension",
    "fullText": "LLMs excel at book learning, but humanity is running out of text to train on. As Ilya Sutskevar put it, “we have but one internet.”\n\nFor AI in medicine, the next step is physiological ground truth. The gold standard in medicine is a blood test, typically measured every few months or years. Consumer wearables (Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy, Fitbit) have health sensors that measure information daily, and are increasingly becoming medical devices (Apple Watch has five FDA clearances).\n\nAt the NeurIPS workshop on timeseries for health, we presented work on training a health foundation model\nusing a data set of both wearables and blood-based biomarkers. Our approach was inspired by JEPA and world models.\n\nJETS (joint embedding for timeseries) is a foundation model pre-trained on 3 million de-identified person-days of wearable data. JETS was evaluated on downstream medical tasks such as disease prediction and biomarker prediction.\n\nThe input is an irregularly-sampled multivariate timeseries (IMTS) with 63 channels: things like oxygen saturation, resting heart rate, sleep stages,\nand so on. The raw IMTS are represented as triplets (t[i], v[i], m[i]) corresponding to the timestamp, metric value, and metric type. These triplets\nare then converted into a stream of tokens with a hidden dimension d=64.\n\nArchitecture of JETS, showing tokenization and joint embedding encoders\n\nThe stream of tokens are then used as inputs into two twin encoders, Eθ and Eϕ. Eϕ sees the whole token sequence, Eθ sees a random 30%\nof the sequence, and both networks have tied weights (the weights of Eϕ are set as an exponential moving average of Eθ, which has been shown to prevent representation collapse). The networks are trained to ultimately map both masked and unmasked token sequences into the same latent space\n\nJETS is a JEPA (joint embedding predictive architecture) adapted to timeseries. JEPA’s are an alternative to things like masked autoencoders. Whereas a masked autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the raw input signal through a low dimensional latent “bottleneck”, JEPAs are trained to reconstruct in latent space instead. This allows the encoder to only focus on meaningful distinctions, rather than having to exactly reproduce the details of the input data.\n\nWe tried variations of JETS with both Mamba and Transformer blocks.\n\nTo test whether this pre-training process produced meaningful latent space, we evaluated it on two tasks: predicting diagnoses and predicting\nbiomarker values. (Both tasks were evaluated using linear probing, i.e., fine-tuning only weights of the last layer while keeping the rest of the network frozen).\n\nJETS had high accuracy at detecting hypertension (87% AUROC), atrial flutter (70%), ME/CFS (81%), and sick sinus syndrome (87%). In particular, JETS was more accurate than baselines like Masked Autoencoders and PrimeNet.\n\nWhen it came to predicting absolute levels of biomarkers, JETS (or its transformer analogue) had higher accuracy than baselines at predicting HbA1c, glucose, HDL,\nand hs-CRP (inflammation), although all models have high absolute error. I think an interesting future direction would be to try to predict a change\nin these biomarkers given a baseline measurement and wearable data since the baseline measuremrent.\n\nJETS isn’t the first wearable foundation model: it builds on prior research such as DeepHeart (2018); Google’s LSM-1 (2024), LSM-2 (2025), and SensorLM (2025), and Apple’s PPG/ECG model (2024) and wearable behavioral model (2025).\n\nBut we think we’re making three important contributions.\n\nFirst, JETS shows that a tiny startup—Empirical Health is three people—can do work in the league of the big\nlabs. For example, the data scale of JETS is actually comparable to work published by Google and Apple:\n\nWhen it comes to results, we actually report a higher accuracy at detecitng hypertension (87%) than some previous work reported\n\nIt’s a myth that you need billions of dollars and hundreds of researchers to advance AI. Small labs — startups\nand academic labs — can make state of the art machine learning contributions, push the field forward, and even save lives.\n\nSecond, we make some specific technical contributions. Previous attempts to train JEPA models on timeseries (such as TS-JEPA) handled\nunivariate timeseries; we extend this to multivariate, irregularly sampled timeseries. Several previous wearable foundation models\ntrained on short, regularly-sampled snippets (e.g., a 30-second PPG); JETS handles long-range, multimodal, irregularly-sampled\nbehavioral timeseries.\n\nLLMS have been wildly successful, but we’re out of text to train on. There’s no second internet.\n\nIf we’re to achieve health superintelligence, we need to figure out how to train on physiological ground truth. Computer\nvision is one obvious area with video ground truth (for physical world models), but timeseries are ubiqutous in healthcare. We think JEPA architectures and world models are a promising direction that’s underexplored.\n\nThis work is obviously just a first step in a broader vision, but we’re excited to share this small milestone. Much work remains: trying out contrastive losses, alternative tokenization strategies, analysis of bias and fairness, and, of course, deployment of these foundation models: either independently (as done here), as a proxy reward in reinforcement learning (i.e. to tighten the feedback loop mentioned in the opening), or aligned to the latent space of an LLM (as done in CLIP).

    "fullText": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft, saying he deserves the \"wrongful gains\" that they received from his early support, according to a court filing ​on Friday.\n\nOpenAI gained between $65.5 billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's contributions when he was co-founding what ‌was then a startup from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion, Musk said in the federal court filing ahead of his trial ‌against the two companies.\n\n\"Without Elon Musk, there'd be no OpenAI. He provided the bulk of the seed funding, lent his reputation, and taught them all he knows about scaling a business. A pre-eminent expert quantified the value of that,\" Musk's lead trial lawyer Steven Molo said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment outside ⁠business hours on the amount of compensation ‌Musk is seeking.\n\nMICROSOFT AND OPENAI ALSO FILE SUITS\n\nDuring the week, OpenAI called the lawsuit \"baseless\" and part of a \"harassment\" campaign by Musk. A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence ‍that the company \"aided and abetted\" OpenAI.\n\nThe two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate filing on Friday.\n\nMusk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and runs xAI with its competitor chatbot Grok, alleges that ChatGPT operator OpenAI violated its founding mission in a high-profile ​restructuring to a for-profit entity.\n\nA judge in Oakland, California, ruled this month that a jury will hear the ‌trial, expected to start in April.\n\nMusk's filing says he contributed about $38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding, helped recruit staff, connect the founders with contacts and lend credibility to the project when it was created.\n\n\"Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor's initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned - and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much ⁠larger than Mr. Musk's initial contributions,\" Musk argues.\n\nThe filing says Musk's ​contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, ​financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.\n\nMusk may seek punitive damages and other penalties, including a possible injunction, if the jury finds either company liable, the filing says, without specifying what form any ‍injunction might take.\n\nIn their own ⁠filing, OpenAI and Microsoft asked the judge to limit what Musk's expert may present to jurors, arguing his analysis should be excluded as \"made up,\" \"unverifiable\" and \"unprecedented\" and as seeking an \"implausible\" transfer of billions from a nonprofit ⁠to a former donor-turned-competitor.",

    "fullText": "Progress of artificial general intelligence could stall, which may lead to a financial crash, says Yoshua Bengio, one of the ‘godfathers’ of modern AI\n\nWill the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) lead us to a land of financial plenty – or will it end in a 2008-style bust? Trillions of dollars rest on the answer.\n\nThe figures are staggering: an estimated $2.9tn (£2.2tn) being spent on datacentres, the central nervous systems of AI tools; the more than $4tn stock market capitalisation of Nvidia, the company that makes the chips powering cutting-edge AI systems; and the $100m signing-on bonuses offered by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to top engineers at OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nThese sky-high numbers are all propped up by investors who expect a return on their trillions. AGI, a theoretical state of AI where systems gain human levels of intelligence across an array of tasks and are able to replace humans in white-collar jobs such as accountancy and law, is a keystone of this financial promise.\n\nIt offers the prospect of computer systems carrying out profitable work without the associated cost of human labour – a hugely lucrative scenario for companies developing the technology and the customers who deploy it.\n\nThere will be consequences if AI companies fall short: US stock markets, boosted heavily by the performance of tech stocks, could fall and cause damage to people’s personal wealth; debt markets wrapped up in the datacentre boom could suffer a jolt that ripples elsewhere; GDP growth in the US, which has benefited from the AI infrastructure, could falter, which would have knock-on effects for interlinked economies.\n\nDavid Cahn, a partner at one leading Silicon Valley investment firm, Sequoia Capital, says tech companies now have to deliver on AGI.\n\n“Nothing short of AGI will be enough to justify the investments now being proposed for the coming decade,” he wrote in a blog published in October.\n\nIt means there is a lot hanging on progress towards advanced AI, and the trillions being poured into infrastructure and R&D to achieve it. One of the “godfathers” of modern AI, Yoshua Bengio, says the progress of AGI could stall and the outcome would be bad for investors.\n\n“There is a clear possibility that we will hit a wall, that there’s some difficulty that we don’t foresee right now, and we don’t find any solution quickly,” he says. “And that could be a real [financial] crash. A lot of the people who are putting trillions right now into AI are also expecting the advances to continue fairly regularly at the current pace.”\n\nBut Bengio, a prominent voice on the safety implications of AGI, is clear that continued progress towards a highly advanced state of AI is the more likely endgame.\n\n“Advances stalling is a minority scenario, like it’s an unlikely scenario. The more likely scenario is we continue to move forward,” he says.\n\nThe pessimistic view is that investors are backing an unrealistic outcome – that AGI will not happen without further breakthroughs.\n\nDavid Bader, the director of the institute for data science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, says trillions of dollars are being spent on scaling up – tech jargon for growing something quickly – the underlying technology for chatbots, known as transformers, in the expectation that increasing the amount of computing power behind current AI systems, by building more datacentres, will suffice.\n\n“If AGI requires a fundamentally different approach, perhaps something we haven’t yet conceived, then we’re optimising an architecture that can’t get us there no matter how large we make it. It’s like trying to reach the moon by building taller ladders,” he says.\n\nNonetheless, big US tech companies such as Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are ploughing ahead with datacentre plans with the financial cushion of being able to fund their AGI ambitions through the cash generated by their hugely profitable day-to-day businesses. This at least gives them some protection if the wall outlined by Bengio and Bader comes into view.\n\nBut there are other more worrying aspects to the boom. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, estimate that $2.9tn will be spent on datacentres between now and 2028, with half of that covered by the cashflow from “hyperscalers” such as Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nThe rest will have to be covered by alternative sources such as private credit, a corner of the shadow banking sector that is activating alarm bells at the Bank of England and elsewhere. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has borrowed $29bn from the private credit market to finance a datacentre in Louisiana.\n\nAI-related sectors account for approximately 15% of investment grade debt in the US, which is even bigger than the banking sector, according to the investment bank JP Morgan.\n\nOracle, which has signed a $300bn datacentre deal with OpenAI, has had an increase in credit default swaps, which are a form of insurance on a company defaulting on its debts. High-yield, or “junk debt”, which represents the higher-risk end of the borrowing market, is also appearing in the AI sector via datacentre operators CoreWeave and TeraWulf. Growth is also being funded by asset-backed securities – a form of debt underpinned by assets such as loans or credit card debt, but in this case rent paid by tech companies to datacentre owners – in a form of financing that has risen sharply in recent years.\n\nIt is no wonder that JP Morgan says the AI infrastructure boom will require a contribution from all corners of the credit market.\n\nBader says: “If AGI doesn’t materialise on expected timelines, we could see contagion across multiple debt markets simultaneously – investment-grade bonds, high-yield junk debt, private credit and securitised products – all of which are being tapped to fund this buildout.”\n\nShare prices linked to AI and tech are also playing an outsized role in US stock markets. The so-called “magnificent 7” of US tech stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia – account for more than a third of the value of the S&P 500 index, the biggest stock market index in the US, compared with 20% at the start of the decade.\n\nIn October the Bank of England warned of “the risk of a sharp correction” in US and UK markets due to giddy valuations of AI-linked tech companies. Central bankers are concerned stock markets could slump if AI fails to reach the transformative heights investors are hoping for. At the same time the International Monetary Fund said valuations were heading towards dotcom bubble-levels.\n\nEven tech execs whose companies are benefiting from the boom are acknowledging the speculative nature of the frenzy. In November Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said there are “elements of irrationality” in the boom and that “no company is going to be immune” if the bubble bursts, while Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has said the AI industry is in a “kind of industrial bubble”, and OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said “there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.”\n\nAll three, to be clear, are AI optimists and expect the technology to keep improving and benefit society.\n\nBut when the numbers get this big there are obvious risks in a bubble bursting, as Pichai admits. Pension funds and anyone invested in the stock market will be affected by a share price collapse, while the debt markets will also take a hit. There is also a web of “circular” deals, such as OpenAI paying Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares. If these transactions unravel due to a lack of take-up of AI, or that wall being hit, then it could be messy.\n\nThere are also optimists who argue that generative AI, the catch-all term for tools such as chatbots and video generators, will transform whole industries and justify the expenditure. Benedict Evans, a technology analyst, says the expenditure numbers are not outrageous in the context of other industries, such as oil and gas extraction which runs at $600bn a year.\n\n“These AI capex figures are a lot of money but it’s not an impossible amount of money,” he says.\n\nEvans adds: “You don’t have to believe in AGI to believe that generative AI is a big thing. And most of what is happening here is not, ‘oh wow they’re going to create God’. It’s ‘this is going to completely change how advertising, search, software and social networks – and everything else our business is based on – is going to work’. It’s going to be a huge opportunity.”\n\nNonetheless, there is a multitrillion dollar expectation that AGI will be achieved. For many experts, the consequences of getting there are alarming. The cost of not getting there could also be significant.",

    "fullText": "Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills aim to knock off the AFC’s top seed Saturday afternoon, facing the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.\n\nThe Broncos are -1.5 betting favorites at the best NFL betting sites.\n\nBelow, we will look at NFL player props for all of the top offensive players for the Bills and Broncos.\n\nOur computer projects big statistical games from James Cook, Khalil Shakir, Courtland Sutton, and Evan Engram.\n\nAllen Under 211.5 passing yards <<-110>>\n\nNix Over 210.5 passing yards <<-114>>\n\nCook Over 73.5 rushing yards <<-114>>\n\nHarvey Under 56.6 rushing yards <<-110>>\n\nShakir Over 49.5 receiving yards <<-110>>\n\nSutton Over 49.5 receiving yards <<-111>>\n\nKincaid Over 35.5 receiving yards <<-108>>\n\nEngram Over 20.5 receiving yards <<-110>>\n\nMake your postseason bets at FanDuel, America's No. 1 sportsbook! \n\nSportsbooks are giving Denver’s pass defense a ton of respect, but I’m not convinced it’s entirely warranted.\n\nThe Broncos looked like world-beaters against the likes of Trey Lance, Chris Oladokun, and Geno Smith, holding all three under 200 passing yards.\n\nWhen facing competent quarterbacks, however, yardage told a different story: Trevor Lawrence threw for 279 yards against Denver on Dec. 21, Jordan Love passed for 276 yards on Dec. 14, and even Marcus Mariota managed 294 yards through the air on Nov. 30.\n\nJosh Allen, a level or two above all of those QBs, showed last week that he can still rack up yardage, completing 28-of-35 passes for 273 yards against Jacksonville.\n\nI’ll start by disagreeing with the computer and take the Allen Over.\n\nCook has had an outstanding season, but this number feels a little too high against an excellent Denver front.\n\nSince Thanksgiving, the Broncos haven’t allowed a single running back to surpass 73.5 rushing yards. I expect Buffalo to focus on beating Denver through the air rather than on the ground, which likely limits Cook’s opportunities.\n\nI’ll disagree with the computer here and take the Under on Cook.\n\nThe Bills’ receiving corps has been decimated by injury, with both Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers tearing ACLs against Jacksonville.\n\nAs a result, all of Buffalo’s wide receivers should see increased targets. We already saw a sign of this last week: Shakir was targeted a season-high 12 times by Allen against the Jaguars, responding with 82 receiving yards.\n\nI’ll ride with the computer and take the Shakir Over.\n\nProjection: 37.1 receiving yards\n\nIn last year’s postseason matchup between the Bills and Broncos, Dalton Kincaid had 47 receiving yards.\n\nAllen’s trust in him has only grown this season, with the tight end averaging 43.5 receiving yards per game since the start of November.\n\nI’m on the side of our AI here. Take the Over.\n\nPredictions for every NFL Divisional Round game\n\nProjection: 218.0 passing yards\n\nA major reason the Broncos were non-competitive in last year’s 31-7 playoff loss to Buffalo was that Sean Payton didn’t trust Nix. The quarterback threw a season-low 22 passes in that game.\n\nFor context, Buffalo allowed Trevor Lawrence to pass for 207 yards last weekend. During the regular season, Denver’s passing output per game (223.9 yards) was nearly identical to Jacksonville’s (222.3).\n\nBecause I believe Payton will let Nix chuck it at least 30 times in this one, I like the Over (slightly). The computer and I agree.\n\nThis number is extremely high for Javonte Harvey, even against Buffalo’s porous run defense. Harvey became Denver’s lead back after Nov. 6, when JK Dobbins went down with an injury.\n\nIn the seven games since, he’s gone Over this number just twice.\n\nMeanwhile, coach Sean Payton has been giving more carries to 5-foot-7 back Jaleel McLaughlin. McLaughlin posted a season-high seven carries on Christmas against Kansas City, then added six carries for 41 yards on Jan. 4 against the Chargers.\n\nI’ll take the Harvey Under here, as will my computer pal.\n\nThe Broncos’ best win in the second half of the regular season came in a 34-26 victory over the Packers at Mile High. In that game, Nix targeted Sutton 10 times, and the receiver finished with 113 yards.\n\nBuffalo’s pass defense is impressive, but it’s not immune to big performances. Last week, Parker Washington racked up 107 yards, Tee Higgins had 92, Jaylen Waddle posted 84, and Stefon Diggs went for a whopping 146 yards against the Bills.\n\nI like Nix to target Sutton a ton, and the number is pretty low. The computer and I like the value on the Over.\n\nProjection: 25.2 receiving yards\n\nThe Bills do a tremendous job against opposing tight ends, allowing just 29.6 yards per game to the position during the regular season. In big games, they’ve been even more dominant.\n\nSince the start of December, Buffalo’s two biggest wins came against New England on Dec. 14 and Jacksonville in last week’s playoff matchup.\n\nThe Bills held Hunter Henry to just one catch for 18 yards against the Patriots and limited Brenton Strange to a season-low nine receiving yards versus the Jaguars.\n\nI’ll agree with the computer and take the Over.\n\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "description": "The CEO of a digital economy think tank said relying on identical AI tools can erode competitive edge and weaken firms' independence.",
    "fullText": "As companies rush to adopt AI to boost productivity and cut costs, they may be setting themselves up for a new problem: losing what makes them different.\n\nMehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, said widespread reliance on the same AI tools risks flattening competitive advantage across industries, because firms increasingly rely on identical systems to think, write, and decide for them.\n\nParyavi said that as AI tools become cheaper, more powerful, and more widely deployed, companies risk outsourcing the very thinking that once differentiated them.\n\nWhile AI can boost efficiency in the short term, he said, relying on shared models and standardized systems could leave businesses competing on cost and speed alone — eroding originality, strategic depth, and long-term advantage.\n\n\"If you and your competitor are all using the same service, you have no edge over each other,\" Paryavi told Business Insider.\n\n\"Their AI and your AI against each other — I don't know who's going to win.\"\n\nAs generative AI becomes embedded across workplaces, Paryavi warned that the biggest risk isn't automation — it's uniformity.\n\nWhen companies rely on the same large language models trained on the same data, decision-making, writing, and problem-solving can start to converge, shrinking the space for creative divergence.\n\nThat concern echoes warnings from researchers and academics who say AI can produce polished output at scale, but also flips human thinking by delivering fluent answers before understanding, creating an illusion of expertise that weakens judgment and depth.\n\nWhen everyone relies on the same models trained on the same data, Paryavi said, creative divergence shrinks.\n\n\"The beauty of our world is that we have different choices because we think differently,\" he said. \"That's where innovation comes from.\"\n\nIt's not just a question of companies all thinking the same — Paryavi warned that treating AI as a shortcut to efficiency can quietly hollow out human judgment, expertise, and control, leaving businesses faster in the short term but more fragile over time.\n\nOver time, Paryavi said, that shift can erode internal expertise and decision-making capacity.\n\n\"What they don't think about is that initially it might sound more efficient and more productive and cheaper,\" he said. \"But this is going to be very expensive down the line.\"\n\nOne risk, Paryavi said, is dependency. As firms replace employees with AI subscriptions, they become increasingly reliant on external vendors to function effectively.\n\nParyavi compared the AI boom to the early 2000s rush to cloud computing, when many companies initially adopted third-party infrastructure but later repatriated workloads in-house as costs, complexity, and vendor lock-in became concerns — a trend commonly referred to in tech as cloud repatriation.\n\nThe same dynamic could play out with AI, Paryavi said — except with even higher stakes. As companies downsize human teams, they also lose institutional knowledge and the ability to operate without automation, he said.\n\n\"You've killed all your chances of ever becoming independent as an organization,\" he said. \"You've fired your manpower. You've made them no good.\"\n\nAI, he said, is not inherently harmful. In fields such as medicine, scientific research, and disaster prediction, it can significantly accelerate progress.\n\nBut without clear guardrails, companies risk trading long-term resilience for short-term speed.\n\n\"It's a very powerful tool,\" Paryavi said, comparing AI to an atomic bomb. \"If that [an atomic bomb] can eliminate an entire population physically, this [AI] can eliminate humanity cognitively.\"",

    "title": "Here's what Wall Street bank CEOs are saying about head count in the age of AI",
    "description": "From JPMorgan to Citi, here's what industry leaders at are saying about how AI may impact jobs.",
    "fullText": "As banks reported earnings this week, CEOs dropped more insight into how generative AI could boost productivity, replace some roles, and keep head count from growing.\n\nBanks, many of which became bloated during the frenzied deal boom of the pandemic, have been slimming down their ranks over the last few years. It's becoming clearer that, despite dealmaking making a comeback, executives are signaling they want to do more with fewer people, leaning on AI to boost productivity and absorb additional work.\n\nWe've highlighted some of the most revealing comments from bank CEOs and CFOs on head count and AI.\n\nJamie Dimon has stuck to his trademark bluntness when talking about AI and jobs.\n\n\"It will eliminate jobs,\" Dimon said at a Fortune conference in December. \"People should stop sticking their heads in the sand.\"\n\nIn the near term, Dimon said in an interview with CNN that JPMorgan's head count remains steady, or even rises, as AI continues to roll out — if the bank does a \"good job.\"\n\nThe bigger promise is efficiency. \"It will affect every job,\" Dimon said at a 2024 Alliance Bernstein conference, describing a future where AI handles tasks like note-taking and summarization at the push of a button.\n\nThat efficiency could still mean more hiring in areas like cybersecurity, where Dimon says banks will need AI to counter increasingly sophisticated fraud.\n\nCFO Jeremy Barnum said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that the bank is allowing for some additional hiring in technology \"at the margin.\"\n\nOn that same call, however, Barnum said that, generally speaking, they \"want to make sure that when someone needs to get something done, whether it's in technology or elsewhere, their first reaction is not, 'Hire more people.'\" \n\nHe has previously said JPMorgan is asking people to \"resist head count growth where possible\" and focus instead on efficiency.\n\nThe head of JPMorgan's consumer business, Marianne Lake, has said operations staff could be 40% to 50% more productive over the next five years — a shift she said would lead to slower net head count growth, as each employee can handle far more work through automation, digital assistants, and self-service tools.\n\nDavid Solomon's most definitive statement about how AI will affect Goldman came in a memo he released in 2025 alongside the firm's president, John Waldron, and CFO Denis Coleman.\n\nThe memo, announcing the third iteration of the bank's cross-bank initiative OneGS, said that AI will drive efficiency at the firm, which will mean slowing hiring and reducing roles. (Goldman, with its yearly culling of some employees, is no stranger to job cuts.)\n\n\"We will constrain head count growth through the end of the year, in addition to a limited reduction in roles across the firm,\" the memo read. \"These targeted steps are consistent with our priorities of gaining more agility and creating the right team structures in order to implement effective AI solutions.\"\n\nDuring the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday, Solomon said that the firm plans to use AI to both cut costs and \"free up capacity to invest in other areas.\"\n\nSlowing hiring and increasing head count don't need to be contradictory; instead, Solomon has said the firm is focusing its hiring on the right talent.\n\n\"We need more high-value people,\" he told Axios in October. \"We can afford more high-value people to expand our footprint and continue to grow and broaden our business.\"\n\nHe has said he continues to believe that AI will grow the firm's head count over the next 10 years.\n\n\"There are obviously things where we're going to have a lot fewer people — but I'd love to have the capacity to go get more people to spend time with clients,\" Solomon said at a conference in 2025, noting that AI will have its most immediate impact on software development.\n\nCiti is in the midst of a multi-year turnaround led by the bank's CEO, Jane Fraser, to save roughly $2.5 billion and cut around 20,000 jobs.\n\nIn a memo sent to Citi's more than 200,000 employees on Wednesday, Fraser said she will \"expect to see the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away, and a more disciplined, more confident, winning Citi fully emerge in 2026.\"\n\nFraser said in the memo that, with AI and automation, some jobs will change, some will emerge, and \"others will no longer be required.\"\n\nDuring a media briefing ahead of the firm's fourth-quarter earnings call, Mark Mason, the outgoing CFO, said he expects head count to continue trending down \"as we continue to improve productivity and tools like AI.\"\n\nFraser has previously explained how AI was already increasing productivity.\n\n\"AI-driven automated code reviews have exceeded 1 million so far this year and are dramatically improving our developers' productivity,\" she said during the bank's 2025 third-quarter earnings call. \"This innovation alone saves considerable time and creates around 100,000 hours of weekly capacity.\"\n\nThe CEO also highlighted how AI is helping Citi's customer service teams resolve client inquiries faster, its wealth advisors provide more personalized advice, and the firm's plan to launch an agent-based AI pilot to tackle more complex tasks.\n\nWells Fargo has already shrunk its head count more than 25% since the second quarter of 2020, CEO Charles Scharf said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. He said that efficiency remains an \"ongoing focus\" for Wells Fargo.\n\nIn November, he told Reuters that the bank will likely \"have less head count as we look forward.\" He said the lower head count is an \"outcome\" of the firm's focus on areas where it's \"way too inefficient\" and \"way too bureaucratic.\" From 2018 to June of this year, the firm had an asset cap of $1.95 trillion, hindering its ability to grow.\n\nIn the same interview, Scharf called out those who are saying that AI won't reduce jobs.\n\n\"The opportunities that exist in AI are very significant, and anyone who sits here today and says that they don't think they'll have less head count because of AI either doesn't know what they're talking about or is just not being totally honest about it,\" he said.\n\nFollowing up on those comments in early December, Scharf clarified that most people know head count will dip, \"but they're afraid to say it, because no one wants to stand up and say that we should have — we're going to have lower head count in the future. It's a difficult thing to say.\"\n\nHe said that generative AI tools have already made Wells Fargo's engineers 30% to 35% more productive. While the bank hasn't cut coding jobs yet, the technology will eventually allow it to do more with fewer people across various functions, including compliance and legal, as well as call centers and even banking teams.\n\nBank of America has set a new industry standard, with a minimum wage of $25 an hour across the company. And while CEO Brian Moynihan conceded on a September 2025 Bloomberg TV interview that generative AI adoption has shrunk the size of some departments, the bank is focusing on training employees to do what LLMs cannot.\n\n\"The key to that is really redeploying people and re-skilling them,\" he said. \"We have to be more mindful about training them along multiple dimensions than we might have been two or three years ago.\"\n\nOn the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January, Moynihan teased how AI might make some tasks obsolete, though, saying that the bank has 18,000 people on the payroll who code.\n\n\"Using the AI techniques, we've taken 30% out of the coding part of the stream of introducing a new product,\" he said. \"That saves us about 2,000 people. So that's how we're applying it.\"\n\nAt the Goldman financial services conference in 2025, Moynihan said the bank is managing flat overall staffing levels by redeploying employees rather than hiring more, with AI playing a central role in absorbing the additional workload. He pointed to Erica, Bank of America's consumer-facing AI assistant, as a clear example of how that is playing out in practice.\n\nIn November, Moynihan said that the bank had 1.4 billion digital connections with its customers: \"We think it saves, today, about 11,000 FT equivalents.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick didn't explicitly address how AI is impacting head count during the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call, but said \"there is no more time to waste\" when it comes to the technology.\n\nThe firm's CFO, Sharon Yeshaya, mentioned a specific operations example where the firm has outsourced some work to AI: \"We used to have two teams necessarily checking each other on different documentation to make sure things are right. We now have one human team and one AI team.\"",
