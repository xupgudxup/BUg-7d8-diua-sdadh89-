    "fullText": "A report from Reuters claims that scientists in China have created a prototype of a machine that could eventually be used to produce semiconductor chips capable of powering artificial intelligence. Sources told the publication that a team in Shenzhen completed the prototype of an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine earlier this year and it is allegedly now undergoing testing. The EUV machine was reportedly made by former engineers from Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML. Reuters states that China is targeting production of its own EUV chips beginning in 2028, although other experts have projected 2030 as a more likely date.\n\nEUV is a supremely complicated bit of technology; we have an explainer below that gets into some of the details. It is at the heart of the chips made by companies such as Intel and TSMC, so any company trying to compete would also need access to EUV. Although the Chinese prototype is not yet making chips, it is reportedly able to generate the extreme ultraviolet light needed for chip manufacturing.\n\nIf confirmed, this development would put China in control of tech much sooner than analysts had previously expected. To date, EUV has largely been kept out of reach by Western companies and used as a bargaining chip by the US government. Chinese President Xi Jinping has placed a high priority on the country being able to produce its own semiconductors. \"The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,\" a source told Reuters. \"China wants the United States 100 percent kicked out of its supply chains.\"",

    "description": ": Apparently you’re about to get better advice on any identity issues lurking in your infrastructure",
    "fullText": "Cisco has decided its homegrown AI models are ready to power its products, starting with its Duo Identity Intelligence offering.\n\nThe model Cisco will use is called “Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct”. As described on the Hugging Face model-mart, it’s an open-weight, 8-billion-parameter instruction-tuned “Auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture,” namely Meta Llama-3.1-8B backbone.\n\nCisco tuned the model for cybersecurity applications and optimized it for three uses:\n\nIn a Tuesday post, Cisco revealed it’s using the model with Duo Identity Intelligence, a service that analyzes who logs on to networks, where they log on from, and which devices they use.\n\n“By examining post authentication signals, the system identifies patterns that traditional access controls often miss, including unusual geographic activity, abnormal privilege usage, and indications of MFA fatigue attempts or session hijacking,” Cisco explained.\n\nThe product alerts users to potential identity issues in a weekly email digest that Cisco will now compose with help from its new model.\n\n“Producing such a digest requires an artificial intelligence model that understands identity behavior, can interpret long chains of events, and communicates insights in a way that aligns with how security administrators make decisions,” Cisco’s post states, adding that general-purpose models “are not always tuned for the nuance and precision required for identity security and often introduce external dependencies.”\n\nUsing its own model, Cisco says, will deliver “summaries that are more accurate, more readable, and more aligned with real security workflows.”\n\nThe company also says the content of the digests will become “noticeably stronger … clearer and more consistent. Prioritization improves, making it easier to identify what demands immediate attention. Insights feel more relevant to each environment, and recommendations are expressed in a more actionable way.” Cisco reckons you’ll therefore end up using Identity Intelligence more often, because the model will produce info that demands action.\n\nThe improved digest is the result of collaboration between the teams that develop Duo and Cisco’s foundation models.\n\n“Both groups created a tuned prompt stack that significantly improved output quality and aligned the model with the analytical style expected in the digest,” Cisco’s post states.\n\nOver 2,000 Cisco customers receive the digest. If you’re one of them, let us know if the weekly email has improved!\n\nThe model can run on-prem or in the cloud, and do much more than write nice email digests. Cisco says its downstream uses include:\n\nIn early November, Cisco told The Register it’s working on a 17-billion parameter foundation model, and “a whole phalanx” of other AI. Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct seems to come from the phalanx, as while it is a foundation model it is nine billion parameters short of the forthcoming model Cisco mentioned.®",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "fullText": "Another day, another update that's giving investors anxiety about the AI trade.\n\nThe US tech sector was under pressure on Wednesday as traders took in a report from The Financial Times that said Blue Owl Capital wouldn't back a $10 billion data center the company was planning to build in Michigan for OpenAI.\n\nOracle shares led the broader market lower, falling as much as 6% Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed more than 1%.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly around 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday:\n\nHere were the other notable moves in the market:\n\nThe latest developments extend a broader rotation out of the market's most expensive tech stocks and into other parts of the market.\n\nThe enthusiasm for AI has dampened particularly in the past week, Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Additionally, rotation pressure out of tech has accelerated, with positioning data showing rising demand for smaller-cap and value stocks,\" Turnquist said of the latest market moves.\n\nThe FT's report said that talks between Oracle and Blue Owl Capital stalled over the planned data center. The private credit firm will not move forward with funding the project due to concerns about Oracle's hefty AI spending and growing debts, sources told the outlet.\n\nOracle disputed the contents of the FT report.\n\n\"The FT story is incorrect. Our development partner, Related Digital, selected the best equity partner from a competitive group of options, which in this instance was not Blue Owl. Final negotiations for their equity deal are moving forward on schedule and according to plan,\" Michael Egbert, a spokesperson for Oracle, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for the AI trade, but particularly for Oracle. After impressing investors with an aggressive revenue forecast, the stock has declined steadily in the last two months as the company stokes more concerns about the large amounts of debt coursing through the AI space. Shares are down 45% from their peak in early September.\n\nOracle recently triggered another sell-off in tech after reporting lower-than-expected earnings and pledging to increase its capital expenditures more than expected in the coming year.\n\nCoreWeave is the other prominent tech name to join Oracle recently as a poster child of investors' growing anxieties about the health of the AI trade. Similar to Oracle, CoreWeave has spooked investors with its high debt load and reliance on a handful of customers. As of Wednesday afternoon, the stock is down 66% from its post-IPO high reached in June.",

Prasad was elevated to report directly to Jassy in 2023 to lead the AGI team, which was tasked with developing Amazon's \"most ambitious\" AI models, Business Insider reported at the time.\n\nSince then, Prasad helped launch Amazon's Nova family of AI models. Although Nova models earned some praise for their efficiency, they still trail frontier models such as OpenAI's GPT offerings, Anthropic's Claude Opus, and Google's Gemini.\n\nAs part of the shake-up, Amazon is creating a new organization under Peter DeSantis, AWS's SVP of Utility Computing, Jassy said. The group will oversee Amazon's AGI and AI model initiatives as well as its silicon chip and quantum computing efforts.\n\nJassy also said that Pieter Abbeel, the co-founder of robotics startup Covariant, who joined Amazon last year, will now lead the company's frontier AI model research team.\n\nPrasad's departure is the latest in a series of leadership changes at AWS. Over the past year, the company has seen several executives depart, including VP of AI Matt Wood and VP of generative AI Vasi Philomin, while bringing in new talent such as former Microsoft executive Julia White as chief marketing officer.\n\nAWS also recently hired David Richardson as VP of AgentCore and Joe Hellerstein as Vice President and Distinguished Scientist, and added Chet Kapoor as VP of security services and observability.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "'Digital worker' is, in fact, a fitting neologism for the AI agent...",
    "fullText": "Hey AI Agent Developer - yes, you. What is the value you create? Let's find out.\n\nThe Skeptic's Take: Useful vs. Intelligent\n\nOn the spectrum of \"Is AI intelligent and able to reason?\", I fall on the skeptical side. But is it useful? Absolutely. We have built a few AI workflows, and they have unlocked superior automation. Evidently, the world is currently witnessing the transformative potential of AI agents in customer support and coding, to some degree.\n\nTake customer support, for instance. If AI agents help each support employee handle 30% more tickets, that's like adding 30 new hires to a 100-person team, without the cost. For a $100M company, this efficiency gain could translate to $20-30M in additional enterprise value (EV), under sweeping assumptions. The difference in EV between pre- and post-AI agents is the Value you create. Alternatively, one could also use operating income for a flow perspective.\n\n'Digital worker' is, in fact, a fitting neologism for the AI agent. I take the view here that human workers, together with digital workers, can do more, creating abundance. As AI agent developers, we should be asking:\n\nOutcomes Matter. Internals Don't.\n\nThere are two parts to our first question: First, what an AI agent or a workflow does internally, for instance, the number of reasoning steps involved, is irrelevant. However, measuring outcomes such as the number of support tickets resolved or the number of successful hires is directly proportional to the value we want to measure. Second, what share do we take? Simply going by the 10x rule of SaaS pricing guidelines, we can claim one-tenth of what we measured. Thus, measuring outcomes becomes imperative. We have built Valmi to ingest outcomes as the first step. The added complexity that Valmi addresses is where legacy billing systems sputter.\n\nWhy Legacy Billing Systems Don't Cut It\n\nLet's start with the cost argument. Building AI systems is expensive. There are ineffective paths in workflows and autonomous agents that simply fail. LLM costs hit COGS linearly, whereas the marginal cost in traditional SaaS systems is negligible. SaaS generates ~70% gross margins. While cost is an important element in the case of AI agents, legacy systems, such as Stripe and Zuora, are inadequate to capture it.\n\nSecondly, the pricing model. The seat-based model works against selling AI agents, since the seat-based model is under attack from two forces. One is the decrease in the number of human workers required. By pricing against seats, you are setting your AI agents up for decline, not for growth. The other is worse: It does not capture the human-equivalent value, as discussed above. Even the usage-based models that legacy systems support do not distinguish between activity and outcomes.\n\nTo effectively price AI agents, we need to measure outcomes, and observe and allocate costs. To evaluate margin contraction, we also need to understand where outcomes and costs diverge, including in aggregate, for which agents and for which customer instances. Therefore, the top AI agent developers who use outcome-billing, such as Harvey, Sierra and Usepropane, put together two sources: one to track cost information and the other to measure value. And they unified these two sources of information in a single system. Valmi helps you do that very easily. You can bring up the whole billing infrastructure on your premises. We have made it available under a permissive license. No need to do it yourself.\n\nThe Unreliability Problem (And How to Sell Despite It)\n\nOutcome measurement serves a greater purpose. AI is unreliable and not deterministic. We simply do not understand when it succeeds and when it fails. Consequently, it is incumbent upon the buyer of your AI agents to demand proof of value. It is simply easier for you to convince and onboard buyers if you switch to outcome-billing. Why? You assume the risk of failure of your AI agents. But, the buyer simply pays for agent's performance and pays nothing for its failure. To prove the value and help you convince your buyers, Valmi supports customer dashboards that show outcomes such as ticket resolution percentage. Your buyers can view and embed these dashboards in their workflows.\n\nTo sum it up, we have built Valmi, and made available open-source SDKs and free to deploy packages, to address the imperative for your AI agents. It solves outcome-billing that provides proof of value and cost tracking that exposes margin contraction. It lets you simulate and set prices for your AI agents and quickly onboard your customers. We understand hybrid models, combining seat-based, activity and outcomes, will be required in the transitory phase of billing models. Valmi supports all of these as well. Try it out for free or deploy it within your premises.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to put a halt to the multi-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure buildout — at least for now.\n\nIn a video posted to social media on Tuesday, the Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate said he would begin pushing for a national moratorium on the construction of AI data centers.\n\nHe argued that AI, which he called one of the most \"transformative technologies in the history of humanity,\" is moving too rapidly for lawmakers and citizens to keep up.\n\n\"This moratorium will give democracy a chance to catch up with the transformative changes that we are witnessing and make sure that the benefits of these technologies work for all of us, not just the wealthiest people on Earth,\" Sanders said.\n\nWhile Sanders is not the only AI critic on Capitol Hill, his planned proposal would go further than most. He is likely the first national politician to call for a moratorium on the construction of data centers, which are the primary infrastructure needed to support the expansion of AI.\n\nMajor tech firms like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Apple have collectively spent hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 on capital expenditures — much of it going toward the chips, servers, and data centers that form the backbone of the AI boom. And they've told investors that they expect to spend even more AI spending in 2026.\n\n\"This process is moving very, very quickly, and we need to slow it down,\" Sanders said. \"We need all of our people, all of our people involved in determining the future of AI, and not just a handful of multi-billionaires.\"\n\nI will be pushing for a moratorium on the construction of data centers that are powering the unregulated sprint to develop & deploy AI.\n\nThe moratorium will give democracy a chance to catch up, and ensure that the benefits of technology work for all of us, not just the 1%. pic.twitter.com/PoV5ziA4oQ\n\nThe Democratic socialist senator listed three major reasons for slowing down the advancement of AI: the fact that it's being promoted by wealthy tech titans, the potential for AI-driven job losses, and the technology's impact on human interaction.\n\n\"Think for a moment about a future when human beings are not interacting with each other and are spending virtually all of their time with devices instead of people,\" Sanders said. \"Is that the kind of future you want? Well, not me.\"\n\nAt this point, it's unlikely that Sanders's vision comes to fruition.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has taken the opposite path, encouraging the rapid construction of data centers in a bid to win the AI race with China.\n\nBut skepticism of AI is continuing to grow on Capitol Hill, with some lawmakers warning about a potential AI bubble and others aiming to limit minors' use of AI chatbots.",

    "description": "AI is accelerating the shift toward skills-based hiring, and in the process reshaping how companies go about recruiting.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence is driving a shift in what companies look for in new hires.\n\nWhile experience has always been a key factor for job seekers, education level matters less and less compared to skill set, enabling companies to \"expand their talent pipelines and keep pace with roles that evolve faster than traditional education can,\" says Lauren Winans, CEO at human resources consulting firm Next Level Benefits.\n\nAI is accelerating the trend, as more organizations seek data science, machine learning, data analytics, and related skills — skills that you essentially learn through doing and repetition, not by going to class.\n\nIndeed, several companies, including Google and IBM, have dropped their degree requirements for some roles in favor of skills-based hiring.\n\nPlus, a quarter of employers said they planned to stop requiring bachelor's degrees this year, instead prioritizing relevant experience, according to a 2025 ResumeTemplates survey of 1,000 US hiring managers.\n\nSkills-based hiring is an \"operational necessity,\" as organizations adopt AI initiatives and require staff to design, build, and manage AI systems and processes, says Anthony Donnarumma, CEO of the recruiting agency 24 Seven.\n\nPlus, relying on skills over degrees reduces the time it takes to fill roles and improves productivity because applicants are \"job-ready,\" he says.\n\nIt also helps organizations remain agile and adapt to changing demands, adds Lisa Highfield, principal director of research and advisory services at McLean & Company, an HR research and consulting firm.\n\nA skills-based approach creates new opportunities for employees, too, Highfield says. It can increase workforce diversity and create paths for career advancement, Winans adds.\n\n\"Workers are able to compete on the value of their skills — not their resume format or educational history — which can lead to better job matches, higher engagement, and longer-term career growth,\" Donnarumma says.\n\nAt the other end, AI-based screening and hiring tools are offering companies ways to automate skill-based hiring, says Kara Ayers, senior vice president of global talent acquisition for Xplor Technologies, a payment and commerce software company that's already made the shift, prioritizing skills, experience, and potential over college degrees in its new hires — and using AI to do it.\n\nXplor Technologies began using the AI-powered applicant tracking system SmartRecruiters in 2022 to help them organize and classify the skills needed for each role, Ayers says.\n\n\"These tools allow us to analyze resumes and profiles for competencies rather than filtering by degree, and we use AI-driven predictive analytics to match candidates based on skills alignment and potential,\" she explains.\n\nSince adopting this approach, Ayers says the company has reduced its reliance on recruiting agencies, saving about $3 million. It also fills roles faster — often in under 30 days, compared to more than 60 days in the past — and has improved the quality of new hires, who are now better matched to a role's competencies.\n\nThat said, using AI to review applicants based on skills depends on organizations having \"a clean, well-structured framework, consistent job architecture, reliable performance data, and HR systems that can integrate skills analytics into hiring workflows,\" Winans says.\n\nThey also need data showing the skills they already have and what they need for the future, Highfield says. And historical workforce data showing how people succeed within the company, Donnarumma adds.\n\nTransitioning to skills-based hiring can be time and resource-intensive, Highfield says. Leadership teams also may need to rethink their traditional hiring practices and beliefs about the value of degrees, Donnarumma says.\n\nAI gives companies tools to build a process that's \"more accurate, more inclusive, and far more aligned with the future of work,\" Donnarumma says.\n\nHowever, AI bias remains a \"real concern,\" he says. Organizations must incorporate governance into AI-driven hiring, including ensuring team members understand AI and can manage its use effectively and objectively.\n\nAyers says it's crucial to highlight the benefits of AI while also emphasizing governance.\n\n\"It is important to be thoughtful about how AI is used and to thoroughly vet the tools in place,\" she says. \"Both candidates and companies should maintain authenticity and find the right balance in how much they rely on AI.\"",

    "fullText": "Universities risk surrendering their intellectual autonomy to Silicon Valley's influence as they rush to adopt AI, one professor says.\n\nIn an essay for the Civics of Technology Project — an education platform analyzing technology's societal impact — Bruna Damiana Heinsfeld, an assistant professor of learning technologies at the University of Minnesota, said that colleges are allowing Big Tech to reshape what counts as knowledge, truth, and academic value.\n\nFrom multimillion-dollar partnerships with AI vendors to classrooms infused with corporate branding, she said, universities are shifting toward a model where technological tools are bundled with the identity of the companies behind them.\n\nAs academic leaders scramble to look \"AI-ready,\" Heinsfeld warned that the sector is drifting from critical inquiry toward compliance, risking a future in which Silicon Valley, not educators, sets the terms of learning.\n\nHeinsfeld said AI tools promote a worldview where efficiency is presumed to be a virtue, scale is inherently desirable, and data becomes the default language of truth.\n\nUniversities adopting these systems without critical examination risk teaching students that the logic of Big Tech is not merely useful but inevitable, she added.\n\nHeinsfeld pointed to California State University as an example of that shift on full display.\n\nThe university signed a $16.9 million contract in February to roll out ChatGPT Edu across 23 campuses, providing more than 460,000 students and 63,000 faculty and staff with access to the tool through mid-2026.\n\nIt hosted an AWS-powered \"AI camp\" in the summer, where students arrived to find Amazon branding everywhere, including corporate slogans, AWS notebooks, and promotional swag.\n\nAnother academic said the problem is already playing out in the day-to-day mechanics of learning.\n\nKimberley Hardcastle, a business and marketing professor at Northumbria University in the UK, told Business Insider that universities must overhaul how they design assessments now that students' \"epistemic mediators\" — the tools that help them make sense of the world — have fundamentally changed.\n\nHardcastle advocates requiring students to demonstrate their reasoning: how they arrived at a conclusion, which sources they consulted beyond AI, and how they verified information against primary evidence, she said.\n\nShe said students also need deliberate \"epistemic checkpoints,\" moments designed into coursework where they must pause and ask: \"Am I using this tool to enhance my thinking or replace it? Have I engaged with the underlying concepts or just the AI's summary? Do I understand, or am I just recalling information?\"\n\nFor Heinsfeld, the risk is that corporations will dictate what constitutes legitimate knowledge. For Hardcastle, it's that students will no longer understand how to assess truth for themselves.\n\nBoth say universities must remain the space where students are taught to think, not just how to operate tools.\n\n\"Education should remain the space where we confront the architectures of our tools,\" Heinsfeld wrote. Otherwise, \"it risks becoming the laboratory of the very systems it should critique.\"\n\nHardcastle made a similar point, adding that this future will be shaped not only by institutional decisions but by every moment a student accepts an AI-generated answer without knowing how to question it.",

Not only do they need to have coding skills, but they also must know how to operate vibecoding tools and stay up to date with new AI models.\n\nAnthropic leader Boris Cherny looks for something else: \"Side quests.\"\n\n\"When I hire engineers, this is definitely something I look for,\" he said on \"The Peterman Pod.\"\n\nCherny's definition of side quests includes \"cool weekend projects,\" like someone who's \"really into making kombucha.\" It's a sign that the engineer is curious and interested in other things, he said.\n\nMuch of Cherny's own growth came from his side projects. Cherny is now a key figure at Anthropic. He created Claude Code, a tool that is now popular with engineers across the country.\n\n\"These are well-rounded people,\" he said. \"These are the kind of people I enjoy working with.\"\n\nCherny also said he prefers that his new hires be \"generalists.\"\n\nHe gave the example of an engineer who can code, but is also able to work on product and design. That all-star engineer also seeks out user feedback.\n\n\"This is how we recruit for all functions, now,\" he said. \"Our project managers code, our data scientists code, our user researcher codes a little bit.\"\n\nCherny isn't alone in pushing for jobs to become more generalist. Figma CEO Dylan Field said in October that AI was causing job titles to merge, resulting in everyone being a \"product builder.\"\n\nWhat else is Anthropic looking for? For some time, it monitored whether candidates use AI in their applications.\n\nIn May, Business Insider reported that Anthropic asked candidates for certain jobs not to use AI in their written responses so the company could test their \"non-AI-assisted communication skills.\"\n\nAnthropic changed its policy in July, allowing candidates to seek out assistance from Claude.\n\nFor the younger engineers, a job at Anthropic may be hard to come by. In May, CPO Mike Krieger said on \"Hard Fork\" that he was focused on hiring experienced engineers — and had \"some hesitancy\" with entry-level workers.\n\nOn the podcast, Cherny said that his love of generalists came from his career trajectory. Working at startups since 18, Cherny had to do everything, he said.\n\n\"At big companies, you get forced into this particular swim lane,\" he said. \"It's just so artificial.\"",

    "title": "How ChatGPT's New Image Generator Stacks Up Against Gemini's Nano Banana Pro",
    "description": "Get ready for the battle of the next-gen AI image editors.",
    "fullText": "Following the major image editing upgrades added to Google Gemini back in August—under the whimsical codename Nano Banana—it's OpenAI's turn to supercharge the tools you get for image manipulations inside ChatGPT. The new update is called GPT Image 1.5, and is rolling out now for all users.\n\nOne of the key improvements here, as was the case with Nano Banana, is the way that ChatGPT can now edit a specific part of an image while keeping everything else consistent. You can add or remove something, or change the color or style of something, without ending up with an entirely different looking picture.\n\nAnother feature ChatGPT has now borrowed from Gemini: the ability to combine multiple images together in one scene. Want you and your best friend in front of Sydney Harbour Bridge? No problem—just supply the source pictures and the AI will do the rest. You can also change visual styles while maintaining consistent details.\n\nOpenAI says the new image editor and generator is able to follow instructions \"more reliably,\" and render pictures up to four times faster than before. Text can be more varied in style and size, and images should be more realistic and error-free in general—though OpenAI also admits there's still room for improvement.\n\nIt's the best image generator tool we've ever seen in ChatGPT, and it all looks impressive at first glance—but how does it stack up in practice against Gemini and Nano Banana? I put the two models to the test via the $20-per-month plan on both platforms (that's ChatGPT Plus and Google AI Pro, respectively) to see how they compared.\n\nOpen up ChatGPT on the web or on mobile and you'll see there's a new Images tab on the left-hand navigation pane. This takes you to a library of your existing pictures, together with some new prompts for creating images. You get some suggestions for prompts, plus an assortment of preset portrait image styles you can apply.\n\nI tested out the new GPT Image 1.5 model by getting ChatGPT to generate a busy tech journalist, a lamp in the middle of an empty warehouse, and a cartoon-style rolling landscape of hills in the fog. I then got Gemini to create the same pictures with the same prompts. While the results were pretty varied, in terms of quality and realism they were pretty equal—the occasional issue with weird physics and repetition, but nothing too bad.\n\nBoth ChatGPT and Gemini are now quite competent at clean image edits, too: Both AI bots seamlessly switched the journalist's clothing to a shirt and tie without touching any other part of the picture. This would have taken a significant amount of time to do manually, even by a Photoshop expert, and shows just how transformative AI imaging is becoming.\n\nColor changes were all handled with aplomb, but the AIs struggled a bit with perspective changes, where I asked to see the same shot from another angle. In these cases, instructions were less well-followed and the images were less consistent (as new areas needed to be rendered), though ChatGPT did a little better than Gemini at getting good results.\n\nThe classic \"remove an object from this picture\" challenge was handled with aplomb: Both Gemini and ChatGPT were able to remove a cottage from the countryside scene with surgical precision, leaving everything else intact. Again, these are the kind of time-intensive image edits that would previously have needed a lot of careful effort, and that can now be done in seconds.\n\nAnother talent ChatGPT and Gemini now have is being able to combine images together. So you can have separate photos of you and your parents, put them together in the same shot, and then add in a background of wherever you like. You can get perfect family photos without actually gathering together your relatives together or going anywhere.\n\nThis was an area where Gemini and ChatGPT did struggle a bit more: The editing dexterity was still impressive, but the results didn't always look like a single, coherent scene. Lighting is sometimes off, or elements from different images appear at different scales, and you'll have to do a bit more tweaking and editing and reprompting to get everything right.\n\nChatGPT did fare slightly better at blending different images and elements together, and changing the overall look of a picture. When I tried to get the AIs to mix all my images together in a moody film noir shot, ChatGPT produced something pretty consistent—the Gemini effort looked a lot more like a cut-and-paste job.\n\nIt can be fun remixing photos again and again—adding new people, changing the weather, moving the location—and both these bots are now capable of some rather incredible results. Remixing photos of family and friends will be popular, but it's not all that easy: With people you know, any generative AI that gets added tends to look wrong, because neither ChatGPT nor Gemini knows exactly what these people look like, how they smile, how they're built, or how they tend to stand or sit.\n\nIn terms of ChatGPT vs. Gemini, they're both at a high level now—a level that puts advanced Photoshop-style editing capabilities at everyone's fingertips. If either AI model has the edge right now, it's ChatGPT's, but there's not much in it. It's also going to be fascinating to see where these image editing capabilities go next.",

Alphabet is the top performer with an advance of 62% amid optimism on its new Gemini 3 model.\n\nIn turn, the valuation of the S&P 500 has reached a level even most bulls would agree is on the rich side.

    "fullText": "Commons committee monitoring revolving door that gave jobs to George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Tony Blair\n\nWhen the billionaire chief executive of AI chipmaker Nvidia threw a party in central London for Donald Trump’s state visit in September, the power imbalance between Silicon Valley and British politicians was vividly exposed.\n\nJensen Huang hastened to the stage after meetings at Chequers and rallied his hundreds of guests to cheer on the power of AI. In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.\n\n“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.\n\nBut his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.\n\nStarmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.\n\nNot done, Huang called on to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.\n\nThis week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn Chat GPT maker Open AI hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.\n\nHe was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.\n\nThey followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that but said he was paid “extremely well”.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.\n\nTBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.\n\nThe Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is currently investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”\n\nJobs with the biggest US AI companies can be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also require comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI to inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.\n\nSelling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.\n\nBritain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.\n\nThe revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco start-up incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.\n\nCivil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year took a senior director general role in the government’s digital service.",

Two: what they do is so pointless and embarrassing that they dare not spell it out in plain English. “We forge marketing systems at the forefront of the online wellness space” translates to something like “we use ChatGPT to sell dodgy supplements”.\n\nBut understanding what so many businesses actually do is the least of my worries. I’m currently among the 5% of Brits who are unemployed. In my six months of job hunting, my total lack of success has begun to make me question my own existence. Just like when you repeat a word over and over until it loses all meaning, when you apply repeatedly for jobs in a similar field, the semantics of the entire situation begin to fall apart like a snotty tissue. About one in five of my job applications elicit a rejection email, usually bemoaning the sheer number of “quality applicants” for the position. For the most part, though – nothing. It’s almost like the job never existed in the first place, and it’s possible that it didn’t.\n\nIn 2024, 40% of companies posted listings for “ghost jobs”, nonexistent positions advertised to create the illusion that the company is doing well enough to take on new employees. And this seems like an all-too-easy way to lie about your success. Regulation of job ads is mostly the remit of the Advertising Standards Authority, which – in all its might – has the power to … have a misleading job ad taken down. So with no particularly harsh consequences for employers, why not go on a pretend hiring spree? Ethics in the job market seem to have gone out the window, and the idea of wasting the time of thousands of hapless jobseekers doesn’t seem to matter much.\n\nEven if the job you’re applying for exists, next comes the hurdle of the AI HR bot. While it’s difficult to find any hard data on just how many employers are using AI to filter applications (sometimes favouring men over women, if a now-scrapped algorithm used by Amazon is anything to go by), articles and Reddit threads about how to game the bots and get in the right “key words” now abound. According to an Atlantic article from earlier this year: “Young people are using ChatGPT to write their applications; HR is using AI to read them; no one is getting hired.” And let’s say your CV and cover letter do make it past the robot gatekeepers, it’s possible that your interview will be conducted by yet another bot. Although I haven’t had the pleasure of an interview, AI or otherwise, since I began my latest job search, the possibility of not coming into contact with a single human during most of the process to becoming the dodgy supplements social media marketing manager looms large and dreadful.\n\nWhile this scramble for jobs is mostly being framed as a problem for graduates, I can confirm – as someone who graduated 15 years ago bang into a recession – not only is this the worst job market I’ve ever seen, but it’s also impacting people like me with many years’ experience. During my last period of job hunting, about three years ago, I was at least getting interviews. Interviews with humans, to boot. Given all the skilled people I know who can’t seem to land interviews for even entry-level positions, I’m certain that I’m not an outlier. I’m also convinced that we’re facing a crisis in which middle-class jobs have mutated into rare and disturbing beasts.\n\nWhen, according to its job ad, an indie pet food company called something like Flopsies is looking for a “rock star” and a “unicorn” to revolutionise its social media presence, you know that the job market has become high on its own farts. Ill-defined franken-jobs, requiring everything from SEO expertise to video-editing skills (all for a salary of £27,000 and free protein bars that taste like hay) require cult-like dedication. First, you must convince the fine people at Flopsies that it has been your dream since exiting your mother’s birth canal to sell pet food. You would cut off your own hands for the privilege, and quickly learn to write copy for them by smashing your face into a keyboard. You will convey this in a 400-word cover letter, written in your own blood. This cover letter will then be redirected into the ether by an AI filter, because you didn’t use the phrase “optimising algorithmic relevancy” in it. You will never hear from Flopsies again. You will start this process again and repeat it until you are seen fit for an interview in which you have a few minutes to convince a bot that you’re fit for purpose as both a worker and a human being.\n\nThe hiring process has become so mechanised, both figuratively and literally, that it’s hard to believe that the people who end up being hired aren’t merely the best at gaming the system. And frankly, all power to them. It’s no skin off my nose if the dodgy supplement or pet-food jobs go to people who are incredible at creating the illusion that they live and breathe pet food and/or dodgy supplements. But in this oh-so-streamlined process, what happens to those of us who can’t or won’t play the game? Of all the applications I’ve sent out recently, I wonder how many have been looked at by humans. There’s only so much shouting into the void about your ability to use a CMS you can do before you give up and start Googling things like: “Can I sell a kidney on Vinted?”\n\nEleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and Diva",

    "fullText": "Family members can be sweet and relentless but how can we aid our relatives in the age of new tech and device addiction\n\nDon’t get The Long Wave delivered to your inbox? \nI don’t want to sound dramatic but, a few weeks ago, something happened that has completely changed how I view online material. I fell for AI-generated content. For someone who is constantly squabbling with older relatives about how little they question what they see online, this was a profoundly unsettling and humbling experience. And it made me think about how, during this holiday period, we could all use this as an opportunity to approach those conversations with the “WhatsApp aunties” more sensitively.\n\nFrom ‘WhatsApp Aunties’ to ‘AI Aunties’\n\nI think I have the perfect sample of WhatsApp aunties. Sadly displaced from Sudan due to war, a permanently online group of women, some direct aunts, some not, but all aunties nonetheless, sit in a control room of sorts in their different cities and send out daily broadcasts that simulate as much as possible the interactions and updates they would have shared had they still been living in the same place. They even have office hours. One can divine the start of the day in their respective locations as they clock in and the forwards begin: First, it is morning greetings, maybe an embellished picture of Quranic verses or a graphic of flowers, wishing you a good day.\n\nThen, the hardcore stuff. Snippets of videos from war zones back home, clipped debates between political antagonists, and sometimes entire YouTube episodes of interviews. After this news shift comes the lighter one (secretly my favourite): TikTok and Instagram reels of Arab celebrities with too much plastic surgery accompanied by scream emojis, footage from family and friend weddings across the world, captioned with love heart eyes. The stream is interspersed with the longest voice memos you will ever receive, asking how you are and telling you how they are with an introductory and concluding prayer session. It is sweet and relentless.\n\nAll of this is dumped with an abandon that suggests no understanding of or respect for phone memory limitations. Whenever my mother casually mentions that her phone is acting up and mutters something about no space, my heart sinks. I know that hours and hours of deletions of grainy videos are upon me. But most galling is how much fake content it includes. The WhatsApp aunties have become AI aunties. This was frankly a problem even before AI became so sophisticated, but it is now much, much worse. There is the harmless stuff; cats hugging babies or penguins feeding themselves with cutlery. I try not to get too agitated by this or point out that it’s fake. But when it’s videos of Taylor Swift endorsing the pro-Palestine movement, it’s impossible to let it slide.\n\nThe result is a series of exchanges that are both saddening and enraging. Aunties will either take it personally, like I am disrespecting them by implying they can’t tell what’s real or not, and double down. Or they will express genuinely innocent beliefs in the veracity of online content, imbuing the internet with the same standards of TV or radio they grew up with.\n\nTelling the aunties that something is entirely fake is like asking them to imagine a TV news broadcast is not real. Also, they are actually receiving news broadcast clips on their phones that are not real. You end up sounding like the crazy one, trying to explain that a living, breathing, walking, talking person is just pixels generated from prompts.\n\nIn a recent episode of Subway Takes, comedian Ola Labib said we shouldn’t try to convince elders that AI content isn’t real. Her argument: Let them have their little comforts. I kind of get that, what harm is it doing really? But there is an emotional element to it as well. Policing elders’ content feels to me like a manifestation of a deep-seated fear that they’re losing it, that their faculties are waning, as they succumb to old age and the bewildering assaults of new tech and device addiction. I think it is truly distressing for people to see parents and relatives increasingly become addicted to their phones and become slightly addled, a window into a sort of premature senility.\n\nBut there are social and political reasons too, for pushing back. Aunties (and, to a lesser degree, uncles) have a huge amount of disseminative power and a lot of free time. They wield a formidable authority, particularly in diaspora communities, both as enforcers of values, as organisers and sponsors of social events, and generally as gatekeepers of community interactions and upholders of norms. Collectively and individually, they are forces to be reckoned with, which makes disagreements even more challenging and fraught with risks of falling foul of powerful elders. But they are force multipliers in terms of spreading fake content that is politically inflammatory or conspiratorial, and when unchallenged, they contribute to the general degradation of the information ecosystem and its associated political fallout.\n\nSo, I would say talk to them, keep talking to them, but do it kindly, with time and explanation, rather than frustration and bewilderment. Maybe just acknowledge the content first before pointing out its fakery – a “really cool!” followed a little while later with a “actually, do you think that’s real? I’m not sure”. Also, furnish them with the “tells”: video glitches, lack of shadows, weird blinking. Bear in mind what the world looks like to them. It is a place that is changing too rapidly to assimilate how it is happening. Our elders are also, simply, getting older. With that comes all sorts of uncertainties and unsettlement; loneliness, loss of identity as work is retired from, and children age out of parenting. Exacerbating that are the vast distances that now often separate elders from their kin and peers. Online content and its constant exchange are about so much more than sharing information; it is a new language, almost phatic, for trying to connect.\n\nRemember that the tech is evolving so quickly that even the most savvy have to be vigilant. I now have to be on alert after admiring a song with album cover art, a music video, a richly talented singer and fantastic accompanying chorus. After days of trying to hunt down the artist, I was thunderstruck to find out it was all AI. It will happen to all of us. Welcome me to the aunties brigade. Please be kind. Break it to me gently.",

    "fullText": "AI promises to have far-reaching effects in music-making. While some welcome it as a compositional tool, many have deep concerns. Here are some of your responses\n\nAI-generated music is flooding streaming platforms, and it seems to be here to stay. Last month, three AI songs reached the highest spots on Spotify and Billboard charts. Jorja Smith’s label has called for her to receive a share of royalties from a song thought to have trained its original AI-generated vocals on her catalogue, which were later re-recorded by a human singer.\n\nWith this in mind, we asked for your thoughts on music composed by AI, the use of AI as a tool in the creation of music, and what should be done to protect musicians. Here are some of your responses.\n\nI have already found AI songs being added into jazz playlists and “radio stations” on Spotify. There was one song I actually liked, so I did some digging and found out it was a group with a generic name that had around three to five albums all released in 2025. Then I noticed the next track and the track followed the same path. It was really irksome. History, I hope, shows that people do value human flaws in art. Sometimes it helps us feel seen or not alone. I don’t understand how a completely computer-generated sound based on what’s come before could do that. Then again, some people fall in love with LLMs. I just think everything should be labelled somehow. Give people the choice. Make sure there are protections in place like forcing social feeds and music platforms to give consumers the ability to filter out AI-generated content. Casey, 37, Chicago, US\n\nThere’s no heart in music generated entirely by AI, and encouraging it is hurting the livelihoods of musicians. It is also very important not to call music made by AI “composed”. That word gives AI prompters far more credit and muddies the waters as to what composition is. The only people served by AI music are companies like Spotify, and major record labels who would no doubt rather not have to pay artists at all.\n\nAs for working with AI, I once recorded an album with my band and lost the stem tracks before we finished the final mix, but we were able to use an AI tool that could isolate certain instruments in the masters and boost them to get the mix we wanted. That seems to me an example of positive AI usage, and something that wouldn’t have been possible before AI. A composer like Ben Nobuto is also an example of someone who has used AI as a starting point for building real, human music. It’s probably too late now, but all musicians with work on streaming sites should probably have been paid as their work was likely used as training data. Additionally, musicians should be able to opt out of their work being used to train LLMs just like cookies on a website. Jon, 30, musician and music teacher, Switzerland\n\nI believe music needs a human component to be of any value. Music composed by AI has, from what I have heard, a big problem with simplistic or visible lyrics and a lack of emotional content.\n\nBut I am happy with musicians using AI as a tool. It brings professional quality recordings to those unable to hire a studio, orchestra or vocalist and so on. I have been writing songs for decades – in the 80s I couldn’t afford a Portastudio (four-track cassette recorder), so I used two single-track machines instead to play and record simultaneously. Now I can upload my songs to Suno (a generative AI program) and create new arrangements of them close to my original intention. It is great to be able to write for voices other than my own. Even so, some of my family and friends tell me they prefer my original versions. Mike Lee, 67, ex-photographer and teacher, Southampton\n\nAI-generated music is a copyright nightmare and is stopping creativity. We don’t have to accept it, and we don’t have to use it. The most irksome thing is non-creatives believing themselves to be artists, using AI to create and claiming it as their own art, when it’s an amalgamation of stolen work. Not sculpted with their own hands, not conceived in their own minds. Frankly, I find it embarrassing when someone proudly declares using it. Artists are already marginalised, but there is a kickback against, for example, TV slop, and a growing demand for audiences – in all forms – to not be treated like idiots. Artists are the answer to this, not AI.\n\nIf you can harness it to your advantage as an assistive tool, then by all means use it. The danger is to become reliant on AI. There should be a clear payment scheme, similar to PRS and PPL where AI shows exactly which items have been used to create. Or a watermark on copyrighted material. Nicole Vardon-Martin, 37, events and stage manager, Dagenham\n\nWhen social media and streaming services are flooded with digitally regurgitated stuff, it becomes harder to find the pieces with personal decisions behind them. I like knowing there’s a story behind the songs I get stuck in my head. I don’t think generative AI is the neutral tool many describe it to be, both because of its strain on the earth and because anything used by these algorithms has to come from somewhere, and keep coming, for what they chuck together to seem original.\n\nBlatantly copying someone else’s work doesn’t become “taking inspiration” because some software has mixed it around. Yes, there are musicians who use only their own work to generate “new” music, but in my opinion this is quite an insular and thoughtless way of creating. Generative AI will always, eventually, become bland without new content to sustain it, and more AI-generated work cannot fill that void. Charlotte, student, Cornwall\n\nIn my home studio I use AI to help mix and master music. I can see that it might be tempting to use an AI voice on your composition if you can’t sing – but why not go out to an open mic and see if you can find a real, living voice? Where would Burt Bacharach and Hal David be without all the brilliant singers who interpreted their songs? Who knows what a real musician will add to your music.\n\nI might be tempted to use AI to write a song but then I suspect my own musical abilities would atrophy and I would become quickly dependent on the technology. I don’t know enough about how copyright would work in these circumstances, but we need to protect human creativity and one way is to go out and see live music, commission people to write it, and to buy music directly from the artist if you can, avoiding those streaming services that pay very little and seem to be actively promoting fake artist profiles.

    "fullText": "Growth in the US economy – and the president’s political survival – rest on AI. The EU must use its leverage and stand up to him\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

    "fullText": "OpenAI seeking to strike latest deal in its efforts to pay for huge spending on datacentres\n\nAmazon is in talks to invest more than $10bn (£7.5bn) in OpenAI, in the latest funding deal being struck by the startup behind ChatGPT.\n\nIf it goes ahead, the market valuation of OpenAI could rise above $500bn, according to The Information, a tech news site that revealed the negotiations.\n\nAmazon, which is best known as an online retailer, is also the world’s largest datacentre provider and its investment would help OpenAI pay for its commitments to rent capacity from cloud computing companies – including Amazon.\n\nOpenAI said last month it would spend $38bn on capacity from Amazon Web Services – the company’s datacentre arm – over seven years. The Information said that OpenAI planned to use Amazon’s Trainium chips, which compete with Nvidia and Google’s chips. It also reported that Amazon’s financing could lead to a broader fundraising round with other investors.\n\nOpenAI’s spending commitment on compute – the chips and servers that power its chatbot – is $1.4tn over the next eight years, a figure far in excess of its reported $13bn in annual revenues.\n\nAs a result, the lossmaking company has been seeking further funding and has converted its main business into a for-profit corporation. Its main longtime backer, Microsoft, has taken a stake of roughly 27% in a deal that valued OpenAI at $500bn.\n\nOpenAI is also considering an initial public offering – selling its shares to the general public – in a move that could value the company at up to $1tn, according to Reuters.\n\nOther deals struck by OpenAI this year include Oracle spending $300bn on building datacentres in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI is expected to pay back roughly the same amount to use the sites.\n\nIn another transaction with Nvidia, OpenAI will pay in cash for chips and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.\n\nOpenAI announced on Tuesday that it had hired the former UK chancellor George Osborne to develop relationships with governments around the world and broker national-level AI projects.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has declared a “code red” staff alert to lead a fightback against competitors led by Google, whose update of its Gemini AI tool gave it an edge over rivals including ChatGPT.\n\nThe Amazon talks reportedly include discussing commercial opportunities and selling a corporate version of ChatGPT to the online retailer.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment. Amazon has been approached for comment.",

    "description": "Trump’s AI “Manhattan Project” will fail if DOGE cuts are kept, critics say.",
    "fullText": "Described as a “historic national effort” to “invest in AI-enabled science to accelerate scientific advancement,” Trump claimed his mission would address key challenges to American energy dominance, innovation, and national security.\n\nThis mission, Trump boasted, would be a game-changer to science akin to putting a man on the moon or firing the first nuclear weapons. By building “an integrated AI platform” trained on “the world’s largest collection” of federal scientific data sets, he promised, the government could set off cascades of scientific breakthroughs.\n\nAccess to such a platform, Trump imagined, would supercharge top US labs, powering AI agents to do tasks like quickly test hypotheses and automate research workflows to speed up discoveries.\n\nHowever, the mission crucially depends on strengthening collaboration between public, private, and academic sectors. And Trump’s order is concerningly vague on how those partnerships will be structured and funded at a time when many scientists have been sidelined due to a flurry of Trump orders earlier this year that eliminated their funding or removed them from their labs.\n\nTo critics, including scientists, policy experts, advocates, and historians, Trump’s order seems divorced from reality, given that he spent the past year attacking some of the very institutions the Genesis Mission would seem to depend on. Trump also seemed unclear about what can be achieved with AI and confused about how scientific progress is actually made, some critics suggested.\n\nAmong the critics was Arati Prabhakar, who served as the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden administration. Prabhakar told Ars that Trump’s crippling cuts to government science agencies, research grant funding freezes, and attacks on universities must be repaired or his mission will fail.\n\n“After the Trump administration has inflicted so much damage to valuable datasets and publicly funded research, the new executive order is a Band-Aid on a giant gash,” Prabhakar said.\n\nAlso skeptical of Trump’s plans is Kathryn Kelley, executive director for the Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation, an educational nonprofit representing more than 100 of “the nation’s most forward-thinking universities and computing centers,” CASC’s LinkedIn said.\n\nHer group is specifically dedicated to Genesis Mission-aligned goals, “advocating for the use of the most advanced computing technology to accelerate scientific discovery for national competitiveness, global security, and economic success.” And while Trump’s initiative could be considered “a step in the right direction,” Kelley told Ars that she shares Prabhakar’s concerns.\n\n“Many research institutions and national laboratories continue to experience funding uncertainty, program disruptions, and workforce instability stemming from earlier cuts,” Kelley told Ars.\n\nParticular pain points considered critical to address for Genesis Mission to move forward include reversing “impacts on staffing, ongoing research, and student pipelines,” she suggested.\n\nIn one prominent example, some Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts targeting workers at the National Science Foundation hit hardest in the branch designed to accelerate technology development across a wide range of research settings in the US. DOGE slashed workers there simply because it was the youngest directorate at NSF with the most workers in transition when Trump took office. As courts weighed legal challenges to cuts, whistleblowers warned that Trump was aiming to politicize and dismantle NSF.\n\n“Large-scale initiatives like Genesis rely on highly skilled personnel, robust infrastructure, and sustained program support—some of the very resources at NSF and other federal agencies that were disrupted,” Kelley told Ars. “Rebuilding trust, re-establishing lost programs, and stabilizing the research workforce will be essential to make this mission feasible.”\n\nCritics urged that Trump’s attacks on science also included messing with government datasets that scientists depend on. Since Trump’s second term started, scientists have watched valuable data get censored or scrubbed from government websites. Some researchers have rushed to recreate datasets independently with the help of the Internet Archive.\n\nPrabhakar pointed out that some “datasets that could improve health and prevent disasters are eroding or even disappearing due to this administration,” while universities training “the next generation of great researchers and innovators have reduced or even stopped graduate admissions because of Trump’s assault.”\n\nWithout a massive undertaking to undo moves that critics have said undermined both US science and trust in it, Trump’s dreams of launching AI models that would propel a million moonshots could go down in history as merely hype.\n\n“Without robust data and research and without people’s trust, America won’t lead in AI,” Prabhakar said.\n\nFor people in the science community, it’s hard to square Trump’s aggressive cuts from earlier this year with the broad ambition of Genesis Mission. Frustratingly, the president demands that scientists make discoveries on his timeline, without acknowledging AI’s limitations or how his attacks on science could be driving away talent that could help labs advance AI.\n\nIn many fields, scientists are still exploring how AI can aid research. Trump’s order appears to politicize science by focusing on areas he favors—like critical materials, nuclear energy, biotechnology, and quantum computing—despite their limited AI applications or data-quality challenges. Meanwhile, critics noted that it overlooks areas where “supercharging” AI could perhaps be more impactful—but where Trump notably does not want to leave his mark—like climate science or vaccine research.\n\nIt also lays out aggressive timelines for results, demanding that the Department of Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, “demonstrate an initial operating capability of the Platform for at least one of the national science and technology challenges” identified in less than a year (270 days). Ideally, Trump’s mission will have generated significant discoveries in key fields within the next three years before he leaves office, his order outlined.\n\nPaul Josephson, a Colby College professor and expert in the history of 20th-century science and technology, told Ars that Genesis Mission deadlines differ from John F. Kennedy’s 10-year timeline to reach the moon.\n\nTrump’s order “shows tremendous ignorance of how science and technology work,” Josephson said. The White House is saying, “Tell me what your discoveries will be and how many there will be in three years,” Josephson said, expecting that “we can pick the places where we want discoveries and make them happen.”\n\n“That’s not anything like how science works,” Josephson told Ars, reducing Genesis Mission to “a vision without policy” and “a hope without funding.”\n\nTo Josephson, Trump’s order sounded “more like it came out of Silicon Valley” than out of talks with government scientists, seemingly rushing approvals of industry partnerships and incentives without mentioning what resources would be available to fund gutted labs or train the next generation of scientists. It’s perhaps notable that the order is DOE-centric and does not place the same emphasis on contributions from universities or national labs funded by NSF and the National Institutes of Health as it does on industry partners.\n\nKelley told Ars that “many public datasets are already being used effectively in research and industry” in the ways that Trump intends his AI platform to amplify. However, “there are areas—such as advanced nuclear research or emerging energy technologies—where datasets are limited.” And Trump risks reducing Genesis Mission to bluster by claiming that an AI platform could drive breakthroughs to the major challenges he flagged in the short term.\n\n“There is a real risk that the EO’s ambitious framing could overpromise what AI can achieve in the near term without addressing foundational data gaps,” Kelley told Ars. “That said, even partial progress in these areas could provide valuable insights, but expectations need to be realistic.”\n\nJust as important as asking where Genesis Mission funding is coming from or who the funding is going to, Chris R. Glass asks: “Where’s the talent coming from?”\n\nTrump’s order does not forecast that, only vaguely referencing support for universities training scientists. This comes, of course, after the administration revoked an estimated $1.5 billion in federal grant money in 2025. Those grant cuts shrank the pipeline for PhD students at an “unprecedented rate,” Axios reported.\n\nA Boston College professor who researches global student mobility and the impact of emergent technology on learning, Glass told Ars that Trump has notably left international talent out of his AI plans, despite the prominent roles that both “domestic and international scientists play in our current leadership” in AI.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed, Glass warned that “America is losing research scientists,” who are seeking more stable environments to set up their lives and conduct long-term studies.\n\nAs the Trump administration has attacked immigrants, other governments like the European Union and China have benefited by offering friendlier visa systems to attract the best and brightest minds graduating from US universities. Of course, of the two, China is America’s bigger AI rival. Earlier this year, China began heavily recruiting American scientists spooked by Trump’s grant funding cuts, and Glass confirmed that China has continued those efforts with the AI race heating up. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be going the other direction, recently requiring a $100,000 payment for some skilled workers seeking non-immigrant visas.\n\nThroughout 2025, US universities’ ability to attract international students showed resilience, but “we’re on thin ice,” Glass told Ars, with that resilience “waning.”\n\nCurrently, the US “is ranked the lowest among top destinations for its safety and welcoming and the lowest for its post-graduation visa policies,” Glass said, noting that doctoral students must affirm that they do not intend to immigrate, even though the majority of STEM PhD students stay in the US after graduating.\n\n“They want to stay, and we want them to stay,” Glass told Ars.\n\nAnother concerning outcome of Trump cuts that could hamper Genesis Mission: Entire research groups at many institutions were “displaced”—removed from their labs and left to work in cubicles without access to their equipment, Glass told Ars.\n\n“I think scientists want to go where the best sciences are being done, but eventually these kinds of friction points and these hostile policies make them redirect elsewhere, even temporarily redirect, earn their doctorate in Europe and hope that the policy environment in the US changes,” Glass said.\n\nTo turn it around, Glass made several recommendations in his op-ed to help retain PhD graduates and create stable pathways for high-value talents. That includes suggesting that the Trump administration consider fast-tracking green cards for students in fields that Genesis Mission depends on, including AI and machine-learning researchers, quantum computing scientists, and semiconductor engineers.\n\nHe also thinks the US should “unlock the O-1A visa for researchers and entrepreneurs” by redefining what makes someone an “extraordinary” talent and creating dedicated “founder tracks” for international talent, as Britain and Singapore do. That visa is “uncapped yet underused,” Glass said, only approving 4,500 STEM candidates in 2023.\n\nWithout changes to the visa system, the US “risks redirecting those talent flows,” he said. “And like a river, once those talent flows get redirected, they are very difficult to reverse.”\n\nAnd it won’t just be international talents jumping ship, Glass suggested, but also possibly US scientists forced to continue navigating potentially more of Trump’s cuts and indirect costs in the coming years.\n\n“I think that’s the kind of thing that slowly eats away at someone’s desire to continue to do science in the United States,” Glass said.\n\nGlass told Ars that he expects the US to stay on a “downward trajectory,” driving away talent in 2026, which Josephson suggested “will damage science both for the short and long term.”\n\n“Many universities figured out a one-year contingency plan, but reality will set in if funding continues to be cut,” Glass said.\n\nCASC’s Kelley told Ars that like university international student recruitment, “the US research ecosystem continues to be resilient, but the gap between ambitious goals and the current capacity must be carefully managed.”\n\n“While the Genesis Mission signals strong intentions to invest in science and technology, its success will depend on aligning resources, rebuilding workforce capacity, and thoughtfully integrating AI and data capabilities where they are most effective,” Kelley said.\n\nA scientist might be best positioned to understand the nuance that requires, but Josephson noted that Trump tasked his Science Advisor, Michael Kratsios, with leading the initiative. Unlike prior officials serving in that role, Kratsios is not a scientist and has no PhD, earning his BA in politics. Instead, Kratsios has strong industry ties, previously serving as chief of staff for venture capitalist Peter Thiel and managing director of a company called Scale AI.\n\nTo Josephson, Kratsios as head of the mission—which “seems to be totally based on faith in AI and datasets to do everything”—makes the initiative seem more aligned with Silicon Valley ambitions than public good. That could be a problem since historically, it has never worked when governments attempt to “pick winners” or pass industrial policy with claims that “if we do this, we will come out on top.”\n\n“It’s a belief in AI as the cure or the panacea for all the world’s problems to ensure we’re a dominant technological power, but ignoring climate change, race, gender, anything that is important in daily life,” Josephson said.\n\nJosephson is also an expert in Russian and Soviet history, explaining that precedent shows there are “tremendous dangers” of governments controlling which sciences are funded. In some ways, he thinks Genesis Mission “smells of Putin,” he told Ars, warning that Trump’s attempts to hoard and censor science in 2025 have been “as damaging to science and technology in the world’s leading centers as totalitarian regimes have been.”\n\n“It reflects the general timbre of the Trump administration toward the scientific enterprise,” he suggested, saying that the president has embraced the “authoritarian view” that he “has the right to pick and choose which fields and which branches merit more support and which should not be funded at all.”\n\nJules Barbati-Dajches, an analyst for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), told Ars that in addition to cuts, Trump recently “weakened federal agency policies (called scientific integrity policies) that were specifically in place to protect federal agency science from political interference.” This further threatens scientific integrity, Barbati-Dajches warned in August.\n\nUCS has tracked “instances of science being sidelined, ignored, or misused by the federal government” across “multiple presidential administrations” for two decades, Barbati-Dajches told Ars. And although their methodology was recently updated, the current Trump administration stands out, as “the rate and impact of attacks on science we’ve observed over the past nine months far outpace anything UCS has tracked before,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nAdditionally, UCS has documented “cases of the administration using AI in their reports and research that raise concern” that AI initiatives like Genesis Mission may promote dubious claims to serve “politicized” outcomes, Barbati-Dajches said.\n\n“This altogether paints a very troubling picture,” Barbati-Dajches said. “Scientific innovation and discovery are exciting, important, and can help inform federal policy and guidance. But as history tells us (and recent history even more so), science in the federal government needs protective guardrails to keep it independent and free from undue influence.”\n\nWith Trump pushing for rapid buildouts of AI data centers—sparking widespread backlash among Americans—Barbati-Dajches noted that UCS has documented his administration making “policy choices and decisions that benefit favored interests (including tech and fossil fuel companies) over the health and safety of the public and planet.” Genesis Mission appears to follow that trend, critics suggested, along with Trump’s most recent executive order threatening to block state AI laws, which many consider a gift to the tech industry.\n\n“And meanwhile, most Americans are clear they don’t trust AI and want it regulated—but this administration has opposed even basic guardrails,” Prabhakar said.\n\nPlanning to closely monitor Genesis Mission, UCS is keen to get answers to many questions, such as “who will have access to the platform that’s being created as part of this initiative” and “who will own or will benefit from the outputs of this type of program?”\n\nJosephson said that it’s unlikely Genesis Mission will advance much before the midterm elections. In the next steps, Congress will have to approve funding for the mission, as its broad ambitions, if supported, would surely require structure to continue across multiple administrations.\n\nTo Barbati-Dajches, it’s critical that Genesis Mission is “viewed in the context of [the Trump administration’s] pattern of anti-science actions.”\n\n“One of my main concerns is that this type of mission is being funded in the name of science and innovation when the administration has continuously and methodically attacked federal scientific systems since Inauguration Day,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Genesis Mission will amount to anything but hype. But Josephson noted that perhaps the most blustery part of Trump’s order was a claim that “from the founding of the Republic, scientific discovery and technological innovation have driven American progress and prosperity.”\n\nThe US only began funding research in the back half of the 19th century, Josephson said, “but the amount of money coming from the federal government to the sciences was limited until the Manhattan Project.” After that, the US emerged as a “leading scientific power” in the Cold War, not by racing for “global technology dominance,” as Trump wants, but by embracing science as a “national good.”\n\nAs it stands now, Genesis Mission’s biggest flaw might stem from Trump’s disdain for DEI, which fueled his attacks on science and universities all year, Josephson suggested.\n\n“Funding science and technology and allowing the scientific community through peer review to determine what is the best science and to give funding to encourage young people to enter the science pipeline and to ensure that there are more women and people of color in the scientific community, so that more and more brains are taking part—there’s none of that in the Genesis Mission,” Josephson said.",

    "description": "DAAAM is a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding, building hierarchical 4D scene graphs with detailed natural language descriptions.",
    "fullText": "Computer vision and robotics applications ranging from augmented reality to robot autonomy in large-scale environments require spatio-temporal memory frameworks that capture both geometric structure for accurate language-grounding as well as semantic detail. Existing methods face a tradeoff, where producing rich open-vocabulary descriptions comes at the expense of real-time performance when these descriptions have to be grounded in 3D.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing. It leverages such semantic understanding to build a hierarchical 4D scene graph (SG), which acts as an effective globally spatially and temporally consistent memory representation. DAAAM constructs 4D SGs with detailed, geometrically grounded descriptions while maintaining real-time performance. We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning.\n\nWe thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark. We further curate an extended OC-NaVQA benchmark for large-scale and long-time evaluations. DAAAM achieves state-of-the-art results in both tasks, improving OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over the most competitive baselines, respectively. We release our data and code open-source.",

    "description": "America's job market is paralyzed — and white-collar workers are struggling to land roles. The real culprit is high interest rates, not AI.",
    "fullText": "When Gbenga Ajilore thinks about America's job market, a few things keep him up at night: The slowing demand for entry-level talent, tariff chaos, and high interest rates.\n\n\"There is going to come a point where AI is just a part of everything that we do, but we're not there yet,\" Ajilore, who is chief economist at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, said, adding, \"The economy is paralyzed.\"\n\nThe labor market is showing clear signs of weakness. Long-term unemployment has been trending upward, and the share of Americans looking for work recently eclipsed the number of available roles. Alongside a steady drum of layoff headlines, unemployment ticked up more than expected last month to 4.6%. Young people are having trouble breaking in, older workers are hesitant to retire, and with the \"flattening\" of many companies, the middle rungs of the career ladder are crumbling. Only healthcare and construction showed substantial growth. It's been called the white-collar recession, an unwelcome awakening for Americans who hoped their college degree would translate to long-term stability and a comfortable salary.\n\nGiven the timing, it's easy to villainize artificial intelligence. C-Suite leaders across industries have said they're \"all in on AI,\" often to the dismay of rank-and-file employees. The tech is quickly reshaping how workers are assessed on the job and how companies define productivity. It's even shaking up the hiring process: My colleagues have talked to job seekers who submitted hundreds of résumés without landing a role, as HR departments are swamped by AI-assisted applications. Economists and investors can't agree if chatbots are the future of the workforce or a vastly overblown bubble.\n\nBut, in shouldering the blame for America's job market woes, AI has become a scapegoat for something else: The economy itself is deteriorating. Years of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation, along with slowing wage growth and restrictive trade policies, have created an environment where businesses are slashing budgets and the middle class is living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nIf you're frustrated by a lower-than-expected raise or the inability to land a new gig, don't blame the robots. Blame Jerome Powell.\n\nThere is no better example of the AI-is-wrecking-the-job-market fears than the so-called \"Scariest Chart in the World.\" The chart has popped up in X and Bluesky posts, news reports, and a thick stack of Substack newsletters. The simple, two-line chart tracks two pieces of data: the S&P 500 and the number of US job vacancies since 2015. The two run closely together for the first couple of years, but there is a decided break in 2022 — the stock market continues to soar, and the number of available jobs begins to decline. AI doomers are quick to point out that the date those two lines diverged corresponds to the public launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The implication being that the explosion of large language models immediately began replacing thousands of jobs while pouring money into Wall Street.\n\nAs chatbots and AI tools make employees more productive — drafting emails, writing code, and streamlining administrative tasks — and employers more profitable, the thinking goes, there will be less need for hiring human workers. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence from high-profile companies to support the idea. Nvidia wants employees to use AI \"for every task possible,\" Microsoft is \"rethinking\" its business model for the AI age, Big Law is hoping AI can make its services faster and cheaper, and top banks and consulting firms are transferring some tasks from people to bots.\n\nBut is AI already replacing a bunch of jobs? Probably not.\n\nAjilore thinks the AI-sparked white collar downturn is \"overblown.\" Many companies are \"using AI as a cheat code as opposed to something that makes them more efficient,\" he said, \"With the cheat code, you actually end up making mistakes and cutting corners.\" He believes that both chatbots and Corporate America's tech strategy have a long way to go before AI truly disrupts the workforce.\n\nEven Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, isn't sold on AI's effects on the current job market. When asked about the technology during the Fed's December meeting, Powell said AI \"is part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet.\"\n\nThere's also an important piece of context missing from \"The Scariest Chart in the World\": the federal funds rate. Decided eight times a year by Powell and his colleagues on the all-important (and dully-named) Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed funds rate is the key interest rate that anchors all types of loans. For banks and businesses, the number determines how easily and cheaply they can borrow money. For consumers, Fed rates impact everything from home prices to auto loans and credit card rates.\n\nWhen interest rates are low, businesses can access debt more affordably, which helps them fuel growth and hiring. As the fed fund rate increases, however, the price of borrowing rises too. This can help keep inflation in check, but higher rates make it more expensive for companies to operate, meaning that many are seeking other areas to cut costs — often at the expense of employees.\n\nIt's true that the S&P 500 and job openings began to diverge right as ChatGPT launched, but that's also when interest rates started to climb. Between early 2022 and late 2024, federal funds jumped by over 5 percentage points. This was a reshaping of monetary strategy meant to curb soaring prices and cool off a too-hot economy, and it was a major break with nearly a generation of previous policy. The Fed originally slashed interest rates to zero in 2008 to address the fallout from the financial crisis, and in the following 12 years, the benchmark interest rate never rose above 2.4%. Following the emergency measures of the early pandemic, the dramatic hikes of 2022 were a sign that the zero-interest-rate era of the 2010s had officially come to an end.\n\nThis sudden interest rate rise was a turning point many businesses. «tweaked the wording here since it was similar to a sentence in the graf above Hiring boomed in the early pandemic: Job openings skyrocketed to record highs as tech and business fields scrambled to snap up new talent. The Beige Book — a collection of quotes and insights gathered from business owners across the country by the various regional Federal Reserve banks — provides a valuable window into the thinking of hiring managers and executives during this period. Labor market commentary across 2021 and 2022 Beige Books tend to reference \"modest to strong\" job growth, robust hiring demand, and a shortage of workers, with very few mentions of interest rates. This changed when the Fed started hiking rates. One note in the November 2022 edition of the Beige Book said that \"Interest rates and inflation continued to weigh on activity,\" another said \"labor demand weakened overall,\" pointing to layoffs in tech, finance, and real estate. Both blue-collar and white-collar sectors felt the brunt of interest rates that year, citing steep borrowing costs as a central reason they're not hiring. Americans, meanwhile, stopped quitting their jobs as vacancies dried up, and the job market saw its biggest layoff spike since the 2020 shutdown.\n\nCorporate America began to lean into \"efficiency\" rhetoric alongside rising rates. Reduced bureaucracy and red tape, along with a smaller workforce, were sold by the C-Suite as a profit panacea in the face of higher financing costs. Leaders at Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others spoke about hiring freezes and job cuts as a productivity bet versus a financial issue.\n\nThe trend continued: An October 2023 Beige Book note said many sectors \"reduced hiring plans\" and were \"rightsizing\" their budgets because of rising rates. Fast forward to today, and businesses are still grappling with the increased cost of funding, even as Powell and the Fed have moved slowly to lower their benchmark rate. In October's Beige Book, businesses big and small mentioned layoffs and attrition more so than new hiring. Beige Book reports over the past year suggest that AI is contributing to hiring softening in certain areas, such as call centers and accounting firms, but not widespread job displacement. Instead, \"uncertainty\" and \"tariffs\" were two of the most frequently mentioned words by companies such as Tesla, JPMorgan, and Whirlpool during earnings calls.\n\nBut saying the need for layoffs is the result of a long-term change in the cost of financing isn't very sexy. Better to point to AI as both an excuse for layoffs and a way to give investors hope for the future. Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the real estate firm Redfin, said many companies are struggling to balance profits with the steep cost of borrowing money. This is especially true in the housing sector, she said, because it's sensitive to the federal funds rate. She said fields like tech are similarly vulnerable.\n\n\"I think that what's happening is just simple economics,\" she said, adding, \"But when you say that you're going to do layoffs or you're not going to be hiring as much, it doesn't sound very good to investors. It sounds a lot better if you say that you're seeing all these productivity enhancements because of AI.\"\n\nEach recent technological development — computers, cellphones, the internet — has reshaped the job market and the workplace, but people tend to underestimate the timeline. Economists said it will take years, possibly decades, before we have concrete evidence that AI is replacing jobs on a large scale. And AI may create thousands of jobs as it makes others obsolete.\n\n\"I think the overall evolution of the technology is going to be a lot slower than both the optimists and doomers think,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics and trade at the right-leaning Cato Institute. AI has developed rapidly, and while it can perform basic tasks, it is still a long way from replacing human judgment, creativity, and decision-making. \"There will certainly be disruptions, that's inevitable,\" he said. \"But it won't be cataclysmic.\"\n\nThe job market is in a rut — but chatbots aren't the sole, or even the main, culprit.\n\nDespite the weakening job market numbers, the Federal Reserve has cut rates three times this year, a cautious policy stance brought on by economic precarity. Recent Fed reports show that trade policy and inflation are keeping Powell and company from cutting rates at a faster pace, even as the employment outlook weakens. It has also sparked division within the central bank itself: The December meeting saw the highest number of Fed members disagreeing with the interest rate committee's final decision since 2019. Economic projections also show the median committee member expects one rate cut in 2026, less than projected at this time last year. The moves signal an economic situation that isn't catastrophic, so long as Powell plays his cards carefully.\n\nA pattern of cuts could start bringing relief for borrowers, but it will take time for the economy to recover — and there are still steep headwinds. Fast-changing tariffs are exacerbating the impact of high rates, making many businesses hesitant to invest or spend money. As Lincicome put it, \"Tariff uncertainty is really a drag on the job market because companies are saddled with millions, if not billions, of dollars in additional taxes and tariff costs.\"\n\nDeclining immigration due to Trump's deportation policies is also part of the equation: Fewer immigrants in the workforce is contributing to a slowing labor force participation rate. Ajilore also said that the sweeping cost-cutting strategy of DOGE for the federal workforce added fuel to the corporate world's \"efficiency\" crusade. It all adds up to some extremely valid job anxiety for workers.\n\nEconomists expect the market to grow and adapt alongside new technology — and the AI takeover forecast is far less grim than most people realize. The chatbot revolution may come someday. But, for better or worse, the real headliner is the federal funds rate.\n\nAllie Kelly is a reporter on Business Insider's Economy team.

    "fullText": "Sometimes I use ChatGPT and it seems stunningly obvious that AI is going to have a transformative effect on my life. I use it more every day.\n\nAnd other times I find myself yelling at ChatGPT in ALL CAPS, because it can't do basic, simple tasks — ones I could reasonably farm out to a 5th grader. Or even worse: It can't do basic tasks but won't tell me it can't do them, and tries to fudge a result instead. And that makes me wary of using it again.\n\nIt turns out that the AI business has a great term for this dichotomy: \"The jagged frontier,\" coined in a 2023 research paper. Here's another way of putting it, via Reuters:\n\n\"It might be a Ferrari in math but a donkey at putting things in your calendar,\" said Anastasios Angelopoulos, the CEO and cofounder of LMArena, a popular benchmarking tool.\"\n\nThat quote comes from a report looking at the struggles various businesses have had implementing AI in their work. It's a theme we've been hearing a lot about over the last few months, like the MIT study that found that 95% of companies were getting \"zero return\" on their AI investment.\n\nThis issue is core to the \"Is AI a bubble and when will it pop?\" question, of course. Which is a very important question, with some $2 trillion in investment in play.\n\nBut I think it's not the only question: The tech isn't going away, so many of us are unquestionably going to be using AI in all kinds of ways, no matter what.\n\nSo a more practical question is: What kind of tasks can AI do reliably well today — reliably enough that businesses (and the rest of us) can use it day in and day out — and which ones are going to take a while to sort out? And which ones may never be something we can hand over to AI?\n\nThis is a pretty good summary of the ongoing experiments we're working out in real time, right now.",

    "title": "Inside Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's AI revolution",
    "description": "Internal documents and executive interviews reveal sweeping organizational shifts to radically reshape how the company builds and funds its products.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella views AI as an existential threat, a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and a chance to cement his legacy at the top of the tech industry.\n\nThe mission is both personal and professional for the Nadella, who is pushing the company to rethink how it operates at every level. That's according to internal Microsoft documents obtained by Business Insider, and interviews with leaders, managers, and other employees at the software giant.\n\nSweeping organizational shifts include high-profile executive changes and mandates for teams to work faster and leaner — all designed to consolidate power around AI leaders and radically reshape how the company builds and funds its products.\n\n\"Satya is pushing on intensity and urgency,\" one Microsoft executive told Business Insider. That's putting pressure on some Microsoft veterans to decide whether they want to stay and commit to the mountain of work it's going to take to complete Nadella's AI revolution.\n\n\"You've gotta be asking yourself how much longer you want to do this,\" this executive added.\n\nNadella is having conversations with executives to sign on for the transformation, or leave, people familiar with the matter said. Many of these people asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters, although one top executive spoke openly with Business Insider about the CEO's overhaul and Microsoft's AI future.\n\nNadella this year appointed a new CEO of Microsoft's commercial business to free up time to focus on the technical work necessary for his AI ambitions.\n\nAccording to an internal memo, Nadella also started a weekly AI accelerator meeting and corresponding Teams channel to speed the pace of AI work and get more ideas from across the company.\n\nExecutives do not present in these new meetings. Instead, lower-level technical employees are encouraged to speak and share what they're seeing from the AI trenches. This is designed to avoid top-down AI leadership, and is intentionally a bit messy and chaotic, according to people familiar with the new approach.\n\nOther major executive changes are looming. Three Microsoft executives told Business Insider that longtime Office and Windows boss Rajesh Jha has been mulling retirement. Insiders are also chattering about the possibility that Charlie Bell, who runs Microsoft cybersecurity, could retire.\n\nMicrosoft's spokesman Frank Shaw said the company does not expect any changes in the short term to its senior leadership team, of which Bell and Jha are both members.\n\nMicrosoft recently promoted Judson Althoff, its longtime sales chief, to an expanded role as CEO of the company's commercial business.\n\nAlthoff's promotion is intended to give Nadella and the company's engineering leaders more time to focus on AI, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider, which described this moment as \"a tectonic AI platform shift.\"\n\nNadella has shifted to saying the company is in the \"middle innings\" rather than the \"early innings\" of AI, a cricket term, and started saying he wants to see the game through, one of the people said.\n\n\"This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work — across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation — to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift,\" Nadella wrote.\n\nPractically, that's meant Althoff is spending more time as the face of Microsoft at events such as the recent Ignite conference, the first one in Nadella's tenure when the company CEO didn't deliver the keynote.\n\nOne executive told Business Insider the move seems to be paying off so far by giving Nadella \"extra bandwidth to really lead the company in learning, leveraging, and building AI.\"\n\n\"Satya is 100% engaged with leading the company to learn and embrace AI,\" this person said. \"The Judson move was brilliant. It actually allows Satya more time to advance the company in its AI journey. Satya spends a good amount of time in meetings you could characterize as AI learning, product, and engineering.\"\n\nNadella recently announced new marching orders for executives in another Teams channel, this one exclusively for Microsoft corporate vice presidents and above. The CEO said the company is at a turning point at least as significant as the shift to cloud computing and needs to completely rethink its business model.\n\n\"We all have to work and act like ICs in our own orgs, constantly learning and unlearning,\" Nadella wrote, referring to Individual Contributors, someone who is focused on technical work rather than managing people.\n\n\"I chuckle a bit each time someone sends me a note about talking to a friend at an AI start-up, about how differently they're working, how agile, focused, fast they are,\" the CEO added. \"The reality is that this work is also happening right here at Microsoft under our noses! It's our jobs as leaders to seek this out, empower it, cultivate it, and learn from our own early in career talent who are reinventing the new production function!!\"\n\nAsha Sharma, Microsoft CoreAI product president, who joined in 2024, said the company has shifted its operations dramatically in her short tenure. Nadella's new \"production function\" is about using AI to radically change how the company creates, builds, and delivers products and services.\n\nWhen she joined, the AI industry would crank out a big new foundation model roughly every six months. Then, releases happened every six weeks. Today, AI is changing so quickly that it's forcing Microsoft to rethink not just its products but the entire way software is made, Sharma said in an interview arranged by the company.\n\nFor decades, software development has worked like an assembly line. You take a set of inputs — people, time, resources — and transform them into output. Scaling production required scaling those inputs.\n\n\"AI breaks that relationship,\" she said.\n\nAI agents, data, and intelligence now act as a new type of scalable unit that can generate software, insights, and decisions without a corresponding increase in engineering hours or budget. That means the marginal cost of creating something new drops dramatically, Sharma explained, and teams can now spend more on \"judgment, taste, and problem-solving.\"\n\nWith so much changing, it's natural that leadership evolves — and Microsoft insiders expect more changes at the top.\n\nJha, a veteran executive who oversees famous Microsoft products such as Office and Windows, has been mulling retirement, according to three executives who spoke to Business Insider.\n\nStill, one of these executives noted that Jha has a newfound excitement about the company's AI potential, so he could stick around for Nadella's new intense era.\n\nIf Jha leaves, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky might succeed him, these executives said. Roslansky has been running LinkedIn since 2020 and Microsoft recently expanded Roslansky's role to include Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and the Microsoft 365 Copilot application, according to an internal announcement from Nadella in June.\n\nRoslansky started reporting to Jha for his new duties as executive vice president of Office, and to Nadella in his capacity as LinkedIn CEO, according to organizational charts viewed by Business Insider.\n\nCharles Lamanna, president of the business and industry Copilot group responsible for building AI tools like low-code applications, also moved to report to Jha at the time, and is taking on a bigger profile within the company, the people said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Meet one of BlackRock's top technologists who is supercharging its investment teams with AI",
    "description": "Kirsty Craig recently earned the distinction of tech fellow, partly because of her efforts to transform how BlackRock's investors work.",
    "fullText": "For 15 years, BlackRock's Kirsty Craig has operated as a kind of \"translator\" inside the world's largest asset manager, sitting between portfolio managers making big bets and engineers building the systems that help inform those decisions to get both sides aligned on driving returns.\n\nThis skill set is part of what earned Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, the title of Tech Fellow, one of the firm's high technological distinctions, held by only two dozen of its thousands of engineers. Craig is one of five new fellows that the firm announced on December 16, recognized for supercharging the asset manager's investment team. This year, she is the only woman and the only fellow who works outside of Aladdin, the lucrative spine of BlackRock's investment technology.\n\nWhen it comes to her impact on how $13.5 trillion money manager BlackRock uses AI, Craig said she's especially proud of her role in Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. The \"virtual investment analyst\" was unveiled by Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein at the firm's investor day in June.\n\nIt leverages AI to automate workflows and research, as many firms race to adopt the technology to speed up what were once monthslong investment processes.\n\nNow, as a fellow, Craig is even more embedded in BlackRock's efforts to stay ahead, as the firm continues to center on technological prowess.\n\nAt first, Craig wasn't sure she'd become a tech fellow, largely because her work is different than most of the other fellows who work squarely within BlackRock's data analytics and risk platform, Aladdin. Her team of around 60 software engineers, data engineers, and data scientists \"sits at the horizontal\" across various investment capabilities to help drive investment research.\n\nShe found out about the honor at the beginning of the month when a meeting was added to her calendar.\n\nWhen she heard the news, Craig started by telling the manager who had nominated her, her sponsor during the application process, her team, and her family, \"but they've got no idea what it means,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nNish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and the co-executive sponsor of the fellows program, said that existing tech fellows knew Craig not only for her innovation with AI in investing, but for her collaborative efforts. He described Craig as an \"AI native,\" and added that her team is at the \"tip of the spear\" when it comes to applying AI to investment.\n\nCraig's time at different offices — Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia — has, she thinks, given her a strong foundation of horizontal leadership across teams.\n\n\"I am responsible for really trying to find the dial movers across data, AI, and technology that really help our investment pillars drive investment research,\" she said of her work.\n\nCraig has learned how to communicate with both investors and Aladdin technologists, and said that building deep trust with both groups has been key to her success.\n\n\"If you put both of those different personalities or personas together, quite often they're talking above or below each other. They struggle to connect. So for me, it's really been being able to translate both and then come up with a strategy in the middle,\" she said.\n\nFor Craig, being a woman in a position of visible leadership is \"a huge honor.\" Of the 24 tech fellows, five are women, including Craig. Women make up 43.8% of BlackRock's global workforce and 33.1% of senior leadership, according to data from January 1, 2025, posted on the firm's site.\n\nCraig said being involved in BlackRock's women and LGBTQ+ resource groups has informed her other work at the firm, especially in how they've taught her how to collaborate with people from across divisions and explain complicated topics.\n\n\"If anything has probably helped me with, one, building my network; two, softer presentation skills; and then three, around how to communicate with impact,\" Craig said. With the title, she hopes to help more junior female technologists \"lean in.\"\n\nFor Ajitsaria, it's also important to have a diversity of expertise in the program and ensure that fellows represent all arms of BlackRock.\n\nWhen it comes to driving technology strategy itself, Craig said she's excited to keep figuring out how to leverage AI in active investing. Right now, her team is thinking about how to expand the scope of agentic research, potentially to areas like fixed income and macro investing.\n\nAs she continues to soak up the news, Craig is also preparing for a very different big life change. Her partner is scheduled to give birth in early January, so, with the due date mere weeks away, Craig said they've kept all celebrating fairly tame so far.\n\n\"We did go out for a meal. Nothing has been purchased, apart from cribs and bottles,\" she said. \"Definitely some more celebrating will be done post January 6.\"",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, dismissed bitcoin as \"worthless,\" and revisited his GameStop bet.",
    "fullText": "The mysterious Michael Burry has pulled back the curtain over the past six weeks, revealing his views on everything from bitcoin and meme stocks to the AI boom and the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame was previously known for posting cryptic warnings on X, only to swiftly delete them and go silent for months or years at a time.\n\nHe has now closed his hedge fund to outside cash, and shifted his focus to writing about his personal investments and sharing his financial analyses on Substack.\n\nBusiness Insider trawled through Burry's Substack, X posts, and a recent podcast interview with author Michael Lewis to gather the key insights and details he has shared so far.\n\nBurry returned to X in late October after going quiet in April 2023. His commentary since then has centered on concerns of a historic bubble in AI.\n\nHe has warned that the tech companies leading the charge are seeing a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, overinvesting in equipment such as Nvidia chips and data centers, dragging out depreciation to inflate their short-term earnings, destroying shareholder value through excessive stock-based compensation, and signing \"give-and-take\" contracts with one another to keep the buzz going.\n\nBurry — who shot to fame after his lucrative bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled by Lewis in \"The Big Short\" — has also compared AI mania to the dot-com and housing bubbles, predicting it too will end in disaster.\n\nHe has labeled OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time,\" saying it's \"hemorrhaging cash.\" He has disclosed bets against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir, and predicted the AI bubble will burst within two years. He has also advised investors who've won big on high-flying assets to cash out their winnings.\n\n\"I think the stock market could be in for a number of bad years,\" he told Lewis during what might be his final interview, per his Substack.\n\nBurry also said that bitcoin trading at $100,000 was \"the most ridiculous thing\" as it's \"not worth anything,\" and called it \"worse than a tulip bulb\" because it has enabled so much crime. The most popular cryptocurrency now trades below $90,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Burry revealed that he has owned gold since 2005, and described Google-parent Alphabet as the \"value investor's favorite\" among mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nBurry told Lewis that the Fed has \"done a lot of damage\" since its founding more than a century ago.\n\nHe said the US central bank doesn't do \"anything very helpful,\" and the Treasury could just have a department to set interest rates and control the money supply instead.\n\nBurry has also warned that the US banking system is showing signs of \"fragility,\" and banks are \"getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nMoreover, he has defended his past comments on the regional banking fiasco, pandemic-fueled inflation, and a potential meme-stock crash, saying his calls were largely on the money.\n\nHe has shared details of his personal portfolio, including that he has emulated most of his fund's positions and owns shares of Lululemon, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn a Monday post, he revisited his sale of GameStop shortly before the meme stock skyrocketed in January 2021, saying he had \"no idea what was coming.\" He also teased a future post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\nBurry's other revelations so far include the fact that he has known Nvidia's finance chief, Colette Kress, for years, and bought the chipmaker's stock in 2017 or 2018.\n\nAs promised in his Substack's name, \"Cassandra Unchained,\" Burry is speaking freely for the first time in many years — and may just be getting started.",

    "description": "The ChatGPT maker has hired former British Chancellor George Osborne to run the global arm of its \"Stargate\" AI infrastructure initiative.",
    "fullText": "Tech companies are snapping up former world leaders and politicians — and OpenAI is the latest to join the party.\n\nThe ChatGPT maker has hired former British chancellor George Osborne to run the global arm of its Stargate AI infrastructure initiative.\n\n\"I recently asked myself the question: what's the most exciting and promising company in the world right now? The answer I believe is OpenAI,\" wrote Osborne, who ran the UK Treasury from 2010 to 2016, in a Tuesday X post confirming the move.\n\nOsborne takes the role of managing director and head of OpenAI for Countries, an initiative launched by the AI startup in May that will see OpenAI partner with nations to build data centers and expand its $500 billion Stargate project beyond the US.\n\nThe former finance minister, who was a member of parliament in the right-leaning Conservative party until 2017, is the latest ex-British political heavyweight to join a US tech firm.\n\nRishi Sunak, the former UK prime minister, took on roles at OpenAI rival Anthropic and Microsoft as an advisor in October, while ex-deputy prime minister Nick Clegg worked as a senior executive on Meta's global affairs team from 2018 until stepping down at the start of 2025.\n\nBritish political salaries are dwarfed by the earnings of even midlevel employees at US tech companies. British prime ministers earn an annual salary of around £174,000 ($232,000), while salaries for research engineers at Meta can be as high as $400,000.\n\nOsborne's arrival comes as OpenAI continues to bulk up its executive ranks. The AI startup hired former Instacart and Meta exec Fidji Simo as its new CEO of applications in May, and this week hired veteran Google executive Albert Lee to lead its mergers and acquisitions team.",

    "title": "What job seekers and employers need to learn about AI and hiring, according to Indeed's top marketer",
    "description": "Indeed's CMO explains how AI hiring tools benefit employers and job seekers, urging both to optimize recruitment strategies for better results.",
    "fullText": "Job openings were down in 2025, yet employers still struggled to find the right skills match for their open positions, according to Indeed's 2026 US Jobs and Hiring Trends Report.\n\nThat paradox is a focus for James Whitemore, who joined Indeed as chief marketing officer in June 2025, the same month former CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba returned to lead the company once again. \n\nWhitemore told Business Insider that both companies and candidates have to reorient how they share information, add more details and nuance to postings and profiles, and move towards natural language to optimize for AI.\n\nThese shifts are central to two new AI tools the company rolled out for job seekers and employers in September, called Career Scout and Talent Scout, and an API integration for employers, called Indeed Connect, which is launching in January 2026.\n\nWhitemore also shared how Indeed's marketing team is using AI to maximize its first-party data, and uncanny experiences with synthetic audience testing.\n\nThe following interview is edited for length and clarity.\n\nBusiness Insider: What do employers need to know about hiring using AI tools?\n\nJames Whitemore: We're trying to shift the whole conversation from job search to one that is more proactive, where a potential employer is sourcing and screening for the right candidates, rather than the candidates having to go find the job.\n\nSo first, when you are looking for candidates, how do companies build their profiles? A lot of large-scale employers have really complex search strings that they use to source candidates.\n\nWith our new tools, you're not using search strings anymore. You are using real-language descriptions of skills, personality traits, and educational backgrounds. Teaching employers how to use the tools and how to form searches, describe candidates, and the type of people that they want, is key.\n\nThen to make the AI tools work effectively, there is much more ongoing communication about the candidate, so much more disposition sharing about who moved through the interview process and why some people were screened out versus other people who moved forward. That way you can constantly teach the platforms what worked for them.\n\nSo bringing all this together can be automated?\n\nYes, we call it Indeed Connect, which is basically an API-to-API integration between the Indeed platforms and the company's HR tech stack. The benefit that brings employers is that they can use those screening and sourcing tools across multiple sources of candidates.\n\nMost large-scale employers will have their own databases of candidates, and they're looking at other third parties, but you can use a consistent set of sourcing tools across all of those candidates, not just the ones that are coming in from Indeed.\n\nJob seekers are frustrated with the hiring process. What do they need to know in order to stand out in AI-assisted search?\n\nYou want yourself to be as searchable as possible when employers are using advanced sourcing and screening tools.\n\nThe key thing is to make sure that you have a full and complete profile, and that the profile goes beyond your resume. A resume is a historical look back at what you have done in the past. What most employers are really interested in is what you are capable of doing in the future.\n\nWhen I think about our own team, we're looking for somebody who understands marketing, but also general-purpose people who understand a business process, who can be used effectively across multiple tasks.\n\nResumes typically don't bring out soft skills. Completing your profiles and talking about what makes you tick and what excites you in \"about me\" sections is important, so that as those profiles get screened, you are much more likely to show up as somebody who is an adaptable, curious type of person.\n\nWhat are other best practices for job seekers today?\n\nTo be successful, you need to be very focused on the type of jobs you want. Mass-applying to jobs that aren't a good fit for you is not going to get you anywhere other than frustrated.\n\nAlso, it's OK to be constantly looking. The concept of \"come look for a job when you need a job\" is not the right way to be thinking about it. You should be passively open to understanding what jobs are open to you on an ongoing basis, rather than just coming to look for a job when you need a change for some reason.\n\nThat's the concept Indeed is moving to, from a place where you come to look for a job to a place where you expose your skills, your capabilities, your ambitions to potential employers, and those employers can find you when they need someone with your skills.\n\nHow is Indeed's marketing team using artificial intelligence?\n\nMarketing is one of the disciplines that has the opportunity to be most transformed by the use of AI tools. A big element is understanding and segmenting audiences in ways that we've never been able to do before.\n\nAt Indeed, we have rich first-party audience data. We know who people are, what their job histories are, education, salaries, and much more data than a lot of CMOs have to work with.\n\nBeing able to take that data and compare it to third-party databases — that technology is rapidly evolving. Then it's being able to take those audience segments and run them against mass-scale media databases, so that you understand exactly where those people are consuming content across digital, print, radio, and TV.\n\nThe ability to test messages against a synthetic audience is also fascinating. We're running synthetic marketing tests versus traditional tests, and the synthetic tests are just as accurate. Then you can take that data and feed it into the content engines, so that you are producing personalized content for audiences at scale.\n\nIt's amazing to see how it's constantly evolving, so quickly. Part of the message to the team is that marketing has got to be at the leading edge of AI. We do a lot of work with our vendors, bringing them to demo their platforms and talk about their roadmaps.\n\nHow do you manage the variety of marketing AI systems and vendors?\n\nI'm interviewing right now for a senior director of marketing transformation who will lead that group. It is so important to have somebody who is really on point to lead the discussions.\n\nWe purposely didn't call it \"head of AI\" because it's really looking at the processes, the workflows, the way that we work with others around the organization, as well as all the tools and technology, which is so important to get right.",

    "description": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.",
    "fullText": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.\n\nThe launch of the “US Tech Force” is designed to address a technical and early career talent gap across the government, according to Scott Kupor, the director of the Office of Personnel Management which is spearheading the program. The effort comes amid a broader war for AI talent, with tech companies offering sizable salaries and other perks to attract top engineers and researchers.\n\nOPM plans to hire an initial cohort of 1,000 early career software engineers, data scientists, project managers and AI experts to be placed across government agencies for the two-year program. It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

    "description": "The Google DeepMind CEO warns that some early AI startups are overvalued and the current pace of funding won't last.",
    "fullText": "Demis Hassabis has a blunt message for parts of the AI startup world: Some of this looks unsustainable.\n\nThe DeepMind cofounder and CEO said in an episode of \"Google DeepMind: The Podcast\" published Tuesday that there are likely \"bubbles\" forming in today's AI funding frenzy, particularly among early-stage startups raising money at huge valuations.\n\nSome startups \"basically haven't even got going yet,\" he said, yet are raising at \"tens of billions of dollars valuations just out of the gate.\"\n\n\"It's sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. You know, my guess is probably not, at least not in general,\" he added.\n\nHassabis drew a distinction between those sky-high seed rounds and the large tech companies pouring billions into AI infrastructure. There's \"a lot of real business\" underpinning Big Tech's valuations, he said.\n\nAI is \"overhyped in the short term\" but \"still underappreciated in the medium to long-term,\" he added.\n\nHassabis said an \"over-correction\" is imminent for any major technology shift like AI, especially when it goes from skepticism to obsession quickly.\n\n\"When we started DeepMind, no one believed in it,\" he said. \"Fast forward 10, 15 years, and now, obviously, it seems to be the only thing people talk about in business.\"\n\nThat kind of swing often pushes valuations too far and too fast. \"It's almost an overreaction to the underreaction,\" he said.\n\nHassabis also said he isn't worried about whether AI is in a bubble — he's focused on his job. Google DeepMind builds the AI models that power Google's products, including Gemini, and leads the company's frontier AI research.\n\nHassabis' comments come as AI startups continue to rake in soaring valuations.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last week that young founders — some of whom are fresh out of school — are raising millions for their AI startups. Many have dropped out to ride the AI wave, pulling in top investors and talent.\n\nA Stanford graduate dropout raised $64 million for her AI math startup earlier this year. Carina Hong, the founder of Axiom Math, even recruited top AI talent from Meta and Google Brain.\n\nThe 16 young founders Business Insider spoke with this year have secured over $100 million in funding.\n\nBut not everyone is buying the hype. Howard Marks, the cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management, said on an episode of \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast published last week that investors are flocking to AI startups with little track record.\n\n\"Do you want to have a novel entrepreneurial startup pure play which has no revenues and no profits today, but could be a moonshot if it works?\" the billionaire asked.\n\n\"Or do you want to invest in a great tech company, which is already existing and making a lot of money where AI could be incremental but not life-changing? It's a choice.\"",

Now, OpenAI has answered.\n\nThe ChatGPT creator announced the rollout of a new flagship image generator on Tuesday, which the company says is capable of making faster, more precise edits to an AI image while maintaining details.\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Images, powered by our flagship new image generation model.\n\n- Stronger instruction following\n- Precise editing\n- Detail preservation\n- 4x faster than before\n\nRolling out today in ChatGPT for all users, and in the API as GPT Image 1.5. pic.twitter.com/NLNIPEYJnr\n\nBut the more eye-catching change for many user will likely be the improvements to image quality and the AI model's ability to follow specific instructions.\n\nOpneAI said the new model offers \"clear improvements across a range of cases.\" In one example, the company showed off the differences between the old and new image model when prompted to generate a photorealistic scene in 1970s Chelsea, London.\n\nIn another example touting use cases for businesses using the company's image API, OpenAI compared the outputs showing a mechanic working on a car.\n\nWhile a model's ability to generate photorealistic images has become a popular point of comparison in the AI race, OpenAI's latest model can also generate animated images, graphics, and other styles of artwork.\n\nPerhaps to boost awareness of that, the company is rolling out a new Images feature within the ChatGPT app. While AI image generation was previously available within ChatGPT, OpenAI says the new dedicated Images feature is designed to \"spark inspiration and make creative exploration effortless.\"\n\nThe news comes just over three weeks after Google released its Nano Banana Pro AI image model alongside its flagship Gemini 3 LLM — both of which have received widespread praise and reignited the debate around whether Google had begun to overtake OpenAI in the AI race.\n\nGoogle's new AI image generator was lauded for its hyper-realistic AI images, which some people used over Thanksgiving to make it appear as if they had famous guests at the holiday dinner table.\n\nYuchen Jin, the cofounder and CTO of the startup Hyperbolic Labs, called OpenAI's new model \"Nano Banana Pro level in my tests.\"",

    "title": "Open Source: Inside 2025's 4 Biggest Trends",
    "description": "The biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model.",
    "fullText": "AI was big in 2025, but so were many other developments and worries.\n\nThe biggest open source stories in 2025 clustered around AI, licensing/governance, security and the shift in the “commercial open source” business model. Let’s start, shall we?\n\nWhile most of the money went to proprietary models, open source AI datasets, orchestration frameworks, evaluation tools and guardrail stacks have all seen gains.\n\nSuch open source AI efforts as Common Corpus, along with the  dozens of AI projects hosted by the Linux Foundation’s AI & Data group are enabling us to use community infrastructure for generative AI rather than relying solely on proprietary APIs, making open AI stacks a serious option for businesses and users.\n\nWhile the open source AI definition remains controversial, and very few AI projects fully qualify as open source by the strict requirements of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) AI definition, AI remains built on a foundation of open source software. The debate over open weights, data and training code will continue, but even the most proprietary large language models (LLMs) couldn’t exist without open source programs.\n\nAgentic AI, owes everything to open source. To orchestrate our latest generation of AI agents, we’re using several programs.\n\nThe most important of these, at this early stage of the game, appears to be the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is an open standard and open source implementation for uniformly connecting agents to tools, files, databases and other systems.\n\nMCP is increasingly the “plumbing layer” under many agents and IDE assistants, and there are numerous open source MCP servers and toolkits that let any compatible agent framework plug into the same tools.\n\nMCP isn’t the only agentic AI middleware that’s speeding up:\n\nA Linux Foundation report released in August showed that venture capital‑backed commercial open source companies have outperformed comparable closed‑source vendors over the last 25 years.\n\nThat report, alongside open source adoption data from an April OSI survey, which from 96% of organizations are maintaining or increasing open source software use, has cemented commercial open source as the default way to build software.\n\nTogether, these reports are driving more funding, more mergers and acquisitions, and more “open core plus services” strategies around critical open source projects.\n\nOf course, we knew that. After all, a 2024 Harvard Business School study already showed that  96% of commercial programs rely on open source and that the total value of open source code comes to a cool $8.8 trillion. That still doesn’t stop companies that made the mistake of confusing open source as a software development model with a business model; it never was. It never will be.\n\nSo it is that in 2025, we saw more companies move from open source to fauxpen source. For example, the ScyllaDBteam announced in December 2024 that it would move to a single “ScyllaDB Enterprise” stream under a source‑available license.\n\nAt the library level, there have been high‑profile examples of previously permissive projects switching quietly to source‑available, paid‑for‑commercial‑use terms, such as the Fluent Assertions .NET testing library moving, this past January, from Apache‑2.0 to a proprietary source‑available license with per‑developer fees.\n\nThen, there’s the DevOps program Puppet. Although Puppet’s core codebase is still under the Apache 2.0 open source license, its commercial parent company, Perforce, has changed how official builds are distributed and licensed.\n\nWhat changed is that new “hardened” binaries and packages built by Puppet/Perforce are now shipped from a private repository. The Puppet Core End User License Agreement (EULA) offers a free tier capped at 25 nodes, with commercial licensing required for additional nodes. Effectively, this makes Puppet a source-available program, even though the code is technically still open.\n\nThe result in Puppet’s case is the same as we’ve seen in other such attempts to close once open source projects: Unhappy programmers have forked the project. The fork is known as OpenVox.\n\nThese forked projects, which include Elasticsearch with its fork OpenSearch, Redis with the Valkey fork, and Terraform with the OpenTofu fork, have been somewhat successful. All four forks have achieved meaningful traction, but at different scales and under different definitions of  “success.”\n\nOpenSearch appears to be the most successful. It reports strong growth, including double‑digit, 78%, year‑over‑year download increases and a roster of major members such as Amazon Web Services, Canonical, SAP and Uber.\n\nValkey has also proven to be popular. The latest release, Valkey 9, is reported to be far faster than the newest version of Redis. In particular, Valkey users report that it’s consistently ahead of comparable Redis releases on raw throughput, especially on larger, memory‑heavy workloads where Valkey’s multithreaded I/O and cache‑prefetching kick in.\n\nWhile OpenSearch and Valkey have both advanced beyond their parent projects, Terraform vs. OpenTofu is another story. People still see OpenTofu and Terraform as differing only in their licenses. Over the last few months, though, that’s been changing as OpenTofu, which joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in April, steers more of its own course. Latest releases now include state encryption, a feature the Terraform community has wanted for years, and early variable evaluation.\n\nFinally, OpenVox continues to present itself as a “soft fork.” Its directors want it to stay 100% compatible with Puppet so it can serve as a drop-in replacement for Puppet deployments. That, however, appears to no longer be possible, as Gene Liverman, the leader of OpenVox, wrote, “We can no longer guarantee that our modules will work with Puppet Core or Puppet Enterprise.”\n\nFrom the project maintainers’ viewpoint, Perforce is breaking compatibility. For now, though, OpenVox is essentially a healthy, community lifeboat rather than a full‑scale Puppet replacement ship.\n\nDespite the simple fact that we all depend on open source, all too many projects remain underfunded. Others, such as NET 6, are still popular, but their maintainers have quit supporting them. What’s a user to do?\n\nThis isn’t a new problem. Back in 2021, Tidelift, a security company that also financially supported open source maintainers, found that 46% of open source project maintainers received no pay at all. Almost as bad, even those who were paid, a mere 26% earn more than $1,000 per year for their work.\n\nThings have not improved. In fact, they’ve gotten worse. In 2024, Tidelift’s latest results showed that now 60% of open source maintainers are unpaid.\n\nAs  an open letter signed by 10 open source foundations  and published in September pointed out, “Most of these [open source] systems operate under a dangerously fragile premise: They are often maintained, operated, and funded in ways that rely on goodwill, rather than mechanisms that align responsibility with usage.”\n\nSo it is that, according to the open letter, “a small number of organizations absorb the majority of infrastructure costs, while the overwhelming majority of large-scale users, including commercial entities that generate demand and extract economic value, consume these services without contributing to their sustainability.”\n\nA specific example that I’ve been covering is how FFMpeg, which is used by everyone who watches videos over the Internet, is horribly underfunded, even as major companies such as Amazon, Google and Netflix depend on its code. There are many other such projects. This can not continue.\n\nThe answer is that companies must — Must — start financially supporting mission-critical open source projects. The cost to do this is minute compared to the damage they’d suffer if these projects folded or were hit by a major security problem.\n\nIn 2024, the xz data compression library code, which had been deliberately infected with malware, came close to inserting a backdoor into Fedora, Red Hat’s community Linux. Had it been successful, it might have ended up in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its clones.\n\nThis would have led to the greatest Linux security disaster to date. We dodged a bullet.\n\nUnfortunately, the open source software supply chain security is under sustained, high-volume attack, with npm- and PyPI-focused campaigns escalating.\n\nSeveral high-impact campaigns in 2025 centered on compromising open source package ecosystems, especially npm.\n\nIn November, researchers from Wiz, Aikido, and others detailed a “Shai-Hulud 2.0” wave of trojanized npm packages that exfiltrated developer and CI/CD credentials from environments using popular libraries tied to major Software as a Service and cloud tooling.\n\nTens of thousands of malicious repos were spun up as part of the campaign. GitLab’s vulnerability research team also reported a separate widespread npm supply chain attack that harvested credentials for GitHub, npm, and major clouds and propagated by infecting additional packages owned by victims.\n\nThese are not one-off instances. Industry threat reports in 2025 describe a surge in software supply chain attacks overall, with October setting a new monthly record, and open source ecosystems featuring prominently among the targets.\n\nAnalysis from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 and other research teams notes that attackers increasingly prefer compromising maintainer accounts and publish pipelines rather than core source repos, because this path can silently poison trusted packages at scale.\n\nA study by ReversingLabs, released in March, reported that, while observed open source malware packages have declined somewhat, the risk has shifted toward leaked developer secrets and build-time exposures.\n\nResearchers examining popular npm, PyPI, and RubyGems components continue to find hard-coded credentials, weak application hardening, and exposed data inside widely used binaries deployed in enterprises. That kind of mistake was stupid back in the ’80s, when I first encountered it in production software, and it’s unforgivable today.\n\nMaking matters worse, security companies such as JFrog and Veracode report that exploding dependency graphs, faster release cycles, and heavy reuse of open source libraries mean a single malicious or vulnerable package can ripple through thousands of downstream applications in days.\n\nThis dense interconnection makes the blast radius of attacks like the npm-focused campaigns in 2025 significantly larger than that of many earlier open source incidents, especially when the target libraries appear in 20 to 30% of scanned cloud environments.\n\nWhat can we do about it? We must more broadly adopt software bills of materials (SBOMs), Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)-style attestations, and tools from the Open Source Software Foundation ecosystem to track provenance and integrity of open source components.\n\nOpenSSF and its partners highlight initiatives such as Sigstore for keyless signing, Scorecard for automated project risk assessment, and the Open Source Project Security Baseline, which aim to give both maintainers and consumers clearer security expectations.\n\nEvery year, I tell people that they must take security more seriously. Lately, as open source supply chain violations become ever more common, I’ve been saying you must ensure the code in your supply chain is both safe and written by someone trustworthy.\n\nLooking ahead, I can only redouble these warnings. Now we’ve already had serious security breaches in the last few years. You remember: Solarwinds, JetBrains TeamCity, and Apache Log4j should all come to mind quickly. As bad as those were, worse security disasters lie ahead if we don’t take open source supply chain security much more seriously.",

    "description": "Roughly one-in-five U.S. teens say they are on TikTok and YouTube almost constantly. At the same time, 64% of teens say they use chatbots, including about three-in-ten who do so daily.",
    "fullText": "Pew Research Center conducted this study to better understand teens’ use of social media, the internet and artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.\n\nThe Center conducted an online survey of 1,458 U.S. teens from Sept. 25 to Oct. 9, 2025, through Ipsos. Ipsos recruited the teens via their parents, who were part of its KnowledgePanel. The KnowledgePanel is a probability-based web panel recruited primarily through national, random sampling of residential addresses. The survey was weighted to be representative of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 who live with their parents by age, gender, race and ethnicity, household income, and other categories.\n\nHere are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey methodology­­­.\n\nThis research was reviewed and approved by an external institutional review board (IRB), Advarra, an independent committee of experts specializing in helping to protect the rights of research participants.\n\nEven as teens express mixed feelings about social media’s impact, these sites remain a key part of their lives, with some using them “almost constantly.”\n\nNow, AI chatbots, like ChatGPT and Character.ai, are getting teens’ attention. Roughly two-thirds report using chatbots, including about three-in-ten who do so daily, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 1,458 U.S. teens ages 13 to 17.\n\nYoung people turn to a variety of platforms, but YouTube stands out for being used by nearly all teens. Roughly nine-in-ten report ever using it.\n\nTeens widely use three other platforms:\n\nFewer use Facebook (31%) and WhatsApp (24%). And no more than about one-in-five say the same of Reddit or X (formerly Twitter).\n\nToday’s online landscape for teens is marked by both stability and new trends.\n\nWhatsApp is one platform that stands out for its growth in recent years. Today, roughly a quarter of teens say they use WhatsApp, up from 17% in 2022.\n\nX and Facebook have declined in use over the past decade. Today, 16% of teens use X, down from 23% in 2022 and 33% in 2014-15. And Facebook, once the go-to platform for teens, is used today by about three-in-ten teens. This is far lower than the 71% in 2014-15, though on par with 2022.\n\nThe shares of teens who use other sites or apps, like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, have stayed relatively stable in recent years.\n\nJump to read about teens’ online experiences: Online platform use by demographic groups | Frequency of online platform use | Use of AI chatbots | Frequency of chatbot use | Internet use\n\nTeen use of specific online platforms varies across demographic groups – including when it comes to gender, race and ethnicity, age and household income.\n\nTeen girls are more likely to use Snapchat and Instagram. For example, 61% of girls say they use Snapchat, compared with 49% of boys.\n\nMeanwhile, boys are more likely to use Reddit (21% vs. 12%) and YouTube (94% vs. 89%).\n\nThere are differences in use by race and ethnicity across all the platforms asked about except Reddit. Black teens are more likely than their White or Hispanic peers to use Instagram, TikTok, X, Snapchat and YouTube. For example, 82% of Black teens say they use Instagram. This drops to 69% among Hispanic teens and is even lower for White teens (55%). And Black teens are more likely than Hispanic teens to use Facebook.1\n\nWhatsApp is used by a larger share of Hispanic and Black teens than White teens.\n\nOlder teens stand out from younger teens in using nearly every platform we ask about. For instance, three-quarters of 15- to 17-year-olds say they use Instagram, compared with 44% of 13- to 14-year-olds.\n\nYouTube is the only site measured that older and younger teens are equally likely to use.\n\nTeens in households with lower and middle incomes are more commonly using TikTok and Facebook, a largely similar pattern to previous years.\n\nFor instance, 46% of teens living in households earning less than $30,000 a year say they use Facebook. Similarly, 39% of those in households with incomes between $30,000 and $74,999 say the same. However, this drops to 27% among teens in households earning $75,000 or more.\n\nIn a pattern seen in previous Center surveys, a larger share of teens who identify as Democrats than Republicans say they use TikTok, Instagram, Reddit and YouTube.\n\nFor example, there is a large partisan gap for TikTok: 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning teens say they use TikTok, compared with 60% of Republicans and Republican leaners.\n\nYouTube is not only widely used, but it’s also the platform the most teens visit on a daily basis. Roughly three-quarters of teens say they use it every day.\n\nSomewhat smaller shares report going on two other platforms daily: TikTok (61%) and Instagram (55%).\n\nJust under half say they visit Snapchat every day (46%), while far fewer say the same of Facebook (20%).\n\nOverall, teen daily use of these platforms remains relatively stable from past years.\n\nSocial media is not only a daily feature in the lives of teens, some report using these platforms “almost constantly.” About one-in-five teens say this of TikTok and YouTube.\n\nFewer describe their use of Instagram and Snapchat as almost constant (12% for each). And just 3% say this of Facebook.\n\nAcross these five platforms, 36% of teens use at least one of these sites almost constantly.\n\nThe share of teens who say they are on TikTok almost constantly ticked up slightly to 21% this year, from 16% in 2022. The shares who report using YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook almost constantly have changed little since 2022.\n\nThere are some gender differences in frequency of using these sites or apps.\n\nSlightly larger shares of teen girls than boys report being on TikTok and Instagram almost constantly. Teen boys are more likely than girls to visit YouTube this often (20% vs. 13%).\n\nSimilar rates of girls and boys say they use Snapchat and Facebook almost constantly.\n\nBlack and Hispanic teens are particularly likely to report being on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram almost constantly.\n\nFor example, 35% of Black teens say they’re on YouTube almost constantly, compared with 23% among Hispanic teens. Both groups are much more likely than White teens (8%) to say this.\n\nThere are only small or no racial or ethnic differences in visiting Snapchat or Facebook almost constantly.\n\nAI chatbots have become more common in daily life, from education to entertainment. For the first time, we asked teens about their overall use of chatbots, how often they use them and which ones they turn to.\n\nA majority of teens say they use chatbots. Roughly two-thirds of teens (64%) say they ever use an AI chatbot. Fewer (36%) do not use this tool.\n\nWhile many teens use chatbots, there are some differences across demographic groups:\n\nAbout three-in-ten teens say they use AI chatbots every day, including 16% who do so several times a day or almost constantly.\n\nDaily use of chatbots differs somewhat by race and ethnicity as well as age:\n\nIn addition to understanding their overall use, we also asked teens about their use of six specific chatbots.\n\nChatGPT (59%) is by far the most widely used chatbot and the only one we measured that a majority of teens use.\n\nThis is more than twice the rate of the next most commonly used chatbots: Gemini (23%) and Meta AI (20%).\n\nFewer say they use Copilot, Character.ai and Claude.\n\nBlack and Hispanic teens are more likely than their White peers to say they use Gemini and Meta AI.\n\nBlack and White teens differ modestly in their use of ChatGPT and Character.ai.\n\nThere are no significant differences in use for Copilot or Claude.\n\nTeens ages 15 to 17 are more likely than those 13 to 15 to report using ChatGPT and Meta AI.\n\nChatGPT use is more common among teens in higher-income households. About six-in-ten teens living in households earning $75,000 or more (62%) say they use it. That compares with 52% of teens living in households earning less than $75,000.\n\nMeanwhile, lower- and middle-income teens are more likely to use Character.ai. Some 14% of teens in households with incomes of less than $75,000 report using it. This is double the rate among teens in households with incomes of $75,000 or more (7%).\n\nGo to the appendix for a full breakdown of AI chatbot use by demographic groups.\n\nThe survey also explores how often teens use the internet.\n\nNearly all U.S. teens (97%) say they use the internet daily, including four-in-ten who say they are almost constantly online.\n\nThe share of teens who say they’re online almost constantly is much higher today than a decade ago, though it’s a slight dip from last year.\n\nBlack (55%) and Hispanic teens (52%) are about twice as likely as White teens (27%) to say they’re online almost constantly.\n\nBeing online almost constantly is more common for older teens. While 43% of 15- to 17-year-olds report being online almost constantly, 34% of 13- and 14-year-olds report this.\n\nTeens living in households that earn less than $75,000 annually are more likely than those in households earning $75,000 or more to say they use the internet almost constantly.\n\nThere are no significant differences in internet use by gender.",

    "description": "Google's TPU business is ramping up. Here's everything you need to know about Google's AI chips, and what they mean for Nvidia's dominance.",
    "fullText": "Google has been in the AI chip game for more than a decade. Now its custom hardware is moving markets.\n\nShares of Nvidia and other chipmakers tumbled last month following a report that Meta — one of Nvidia's largest customers — was exploring a deal to use Google's AI chips, known as Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.\n\nGoogle has primarily used its TPUs for internal use, but it also leases them to external customers through the cloud. Nvidia, meanwhile, has become the dominant provider of AI chips with its graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nGoogle has a potential blockbuster business to unlock. In a research note sent December 2, Morgan Stanley projected that 5 million of Google's TPUs will be purchased in 2027 and about 7 million in 2028, significantly increasing its prior projections.\n\nHere's a breakdown of everything you need to know about TPUs, what they're used for, and when they might become a more prominent threat to Nvidia's chip dominance.\n\nOver a decade ago, Google needed more powerful and specialized compute power for the type of AI work it wanted to do. A team led by the now-CEO of Groq, Jonathan Ross, designed a new chip based on a specific type of integrated circuit for machine learning. The TPU was born.\n\nGoogle has continued to improve and refine its TPUs over the years, making them more effective at both training models and inference, the process where a trained model answers a question or performs a task. As large language models have grown in size, Google has also increased the memory bandwidth of later TPUs to handle these bigger workloads.\n\nGoogle says its latest \"Ironwood\" TPU, which the company is making widely available, is more than four times better than its predecessor for both training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPU cards, which launched in 1999, were originally designed for gaming, not AI. When researchers later discovered that the chips were useful for tasks such as training neural networks, Nvidia doubled down on the AI market.\n\nGoogle's TPUs, on the other hand, were designed for AI from the get-go. Being more specialized means they're more efficient than Nvidia's chips at some tasks, and faster for running select AI models. They have something called a systolic array, which lets a more constant stream of data pass through the chip, rather than having to keep fetching more from memory.\n\nWhere Google's TPUs have a big edge is in cost at scale. It's possible to have thousands of TPUs working in tandem in a single \"pod.\" Because they are faster at some calculations than GPUs, running many TPUs at once can sometimes be more cost-efficient.\n\nThat may become more important as companies increase investments at the inference stage, which Google says its latest TPU is especially good at. That could save companies money.\n\nOne advantage that Nvidia has over Google is its CUDA software, which makes it possible for regular applications to use GPUs for general computing tasks — not just for graphics. CUDA also only works with Nvidia chips, one of the biggest points of friction stopping companies from switching to Google's chips.\n\nGoogle is trying to change that. For example, there is a lot of industry demand to have TPUs better support Pytorch, a popular tool for building AI applications that was created inside Meta. Google is allocating more resources and attention to better supporting Pytorch, which data suggests is seeing much more demand than Google's own Tensorflow software, according to Google employees and industry experts.\n\nWhen it comes to TPUs, Google remains its own biggest customer. It uses the chips across the company to power products like Search and Maps. Its latest Gemini 3 model was trained on TPUs.\n\nWhile Google has prioritized its own needs, it has leased its TPUs to other customers. Apple used TPUs to train its in-house AI model, Business Insider previously reported. In October, Anthropic announced a blockbuster deal with Google that it says will see it using up to 1 million TPUs. Broadcom, which helps build the TPU chips for Google, revealed in its Q4 earnings call this week that it has received a total of $21 billion in orders from Anthropic for Google's Ironwood TPUs.\n\nMeta is also in early testing of Google's TPUs, according to a person familiar with the matter, although it's not clear if it will result in a long-term deal.\n\nGoogle's TPU business could be poised to explode in the coming years. In a research note this month, Morgan Stanley wrote that every 500,000 TPU chips sold could potentially add around $13 billion in revenue to Google's balance sheet in 2027.\n\nHaving TPUs isn't just a potential revenue boost for Google. It also gets a feedback loop in using TPUs to run and train its AI models, learning from them, and changing how it develops its next chips to be better at the things Google needs.\n\nNvidia's GPU is still very much the chip du jour, but other tech giants are increasingly pouring resources into their own custom chips. Amazon just announced its new Trainium3 custom AI chip, which the company says can cut the cost of training and powering AI models in half compared with a GPU.\n\nMany TPU buyers are also Nvidia customers, and some industry insiders told Business Insider that it's more likely that the rise of more specialized chips will see companies and labs diversify the chips they use, rather than going all in on one provider.\n\nThat could still hurt Nvidia, which could lose pricing power as a result of a more diverse market.\n\nHowever, even if Google's TPU business finds more momentum, it doesn't mean Nvidia will suddenly crumble overnight. Jordan Nanos, member of technical staff of research firm SemiAnalysis, said his firm believes companies, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, will all \"sell lots\" of chips in the future.\n\n\"We don't see TPU as a significant threat to Nvidia's business, but it has been a real player in the market for many years,\" said Nanos. \"It is possible that Google sells TPU servers externally in the future, to many more customers. Right now, they are very selective.\"\n\nHave something to share? Contact this reporter via email at hlangley@businessinsider.com or Signal at hughlangley.01.

    "fullText": "EVs aren't really working out for Ford, so now it's chasing the AI boom instead.\n\nThe Detroit auto giant said on Monday it would pull back from electric vehicles in a move that would cost the company $19.5 billion.\n\nIn addition to scrapping planned electric models and building more hybrids, Ford said it would repurpose its EV battery factory in Kentucky to build batteries to power data centers and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe Mustang maker added that it would invest $2 billion to scale the new energy storage business, which it said would \"leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity.\" Ford plans to deploy at least 20 gigawatt-hours of energy storage systems by the end of 2027, which is roughly equivalent to the power used by 2,000 US homes for a year.\n\nIt comes as the race to build ever more powerful AI models fuels a data center boom across the US, putting pressure on the electricity grid.\n\nFederal estimates suggest data center power demand is expected to as much as triple over the next three years, as tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI pour tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure.\n\nEVs, meanwhile, are heading in the other direction. Demand has cratered in recent months after buyers rushed to purchase electric vehicles before the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit in September, and automakers are rolling back investments and betting on hybrids as they gear up for an EV winter.\n\nFord said the factory at Glendale, Kentucky, which the US automaker built as part of a joint venture with Korean battery company SK On, will produce commercial batteries for the data center industry. Another battery plant in Michigan will produce smaller units for residential use, Ford added.\n\nFord is following in the footsteps of rival Tesla, which operates a thriving energy storage business. Elon Musk's automaker raked in over $10 billion last year from selling batteries to support the grid and power people's homes.\n\nTesla's Megapack commercial batteries have been used by Musk's startup xAI at its massive \"Colossus\" supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee. In May, the AI startup reportedly deployed 168 Megapacks to help stabilize the electricity supply at the site, which is one of the largest data centers in the world.\n\nFord's bet on energy storage comes as the company overhauls its wider EV strategy.\n\nThe Blue Oval announced on Monday it would cancel plans to build some large electric vehicles, and turn its F-150 Lightning electric pickup into an \"extended range\" EV with an additional gas generator.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley told Bloomberg on Monday that the move was the result of the EV market in the US shrinking and \"the customer changing their decision.\"\n\n\"The EV market in the US went from 12% of the industry to only five, and that really, in the end, was the big decider for us,\" he said.",

    "description": "The startup aims to fully automate front-office healthcare tasks for independent provider groups with AI.",
    "fullText": "When Valerie Health CEO Peter Shalek demos his product to clinicians, he has an unusual pitch: \"This is a weird demo, because you'll never have to use this software.\"\n\nValerie Health, which Shalek cofounded alongside Uber Health founder Nitin Joshi, aims to fully automate time-consuming front-office tasks in healthcare, such as referrals and patient scheduling.\n\nIt's taking over those tasks for independent provider groups, a focus that's helping the startup rack up new revenue — and new venture funding.\n\nValerie Health just raised $30 million in Series A funding led by Redpoint Ventures, the company said Tuesday. The raise brings Valerie Health's total funding to $39 million since its 2024 founding.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health is already working with several of the nation's largest independent provider groups, in areas ranging from urology and podiatry to cardiology.\n\nAcross specialties, the front-office challenges for provider groups are often the same, Shalek said: juggling patient intakes and follow-ups against a backlog of referrals.\n\nThose administrative burdens and related financial pressures can lead provider groups to be acquired by hospitals or consolidated by private equity firms. But those deals can mean higher costs for patients and lower satisfaction for the clinicians impacted. Shalek wants Valerie Health to help providers thrive independently.\n\n\"I think that there's an opportunity to make it so that independent practice is the easiest, the highest quality, the most profitable place to deliver care, which is really the core mission we have,\" he said.\n\nValerie Health takes over tasks for healthcare front offices with its own employees in the loop to review the software's autonomous actions.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health helps practices grow, too, by processing new and existing patients faster to increase the volume of patients coming in by 5% to 7% on average.\n\nThe startup has plenty of competition. More companies are setting out to automate administrative tasks for hospitals and healthcare practices, such as the Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup Tennr, which raised $101 million in Series C funding in June at a $605 million valuation to focus on automating patient referrals.\n\nShalek said Valerie Health is bringing in business through its singular focus on independent provider groups and its ability to automate tasks without healthcare practices lifting a finger.\n\n\"It takes a lot of work from our side, but it allows us to just solve these problems for our customers without saying, here's another piece of software for you to train your staff on. That's the last thing these practices want. They just want us to do the work,\" he said.\n\nValerie Health wants to move fast as the market fills. Shalek said the startup is focused on grabbing more customers next year while continuing to build front-office solutions, such as voice AI agents for patient follow-ups. Valerie Health started selling its tech earlier this year; its revenue tripled last quarter from the previous quarter alone, and given the customers already in its pipeline plus the demand it's seeing in the market, Shalek said he expects revenue to grow six to seven times next year.\n\nThe startup is also hiring across its teams, including engineering, product, and sales. Joshi also spent two years as an engineering manager at fintech startup Stripe, so Shalek said Valerie Health has been able to bring over talent from both Stripe and Uber as it expands.",

What podcasts did Brin listen to in the car?\n\n\"I do talk to Gemini Live in the car often,\" Brin said. \"I just talk to it about stuff on my drive.\"\n\nBrin gave an example of what he asked Gemini Live while driving: \"I want to develop a data center, I need how many hundreds of megawatts of this kind of power, that kind of power, how much it's going to cost.\"\n\nGemini Live is Google's voice-enabled AI chatbot. The company first demoed the product in May 2024 at Google I/O and made it freely available in September 2024.\n\nFor car-chatting enthusiasts, Brin recommended drivers \"shouldn't do it now, because we have a way better version coming.\"\n\n\"The publicly available version right now is not the good version,\" he said. \"Give me a few weeks to actually ship what I have access to.\"\n\nBrin said that the current available version of Gemini Live is backed by an \"ancient model.\"\n\nGoogle's recent model updates have made waves in the AI world. In November, the company debuted Gemini 3. The model is more visual, Google said, and its \"most factual\" model to date.\n\nGemini 3 was also the first model Google added directly to search on day one. Users could immediately access it by clicking \"AI Mode,\" rather than having to visit a separate app or website.\n\nThe other LLM makers took note. Meta employees now have access to Gemini 3 Pro.\n\nOn the panel, Brin acknowledged that his answer to the driving question seemed \"kind of self-advertising.\" He does listen to some podcasts, he said.\n\n\"The 'All In' guys are actually one of my favorites,\" he said.

    "fullText": "Companies such as Udio, Suno and Klay will let you use AI to make new music based on existing artists’ work. It could mean more royalties – but many are worried\n\nThis was the year that AI-generated music went from jokey curiosity to mainstream force. Velvet Sundown, a wholly AI act, generated millions of streams; AI-created tracks topped Spotify’s viral chart and one of the US Billboard country charts; AI “artist” Xania Monet “signed” a record deal. BBC Introducing is usually a platform for flesh-and-blood artists trying to make it big, but an AI-generated song by Papi Lamour was recently played on the West Midlands show. And jumping up the UK Top 20 this month is I Run, a track by dance act Haven, who have been accused of using AI to imitate British vocalist Jorja Smith (Haven claim they simply asked the AI for “soulful vocal samples”, and did not respond to an earlier request to comment).\n\nThe worry is that AI will eventually absorb all creative works in history and spew out endless slop that will replace human-made art and drive artists into penury. Those worries are being deepened by how the major labels, once fearful of the technology, are now embracing it – and heralding a future in which ordinary listeners have a hand in co-creating music with their favourite musicians.\n\nAI music platforms analyse huge amounts of recorded music in order to learn its sounds, structures and expressions, and then allow users to create their own AI-generated music via text or speech prompts. You might ask for a moody R&B song about a breakup sung by a female vocalist, and it will come up with a decent approximation of one, because it’s absorbed hundreds of such songs.\n\nArtists and labels initially saw AI as the biggest existential threat since Napster-fuelled piracy: if not a replacement for human creativity, then certainly a force that could undermine its value. Gregor Pryor, a managing partner at legal firm Reed Smith, says background music for things such as advertising, films and video games, where you’re not relating to a personality as you would in pop music, “is where the real damage will be done” first of all. “People will ask: why would I pay anyone to compose anything?”\n\nAware of the scale of the shift, last year the Recording Industry Association of America, representing the three major labels, initiated legal action against AI music companies Suno and Udio for copyright infringement, alleging they had trained their AI platforms on the labels’ artists without their permission. But then there was an extraordinary about-turn. They didn’t just settle the matter out of court – Universal Music Group (UMG) then partnered with Udio, and Warner Music Group (WMG) with Udio and Suno. They also have deals in place with AI company Klay, the first to get all three major labels on board, adding Sony Music (discussions with indie labels are ongoing). WMG chief executive Robert Kyncl has said these recent deals are to ensure the “protection of the rights of our artists and songwriters” and to fuel “new creative and commercial possibilities” for them, while UMG chief Lucien Grainge heralded “a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish and create incredible experiences for fans”.\n\nKyncl made another bold statement as to why these deals are taking place: “Now, we are entering the next phase of innovation. The democratisation of music creation.”\n\nAnnouncing its Universal tie-in, Udio chief executive Andrew Sanchez has said Udio users will be able to “create [music] with an artist’s voice and style”: so not just create the aforementioned moody R&B song, but one with a specific existing artist’s voice. He also says Udio will allow users to “remix and reimagine your favourite songs with AI … take your favourite artists, songs or styles and combine them in novel ways. In our internal experimentation, the team has gotten some truly remarkable and unusual results that will definitely delight.”\n\nKlay meanwhile states that “fans can mould their musical journeys in new ways”, but it’s essentially the same offering: a subscription service where you can manipulate the music of others, or create your own from it. Ary Attie, Klay’s founder and chief executive, says his company will properly compensate artists whose work is used, and won’t supplant the work of human musicians: “This technology is not going to change any of that.”\n\nKlay is a rarity in that it signed up all three major labels before it started training its AI system on their music: “A core part of our philosophy,” Attie says. He argues that rival AI companies – he doesn’t name names – have been “acting in a way that doesn’t respect the work of artists, and then being forced into a corner”. Suno did not respond to an interview request; Udio claimed its executives were “extremely swamped” and therefore unable to answer questions. The current, and synchronised, messaging from labels and gen AI companies with licensing deals is that they all respect both art and artists and that their deals will reflect this.\n\nThey are also positioning gen AI as the single biggest democratising leap ever in remix culture, effectively enabling everyone to become musically creative. The counterargument is that, by lowering all barriers to entry and by allowing the manipulation of a song or a musician’s character at scale, it vastly devalues and negates the creative act itself.\n\nBut what do musicians actually think of the prospect of their work being used to train AI, and reworked by the general public? “Everybody should be selling or licensing their voice and their skills to these companies,” Dave Stewart of Eurythmics argued to me this week. “Otherwise they’re just going to take it anyway.” That view is directly countered by the major labels and AI companies, who have insisted artists and songwriters get to opt in to have their music made available, and if they do, get royalties when their music is used to train AI, or manipulated by users on platforms such as Udio, Suno and Klay.\n\nOthers take a grimmer view about how these companies might reshape the industry. Irving Azoff, legendarily forthright artist manager and founder of the Music Artists Coalition in the US, responded to the Universal/Udio deal with biting cynicism. “We’ve seen this before – everyone talks about ‘partnership,’ but artists end up on the sidelines with scraps,” he said. In the wake of the same deal, the Council of Music Makers in the UK accused the major labels of “spin” and called for a more robust set of artist-label agreements. And the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance says there is a disturbing “lack of transparency” around the deals (though more detail is likely to emerge on what users can do with any music they create, and any potential commercial uses of it).\n\nCatherine Anne Davies, who records as the Anchoress and also sits on the board of directors at the Featured Artists Coalition (FAC), has many reservations here. “Most people don’t even want their work to be used for training AI,” she says. “I’m on the dystopian side, or maybe what I call the realist side of things. I’m interested in the way that AI can be assistive in the creative process – if it can make us more efficient, if it can streamline our processes. But generative AI for me, in terms of creative output, is a big no-no at the moment. I’m yet to be convinced.”\n\nMusician Imogen Heap feels that AI itself is not to be feared as a tool – she uses an AI she calls Mogen to listen to every aspect of her life, with a view to it being a creative partner (as explored in a recent Guardian article). To help address some of the issues, she has created Auracles, an artist-led, non-profit platform she hopes will be the place where the rights and permissions around AI are set out. It’s not enough to say you’re happy with your music being used by AI, she says – instead, what’s needed are “permissions that grow and evolve over time”.\n\nOther companies are cropping up with similar offers. “We must protect the artists at all costs,” says Sean Power, chief executive of Musical AI, who aims to give musicians “an exact portion of the influence they’re having on all the generative outputs” – meaning compensation every time even a tiny bit of one of their songs is used by a user of Udio et al.\n\nTerms of these deals are undisclosed, but labels are likely to be seeking settlement for any past use of their artists’ copyrights as well as an advance on future use, plus an equity stake in the platform. And while artists will be able to opt out of including their work, they probably won’t be consulted on these partnerships going ahead, with this lack of consultation being something that artist representative bodies such as FAC have been particularly critical of. “The big artists, the labels need to be nice to; those who have a platform will be consulted to some degree,” says a music licensing expert, speaking anonymously. “The very few, who as individual artists are able to make a dent on share price, will have approval.”\n\nI approached Universal, Sony and Warner about the specific concerns raised by artists here: namely limited transparency around the deals, their commercial terms and how opt-ins work; if there is a risk of gen AI undermining existing revenue sources; and if there is significant artist refusal to assign their works for gen AI training. None of the companies would comment on the record about the specifics. Though in an internal Universal memo about AI deals, sent to all staff earlier this year and seen by the Guardian, Grainge said “we will NOT license any model that uses an artist’s voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist’s existing songs without their consent.”\n\nThe Guardian understands that labels are currently having discussions with artists and their managers to better explain how these deals will work and why they believe they can bring in additional revenue, although they will need to convince artists that gen AI will not damage other sources of income, notably from streaming.\n\nBut it isn’t clear whether consumers will actually pay to play around with music in the way Udio and others hope they will. AI is the single biggest hype category in Silicon Valley right now, with an average of $2bn of venture capital investment going into AI companies every week in the first half of this year. Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet (parent company of Google), recently warned of the catastrophic domino effect across the tech sector if this AI bubble bursts, a concern the Bank of England also recently raised.\n\nReed Smith’s Gregor Pryor argues that AI music could, counterintuitively, end up being positive for human musicians. “By its nature, AI is derivative and cannot create new music,” he says. “Some investors in music catalogues that I speak to say it’s good for artists, because music ‘verified’ as created by humans will have greater value.”\n\nArtists will frame their work as having an invaluable human essence, their music speaking entirely from the heart, but it will become incrementally more difficult for the casual listener to distinguish between music created by a human and that created by AI. The Guardian understands that radio stations and DJs are currently extremely nervous about AI-powered music slipping through their quality filters, effectively hoodwinking them and hanging question marks over how their playlists work. The example of Papi Lamour might force them to do much greater due diligence on what they put forward for airplay consideration. Or they could be the first trickles of a flood that roars through radio and streaming services as the boundaries between AI and human-created music crumble.\n\nDavies is especially worried about artists not thinking through the long-term implications of licensing to AI services. “We cannot think of ourselves selfishly as entities that will be unaffected, because the entire ecosystem will experience a knock-on effect financially. What about your fellow composers and creators? But also what about the generations to come after? Are we fucking this completely, just to make sure that we can pay our mortgages now?”\n\nAI’s current level of sophistication means it is really producing composites of existing music, creating a Frankenstein’s monster of melodies. However, when AGI (artificial general intelligence) finally arrives, with Anthropic co-founder Dario Amodei suggesting that could happen as soon as next year, we will be catapulted into an exhilarating and terrifying realm of uncertainty for the future and the purpose of human-created art.\n\n“It’s literally happening under our noses,” warns Davies. “We should be so much more concerned than we are.”",

    "fullText": "Liz Kendall faces pressure from campaigners as she tells parliament there is no clear consensus on issue\n\nA campaign fronted by popstars including Elton John and Dua Lipa to protect artists’ works from being mined to train AI models without consent has received a boost after almost every respondent to a government consultation backed their case.\n\nNinety-five per cent of the more than 10,000 people who had their say over how music, novels, films and other works should be protected from copyright infringements by tech companies called for copyright to be strengthened and a requirement for licensing in all cases or no change to copyright law.\n\nMinisters subsequently dropped that preference in the face of a backlash. Artists who have opposed any dilution of their copyright include Sam Fender, Kate Bush and the Pet Shop Boys. Campaigners to protect artists’ copyright have voiced fears that ministers have paid too much attention to US tech companies’ interests.\n\nThe US president, Donald Trump, has said: “We have to allow AI to use that [copyrighted] pool of knowledge without going through the complexity of contract negotiations,” and warned international governments not to “make rules and regulations that … make it impossible” for AI companies to do business.\n\nLast month Paul McCartney stepped up the campaign to protect copyright by releasing a new recording, which was almost entirely silent save for some ambient clattering in the studio as a protest against copyright theft by AI companies.\n\nLiz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament on Monday there was “no clear consensus” on the issue and the government would “take the time to get this right”, and promised to make policy proposals by 18 March 2026.\n\n“Our approach to copyright and AI must support prosperity for all UK citizens, and drive innovation and growth for sectors across the economy, including the creative industries,” she said. “This means keeping the UK at the cutting edge of science and technology so UK citizens can benefit from major breakthroughs, transformative innovation and greater prosperity.\n\n“It also means continuing to support our creative industries, which make a huge economic contribution, shape our national identity and give us a unique position on the world stage.”\n\nBut campaigners for copyright holders said the consultation response set a clear course for the government to take.\n\n“This is an overwhelming show of support for the commonsense position that AI companies should pay for the resources they use, and a total rejection of the government’s ‘preferred option’ of handing AI companies the work of the UK’s creatives for free,” said Ed Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for copyright fairness.\n\n“Liz Kendall should listen to the people and rule out changing copyright law to benefit AI companies.”\n\nOwen Meredith, the chief executive of the New Media Association, urged Kendall to rule out any new copyright exception and end the uncertainty created by “this prolonged process”.\n\n“This will send a clear message to AI developers that they must enter into licensing agreements with the UK’s media and creative copyright owners, unlocking investment and strengthening the market for the high-quality content that is the most valuable ingredient in producing safe, trustworthy AI models,” he said.\n\nLast month, Kendall indicated she was sympathetic to artists’ demands not to have their copyrighted works scraped by AI companies without payment and wanted to “reset” the debate. “People rightly want to get paid for the work that they do,” she said, and “we have to find a way that both sectors can grow and thrive in future”.",

    "description": "The Oaktree cofounder sees echoes of past bubbles in the current AI frenzy and urged investors to focus on durable, profitable tech giants.",
    "fullText": "Legendary investor Howard Marks has seen enough manias to know when a bubble is brewing.\n\nOn the \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast last Saturday, the billionaire and cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management said he is alarmed by how many investors are piling into speculative startups in hopes of landing the next trillion-dollar winner.\n\n\"Do you want to have a novel entrepreneurial startup pure play which has no revenues and no profits today, but could be a moonshot if it works?\" he asked.\n\n\"Or do you want to invest in a great tech company, which is already existing and making a lot of money where AI could be incremental but not life-changing? It's a choice.\"\n\nToo many investors, he said, are treating AI like a lottery where the slim chance of a jackpot overshadows the far greater likelihood of failure.\n\n\"People say, 'Well, they have a low probability of success, but maybe a big payoff, so I should buy it.' That's what I call lottery-ticket mentality,\" he said.\n\nMarks has been sounding this warning for months.\n\nIn a 2023 conversation with financial historian Edward Chancellor on Oaktree's \"Behind the Memo\" series, he put it bluntly: \"AI will change the world,\" he said, predicting that most of the companies that people are investing in today for AI purposes \"will end up worthless.\"\n\nOn the \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast, Marks said he sees echoes of the dot-com era: a groundbreaking technology, sky-high expectations, and a growing assumption that early movers will inevitably dominate.\n\n\"Most bubbles are around something new,\" he said, pointing to the growth-stock boom of 1969, the subprime-mortgage mania of 2006, the dot-com bubble in 1999, the 1720 South Sea Bubble, and even the Tulip Craze of 1636 in the Netherlands.\n\nSuch moments, he added, arise because \"the imagination is untrammelled, and it can go off in a flight of fancy.\"\n\nIn reality, he said, most early-stage companies don't survive the transition from promise to profitability.\n\n\"On the AI, I'm led to believe that you can make binary bets in companies that have nothing else going on, which will be sink-or-swim bets, or you can invest in pre-existing great tech companies, which will get moderate benefits from AI if they're successful.\"\n\nRather than gamble on moonshots, Marks said he'd rather own stocks in established tech titans that are already generating profits — companies that can integrate AI as an incremental advantage rather than a life-or-death proposition.\n\nHe contrasted those firms with the fragile AI startups drawing hype, saying that Big Tech is positioned to reap some benefits from AI, even if the technology rolls out more slowly or unevenly than hoped.\n\nBut a breakthrough in productivity doesn't automatically translate into investment gains.\n\n\"Change the world and investors making money are not the same thing.\"\n\nMarks echoed a warning Warren Buffett issued at Berkshire Hathaway's 2000 annual meeting, when Buffett warned that the internet stock mania had detached valuations from underlying profit potential — a mistake he believes investors are repeating with AI.\n\n\"I think the same is true of AI,\" he said.",

    "description": "Sol Rashidi worked in the AI space for 15 years, and said it's important to make a conscious effort not to outsource your thinking.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sol Rashidi, a former tech executive at IBM, AWS, and Estée Lauder, who is based in Miami. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the last 15 years, I have built and scaled AI capabilities, and I have over 200 deployments under my belt.\n\nI went from being an individual practitioner to running IBM's enterprise data management practice. I was the chief data officer at Sony Music, the chief analytics officer at Estée Lauder, and the head of technology for AWS's startup division in North America.\n\nAll my experiences from 2011 on have led me to realize there's a real chance people will develop a codependency on AI. So I'm focused on workforce preparation and educating the masses.\n\nNow I have my own company where I'm working on solving the problem of AI in the workforce by teaching enterprises how to prepare their workforce for the future, and how to use AI and automation to amplify the workforce instead of eliminating it. If you're going to use AI in your day-to-day, great — but you have to be conscientious, to outsource tasks and not your critical thinking. You need to avoid intellectual atrophy.\n\nIntellectual atrophy is when you lose your cognitive ability to think critically because you're outsourcing that thinking to tech. Just like our muscles atrophy if we don't use them, so does our brain. The big thing that you've got to be careful of is making sure that generative AI doesn't make your thinking become generic, because everyone else is also using ChatGPT. You maintain your edge by using cognitive power.\n\nAs an individual, I use six to eight AI tools every day. I use AI a lot for data processing, so I can think about the patterns and insights and, from there, observe and spotlight frameworks and models.\n\nBut when using the tools, I always ask myself, \"Am I using this to accelerate work I have to do, or am I using it to do the work for me?\" It needs to accelerate the work so that the thinking is left to me. \"This is making me faster, but is it making me more capable? This is making me more productive, but is this making me more valuable?\" I use the tools to expedite and facilitate versus doing the work for me.\n\nPart of what I do is communication, and I don't ever want to lose that edge. I don't use AI to write emails, keynotes, or personal interactions.\n\nIt's really important for me to be able to understand whether or not what I'm communicating is being perceived in the way I intended. That takes practice. Anything that comes from the heart or mind has to be sincere, expressive, and communicate the right messaging. It has to be organically generated by me — no exceptions.\n\nWe live in a society right now that values convenience over competition and speed over substance. But the key to keeping up is actually slowing down, because there is no shortage of information coming to us. We're ingesting so many gigabytes of data every day through WhatsApp, Slack, email, LinkedIn, and Instagram. The way we used to handle the workload of the past cannot be replicated to handle the speed of today.\n\nSo we have to develop our discernment muscles, which is the ability to spot a signal from noise. A large percentage of content worldwide right now is AI-generated, and we have AI-generated content that is being cannibalized to retrain itself.\n\nMoving forward, we're going to get to the point of diminishing return. Problem-solving skills are going to be so important, and it will be super important to discern, validate, and verify AI responses. You can use AI to author the first draft, but maybe don't copy and paste the output because it's often inaccurate. Think of it as a first draft always.\n\nThe last team that I managed was a data science team at a Fortune 500 company. I tasked my junior and senior data scientists to come up with an approach for the CMO for a new product. My junior scientist produced the same deliverable as the senior scientists but it took them less than half the time because they took the word of ChatGPT.\n\nIt sounded great, but they short-circuited the process of research and verification, so I had to make a new mandate that they cannot use AI to do the work for them, but only to help facilitate and accelerate the research.\n\nI told my junior scientists and anyone highly codependent on AI, \"I'm paying for your brain and uniqueness. I'm not paying you to copy and paste, because, quite frankly, a license for enterprise API from OpenAI is a lot cheaper than you.\"\n\nIt's so easy to ask ChatGPT a question and get an answer that sounds really good. But if you don't use critical thinking and depend on yourself to solve problems, you could be outdated within a few years.\n\nHow is AI affecting your work?

    "fullText": "Adtech company Fluency has built a platform that helps brands and agencies automate their campaigns across Meta, TikTok, Google, and other platforms. Now, it aims to introduce AI agents to the mix.\n\nLarge brands and agencies typically manage campaigns across multiple platforms and ad buying tools, known as demand-side platforms, each with separate logins and interfaces.\n\nFounded in 2017 in Burlington, Vermont, Fluency created what it describes as a digital advertising operating system. It connects to the various platforms' application programming interfaces (APIs) and lets its customers manage their digital ads using a single workflow.\n\n\"It takes a lot of people, and hours, and button clicking to be able to effectively execute your advertising,\" Fluency CEO Mike Lane said in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nHe added that Fluency wanted to \"help simplify and streamline that, much like HubSpot or Salesforce\" did in the customer relationship management (CRM) space. Fluency's competitor set includes other campaign management and ad automation tools, such as Hootsuite, Smartly, and Sprinklr, though these companies tend to cater to larger advertisers and agencies.\n\nThe company said it manages around $3 billion in annual ad spend for brands and agencies, including Cox Automotive, Innocean, and The Johnson Group.\n\nFluency is set to announce on Tuesday that it has raised a $40 million Series A investment round, led and fully funded by Integrity Growth Partners.\n\nFluency said it plans to invest the funds in enhancing its agentic AI capabilities, which can autonomously oversee marketers' digital ad campaigns. This could mean AI agents automatically swapping out ad creatives or copy with better-performing versions, for example.\n\nFluency mostly uses Amazon's Bedrock generative AI models, as well as Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, the company said.\n\nLane said that for agentic AI to work effectively for a marketer's digital advertising, the AI needs robust frameworks and structures to operate within, connections to all major media platforms, and for everything to be integrated into a single system.\n\nHe said these factors make Fluency well-positioned to be \"the premium platform for agentic\" AI in the digital ads space.\n\nCheck out the pitch deck Fluency used to secure its $40 million Series A investment, shared exclusively with Business Insider. Some of the slides have been omitted or redacted.\n\nFluency says marketers often use \"point solutions\" that don't interact with each other, which can also bring in issues around compliance and performance.\n\nFluency says ad strategists often have to cobble together several different tech solutions to handle tasks like targeting or reviewing campaign performance.\n\nFluency's platform aims to address these concerns as a kind of \"one-stop shop\" across various channels.\n\nThose attributes include a blue-chip client base and high customer-retention rates.\n\nThere's been a shift in budgets from big agency holding companies to independent agencies, though smaller firms have constrained resources, Fluency says.\n\nFluency says its \"serviceable addressable market\" is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11%, reaching $6.4 billion by 2028.\n\nFluency says its platform serves agencies and brands better than agency-developed tech, in-house channel management, legacy omni-channel tools, and point solutions.\n\nThe slide showcases how the Fluency platform integrates a marketer's own data, big media platforms, and DSPs using AI automation to manage campaigns and assess their performance.\n\nFluency says its tools can save customers time, improve ad performance, and boost their revenue.",

    "title": "There are 2 kinds of market bubbles, and AI isn't either of them yet, portfolio manager at $35 billion fund says",
    "description": "A portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds says market bubbles come in the form of either valuations or earnings. AI isn't either kind of bubble just yet.",
    "fullText": "You're either in one camp or the other as 2025 comes to a close: you think AI is a bubble or that AI is not a bubble.\n\nBut for those wondering where they stand, there's nuance in the debate to be aware of, specifically, what kind of bubble might AI be?\n\nWell, there are two kinds, according to a portfolio manager at $35 billion Gabelli Funds. John Belton says stock market bubbles are either earnings-driven or valuation-driven.\n\nLike many finance pros, he compared the current AI landscape to the dot-com era, noting that prices for top tech stocks today are high relative to profits but not overly so. For that reason, he maintains that the AI market likely hasn't entered a valuation bubble.\n\n\"It is very difficult to argue we are in a valuation bubble currently. As an example, median 'Mag 7' (seven largest tech co's) forward P/E was close to 90x at YE99 vs. ~25x today,\" he said. \"Valuations seem to simply reflect strong fundamentals without obvious excess. Are we in an earnings bubble? Time will tell.\"\n\nThe portfolio manager shared two reasons he doesn't think AI has fallen into an earnings bubble at present, though. The biggest reason is that while AI capex spending is high, the bulk of it is being used to strengthen already-profitable businesses.\n\nThe second is that the list of use cases for AI is growing.\n\n\"Second biggest reason to feel confident we are not in an earnings bubble: additional large-scale use cases are beginning to present themselves. Autonomous driving, robotics, life sciences, other scientific discovery, agentic software. We do need at least some of these use cases to become commercial — early, but there is promise.\"\n\nBelton pointed to concerns surrounding Oracle and Broadcom, which have both seen recent declines as investors question high capex spending and returns on AI investments. However, Belton added that he thinks both stocks have the potential to shake off the current volatility, and that Broadcom is among the top chip stocks to own right now.\n\nThe portfolio manager is bullish on the AI trade's continued strength in the near term, but said investors are right to be cautious about massive spending from OpenAI.\n\n\"Like any infrastructure cycle this too will be a cycle (question is not if we reach a peak, but when and how high the peak is),\" he said.",

    "description": "Meta has given employees access to Google Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-5 alongside its own AI tools to help boost productivity.",
    "fullText": "In its push to create an \"AI-first\" workplace, Meta is expanding employees' access to tools from rivals such as Google and OpenAI, Business Insider has learned.\n\nThe social media giant has been encouraging employees to integrate AI tools into nearly everything they do, according to multiple internal documents and posts seen by Business Insider.\n\nOne of the company's priorities is to \"make AI core to how we work,\" Meta's chief information officer, Atish Banerjea, told employees in a June memo outlining a plan to use Meta's own models — which use the naming convention \"Llama\" — alongside products from other firms.\n\nIn November, a Meta engineer said in an internal post that all employees have access to Google's Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's ChatGPT-5. The post included a list of AI tools Meta employees have access to, including their use cases. Business Insider has recreated the list below.\n\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the revamped suite of AI tools and pointed to an earlier comment shared with Business Insider about AI adoption, stating: \"It's well-known that this is a priority, and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work.\"\n\nThe social media giant opened the floodgates to rival AI models in June.\n\nAmong those is an internal coding tool called Devmate that uses Anthropic's Claude, Business Insider previously reported. Google's Gemini and NotebookLM Pro are also available across the company to help employees \"work smarter and have more impact,\" Banerjea told employees in the June memo.\n\nMeta has invested tens of billions into its own consumer-facing AI models, and employees have access to an internal AI assistant called Metamate, which is built on its Llama models.\n\nAfter Meta struck a deal over the summer the startup Midjourney to weave its AI-image generator into its products and models, the company made the tool available to employees in October for \"concept and production uses\" to speed up design work and creative prototyping, according to an internal post ahead of the rollout, seen by Business Insider.\n\nGemini isn't the only Google tool Meta is embracing. The company migrated its internal productivity suite over the summer to Google Workspace — including Chat, Gmail, Docs, and Drive — describing the move in a June memo as a way to \"unlock AI-driven capabilities\" and better integrate with its expanding toolset.\n\nOn the engineering side, Meta has expanded access to agentic coding systems, adding Google's Gemini 3 Pro and exploring new integrations with tools like OpenAI's Codex CLI and Google's Gemini CLI. \"Rather than focusing on specific solutions, our strategy centers on outcomes: increasing productivity, accelerating development, and ensuring you have access to the best agentic coding experiences,\" Reality Labs executive Maher Saba told employees in a November memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nTo encourage adoption and experimentation, Meta has gamified the use of AI, Business Insider previously reported. Earlier this year, it launched an internal game called \"Level Up,\" which rewards employees with badges for using AI in different ways. Leaders are also tying performance to results achieved through AI, rewarding those who can prove \"AI-driven impact\" this year, and including it as part of performance reviews in 2026.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA) on Monday unveiled a new family of open-source artificial intelligence models that it says will be faster, cheaper and ​smarter than its previous offerings, as open-source offerings from Chinese AI labs proliferate.\n\nNvidia ‌is primarily known for providing chips that firms such as OpenAI use to train their closed-source models and ‌charge money for them. But it also offers a slew of its own models for everything from physics simulations to self-driving vehicles as open-source software that can be used by researchers or by other companies, with firms such as Palantir Technologies weaving Nvidia's model into their products.\n\nNvidia ⁠on Monday revealed the third ‌generation of its \"Nemotron\" large-language models aimed at writing, coding and other tasks. The smallest of the models, called Nemotron 3 Nano, was being released ‍Monday, with two other, larger versions coming in the first half of 2026.\n\nNvidia, which has become the world's most valuable listed company, said that Nemotron 3 Nano was more efficient than its predecessor - ​meaning it would be cheaper to run - and would do better at long tasks ‌with multiple steps.\n\nNvidia is releasing the models as open-source offerings from Chinese tech firms such as DeepSeek, Moonshot AI and Alibaba Group Holdings are becoming widely used in the tech industry, with companies such as Airbnb disclosing use of Alibaba' s. (BABA) Qwen open-source model.\n\nAt the same time, CNBC and Bloomberg have reported that Meta Platforms is considering shifting toward closed-source ⁠models, leaving Nvidia as one of the most prominent ​U.S. providers of open-source offerings.\n\nMany U.S. states and ​government entities have banned use of Chinese models over security concerns.\n\nKari Briski, vice president of generative AI software for enterprise at Nvidia, said the company aimed ‍to provide a \"model that ⁠people can depend on\", and was also openly releasing its training data and other tools so that government and business users could test it for security and ⁠customize it.\n\n\"This is why we're treating it like a library,\" Briski told Reuters in an interview. \"This is ‌why we're committed to it from a software engineering perspective.\"",

In such an environment, dividend stocks can offer a reliable income stream, making them an appealing choice for those looking to balance growth potential with consistent returns.\n\nProvident Financial Services (PFS)\n\nFirst Interstate BancSystem (FIBK)\n\nLet's explore several standout options from the results in the screener.\n\nSimply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★★★\n\nOverview: Citizens & Northern Corporation is a bank holding company for Citizens & Northern Bank, offering a range of banking and related services to individual and corporate clients, with a market cap of $391.46 million.\n\nOperations: Citizens & Northern Corporation generates its revenue primarily from its Community Banking segment, which accounts for $109.63 million.\n\nCitizens & Northern offers a stable dividend yield of 5.09%, placing it in the top 25% of U.S. dividend payers. Recent affirmations include a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per share, supported by a reasonable payout ratio of 63.9%. Earnings showed modest growth, with net interest income rising to US$22.26 million for Q3 2025, and net income at US$6.55 million, suggesting continued support for its reliable and growing dividends over the past decade despite minor shareholder dilution recently.\n\nDive into the specifics of Citizens & Northern here with our thorough dividend report.\n\nAccording our valuation report, there's an indication that Citizens & Northern's share price might be on the expensive side.\n\nSimply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★★☆\n\nOverview: CompX International Inc. manufactures and sells security products and recreational marine components primarily in North America, with a market cap of $300.19 million.\n\nOperations: CompX International Inc.'s revenue is derived from two main segments: $121.76 million from Security Products and $37.25 million from Marine Components.\n\nCompX International's dividend yield of 9.03% ranks it among the top 25% of U.S. dividend payers, with a stable and reliable history over the past decade. The company recently declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, though its high cash payout ratio of 183.3% raises sustainability concerns as dividends aren't covered by free cash flows despite earnings coverage at a 76.5% payout ratio. Earnings have shown modest growth, supporting continued payouts for now.",

    "description": "The engineer behind Claude Code says vibe coding works for prototypes, but today's AI models still fall short for maintainable software.",
    "fullText": "The creator of one of the most popular AI coding tools says vibe coding can only go so far.\n\nBoris Cherny, the engineer behind Anthropic's Claude Code, said on an episode of \"The Peterman Podcast\" published Monday that while vibe coding has its place, it's far from a universal solution.\n\nIt works well for \"throwaway code and prototypes, code that's not in the critical path,\" he said.\n\n\"I do this all the time, but it's definitely not the thing you want to do all the time,\" Cherny said, referring to vibe coding.\n\n\"You want maintainable code sometimes. You want to be very thoughtful about every line sometimes,\" he added.\n\nClaude Code launched earlier this year as part of Anthropic's efforts to integrate AI more deeply into code development workflows.\n\nTop AI coding services like Cursor and Augment run on Anthropic's models, and even Meta uses Anthropic's models inside its coding assistant. Claude Code has also taken off with non-technical developers who want to build software with natural-language prompts.\n\nAnthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, said in October that Claude was writing 90% of the code in the company.\n\nFor critical coding tasks, Cherny said he typically pairs with a model to write code.\n\nHe starts by asking an AI model to generate a plan, then iterates on the implementation in small steps. \"I might ask it to improve the code or clean it up or so on,\" he said.\n\nFor parts of the system where he has strong technical opinions, Cherny said he still writes the code by hand.\n\nCherny said the models are still \"not great at coding.\"\n\n\"There's still so much room to improve, and this is the worst it's ever going to be,\" he said.\n\nCherny said it's \"insane\" to compare current tools to where AI coding was just a year ago, when it amounted to little more than type-ahead autocomplete. Now, it's a \"completely different world,\" he said, adding that what excites him is how fast the models are improving.\n\nAI-assisted coding has been gaining momentum across the tech world.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said last month that vibe coding is \"making coding so much more enjoyable,\" adding that people with no technical background can now build simple apps and websites.\n\n\"Things are getting more approachable, it's getting exciting again, and the amazing thing is, it's only going to get better,\" he said in a podcast interview with Logan Kilpatrick, who leads Google's AI Studio.\n\nPichai said during Alphabet's April earnings call that AI is writing over 30% of the new code at Google, an increase from 25% in October 2024.\n\nIt's \"fantastic\" how quickly developers can write software with AI coding tools, sometimes while \"barely looking at the code,\" said Google Brain founder Andrew Ng in May.\n\nFor non-technical developers, vibe coding has enabled them to automate parts of their jobs, prototype ideas, or build a creative product on the side, Business Insider reported last month.\n\nStill, leaders caution that the technology has limits. AI-generated code could contain mistakes, be overly verbose, or lack the proper structure.\n\n\"I'm not working on large codebases where you really have to get it right, the security has to be there,\" Pichai said in November.",

    "fullText": "It’s been three years since OpenAI set off euphoria over artificial intelligence with the release of ChatGPT. And while the money is still pouring in, so are the doubts about whether the good times can last.\n\nA recent sell-off in the shares of Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp.’s plunge after reporting mounting spending on AI, souring sentiment around a network of companies exposed to OpenAI — signs of skepticism are increasing. Looking to 2026, the debate among investors is whether to rein in AI exposure ahead of a potential bubble popping or double down to capitalize on the game-changing technology.\n\n“We’re in the phase of the cycle where the rubber meets the road,” said Jim Morrow, chief executive of Callodine Capital Management. “It’s been a good story, but we’re sort of anteing up at this point to see whether the returns on investment are going to be good.”\n\nThe queasiness about the AI trade involves its uses, the enormous cost of developing it, and whether consumers ultimately will pay for the services. Those answers will have major implications for the stock market’s future.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 index’s three-year, $30-trillion bull run has largely been driven by the world’s biggest tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as firms benefiting from spending on AI infrastructure such as chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom Inc. and electricity providers such as Constellation Energy Corp. If they stop rising, the equities indexes will follow.\n\n“These stocks don’t correct because the growth rate goes down,” said Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital. “These stocks correct when the growth rate doesn’t accelerate any further.”\n\nOf course, there are still plenty of reasons for optimism. The tech giants that account for much of the AI spending have vast resources and have pledged to keep pumping in cash in the years ahead. Plus, developers of AI services, such as Alphabet’s Google, continue to make strides with new models. Hence the debate.\n\nHere’s a look at the key trends to watch while navigating through these choppy waters.\n\nOpenAI alone plans to spend $1.4 trillion in the coming years. But the Sam Altman-led company, which became the world’s most valuable startup in October, is generating far less revenue than its operating costs. It expects to burn $115 billion through 2029 before generating cash in 2030, the Information reported in September.\n\nThe company has had no problem with fundraising, collecting $40 billion from Softbank Group Corp. and other investors earlier this year. Nvidia pledged to invest as much as $100 billion in September, one of a series of deals the chipmaker has made that funnel cash to its customers, which is causing fears of circular financing in the AI industry.\n\nOpenAI could run into trouble if investors start to balk at committing more capital. And the consequences would spiral to the companies in its orbit, such as computing services provider CoreWeave Inc.\n\n“If you think about how much money — it’s in the trillions now — is crowded into a small group of themes and names, when there’s the first hint of that theme even having short-term issues or just valuations get so stretched they can’t possibly continue to grow like that, they’re all leaving at once,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund.\n\nPlenty of other companies are reliant on external funding to pursue AI ambitions. Oracle shares soared as it racked up bookings for cloud computing services, but building those data centers will require massive amounts of cash, which the company has secured by selling tens of billions of dollars in bonds. Using debt puts pressure on a company because bondholders need to be paid in cash on a schedule, unlike equity investors, who mostly profit as share prices rise.\n\nOracle’s stock got pounded on Thursday after the company reported significantly higher capital expenditures than expected in its fiscal second quarter and cloud sales growth missed the average analyst estimate. On Friday, a report that some data center projects it’s developing for OpenAI have been delayed sent Oracle’s shares down further and weighed on other stocks exposed to AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, a gauge of Oracle’s credit risk hit the highest level since 2009.\n\nAn Oracle spokesperson said in a statement that the company remained confident in its ability to meet its obligations and future expansion plans.\n\n“The credit people are smarter than the equity people, or at least they’re worried about the right thing — getting their money back,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to spend more than $400 billion on capital expenditures in the next 12 months, most of it for data centers. Although those companies are seeing AI-related revenue growth from cloud-computing and advertising businesses, it’s nowhere near the costs they’re incurring.\n\n“Any plateauing of growth projections or decelerations, we’re going to wind up in a situation where the market says, ‘OK, there’s an issue here,’” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading.\n\nEarnings growth for the Magnificent Seven tech giants, which also includes Apple Inc., Nvidia and Tesla Inc., is projected to be 18% in 2026, the slowest in four years and slightly better than the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nRising depreciation expenses from the data center binge is a major worry. Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta combined for about $10 billion in depreciation costs in the final quarter of 2023. The figure rose to nearly $22 billion in the quarter that just ended in September. And it’s expected to be about $30 billion by this time next year.\n\nAll of this could put pressure on buybacks and dividends, which return cash to stockholders. In 2026, Meta and Microsoft are expected to have negative free cash flow after accounting for shareholder returns, while Alphabet is seen roughly breaking even, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern about all the spending is the strategy shift it represents. Big Tech’s value has long been premised on the companies’ ability to generate rapid revenue growth at low costs, which resulted in immense free cash flows. But their plans for AI have turned that upside down.\n\n“If we continue down the track of lever up our company to build out for the hopes that we can monetize this, multiples are going to contract,” O’Rourke said. “If things don’t come together for you, this whole pivot would have been a drastic mistake.”\n\nWhile Big Tech’s valuations are high, they’re nowhere near excessive compared with past periods of market euphoria. Comparisons with the dot-com bust are common, but the magnitude of the gains from AI are nothing like what happened during the development of the internet. For example, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is priced at 26 times projected profits, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That figure exceeded 80 times at the height of the dot-com bubble.\n\nValuations during the dot-com era were far in excess of where they are now partly because of how far the stocks had run, but also because the companies were younger and less profitable — if they had profits at all.\n\n“These aren’t dot-com multiples,” said Tony DeSpirito, global chief investment officer and portfolio manager of fundamental equities at BlackRock. “This isn’t to say there aren’t pockets of speculation or irrational exuberance, because there are, but I don’t think that exuberance is in the AI-related names of the Mag 7.”\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc., which trades at a multiple of more than 180 times estimated profits, is among the AI stocks with nosebleed valuations. Snowflake Inc. is another, with a multiple of almost 140 times projected earnings. But Nvidia, Alphabet and Microsoft are all below 30 times, which is relatively tame considering all the euphoria surrounding them.\n\nAll of which leaves investors in a quandary. Yes, the risks are right on the surface even as investors keep pouring into AI stocks. But for now, most companies aren’t priced at panic-inducing levels. The question is which direction the AI trade goes from here.\n\n“This kind of group thinking is going to crack,” Value Point’s Bhasin said. “It probably won’t crash like it did in 2000. But we’ll see a rotation.”\n\nWittenstein writes for Bloomberg.",

    "title": "The Kindle App Now Has Built-In AI, Because of Course It Does",
    "description": "The feature is always on, whether or not you want it to be.",
    "fullText": "It's 2025, so every piece of technology now needs to have an AI component. It doesn't matter if these AI features are useful (though some are), they just need to be there, however ham-fisted or useless they may seem—though the line between those extremes often comes down to user preference. To that end, if you've ever been reading a book on the Kindle app and wished that you could ask your device a question about the text, Amazon has an AI bot for you.\n\nLast week, Amazon announced \"Ask this Book,\" a new AI feature for the Kindle app. Now available on the iOS version of the app, it lets you ask Amazon's AI questions about whatever it is you're reading, whether you bought or borrowed the title. You can highlight a selection from the text to include in you're queries, and ask questions relating the story's plot, characters, relationships, and theme. According to Amazon, all answers will be contextual, presumably meaning they'll all be related to the text at hand, and importantly, all answers will be spoiler-free. That should help avoid the classic mistake of googling a question you have about a book you're reading and spoiling a coming plot twist or character death.\n\nAmazon says Ask this Book is currently active for \"thousands\" of books written in English. As noted, as of this writing the feature is only live in the iOS version of the app, but Amazon is working on bringing it to the Android app, as well as Kindle devices, next year.\n\nIf this sounds like the type of feature you'd be interested in, great! If you don't care for this feature, either as a reader who doesn't want AI getting in the way of their books, a publisher who doesn't want Amazon training its AI on their IP, or a teacher who might see this as a potential cheating opportunity, there's bad news: Once Amazon makes Ask this Book available for any given title, it's permanently available, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. That comes directly from an Amazon spokesperson, who told Publishers Lunch, “[t]o ensure a consistent reading experience, the feature is always on, and there is no option for authors or publishers to opt titles out.”\n\nThat response bothers me for two reasons. One, it's always frustrating when a company introduces a new feature lwithout giving users the option to turn it off. I don't use Apple Intelligence, but I appreciate that Apple lets me turn it off. Meta, on the other hand, forces me to contend with Meta AI, even though I never use it. Amazon seems to be attending the Meta school of user design.\n\nBut what's more, it seems wild to me that authors and publishers don't get a say as to whether this AI bot gets to be active on their books—especially retroactively. It'd even be one thing if authors had to opt-in in order to put their books on the Kindle platform going forward. But to enable it on \"thousands\" of titles made available before Ask this Book was ever a thing is, to me, disrespectful to authors and publishers, to say the least.\n\nInterestingly, Amazon dodged questions from Publishers Lunch concerning licensing rights around Ask this Book, as well as protections for users, which is troubling given generative AI has a habit of hallucinating—or, in other words, making things up completely. Sure, when it's working as intended, the AI can help readers understand things they're confused about, but there's a real chance that the AI will misinterpret questions, misrepresent the text, or straight up lie, which could negatively impact a reader's experience of the work, with potential fallout for both the author and the publisher.\n\nWhile you won't see this feature yet on your Kindle, you will encounter it in the Kindle app. You can either access it from the menu in any book where the feature is available, or by highlighting text in said book. Once you do, Ask this Book will present a list of questions it thinks you might be interested in asking. If none of them do it for you, you can formulate your own questions, and ask followups after the bot answers.",

Once they do know—particularly if they’re boomers—they want it desperately. Fortell is a hearing aid, one that claims to use AI to provide a dramatically superior aural experience. The chosen few included in its beta test claim that it seems to top the performance of high-end devices they’d been unhappily using.\n\nThese testers have made pilgrimages to Fortell’s headquarters on the fifth floor of a WeWork facility in New York City’s trendy SoHo neighborhood, where they were fitted for the hearing aids—which from the outside look pretty much like standard, over-the-ear, teardrop-shaped devices. But the big moment comes when a Fortell staffer takes them down to street level. There, among street clatter, honking cabs, and delivery trucks backing up to luxury stores, they are asked to conduct a conversation with a Fortell worker. Two other employees stand behind them, adding their own loud discourse to the urban cacophony.\n\nDespite the din, the testers clearly make out what the person in front of them is saying.

But now they fear that casual users who rely on search engines or social media to find a recipe for dinner will conflate their work with AI slop and stop trusting online recipe sites altogether.\n\n“There are a lot of people that are scared to even talk about what’s going on because it is their livelihood,” says Jim Delmage who, with his wife, Tara, runs the blog and YouTube channel Sip and Feast.\n\nMatt Rodbard, the founder and editor-in-chief of the website Taste, is even more pessimistic. Taste used to publish recipes more frequently, but now it mostly focuses on journalism and a podcast (which Rodbard hosts). “For websites that depend on the advertising model,” he says, “I think this is an extinction event in many ways.”\n\nThe holiday season is traditionally when food bloggers earn most of their ad revenue. For many, this year has been slower than usual. One blogger, Carrie Forrest of Clean Eating Kitchen, told Bloomberg that in the past two years, she has lost 80% of her traffic.\n\nOthers, like Delmage and Karen Tedesco, the author of the blog Familystyle Food, say their numbers, and ad revenue, have remained steady – so far. They attribute this to focusing their energies less on trying to game the search engines than on the long-term goal of attracting regular followers – and, in Delmage’s case, viewers.\n\nTedesco’s strategy has been to create recipes that rely on her experience and technical knowhow honed by years in restaurant kitchens and as a personal chef. Her Italian meatball recipe, for example, based on her mother’s, includes advice about which meat to use, an explanation of why milk-soaked breadcrumbs are essential for texture, and a dozen process photos and a video.\n\nBut she is still worried about the potential impact of AI. When she recently did a Google search for “Italian meatballs”, Familystyle Food appeared as the top result. Then she switched to AI Mode. There, she found the recipe had been Frankensteined – or “synthesized” as Gemini put it – into a new recipe with nine other sources (including Sip and Feast and a Washington Post recipe for Greek meatballs). The AI-generated recipe was little more than a list of ingredients and six basic steps with none of the details that make Tedesco’s recipe unique.\n\nAI Mode linked to all 10 recipes, including Tedesco’s, but, she says, “I don’t think many people are actually clicking on the source links. At this point, they’re absolutely trusting in the results that are getting thrown in their faces.”\n\nOther bloggers have seen a more definite impact on their viewership. Adam Gallagher, who runs Inspired Taste with his wife, Joanne, and who has become an outspoken critic of AI on social media, told the podcast Marketing O’Clock that since spring, he has noticed that while the number of times viewers saw links to the site on Google has increased, the number of actual site visitors has decreased. This indicates, to him, that users are satisfied with the search engine’s AI interpretation of Inspired Taste’s recipes.\n\nAfter the Gallaghers posted about the discrepancy on X and Instagram, a number of readers replied to say they had not realized there was a difference between the recipes on the blog and the version that showed up in Google searches. They had just appreciated the convenience of not having to click on another website, especially when Google’s page design was so clean and uncluttered.\n\nRodbard acknowledges that many food blogs have gotten ugly and overloaded with ads, which has exacerbated the problem. “Ad tech on these recipe blogs has gotten so bad, so many pop-up windows and so much crashing, we kind of lost as publishers,” he says.\n\nAccording to Tom Critchlow, the EVP of audience growth at Raptive, a media company that works with many food bloggers to find advertisers, it isn’t ads that are driving viewers away. It’s Google itself, with its changes to the algorithm and now with AI Mode, that’s making the sites harder to find.\n\nThere is some hope though: a survey of 3,000 US adults commissioned by Raptive showed that the more interaction people had with AI, the less they wanted to engage with it, and nearly half the respondents rated AI content less trustworthy than content made by a human.\n\nBut unless the public rebels against AI Mode, there is only so much bloggers can do. They can block OpenAI’s training crawler, which gathers information that ChatGPT uses to create content, including its own recipe generator, but theyare not necessarily willing to make themselves invisible to web searches; as Delmage puts it: “You can’t bite the hand that feeds you.”\n\nThere is also the option of moving over to a subscription model, such as Substack or Patreon, and keeping the recipes behind a paywall, but both Tedesco and Delmage point out that the most successful Substackers, like Caroline Chambers or David Lebovitz, came to the platform with much more substantial followings than they have. “If I were to give up my website or even try to go over to Substack, I would be broke,” Tedesco says.\n\nRodbard suggests that the analog version of the recipe blog, the cookbook, might be due for a comeback. Cookbooks, after all, offer the same experience of spending time and learning from a trusted source, and it’s likely the recipes have been tested. As a bonus, unlike phones or laptops, they don’t go dark when you neglect them for too long and you can splash tomato sauce on them without inflicting permanent damage. According to the market research firm Circana (formerly BookScan), sales of baking cookbooks are up 80% this year, but other areas have been relatively flat.\n\nBut AI bots are stealing from published cookbooks, too. When Meta was training its own AI, it compiled thousands of books into a dataset called Library Genesis (LibGen). Now unscrupulous publishers have raided LibGen and repackaged some of the books into dupes, which they are selling on Amazon.\n\nAs more people become aware of the amount of AI slop on the internet and how to identify it, Critchlow believes they will develop a greater appreciation for content produced by humans. “People will ultimately place a higher premium on being able to know that these recipes have been tested and made by somebody that I follow or somebody I respect or somebody that I like,” he says.\n\nThe recipe creators themselves are not so sure. “I’m putting my faith in that there’s always going to be a segment of people who really want to learn something,” Tedesco says. But as for the business of blogging itself, “it’s like a rolling tide. It’s always up and down and you have to roll with it and adapt.”",

    "description": "There are reasons to believe it will be more trustworthy than ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Generative AI has advanced to the stage where you can ask bots such as ChatGPT or Gemini questions about almost anything, and get reasonable-sounding responses—and now renowned gadget repair site iFixit has joined the party with an AI assistant of its own, ready and willing to solve any of your hardware problems.\n\nWhile you can already ask general-purpose chatbots for advice on how to repair a phone screen or diagnose a problem with a car engine, there's always the question of how accurate the AI replies will be. With FixBot, iFixit is trying to minimize mistakes by drawing on its vast library of verified repair guides, written by experts and users.\n\nThat's certainly reassuring: I don't want to waste time and money replacing a broken phone screen with a new display that's the wrong size or shape. And using a conversational AI bot to fix gadget problems is often going to feel like a more natural and intuitive experience than a Google search. As iFixit puts it, the bot \"does what a good expert does\" in guiding you to the right solutions.\n\nThe iFixit website has been around since 2003—practically ancient times, considering the rapid evolution of modern technology. The iFixit team has always prided itself on detailed, thorough, tested guides to repairing devices, and all of that information can now be tapped into by the FixBot tool.\n\niFixit says the bot is trained on more than 125,000 repair guides written by humans who have worked through the steps involved, as well as the question and answer forums attached to the site, and the \"huge cache\" of PDF manuals that iFixit has accumulated over the years that it's been business.\n\nThat gives me a lot more confidence that FixBot will get its answers right, compared to whatever ChatGPT or Gemini might tell me. iFixit hasn't said what AI models are powering the bot—only that they've been \"hand-picked\"—and there's also a custom-built search engine included to select data sources from the repair archives on the site.\n\n\"Every answer starts with a search for guides, parts, and repairs that worked,\" according to the iFixit team, and that conversational approach you'll recognize from other AI bots is here too: If you need clarification on something, then you can ask a follow-up question. In the same way, if the AI bot needs more information or specifics, it will ask you.\n\nIt's designed to be fast—responses should be returned in seconds—and the iFixit team also talks about an \"evaluation harness\" that tests the FixBot responses against thousands of real repair questions posed and answered by humans. That extra level of fact-checking should reduce the number of false answers you get.\n\nHowever, it's not perfect, as iFixit admits: \"FixBot is an AI, and AI sometimes gets things wrong.\" Whether or not those mistakes will be easy to spot remains to be seen, but users of the chatbot are being encouraged to upload their own documents and repair solutions to fix gaps in the knowledge that FixBot is drawing on.\n\niFixit says the FixBot is going to be free for everyone to use, for a limited time. At some point, there will be a free version with limitations, and paid tiers with the full set of features—including support for voice input and document uploads. You can give it a try for yourself now on the iFixit website.\n\nI was reluctant to deliberately break one of my devices just so FixBot could help me repair it, but I did test it with a few issues I've had (and sorted out) in the past. One was a completely dead SSD drive stopping my Windows PC from booting: I started off with a vague description about the computer not starting up properly, and the bot did a good job at narrowing down what the problem was, and suggesting fixes.\n\nIt went through everything I had already tried when the problem happened, including trying System Repair and troubleshooting the issue via the Command Prompt. Eventually, via a few links to repair guides on the iFixit website, it did conclude that my SSD drive had been corrupted by a power cut—which I knew was what had indeed happened.\n\nI also tested the bot with a more general question about a phone restarting at random times—something one of my old handsets used to do. Again, the responses were accurate, and the troubleshooting steps I was asked to try made a lot of sense. I was also directed to the iFixit guide for the phone model.\n\nThe bot is as enthusiastic as a lot of the others available now (I was regularly praised for the \"excellent information\" I was providing), and does appear to know what it's talking about. This is one of the scenarios where generative AI shows its worth, in distilling a large amount of information based on natural language prompts.\n\nThere's definitely potential here: Compare this approach to having to sift through dozens of forum posts, web articles, and documents manually. However, there's always that nagging sense that AI makes mistakes, as the on-screen FixBot disclaimer says. I'd recommend checking other sources before doing anything drastic with your hardware troubleshooting.",

    "description": "Be careful with ChatGPT or Grok's tech advice.",
    "fullText": "You (hopefully) know by now that you can't take everything AI tells you at face value. Large language models (LLMs) sometimes provide incorrect information, and threat actors are now using paid search ads on Google to spread conversations with ChatGPT and Grok that appear to provide tech support instructions but actually direct macOS users to install an infostealing malware on their devices.\n\nThe campaign is a variation on the ClickFix attack, which often uses CAPTCHA prompts or fake error messages to trick targets into executing malicious commands. But in this case, the instructions are disguised as helpful troubleshooting guides on legitimate AI platforms.\n\nKaspersky details a campaign specific to installing Atlas for macOS. If a user searches \"chatgpt atlas\" to find a guide, the first sponsored result is a link to chatgpt.com with the page title \"ChatGPT™ Atlas for macOS – Download ChatGPT Atlas for Mac.\" If you click through, you'll land on the official ChatGPT site and find a series of instructions for (supposedly) installing Atlas.\n\nHowever, the page is a copy of a conversation between an anonymous user and the AI—which can be shared publicly—that is actually a malware installation guide. The chat directs you to copy, paste, and execute a command in your Mac's Terminal and grant all permissions, which hands over access to the AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer) infostealer.\n\nA further investigation from Huntress showed similarly poisoned results via both ChatGPT and Grok using more general troubleshooting queries like \"how to delete system data on Mac\" and \"clear disk space on macOS.\"\n\nAMOS targets macOS, gaining root-level privileges and allowing attackers to execute commands, log keystrokes, and deliver additional payloads. BleepingComputer notes that the infostealer also targets cryptocurrency wallets, browser data (including cookies, saved passwords, and autofill data), macOS Keychain data, and files on the filesystem.\n\nIf you're troubleshooting a tech issue, carefully vet any instructions you find online. Threat actors often use sponsored search results as well as social media platforms to spread instructions that are actually ClickFix attacks. Never follow any guidance that you don't understand, and know that if it asks you to execute commands on your device using PowerShell or Terminal to \"fix\" a problem, there's a high likelihood that it's malicious—even if it comes from a search engine or LLM you've used and trusted in the past.\n\nOf course, you can potentially turn the attack around by asking ChatGPT (in a new conversation) if the instructions are safe to follow. According to Kaspersky, the AI will tell you that they aren't.",
