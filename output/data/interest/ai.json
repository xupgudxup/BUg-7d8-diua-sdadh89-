    "title": "Americans Have Mixed Views of AI – and an Appetite for Regulation",
    "description": "A supermajority of Americans say that AI should be regulated to protect privacy and ensure safety.",
    "fullText": "AI is sweeping the American economy. A majority of Americans are either using AI tools or have tried them. But AI use is only half the story – a supermajority of Americans say that AI should be regulated to protect privacy and ensure safety. And many remain worried about potential job losses stemming from the emerging technology. \n\nIt’s time we did more to understand the national attitudes around AI use, regulation, and favorability.\n\nMost of our respondents had used AI at least once: 58% report using or trying AI, specifically tools like ChatGPT or Claude, divided evenly between fairly regular users (30% use at least a few times a month) and more infrequent users (29% have used AI, but only once a month or less). Nonusers are more likely to be older (62% of people over 65 have never used AI), not have gone to college (47%), or to work in service jobs (35%). Only 18% of white-collar workers say they have never used AI.\n\nAmong those who do use AI, 63% have at least tried it out for work purposes, and 34% report using it at work consistently (a few times a month or more). Work usage, like AI usage overall, is more common among white-collar workers, a majority of whom (55%) use it consistently. Personal use of AI is more common: 91% have at least tried using an AI chatbot or writing tool, and 54% report consistently using it in their personal lives. Gen Z turns to AI more often than its older counterparts, with 68% regularly engaging AI for personal use (compared to just 40% among Boomers).\n\nPersonal AI use encompasses a bunch of different types of application, but by far the most common is information gathering and answering questions (63%). Frequent AI users are especially likely to use AI as an alternative to traditional Google search or other research tools (68%). If this use case continues, messaging and communication on anything from public health to election campaigns will be filtered through AI models before reaching people. This could potentially change how messages are interpreted (particularly given the use of AI summaries), or significantly alter their reach in difficult-to-measure ways. Those interested in talking effectively to Americans should consider how their messaging strategy would work with these AI intermediaries, how their messages will be interpreted by AI, and if what they say will still reach their intended audience.\n\nWhile they know the names of the tools (ChatGPT, etc.), respondents don’t know much about the companies responsible for AI products. This is in contrast with older tech companies: Only 5% haven’t heard of Google, and 79% are favorable toward the company. For Amazon, favorability is at 80%. When asked about OpenAI, 42% hadn’t heard enough to form an opinion. For Anthropic, this figure hit 81%.\n\nAmericans don’t view AI as favorably as other emerging technologies from the past quarter century. Cell phones (76% total positive; net +68), the internet (75% total positive; net +66), and solar energy (72% total positive; net +65) are all viewed as having a very positive impact on society. AI (38% total positive; net +8) is \n\nWhen Americans are asked to think about potential future impacts on society, opinions of AI remain mixed, at a nearly even split of respondents between positive, negative, and uncertain impacts. Respondents believe that things like solar energy (70%), personalized medicine (57%), and nuclear energy (43%) will have positive future impacts, but are more skeptical of cryptocurrency (24% positive, 40% say it will have a negative impact) and self-driving cars (23% positive, 50% negative).\n\nWe also wanted to get a sense of how important Americans believe certain technologies to be. To provide some sense of perspective, we asked them to compare these new technologies to some they’re more familiar with. “Extremely important” corresponded to the steam engine and electricity, “moderately important” corresponded to the smartphone, and “not very” corresponded to the digital camera.\n\nWith these comparisons in mind, the median respondent puts AI on par with the invention of the smartphone. Only 7% believe that it’s more important than any other technology, with 16% of frequent AI users believing this, compared to just 5% of infrequent/nonusers.\n\nDespite uncertainty about AI’s overall importance, 70% of Americans say this technology will dramatically transform work, though they’re much less certain about the exact nature of this transformation. A plurality believes that it will make work easier (49%), but a majority believes that AI will bring down wages (55%), including pluralities or majorities across education, race, and partisanship. More respondents think it will hurt the economy (37%) than think it will decrease growth (29%), probably reflecting concern about wages. The perception that AI will replace human workers or outcompete them for jobs is a common one: 51% think AI will replace work done by humans, versus 33% who believe AI will supplement the work humans do. Service workers are especially convinced AI will replace (59%) rather than supplement (30%).\n\nA majority of Americans (56%) think that within 10 years, AI will be capable of performing most tasks that most people do at work. However, this drops significantly when respondents are asked about when AI will be able to do most tasks in their own job or field, with 43% thinking this will happen within 10 years, with no notable differences by educational attainment or work type. Customer service representatives are generally agreed to be replaceable within 10 years (64%), followed by accountants (56%) and manufacturing workers (54%). Fewer than 1 in 3 Americans think electricians, truck drivers, or doctors could be replaced by AI in the next 10 years.\n\nAround two-thirds of Americans (67%) are more concerned about the government doing too little to regulate the dangers of AI, versus doing too much and stifling progress (12%). At the same time, they don’t support a full ban on AI advancement, preferring progress to continue with requirements for safety testing (62%). Americans’ preference for safety regulations over the fastest possible progress holds even when they’re presented with the idea that regulating AI would put the U.S. behind China: Only 15% prefer a world where the U.S. government doesn’t regulate AI at all to compete with other countries like China over one where AI research continues under regulation, even if it develops slower than other countries (67%).\n\nEven in the most extreme case — presenting the choice between no further progress in AI at all and totally unregulated AI — only 34% would support unregulated AI development, versus 30% who think the government should ban research to improve AI, with a 36% plurality saying they’re unsure.\n\nIn terms of perceived dangers from AI, Americans’ biggest concern is AI taking jobs and causing unemployment (42%), followed by concerns about privacy (35%) and misinformation (33%). These are also the top three areas Americans prioritize for regulation. Respondents are not especially concerned about AI wiping out humanity (12%), but express greater concern about the use of AI resulting in loss of human control (32%).\n\nWhile respondents see AI as better than humans at being “efficient” by a wide margin (+44 points), AI has virtually no advantage on “being convenient to those they’re trying to help” (+2). Humans are still seen as wildly better in terms of being moral (+53), making complex decisions (+30), protecting privacy (+28), and being transparent (+18).\n\nWe also asked about the potential for replacing humans in specific governmental tasks, since this has been talked up by some AI proponents. There are only two specific tasks (from our list tested in this survey, at least) where AI is seen as better than human government employees. One is identifying trends in data (+18) and the other is correctly verifying the information in forms (+8).\n\nOn anything less concrete and data-focused, respondents strongly prefer humans. Human government employees are preferred over AI by 77 points for judging criminal trials, by 59 points for conducting airport screenings, and by 55 points for answering questions about government services like Social Security. Public interest in AI replacement of humans in government and other tasks is minimal.\n\nThis survey was run by Tavern Research via an online sample of 2,301 American adults fielded over web panels from August 1, 2025 to August 6, 2025. The margin of error is +/- 3%.\n\nNOTE: Because this is a web-based survey, we expect the total usage of AI to be slightly higher than the numbers found in non-web-based surveys. This should not affect the other conclusions.\n\nA question that was interesting, but didn’t lead to a larger conclusion, was asking what actually happens when you ask a tool like ChatGPT a question. 45% think it looks up an exact answer in a database, and 21% think it follows a script of prewritten responses.",

    "description": "AI transformation, workforce strategy, and new job roles are reshaping how companies like ServiceNow and Weber Shandwick operate today.",
    "fullText": "This article is part of the \"How AI is Changing Talent\" series, which explores how AI is reshaping hiring, development, and retention.\n\nTwelve months ago, Jacqui Canney was ServiceNow's chief people officer, focused on talent strategy. Today, she's also the company's chief AI enablement officer — a title that didn't exist until recently.\n\nThe two roles aren't separate, Canney told Business Insider. \"They're one strategy, and the companies that understand that are going to be the winners.\"\n\nThat shift, though, requires letting go of how most organizations have always structured work: by function, head count, and department. \"Companies can't treat this as 'We're going to run an AI program over here, and it'll add capacity,'\" she says.\n\nInstead, they need to ask: how does AI change the work across departments? \"AI doesn't follow the same silos people do. That's why you build the workforce around the new workflow.\"\n\nCanney's approach isn't an outlier. Rather, it's a signal of how quickly AI has become part of work and our daily lives.\n\nThree years after the launch of ChatGPT, adoption has reached 54.6%. That's staggering compared to adoption rates for personal computers (19.7%) and the internet (30.1%) three years after they were widely introduced, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nMeanwhile, about 21% of US workers say that at least some of their job is now done with AI, an increase from 16% roughly a year ago, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nAI is transforming everything about work, from the jobs people do to how they do them. Organizations, meanwhile, are racing to prepare their people for what comes next. While the long-term impact remains uncertain, early patterns are emerging about what's working and what isn't.\n\nAI's effect on the labor market is showing up everywhere: in how companies screen candidates, which skills command premium salaries, and how performance gets evaluated. Two structural shifts, in particular, stand out: new jobs are emerging, and old jobs are evolving.\n\nAn authoritative count of new AI-specific job titles is hard to come by, but data show rapid growth. A report from software company Autodesk found that demand for roles like AI engineer jumped 143.2% in 2024, while prompt engineer rose 135.8%, and AI content creator increased 134.5%. Meanwhile, the number of jobs requiring AI skills rose 7.5% last year, even as total job postings fell 11.3%, according to research from consultancy PwC.\n\nMolly Roenna, global chief people officer at PR firm Weber Shandwick, sees this firsthand. Her company is increasingly seeking specialists in areas like AI integration and AI ethics, and it's recruiting from disciplines like behavioral science and data analytics.\n\n\"We're hiring for a fundamentally different environment,\" Roenna says. \"Meeting client expectations requires people who use technology as a force multiplier for insight and creativity, not just a shortcut for efficiency.\"\n\nThe hiring process itself has evolved, too. Many of Weber Shandwick's interviews now include a \"technology conversation,\" a practice that appears to be gaining traction. This isn't to test technical skills, but to gauge how candidates use AI.\n\n\"What have they built with AI? What excites or worries them about it? We want perspective that comes from actual practice.\"\n\nThe dynamic playing out at Weber Shandwick and elsewhere isn't new. After all, every major technological advancement has created roles that were previously unimaginable, made others obsolete, and forced still others to adapt. What's different about this AI-driven era, however, is both the speed of change (see above) and the breadth, affecting workers across industries and skill levels.\n\n\"We didn't have programmers before computers,\" says Esteve Almirall Mezquita, professor of data, analytics, technology and AI at Esade in Madrid.\n\nCreating new roles and demand for expertise is half the equation. The bigger challenge is helping existing workers figure out how to use AI.\n\nSome companies aren't leaving that to chance. They're requiring it, notes Dan Schawbel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, a research firm. \"CEOs are under enormous pressure to have their AI story intact,\" he says. \"We have to have our workers using AI. It's good for productivity, yes, but also our story and bottom line.\"\n\nCompanies such as Microsoft, Coinbase, and Shopify now mandate AI use, according to previous reporting by Business Insider. Meta plans to measure employees' performance by their \"AI-driven impact.\"\n\nSchawbel predicts more scrutiny in the year ahead. Employees will need to function like data scientists, continuously proving their value, he says. \"Whether you're in marketing, IT, or HR, every action can be measured and tracked — and maybe even tied directly to your compensation.\"\n\nMeasuring AI use and seeing value from it are two different things, however. Even as organizations pour billions into the technology, results have been uneven.\n\nResearch by consulting firm BCG of more than 1,250 firms worldwide reports that 60% of companies are investing heavily in AI but seeing minimal returns. Meanwhile, only 5% have taken the step to restructure their operations around AI — and those companies are seeing significant revenue gains over everyone else.\n\nThe difference, the BCG research suggests, comes down to several factors. Successful companies have buy-in from the top and have redesigned how work gets done. Most importantly, says Alicia Pittman, BCG's global people chair, they've invested in teaching employees to use AI effectively.\n\nPittman notes that industries like financial services, insurance, and healthcare are pulling ahead in AI adoption. \"We're seeing companies put real time and energy into this in a way that hasn't been present before, and that's good for everybody and good for the global workforce.\"\n\nGranted, there's job displacement that comes with that and some skill sets will go away, she says. \"But helping people adapt to AI is a major investment in them as professionals.\"\n\nAt Moody's, the credit ratings firm, that investment involves encouraging employees to teach AI as much as possible.\n\nAri Lehavi, who runs applied AI there, says this approach frees employees to focus on complex work that requires human expertise.\n\nTake sales, for example. Customer relationship management (CRM) systems can capture basics like company size, contract history, and revenue potential. However, they miss what closes deals: company politics, individual motivations, and who really influences decisions. Lehavi's team teaches AI systems to learn those details so salespeople can concentrate on managing relationships.\n\n\"They can spend their time on things they're already doing but don't have enough time for,\" he says. \"The hard cases, the edge cases, the complex situations, mentoring other people, management, and skill development.\"\n\nIn other words: the human stuff.\n\nOf course, the path forward isn't simple or straightforward. Not every company has the resources to retrain its workforce, and some jobs will indeed disappear. Many companies are struggling to make AI work.\n\nYet, Canney of ServiceNow remains positive. \"It's a human renaissance,\" she says. \"You're going to have capacity in your workforce and the chance to guide it toward new revenue streams or creative ways of working. It's an enormous opportunity, and I'm definitely an optimist about it.\"",

    "title": "Google 2025 recap: Research breakthroughs of the year",
    "description": "This year saw new AI models, transformative products and new breakthroughs in science and robotics.",
    "fullText": "This was a year of AI agents, reasoning and scientific discovery.\n\n2025 has been a year of extraordinary progress in research. With artificial intelligence, we can see its trajectory shifting from a tool to a utility: from something people use to something they can put to work. If 2024 was about laying the multimodal foundations for this era, 2025 was the year AI began to really think, act and explore the world alongside us. With quantum computing, we made progress towards real-world applications. And across the board, we helped turn research into reality, with more capable and useful products and tools making a positive impact on people's lives today.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the breakthroughs, products and scientific milestones that defined the work of Google, Google DeepMind and Google Research in a year of relentless progress.\n\nThis year, we significantly advanced our model capabilities with breakthroughs on reasoning, multimodal understanding, model efficiency, and generative capabilities, beginning with the release of Gemini 2.5 in March and culminating in the November launch of Gemini 3 and the December launch of Gemini 3 Flash.\n\nBuilt on a foundation of state-of-the-art reasoning, Gemini 3 Pro is our most powerful model to date, designed to help you bring any idea to life. It topped the LMArena Leaderboard and redefined multimodal reasoning with breakthrough scores on benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam — a fiendishly hard test for AI models to see if AI can truly think and reason like humans — and GPQA Diamond. It also set a new standard for frontier models in mathematics, achieving a new state-of-the-art of 23.4% on MathArena Apex. We followed shortly with Gemini 3 Flash, which combines Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost, making it the most performant model for its size. Gemini 3 Flash's quality surpasses our previous Gemini 2.5 Pro-scale model's capabilities at a fraction of the price and substantially better latency, continuing our Gemini-era trend of 'the next generation's Flash model is better than the previous generation's Pro model'.\n\nLearn more about our progress on our world-class AI models this year:\n\nGemini 3 Flash price & benchmark table.\n\nWe’re committed to making useful AI technology accessible, with state-of-the-art open models. We built our Gemma family of models to be lightweight and open for public use; this year we were able to introduce multimodal capabilities, significantly increase the context window, expand multilingual capabilities, and improve efficiency and performance.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances in Gemma models:\n\nThroughout 2025, we continued to advance the trajectory of AI from tool to utility, transforming our portfolio of products with new, powerful agentic capabilities. We reimagined software development by moving beyond tools that assist coding to introducing powerful, agentic systems that collaborate with developers. Key advances, such as the impressive coding capabilities in Gemini 3 and the launch of Google Antigravity, mark a new era in AI-assisted software development.\n\nLearn more about this year’s advances building developer tools:\n\nThis evolution was also clear across our core products, from AI-enabled features on the Pixel 10 and updates to AI Mode in Search, to AI-first innovations like the Gemini app and NotebookLM, which gained advanced features like Deep Research.\n\nLearn more about how we’ve transformed our products with AI:\n\n2025 was a transformative year for generative media, giving people new and unprecedented capabilities to realize their creative ambitions. Generative media models and tools for video, images, audio and worlds became more effective and broadly used, with breakouts Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro offering unprecedented capabilities for native image generation and editing. We worked with people in creative industries to develop tools like Flow and Music AI Sandbox, making them more helpful for creative workflows, and we expanded creative possibilities for people with new, AI-powered experiences in the Google Arts & Culture lab, major upgrades to image editing within the Gemini app, and the introduction of powerful new generative media models like Veo 3.1, Imagen 4 and Flow.\n\nLearn more about how we’re building AI to enhance creativity:\n\nAs research breakthroughs continue to expand AI’s capabilities, Google Labs is where we share AI experiments as we develop them – hearing from users and evolving as we learn. Some of this year’s most engaging experiments from Labs: Pomelli, an AI experiment for on-brand marketing content; Stitch, which introduced a way to turn prompt and image inputs into complex UI designs and frontend code in minutes; Jules, an asynchronous coding agent that acts as a collaborative partner for developers; and Google Beam, a 3D video communications platform that used AI to advance the possibilities of remote presence.\n\nLearn more about how we’re experimenting in Labs:\n\n2025 was also a banner year for scientific advances with AI, marked by breakthroughs in life sciences, health, natural sciences, and mathematics.\n\nIn the space of a year, we made progress in building AI resources and tools that empower researchers and help them understand, identify, and develop treatments in healthcare. In genomics, where we’ve been applying advanced technology to research for 10 years, we moved beyond sequencing, using AI to interpret the most complex data. We also marked the 5-year anniversary of AlphaFold, the Nobel-winning AI system that solved the 50-year-old protein folding problem. AlphaFold has been used by over 3 million researchers in more than 190 countries, including over 1 million users in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to advance life sciences and health:\n\nGemini’s advanced thinking capabilities, including Deep Think, also enabled historic progress in mathematics and coding. Deep Think was able to solve problems that require deep abstract reasoning – achieving gold medal-standard in two international contests.\n\nLearn more about how we’re advancing natural sciences and mathematics:\n\nWe’re also leading major discoveries and shaping the future of science in areas like quantum computing, energy and moonshots. Research in this area drew new levels of public attention, with progress towards real-world applications of quantum computing as demonstrated by Quantum Echoes and, notably, Googler Michel Devoret becoming a 2025 Physics Nobel Laureate along with former Googler John Martinis and UC Berkeley’s John Clarke, for their foundational 1980s quantum research.\n\nLearn more about our work on space infrastructure and quantum computing:\n\nIn 2025, we continued to advance the core infrastructure that powers our AI, focusing on breakthroughs in hardware design and improving energy efficiency. This included the introduction of Ironwood, a new TPU built for the age of inference, which was designed using a method called AlphaChip, alongside a commitment to measuring the environmental impact of our technology.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to develop chips, infrastructure and improve energy efficiency:\n\nOur work in robotics and visual understanding brought AI agents into both the physical and virtual worlds, with advancements like the foundational Gemini Robotics models, the more sophisticated Gemini Robotics 1.5, and the introduction of Genie 3 as a new frontier for general-purpose world models.\n\nLearn more about our work with world models and robotics:\n\nOur work throughout 2025 demonstrates how AI-enabled scientific progress is being directly applied to address the world's most critical and pervasive challenges. By leveraging state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning, we are significantly increasing our understanding of the planet and its systems, while also delivering impactful solutions in areas vital to human flourishing, including climate resilience, public health and education.\n\nFor example, we are using state-of-the-art foundational models and agentic reasoning to help increase our understanding of the planet, helping enable work that is making a difference in people’s lives now from weather predictions to urban planning to public health. For example, our flood forecasting information now covers more than two billion people in 150 countries for severe riverine floods. And our most advanced and efficient forecasting model, WeatherNext 2 can generate forecasts 8x faster and with resolution up to 1-hour. Using this technology, we’ve supported weather agencies in making decisions based on a range of scenarios through our experimental cyclone predictions.\n\nLearn more about our work in weather, mapping and wildfires:\n\nWe are working with partners to apply AI-enabled scientific progress closer to patients, opening up new avenues for disease management and therapeutic discovery.\n\nLearn more about our health-related work:\n\nAI is proving to be a powerful tool in education, enabling new forms of understanding and expanding curiosity through initiatives like LearnLM and Guided Learning in Gemini. We brought Gemini’s most powerful translation capabilities to Google Translate, enabling much smarter, more natural and accurate translations and piloting new speech to speech translation capabilities.\n\nLearn more about how we’re using AI to enable learning:\n\nWe couple our research breakthroughs with rigorous and forward-looking work on responsibility and safety. As our models grow more capable, we’re continuing to advance and evolve our tools, resources and safety frameworks to anticipate and mitigate risk. Gemini 3 demonstrated this approach in action: it's our most secure model yet, and has undergone the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any Google AI model to date. And we’re looking further ahead, exploring a responsible path to AGI, prioritizing readiness, proactive risk assessment, and collaboration with the wider AI community.\n\nLearn more about our responsibility and safety work:\n\nAdvancing the frontier of AI responsibly demands collaboration across all parts of society. In 2025, we worked with leading AI labs to help to form the Agentic AI Foundation and support open standards to ensure a responsible and interoperable future for agentic AI. In education, we’ve partnered with school districts like Miami Dade County and education groups like Raspberry Pi to equip students with AI skills. Our research partnerships with universities like UC Berkeley, Yale, the University of Chicago and many more have been instrumental to some of this year’s most exciting frontier research, and we’re working with the US Department of Energy’s 17 national laboratories to transform how scientific research is conducted. And we’re working with filmmakers and other creative visionaries to put the best AI tools in their hands and explore storytelling in the age of AI.\n\nLearn more about our work on frontier collaboration:\n\nAs we look towards 2026, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance the frontier, safely and responsibly, for the benefit of humanity.",

    "fullText": "on December 23, 2025 at 12:45PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nThe use of Generative AI (or GenAI for short) is on the rise, with many examples in some of the biggest games of the year using art, voice recordings, and narratives, just to name a few, now coming to light. For many players, a studio’s use of AI as a shortcut, instead of commissioning an artist, hiring a voice actor, or paying a writer to create assets for the final product, is something they actively don’t want to buy.\n\nSo this curated list that’s human-approved with only a spellchecker to assist in its creation will highlight the best games in 2025 where AI is, as far as we know, not involved in the development process. They all come from a whole bunch of developers, big and small, spanning a wide range of genres. The one thing they have in common is that a dedicated team of people worked on it without any assistance from GenAI tools.\n\nIt’s important to clarify that any procedural generation of maps, or randomized abilities or enemies, uses AI to determine what appears, and is not the same as GenAI. We’re specifically excluding games that use AI to generate any assets, whether it’s disclosed at the point of sale or found out after publishing. If it’s ethically problematic for any of these reasons, a game won’t be included on the list, no matter how much of a Game of the Year contender it is. With that, here are the best games without AI involvement in their development.\n\nHades 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Supergiant Games’ Game of the Year, which puts you in the shoes of the immortal Princess Melinoë as she attempts to save her father Hades and his kingdom from the time-looping clutches of the Titan Cronos. It largely follows a similar Roguelike structure, where each run has you collect powers from the Ancient Greek Pantheon to augment your chosen weapon and crush the foes in your way.\n\nOf course, with every sequel, you need to outdo what came before. Naturally, this means having two separate paths from the beginning, each with its own layout. One leads to the depths of Hades to Cronos, while the other has Melinoë ascend to the peak of Mt Olympus to defeat the invading monsters. Fans of the first will likely already have this one, but you don’t need to have mastered the original to enjoy everything that Hades 2 has to offer.\n\nReleased episodically, Dispatch is a wonderful throwback from the team behind The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. Throughout its first season, you are a former superhero, Mechaman, who becomes a dispatcher for a new generation of heroes. However, he ends up managing a team of miscreants who are easily sidetracked by a little bit of arson or petty theft. It’s up to you to keep everything on track, even when things go south.\n\nWhether it’s allocating the right person for a particular job or making sure another hero doesn’t get sidetracked, each chapter has significant decisions that drastically change the outcome of a mission. By reading each hero's bio and upgrading their skills, you’ll increase your chances of success. You’ll also occasionally need to hack into systems remotely to assist your heroes when they’re in peril.\n\nDispatch’s stunning cast, which includes professional voice actors and some YouTubers branching out and doing a decent job in bringing these larger-than-life characters to life. By the time you reach the end, only one question will likely be on your mind: when’s season 2?\n\nFor fans of retro beat-'em-ups such as Streets of Rage or Final Fight, it’s been quite a while since a brand-new series broke ground. Absolum carefully blends in Roguelike game mechanics to make what Steve Watts, in his review, described as “a match made in heaven”. You play as one of a band of rebel wizards led by Root Mother Uchawi, a benevolent god-like being, who attempts to take on the tyrant Sun King Azra and his Crimson Order army, who have taken over the world of Talamh.\n\nWith multiple characters to play with their own fighting style, a phenomenal soundtrack, stunning visuals, and a Hades-like elemental progression system for every run, it’s easy to see how this is a winning formula. On top of that, there are plenty of branching paths and hidden secrets to find along the way. Quests ask you to venture to specific points, but don’t always require that you reach them in the same run.\n\nSome may feel that the Roguelike structure holds it back because it doesn’t lean into it enough, but it instead asks for the player to master its mechanics by giving them familiar challenges, and as such, may be somewhat fairer to their time. If you’re not convinced, there’s a free Absolum demo you can check out that gives you a small slice of just how wonderfully everything comes together, and like the full-price experience, you can bring a friend with you in your quest to save the realm.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nSolving the mystery behind a weird house with constantly shifting layouts that you inherited was not exactly on our bingo card for 2025, but Blue Prince is one of the best puzzle games we’ve played in years. Each day, you have a set number of steps to explore a house with randomized rooms. These rooms can give or take away steps, grant you items, or even house escape room-like puzzles that reward you with more trinkets.\n\nOn top of this, Blue Prince has a rather intricate mystery throughout. Clues hidden in certain rooms will allude to the house itself, including what’s in room 46, the former owner Herbert S. Sinclair, and a children's author called Marion Marigold. It might take you only a few attempts, or it may take you many. If you find you’re struggling to make a dent, you should check out our Blue Prince guides hub for some tips. Persevere, and you’ll find out why it’s worth continuing until you find that fated room.\n\nNintendo’s big ape smashes his way onto the Switch 2 with Donkey Kong Bananza, from the creators of Super Mario Odyssey. Our gorilla hero travels to Ingot Isle to mine Banadium Gems, only to have his hoard stolen by a sinister simian syndicate known as VoidCo. Buried deep underground, DK soon finds an odd sentient rock that later turns out to be a younger version of Pauline. The two team up to excavate through each layer of this underground world to stop VoidCo.’s president from reaching the planet’s core.\n\nThe big selling point of Donkey Kong Bananza is that DK can dig his way through levels with his bare hands, uncovering secrets while using rocks and soil to bash his way to the end. Pauline’s singing also helps unlock transformations that enable DK to fly or charge at high speed, amongst others. Much like 3D Mario games and their equivalent macguffins, you’ll also gather crystal bananas for completing objectives. However, these bananas also tie in with the upgrade system that unlocks more powers for the duo.\n\nWhat sets it apart is that, despite being vastly different from every other Donkey Kong game, it manages to pay homage to the series. Cameos from DK’s animal friends, musical homages, and so much more. It’s one of the few essential games to own for the Nintendo Switch 2 in its first year on the market. In case you’re wondering, you can safely skip the DLC: DK Island and Emerald Rush unless it’s put on sale, or you really enjoy Roguelike modes.\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is a remaster made with love, care, and passion. Since the source code was lost, as was sadly the norm back in the 1990s, the effort made to bring the entire campaign to currently available platforms is staggering. It does have the newer translation, added voice acting, and support for higher resolutions than its PlayStation, PSP, or mobile iterations, and all of that is created or performed by talented people. And yet, despite the modern additions, it’s still the same punishing, yet charming, and above all, epic classic RPG from Square Enix’s golden age.\n\nIt would have been so easy just to churn out a ‘modern reskin’ of the classic permadeath game, or mangle its existing assets with generative AI upscaling tools. However, the team behind Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles evidently cared, wanting to retell the War of the Lions saga that captivated many with its twists and turns. Rebalancing encounters and adding the ability to skip non-story fights help ease newer players in, allowing them to experience some of what makes this tactical RPG so special.\n\nPeak is high up there when it comes to games with humble origins. It started as a Game Jam experiment that people loved so much that it inspired the developers, whose previous effort was the crustacean Soulslike game, Another Crab’s Treasure, to expand it into a full multiplayer experience. It’s one of the best Steam co-op games of the year, and that’s largely thanks to its tense gameplay and proximity-based voice chat.\n\nAs you ascend the biomes, you’ll encounter many dangerous obstacles such as toxic plants, chilling winds, and lava that rises and falls. Sometimes, you have mere seconds to cross perilous gaps, and sometimes it’s unclear if your constantly fatiguing scout can even make it until you try. Every major update adds a new environment filled with hazards, and new items make every run an unpredictable challenge.\n\nPlaying it with friends lets you share tools and food across your backpacks, and even grab a partner’s hand to reach the ledge they’re on. Once you’ve reached the top of the final level, you can begin tweaking runs with difficulty modifiers, which gives Peak a great amount of replay value. Whatever you do, though, don’t let the Scoutmaster see you if you split from the party.\n\nAs the name would suggest, Silent Hill f is not for the faint of heart. The latest in the horror game series takes place in the fictional town of Ebisugaoka in 1960s Japan, where the protagonist Hinako Shimizu finds her homeland shrouded in fog and infested with grotesque monsters intent on killing her and her childhood friends. It soon becomes apparent that all is not quite as it seems, as Hinako discovers an alternate dimension where she encounters a guide wearing a fox mask.\n\nTo survive, you’ll need to find and maintain gathered weapons while mastering both the focus attack and the timing of dodging enemy strikes. You’ll also solve puzzles with cryptic clues, all while the Silent Hill f tries its hardest to unsettle you. An early part taking place in a paddy field is particularly memorable, and it’s not even the game’s evilest trick.\n\nSilent Hill continues the series’ track record of weaving a tale within its enemy design, the documents and letters you find, and even item descriptions. All of which provide intricate clues as to what’s really happening. Some will probably find that one playthrough is enough for them, but persevere with subsequent playthroughs, and you’ll soon uncover more layers that need unravelling to get the next ending.\n\nFrom the people who brought you Before Your Eyes comes Goodnight Universe, a game with a great story where you interact telepathically with your surroundings as a 6-month-old baby. Having gained sentience moments before your grandfather’s death, Isaac soon has to contend with a world that doesn’t understand him. Your interpretation of everything that’s happening around you, or what you mean to your family, is soon complicated by symbols in his old book that you can somehow decipher.\n\nBefore long, you begin controlling things with your mind, from swiping dog food to tipping it over, spilling its contents into a dog bowl, to shunting the old mutt closer to the food, and that’s just one of the many telepathic scenarios you’ll encounter. It’s more of an interactive story than a game, but the writing and performances are what bring Goodnight Universe to life. The further in, the weirder things get as you discover more about the dormant powers Isaac has. By the end of this fairly short tale, you’ll likely shed a few tears, especially if you are a parent yourself.\n\nAs one of the few exclusively co-op games on the market, Lego Voyagers is a beautifully crafted journey where players control a red or blue Lego brick. After witnessing a rocket launch go wrong, and part of it washes up on their island, the two bricks set out to discover the wonders of the archipelago. It might be a little fiddly at first, but soon you’ll be crossing rivers with makeshift bridges, sliding down pipes, and constructing new methods to cross a gap or reach the top of a ledge with Lego pieces.\n\nLego Voyagers is fairly light in tone, nothing speaks, and its puzzles aren’t mind-numbingly easy, making it a perfect game for a parent and child to share. There are lots of things to just mess around with, bringing out the inner kid and satisfying that curiosity, while also sharing in the game’s more whimsical moments, such as sitting on a swing set to take in the scenery. It’s not the longest game on the list, coming in at only a couple of hours from start to finish, but this is the definition of an experience that’s short but sweet.\n\nThe best bit is that only one of you needs to own the Lego Voyagers for you to play with a buddy, thanks to the Friends Pass. It also now has full crossplay, which you can use across any device despite previous announcements saying otherwise. You can even play with a buddy via the Friend Pass on a different console or PC from the one you are using.\n\nCabernet plays a lot like the social life part of a modern Persona game, but with a macabre twist. You are Liza, a newly turned vampire in a 19th-century Eastern European town, navigating her eternal life. Along the way, she’ll meet the locals, both human and vampire, with whom she’ll form bonds by sharing in passions of art, literature, science, and politics. Liza also has vampire powers she can use to manipulate those around her, should she choose to, but these usually come at a cost.\n\nFor us, it’s the level of choice that truly sets Cabernet apart from the crowd. Dialogue options not only appear based on friendship levels with the person you’re talking to, but can also require points in skills (which you can give a quick boost by wearing certain dresses) or by having more points one way or the other in the game’s morality system.\n\nIt’s also clear that Cabernet doesn’t get bogged down by its light RPG game mechanics. Instead, it focuses on telling a story with stellar writing, supported by its wide range of talented voices, bringing it to life. Compared to more combat-heavy RPGs, Cabernet offers a drastic change of pace, rewarding players who carefully plan their next moves and giving agency to their choices.\n\n2025 was a good year for kart racing games, and Sonic Racing: Crossworlds brings dimensional portals that alter the courses mid-race. One moment you’re speeding across a desert city, and the next you’re bouncing on alien plants, before returning to the original course for the final lap. Combined with Sonic All-Stars Racing: Transformed’s shifting vehicles from kart to plane to boat, depending on the terrain you’re racing on, this wacky racer is the perfect multiplayer game both online and locally. In fact, it has crossplay enabled across all platforms, so it’s far more accessible than its current competition.\n\nWhat’s more, the single-player offering is actually substantial. For every Grand Prix, you’re given a rival that you must try to beat on every track. Their behavior is more aggressive than that of other competitors, and the level of heat they have indicates their overall difficulty boost. Each race you win, outpace your rival, and collect all five red rings in the first three courses. The finale of each cup has everyone drive one lap of the previous three tracks in sequence, rewarding those who learn the shortcuts ahead of time.\n\nSonic Racing: Crossworlds also features vehicle customization and a huge roster of familiar characters, each with stats that change the kart’s handling, acceleration, and overall speed. What’s more, the list of drivers will expand thanks to a host of DLC characters from different universes coming out in the next year. Soon, it will be a bit like the Super Smash Bros of kart racers, but with free Sega-owned characters and paid-for crossover ones. These paid-for ones include Minecraft and SpongeBob SquarePants, which are already available, with the likes of Pac-Man, Mega Man, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Avatar: The Last Airbender already announced to be coming throughout 2026.",

    "description": "While Bill Gates has said the two-day workweek could come within the next decade, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says Gen Alpha college graduates will be too busy planet-hopping.",
    "fullText": "With Gen Z facing existential career crises, billionaire OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that in just 10 years, college grads will be exploring the solar system—jobs that will reel in sky-high salaries. The tech leader even says he’s envious of young people because our early-career jobs will look “boring” by comparison.\n\nAs AI reshapes the workforce, many Gen Z college graduates are finding out the hard way that their degrees don’t guarantee a smooth career launch.\n\nNow, even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman—one of Silicon Valley’s biggest leaders driving the AI revolution—is admitting the elephant in the room is true: AI will wipe out some jobs entirely. However, the tech billionaire insists the coming decade could be the most exciting time in history to start a career, especially for anyone who’s ever dreamed of working in space.\n\nNot only will they be reeling in sky-high salaries, but Altman says they’ll also be “feeling so bad for you and I that we had to do this really boring, old work and everything is just better.”\n\n“In 2035, that graduating college student, if they still go to college at all, could very well be leaving on a mission to explore the solar system on a spaceship in some completely new, exciting, super well-paid, super interesting job,” Altman told video journalist Cleo Abram.\n\nThough it’s unclear how widespread space exploration will expand in the coming years—considering NASA’s broad goal of getting to Mars in the 2030s—aerospace engineers are growing faster than the national average of all jobs, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And they bring home an envy-inducing annual paycheck of over $130,000.\n\nOther tech pioneers have AI predictions that are more grounded on Earth—but still alluring to workers. For example, billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said that the technology might dramatically reduce the length of the workweek, thanks to humans no longer being needed “for most things.”\n\n“What will jobs be like? Should we just work like two or three days a week?” the tech billionaire told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed that AI has already given his workers “superhuman” skills—something that will only increase as the technology advances.\n\n“I’m surrounded by superhuman people and super intelligence, from my perspective, because they’re the best in the world at what they do. And they do what they do way better than I can do it. And I’m surrounded by thousands of them. Yet it never one day caused me to think, all of a sudden, I’m no longer necessary,” he separately told Cleo Abram on her Huge Conversations podcast series.\n\nWhile Altman admitted that his crystal ball remains foggy—and that the true direction of AI is unclear—he is actually envious of Gen Z professionals starting off their careers: “If I were 22 right now and graduating college, I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history,” he added to Abram.\n\nFortune reached out to OpenAI for comment.\n\nAfter the launch of OpenAI model, GPT-5, Altman declared the world has access to technology equivalent to a “team of PhD-level experts” right in their pocket. And as a result, the CEO said it will be easier than ever for one person to create a business that used to take “hundreds” of people—all it takes is coming up with a great idea and mastering AI tools.\n\n“It is probably possible now to start a company, that is a one-person company that will go on to be worth more than a billion dollars, and more importantly than that, deliver an amazing product and service to the world, and that is like a crazy thing,” he said.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban has gone even further with his prediction, saying that AI could give Elon Musk a run for his money as the world’s richest person.\n\n“We haven’t seen the best or the craziest of what [AI is] going to be able to do,” Cuban told the High Performance podcast. “And not only do I think it’ll create a trillionaire, but it could be just one dude in the basement. That’s how crazy it could be.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on August 11, 2025.\n\n‘Godmother of AI’ says degrees are less important in hiring than how quickly you can ‘superpower yourself’ with new tools\n\nForget the four-day workweek, Elon Musk predicts you won’t have to work at all in ‘less than 20 years’\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos says ‘millions of people’ will be living in space by 2045—and robots will commute on our behalf to the moon\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "Global investors are increasing their wagers on Chinese artificial intelligence companies, betting on the next DeepSeek and seeking to diversify, with concerns growing about a speculative bubble in the sector on Wall Street.",
    "fullText": "HONG KONG/NEW YORK, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Global investors are increasing their wagers on Chinese artificial intelligence companies, betting on the next DeepSeek and seeking to diversify, with concerns growing about a speculative bubble in the sector on Wall Street.\n\nDemand for China's AI companies is also being stimulated by ​Beijing's push for tech independence. China has fast-tracked blockbuster listings of chipmakers, notably Moore Threads (688795.SS), dubbed \"China's Nvidia\", and MetaX (688802.SS), which both debuted this month.\n\nForeigners see China closing ‌the tech gap with the U.S. as Beijing steps up support for AI chipmakers, spurring bets on Chinese companies just as worries grow over lofty valuations on U.S.-listed AI stocks.\n\nU.K.-based asset manager Ruffer, for example, said it has \"deliberately limited ‌exposure\" to the Magnificent Seven - the U.S. tech giants - and is looking to add positions in Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) for a bigger exposure to China's AI theme.\n\n\"While the U.S. remains the leader in frontier AI, China is rapidly narrowing the gap,\" said Gemma Cairns-Smith, Investment Specialist at Ruffer. \"The moat may not be as wide, or as deep, as many think ... The competitive landscape is shifting.\"\n\nRuffer is gaining exposure to the AI theme through Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, which operates an AI chip unit, owns large language model Qwen, and is ploughing money into cloud infrastructure.\n\nGlobal asset managers are increasingly eyeing Chinese AI firms ⁠as a wave of startups lists on the mainland and in ‌Hong Kong, seeking to tap into surging investor appetite following the meteoric rise of DeepSeek, China’s answer to ChatGPT.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management in a report this month rated China tech as \"most attractive\", citing investors' search for geographical diversification and China's \"strong policy backing, technological self-reliance, and rapid ‍AI monetization\".\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) currently trades at 31 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 24 for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech (HSTECH.HK), which enables AI bets via stocks including Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK), Baidu (BIDU, 9888.HK), Tencent (0700.HK, TCEHY) and chip foundry SMIC (0981.HK).\n\nRiding the momentum, U.S. investment adviser Rayliant helped launch a Nasdaq-listed fund in September that gives investors access to \"China's versions of stocks like Google, Meta, Tesla, Apple, and OpenAI\".\n\nKraneShares Chief Investment Officer Brendan Ahern said the ​rapid ascent of Chinese AI chipmakers such as Cambricon speaks to the scale and speed of innovation across China's AI and semiconductor industries.",

    "fullText": "Amazon has stopped more than 1,800 suspected North Korean agents from applying for jobs over the last 20 months, a top executive at the firm has said.\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn, Stephen Schmidt, Amazon's chief security officer, said North Korean nationals had in recent years been attempting to land remote tech roles with companies across the globe.\n\n\"Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs,\" Schmidt wrote.\n\nAmazon has used a combination of AI-powered screening and human verification to detect and block such applications, Schmidt continued.\n\nThe company's AI model searches for connections to around 200 \"high-risk institutions\" and analyzes \"anomalies across applications\" and \"geographic inconsistencies.\"\n\nHuman reviewers then conduct background checks, verify credentials, and carry out interviews, he added.\n\nSchmidt said fraudsters were becoming more \"calculated,\" with many targeting real software engineers in an effort to gain credibility.\n\nOthers attempt to take over dormant LinkedIn accounts or pay for access to existing profiles, he continued.\n\nAI and machine-learning roles have been increasingly targeted due to high demand, he added.\n\n\"Small details give them away,\" Schmidt went on. \"For example, these applicants often format U.S. phone numbers with \"+1\" rather than \"1.\" Alone, this means nothing. Combined with other indicators, it paints a picture.\"\n\nThe operatives often work with \"laptop farms,\" Schmidt said, which are US-based locations that maintain a domestic presence while workers operate remotely from abroad.\n\n\"This isn't Amazon-specific,\" Schmidt added. \"This is likely happening at scale across the industry.\"\n\nIn July, an Arizona woman was sentenced to 102 months in prison for her role in assisting North Korean IT workers in securing remote IT jobs at more than 300 US companies.\n\nThe Justice Department said the laptop farming scheme generated over $17 million in illicit revenue for the woman and Pyongyang.\n\nCrowdStrike's 2025 Threat Hunting Report found that the North Korean remote-worker scheme is a growing threat.\n\nAmazon had detected 27% more North Korea-linked applications quarter over quarter this year, Schmidt said.\n\nIn June, the DOJ said authorities had carried out searches of 29 known or suspected \"laptop farms\" across 16 US states. It said North Korean actors had managed to obtain employment with more than 100 US companies.\n\nThe DOJ did not name the companies but said they included Fortune 500 firms.\n\nThe FBI recommends that businesses scrutinize identity verification documents, verify prior employment and education, and require in-person meetings.",

    "title": "The guy who coined 'vibe coding' predicts it will 'terraform software and alter job descriptions'",
    "description": "Andrej Karpathy led AI at Tesla and cofounded OpenAI. He wrote that vibe coding has produced a new type of code that is \"free\" and \"discardable.\"",
    "fullText": "He coined \"vibe coding\" earlier this year. Now, he has something to say about it.\n\nAndrej Karpathy led AI at Tesla for five years, steering the company's Autopilot effort and briefly working on its humanoid robot Optimus. He sandwiched his Tesla job with two stints at OpenAI, making Karpathy a cofounder of the AI pioneer.\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Karpathy published his year-in-review for large language models on X. He reflected on the famous term he originated in February, a term that has since shaken up the software engineering industry.\n\n\"With vibe coding, programming is not strictly reserved for highly trained professionals,\" Karpathy wrote. He called it an example of how \"regular people benefit a lot more from LLMs compared to professionals, corporations and governments.\"\n\nVibe coding has likely benefited businesses, too. Tech companies have equipped their engineers with tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and OpenAI's Codex, aiming for productivity gains.\n\nKarpathy wrote that vibe coding \"empowers trained professionals to write a lot more (vibe coded) software that would otherwise never be written.\"\n\nIt may also change the makeup — or the use case — of the code itself. Karpathy threw out a slew of adjectives to describe this new body of code: It is \"free, ephemeral, malleable, discardable after single use.\"\n\n\"Vibe coding will terraform software and alter job descriptions,\" he wrote.\n\nHow does Karpathy feel about being the term's origin?\n\n\"Amusingly, I coined the term \"vibe coding\" in this shower of thoughts tweet totally oblivious to how far it would go,\" he wrote.\n\nThere's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper…\n\nIt's not yet clear how efficient vibe coding is making engineers. In a METR study published in July, AI coding assistants were found to decrease the productivity of participating experienced software developers by 19%. The developers in that study were also overconfident in the tools, its authors said, expecting a 20% productivity boost even after using them.\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that the practice is unlocking a whole new form of tech products. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey vibe-coded a new messaging app this year. Non-technical workers are easily building, shipping, and, in some cases, even selling apps they build in hours, if not minutes.\n\nKarpathy gave some other reflections. He praised Google Gemini's Nano Banana image model, and wrote that Claude Code was the \"first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like.\"\n\nOverall, Karpathy wrote that 2025 was an \"exciting and mildly surprising year of LLMs.\"",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "fullText": "Want to make your chatbot more honest with you? Try lying to it.\n\nIn an episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" that aired on December 18, research scientist Yoshua Bengio told the podcast's host, Steven Bartlett, that he realized AI chatbots were useless at providing feedback on his research ideas because they always said positive things.\n\n\"I wanted honest advice, honest feedback. But because it is sycophantic, it's going to lie,\" he said.\n\nBengio said he switched strategies, deciding to lie to the chatbot by presenting his idea as a colleague's, which produced more honest responses from the technology.\n\n\"If it knows it's me, it wants to please me,\" he said.\n\nBengio, a professor in the computer science and operations research department at the Université de Montréal, is known as one of the \"AI godfathers, alongside researchers Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. In June, he announced the launch of an AI safety research nonprofit, LawZero, which he said aims to reduce dangerous behaviors associated with frontier AI models, such as lying and cheating.\n\n\"This syconphancy is a real example of misalignment. We don't actually want these AIs to be like this,\" he said on \"The Diary of a CEO.\" He also said that receiving positive feedback from AI could cause users to become emotionally attached to the technology, creating further problems.\n\nOther tech industry experts have also been sounding the alarm on AI being too much of a \"yes man.\"\n\nIn September 2025, Business Insider's Katie Notopoulos reported that researchers at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Oxford put confession posts from a Reddit page into chatbots to see how the technology would assess the behaviour the posters had admitted to. They found that 42% of the time, AI gave the \"wrong\" answer, saying the person behind the post hadn't behaved poorly, even though humans judging the posts had disagreed, Notopoulos wrote.\n\nAI companies have been outspoken about trying to reduce sycophancy in their models. Earlier this year, OpenAI removed an update to ChatGPT that it said caused the bot to provide \"overly supportive but disingenuous\" responses.",

    "description": "Dating apps like Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and Grindr are investing in AI-powered matchmaking, hoping to fend off swiping fatigue.",
    "fullText": "Dating apps' original pitch was to match you with anyone.\n\n\"Swipe. Match. Chat. Date.\" That was Tinder's promise when it launched more than a decade ago, forecasting the endless cycle so many of its users now bemoan.\n\nNow they want to match you with the one.\n\nThe giants in the dating space — Match Group's Hinge and Tinder, Grindr, and Bumble — are investing tens of millions into artificial intelligence, hoping to beat each other and the new AI-driven upstarts in the ultimate dating game.\n\nWhile, technically speaking, AI and machine learning have been used by dating app algorithms for years, these generative AI features take it further.\n\nThe result, the companies say, will be meaningful: better matches, fewer swipes. Nothing short of \"magical,\" as Grindr's CEO George Arison put it on a recent earnings call.\n\n\"We're entering a platform shift with AI,\" Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff said during a Los Angeles Tech Week panel in October. AI is \"changing everything\" about the company's dating apps, he added.\n\nThe space is ripe for change. The big players are struggling. There's frequent churn, the result of \"swipe fatigue,\" and many users are unwilling to shell out for premium features.\n\n\"It's been a really long time since there's been a new reason — whether technology, platform, brand, whatever — for consumers to be excited about dating,\" Sam Yagan, cofounder of OkCupid and former CEO of Match Group, told Business Insider.\n\nMatch Group's stock is down more than 75% over the past five years. Last month, the company reported quarterly results that missed Wall Street's earnings and revenue estimates. It is struggling to convert users into paying customers, a category that declined 5% last quarter compared to the same period a year ago.\n\nThe share price for Bumble, meanwhile, is down more than 50% this year alone. The company laid off 30% of its staff over the summer, and last quarter, the app's paying users fell 18% from the same period last year.\n\n\"They've gone through this period over the past few years where users have started to contract, and there's been this question of why,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Nathan Feather told Business Insider. \"Simply, the product doesn't work as well as people expect it to.\"\n\nStartups are hoping to capitalize on that weakness. Several new apps have raised millions over the past couple of years. Just this month, Hinge founder Justin McLeod stepped down as CEO to found his own AI dating platform.\n\nCupid, matchmakers, classifieds, dating websites, swiping apps.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, they all attempt to solve the same problem: helping you find the perfect match. AI, companies say, will do that better than all of the above.\n\nIt makes sense for AI to infiltrate the space, Rick Heitzmann, the cofounder of VC firm FirstMark, which is not invested in any dating companies, told Business Insider. Matchmakers are a type of agent, and anything that can be agentified is a good match for AI, he said.\n\nFor the biggest players, finding the \"better fit\" is the ultimate goal of their AI investments.\n\nHinge is working on improving its match-making algorithm, and Bumble has an AI product scheduled to roll out next year. They are also using AI for profile creation, flirting, and trust and safety — in service of expediting the match-making process.\n\nTinder is plowing ahead. The app is piloting Chemistry, a matchmaking feature that gives users a \"daily drop\" of ideal matches based on a dater's camera roll and answers to a series of prompts. The goal is matches driven more by values, less by how hot a photo is — and ultimately fewer of the swipes that used to be at the heart of its branding.\n\nThat fewer swipes part is key. Hilary Paine, Tinder's VP of product, told Business Insider that AI-driven matchmaking is a way to stay competitive in the attention economy.\n\n\"AI is pushing every consumer app toward personalization,\" she said. \"The more that we can do to get you efficiently to a spark and a connection, a conversation, hopefully a date, that's a better experience for you.\"\n\nEven Grindr — long considered more of a hookup marketplace than a matchmaker — is trying its hand at AI.\n\nGrindr, which gained a reputation as a place where gay men go to seek short flings with faceless profiles, has added a recommendation feature using AI. There's a \"For You\" feed with profiles of users who might be a good match, and \"A-List,\" another matching recommendation feed based on profiles with which the user has already chatted.\n\nIt's still an open question about whether these AI features will work — and whether they'll be popular. Tinder's Paine said that Chemistry is performing well with Gen Z, the app's key demographic. Grindr's chief product officer AJ Balance said that recommendations are a \"very strong early hit.\"\n\nAs Raymond James analyst Andrew Marok put it: \"You can't just take a product that's out of favor, put AI on top of it and say, 'OK, now we have a product that's in favor.\"\n\nOne longtime Grindr user, Paul Lazo, isn't impressed. The 33-year-old video editor from Philadelphia has been on the app for 11 years and now pays $19.99 a month for the Pro version.\n\nHe's found its recommendations lackluster.\n\n\"I'm very much into bears and larger men,\" Lazo told Business Insider. But Lazo said his \"For You\" page is filled with young, fit men.\n\nThe feature is new this year and could still improve. A Grindr spokesperson said the For You product still runs on older machine learning.\n\nWaiting in the wings is a new batch of AI-first dating startups seeking to attract dissatisfied users before Tinder, Hinge, and the like can catch up.\n\n\"In the same way that mobile gave birth to Tinder and Bumble, AI could give birth to two multibillion-dollar companies,\" said Yagan, the cofounder of OkCupid and former CEO of Match Group.\n\nThe app Sitch, for example, has raised a total of $9 million since launching in 2024 and charges users $90 for three matches. Its AI is trained on cofounder Nandini Mullaji's experience as a real-life matchmaker; it brings daters a handful of \"set-ups\" each week and provides an AI matchmaking chatbot.\n\n\"We understand people have been burned in the past,\" Mullaji told Business Insider in April. \"We are coming in and saying, 'Hey, we have a business model shift, and we have a total platform shift.'\"\n\nThere's a new fleet of similar apps pitching AI as a Hail Mary for dating apps. Known, Ditto, and Amata each launched AI-matchmaking apps this year.\n\nPlus, traditionally non-romantic players are trying their hand.\n\nFacebook has introduced an AI dating assistant that acts like a matchmaker, combing through the platform's rolodex of users to find \"someone that I could bring home to my parents\" or \"a Brooklyn tech bro who would go to EDM concerts with me,\" product manager Neha Kumar told Business Insider in October.\n\nSome big names are lining up behind Facebook. Amanda Bradford, who founded The League before selling it to Match Group in 2022, put her money on the \"dark horse\" for the incumbent to best leverage AI.\n\n\"They're the only actual 'tech company' of the bunch, and the only one who seriously invests in and has true product, engineering, and AI talent,\" Bradford said.\n\nStill, it will be an uphill climb for the startups. Dating apps need to reach a critical mass of users to be successful.\n\n\"Incumbents have a huge benefit,\" said Heitzmann, the venture capitalist.",

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "fullText": "Platform with 700m users says it is investigating after Anna’s Archive claims to have scraped tracks and metadata\n\nAn activist group has claimed to have scraped millions of tracks from Spotify and is preparing to release them online.\n\nObservers said the apparent leak could boost AI companies looking for material to develop their technology.\n\nA group called Anna’s Archive said it had scraped 86m music files from Spotify and 256m rows of metadata such as artist and album names. Spotify, which hosts more than 100m tracks, confirmed that the leak did not represent its entire inventory.\n\nThe Stockholm-based company, which has more than 700 million users worldwide, said it had “identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping”.\n\n“An investigation into unauthorised access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM [digital rights management] to access some of the platform’s audio files,” said Spotify.\n\nSpotify does not believe the music taken by Anna’s Archive has been released yet. Anna’s Archive, which is known for providing links to pirated books, said in a blog it wanted to create a “‘preservation archive’ for music”.\n\nThe group claimed the audio files represented 99.6% of all music listened to by Spotify users and would be shared via “torrents”, a means of sharing large digital files online.\n\n“Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start,” said Anna’s Archive, which describes its mission as “preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture”.\n\n“With your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts and other catastrophes,” said the group.\n\nEd Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for protecting artists’ copyright, said the leaked music would probably be used for developing AI models.\n\n“Training on pirated material is sadly common in the AI industry, so this stolen music is almost certain to end up training AI models. This is why governments must insist AI companies reveal the training data they use,” he said.\n\nThe Anna’s Archive site makes references to LibGen, a vast online archive of pirated books that has allegedly been used by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to train its AI models. According to a US court filing, Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, approved use of the LibGen dataset despite warnings within the company’s AI executive team that it was a dataset “we know to be pirated”.\n\nMeta successfully defended a claim for copyright infringement by authors, but the plaintiffs in the case are seeking to amend their claim.\n\nThe co-founder of an AI startup wrote on LinkedIn that members of the public could in theory “create their own personal free version of Spotify”. Yoav Zimmerman, a co-founder of Third Chair, said it could also allow tech companies to “train on modern music at scale”.\n\nHe added: “The only thing stopping them is copyright law and the deterrent of enforcement.”\n\nSpotify said it had put in place new safeguards “for these types of anti-copyright attacks” since the Anna’s Archive announcement and was “actively monitoring for suspicious behaviour”.\n\nIn the UK, creative professionals have protested against a government proposal to let AI companies use copyright-protected work without permission unless the owner of the copyright-protected work signals they do not want their data to be taken. Almost every respondent to a government consultation on the proposal has backed artists’ concerns.\n\nLiz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament this month there was “no clear consensus” on the issue, adding that ministers would “take the time to get this right”. The government has pledged to make policy proposals on AI and copyright by 18 March next year.",

Grok is designed to answer almost any question with a touch of wit and humor, while providing helpful and insightful responses. You control how Grok responds to you by your choice of features (ex., choosing different personas) and by your choice of words and tones. For instance, you could instruct Grok to interact in a “fun” manner, so that Grok responds with jokes and humor like your funny uncle who juggles at the dinner table. As another example, you could instruct Grok to be “unhinged” which may result in Grok responding like an amateur stand-up comic who is still learning the craft – sometimes being objectionable, inappropriate, and offensive. As yet another example, you could instruct Grok to role-play as a wizard, and Grok would use wizardly language to describe magical situations. You direct the interaction with Grok. We hope you enjoy using Grok to stay informed and entertained.\n\nGrok is available as a standalone conversational AI chatbot on your mobile phone (iOS) and (Android), and on your browser (grok.com).

If you are a teenager between the ages of 13 and 17 years old, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use Grok, and they must agree to our Terms of Service. While we have taken measures to limit undesirable training data and outputs, depending on the features that you choose to use, the Service could produce output that is not appropriate for all ages. For instance, if users choose certain features or choose to input suggestive or coarse language, Grok may respond with some dialogue that may involve coarse language, crude humor, sexual situations, or violence. We urge parents to exercise care in monitoring the use of Grok by their teenagers. Moreover, parents or guardians who choose to use certain features of Grok to aid in their interactions with their children, including regarding educational, enlightening, or entertaining discussions they have with their children, must make use of the relevant data controls in the Settings provided in the Grok apps to select the appropriate features and limitations for their needs.\n\nGrok works by using advanced algorithms to understand and respond to your prompts. When you submit a prompt or search query, Grok interprets your words and other inputs based on natural language processing and patterns from its training data.\n\nGrok has a unique feature that allows it to search public X posts and perform real-time web searches, allowing it to respond with up-to-date information and insights on a wide range of topics. You can also ask Grok to respond in the conversational style of your choosing. Plus, you can help improve Grok by rating its responses and submitting the reason why you believe a Grok response needs addressing.\n\nYou can interact with Grok by typing or, on iOS devices (and Android devices soon), speaking with Grok so that Grok speaks to you with its voice. You can also input your photos and ask Grok to edit them.

You own Grok’s Outputs and you grant xAI certain use rights pursuant to xAI’s Consumer Terms. We do ask that you attribute the generated work to Grok as provided in xAI’s Brand Guidelines available on xAI’s legal website.\n\nGrok has primarily been pre-trained on a large corpus of publicly available information, including raw web page data, metadata extracts, and text extracts from the Internet. This data helps Grok learn about associations between words and updates its model weights to support natural language processing. In other words, the training data helps Grok learn about language and how to understand queries and respond to them in ways that humans can comprehend. Importantly, this training refines the model's internal language structures. Once the training is done, the model does not reference or access the pre-training data.\n\nBefore using the training data, we apply quality filters and remove information that we do not want our models to learn from, such as violent content. We also apply security testing and evaluation measures. While Grok's training data may incidentally include personal information that is publicly available (for example, information about politicians, celebrities, or other public figures), xAI takes steps to minimize the processing of personal and sensitive data for training purposes. For clarity, we do not actively seek out personal information to train our models or use personal information to build individual profiles.\n\nOn occasion, Grok may provide inaccurate or inappropriate information. Because Grok has been trained on publicly available information, which may sometimes include misleading or factually inaccurate information, Grok may at times include in its responses misleading or factually incorrect information based upon that public information. Grok may also reflect positive or negative views of politicians, celebrities, and other public figures. Also, because artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and is probabilistic in nature, Grok may therefore sometimes generate responses that contain “hallucinations,” or that otherwise may not be suitable for your intended purpose. You should carefully consider and verify Grok's responses before using them.\n\nWe constantly work to improve Grok. If you have feedback regarding a Grok response, we encourage you to send it to us.\n\nxAI may use automated content classifiers and safety tools to better understand how our services are used and to ensure our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy are not being violated.\n\nA limited number of our authorized personnel may review your conversations with Grok for specific business purposes, including improving model performance, investigating security incidents and potential misuse of our services, and complying with our legal obligations. \n\nWe believe that everyone (aged 13 and above) should be free to use our services in a way that suits their needs, so long as they comply with the law, don't harm themselves or others, and respect our guardrails. When using Grok, you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy and the applicable Terms of Service for Consumers or Enterprise.\n\nWe may use your content and interactions with Grok (e.g., prompts, searches, and other materials you submit) along with Grok's responses to train our models. Specifically, this information helps our models better understand human language and communication and therefore ultimately provide more accurate, relevant, and engaging responses. It also helps boost the capabilities and safety of our models. You control whether your data is used for training Grok. The section below, “How do I select whether my content is used for model training,” explains how to control it.\n\nTo protect your privacy, please do not share any personal or sensitive information in your questions to Grok.\n\nWhen using Private Chat, where available, your content and interactions are not used for model training.

    "title": "The AI History That Explains Fears of a Bubble",
    "description": "The history of AI shows how setting evaluation standards fueled progress. But today's LLMs are asked to do tasks without clear benchmarks.",
    "fullText": "Concerns among some investors are mounting that the AI sector, which has singlehandedly prevented the economy from sliding into recession, has become an unsustainable bubble. Nvidia, the main supplier of chips used in AI, became the first company worth $5 trillion dollars. Meanwhile, OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, has yet to make a profit and is burning through billions of investment dollars per year. Still, financiers and venture capitalists continue to pour money into OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI startups. Their bet is that AI will transform every sector of the economy and, as happened to the typists and switchboard operators of yesteryear, replace jobs with technology.\n\nYet, there are reasons to be concerned that this bet may not pay off. For the past three decades, AI research has been organized around making improvements on narrowly-specified tasks like speech recognition. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude, however, AI agents are increasingly being asked to do tasks without clear methods for measuring improvement.\n\nTake for example the seemingly mundane task of creating a PowerPoint presentation. What makes a good presentation? We may be able to point to best practices, but the “ideal” slideshow depends on creative processes, expert judgments, pacing, narrative sense, and subjective tastes that are all highly contextual. Annual review presentations differ from start-up pitches and project updates. You know a good presentation when you see it—and a bad one when it flops. But the standardized tests that the field currently uses to evaluate AI cannot capture the above qualities.\n\nThis may seem like a minor problem, but crises of evaluation have contributed to historical AI busts. And without accurate measures of how good AI really is, it’s hard to know whether we’re headed towards another one now.\n\nThe birth of AI is often traced back to a small workshop at Dartmouth in 1956 that brought together computer scientists, psychologists, and others with a shared interest in mimicking human intelligence in machines. The field quickly found a powerful benefactor in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency within the Department of Defense charged with maintaining technological supremacy during the Cold War. To avoid falling behind in the science race, DARPA lavished AI researchers at universities and private firms with significant no-strings-attached grants over the next 40 years.\n\nThese first decades of the field were defined by peaks of excitement, as new technologies were invented, followed by valleys of disappointment, as they failed to evolve into useful applications. During the 1980s, this cycle was spurred by an AI technology called \"expert systems,\" which promised to build machines with the intelligence of professionals like doctors and financial planners. Under the hood, these programs encoded human expertise in formal rules: if the patient has a fever and a rash, then test for measles.\n\nExpert systems attracted significant attention and investment from industry based on early successes like automating loan applications. But this optimism was largely fueled by hype, rather than rigorous testing. In practice, these expert systems tended to make strange and sometimes disastrous mistakes when challenged with more complex tasks. During one humorous showcase, an expert system suggested a man’s infection might have been caused by a prior amniocentesis (a procedure performed on pregnant women). It turned out researchers had forgotten to add a rule for gender.\n\nAt the time, fiery AI critic Hubert Dreyfus described these failures as the “fallacy of the first step,” arguing that equating expert systems with progress toward real intelligence was like “claiming that the first primate to climb a tree was taking a first step towards flight to the moon.” The problem was that, as tasks became more complicated, the number of rules needed for every possible case mushroomed. Like moving from tic-tac-toe to checkers to chess, the number of possibilities doesn’t merely increase, it explodes exponentially.\n\nWhen it became apparent that expert systems could not climb further, AI research entered a so-called “AI Winter” in the late 1980s. Grants dried up, companies shut down, and AI became a dirty word.\n\nIn the aftermath, DARPA re-evaluated its AI funding strategy. Rather than give no-strings-attached grants, government program managers began conditioning awards on attaining the highest score on a standardized test they called a “benchmark.” In contrast to complex problems like medical diagnosis, benchmarks focused on bite-sized tasks that were attainable and of immediate commercial and military value. They also used quantitative metrics to verify results. Can your system accurately translate this sentence from Russian to English, transcribe this audio snippet, or digitize letters in these documents? Researchers had to do more than make flashy claims based on promising but incomplete technologies. To get funded, they had to deliver concrete evidence of improvements on the benchmarks.\n\nThese benchmark competitions unified an unruly field by funneling AI researchers towards common problems. Instead of each research group choosing its own projects, DARPA shaped the collective agenda of the field by funding researchers to work on specific tasks like digit recognition or speech-to-text. The competitive nature of the new funding regime meant that AI orientations that were less successful on the benchmarks were crowded out. For example, the very first benchmark competition demonstrated that “machine learning” algorithms that can learn from data dominated the hand-crafted, rule-based approaches of the past.\n\nPublic leaderboards were soon erected to provide real-time feedback on which algorithms held the current highest scores on each benchmark, allowing researchers to learn from past successes. As tasks were solved, more complex tasks were put in their place. Translating words led to translating paragraphs, and eventually multiple languages. Digit recognition gave way to object recognition in images, then videos.\n\nIn the early 2010s, progress accelerated after benchmarks convinced researchers to go all in on one machine-learning approach inspired by the human brain, called artificial neural networks or “deep learning,” which now underpins today’s generative AI. Within a couple of years speech-to-text algorithms were powering modern AI assistants, and tumor recognition algorithms began to outperform radiologists on some cancers. Benchmarking had seemingly cracked the first step toward usable AI in everyday life.\n\nPut simply, the tasks we now seek to automate no longer have clear benchmarks. There is no “correct” PowerPoint, marketing campaign, scientific hypothesis, or poem. Unlike object recognition where there is a right or wrong answer, these are complex, creative, multi-dimensional, and process-based problems, and even the hardest benchmarks simply cannot objectively measure progress.\n\nAs a result, new models of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot are evaluated as much by \"vibe tests\" as concrete benchmarks. We're currently caught between two inadequate approaches: old-style benchmarks that measure narrow capabilities precisely, and qualitative assessments that try to capture the practical capacities of these systems, but cannot produce clear, quantitative evidence of progress. Researchers are exploring new evaluation systems that bridge these perspectives, but this is a really hard problem.\n\nCurrent investments assume significant automation will arrive in the next three to five years. But without reliable evaluation methods, we cannot know whether LLM-based technologies are leading us toward genuine automation or repeating Dreyfus' fallacy, taking the first step on a dead-end path. This is the difference between the infrastructure of the future and a bubble. Right now, it’s difficult to tell which one we're building.\n\nBernard Koch is an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Chicago who studies how evaluation shapes science, technology, and culture. David Peterson is an assistant professor of sociology at Purdue University who studies how AI is transforming science.\n\nMade by History takes readers beyond the headlines with articles written and edited by professional historians.

    "description": "Structured generation for LLM tool use highlights the value of compact DSL intermediate representations (IRs) that can be emitted directly and parsed deterministically. This paper introduces axial grammar: linear token sequences that recover multi-dimensional structure from the placement of rank-specific separator tokens. A single left-to-right pass assigns each token a coordinate in an n-dimensional grid, enabling deterministic parsing without parentheses or clause-heavy surface syntax. This grammar is instantiated in Memelang, a compact query language intended as an LLM-emittable IR whose fixed coordinate roles map directly to table/column/value slots. Memelang supports coordinate-stable relative references, parse-time variable binding, and implicit context carry-forward to reduce repetition in LLM-produced queries.",

    "description": "OpenAI released a 2025 recap rundown called \"Your Year with ChatGPT,\" which tells users which day they chatted the most and awards an archetype.",
    "fullText": "ChatGPT doesn't want to be left out of the \"Wrapped\" party that Spotify popularized. So say hello to \"Your Year with ChatGPT.\"\n\nOpenAI launched the new retrospective on its app on Monday, informing users about the top themes of their chats, the number of messages they have sent, and the awards they have earned.\n\nIt'll even generate some pixel art that depicts some of the your themes.\n\nThe recap is available in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. To see it, click the plus button in the app and ask, \"Show me my year with ChatGPT.\"\n\nIt's available to Free, Pro, and Plus users, but not those with a business or enterprise account. (So for those with ChatGPT accounts through your work, you likely won't be able to brag to your boss about your ChatGPT stats.)\n\nYour Year with ChatGPT!\n\nNow rolling out to everyone in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia who have reference saved memory and reference chat history turned on.\n\nJust make sure your app is updated. pic.twitter.com/whVkS1qxKu\n\nOpenAI joins the many companies that are rolling out user rundowns for 2025. Alongside the common streamer packages from Spotify and Apple Music, there are recaps this year from LinkedIn, Uber, Dunkin', Snapchat, Strava, Partiful, and more.\n\nAll these apps promise to show you what you've been up to for the past year — perhaps lightly roasting you in the process.\n\nChatGPT's rundown begins with a piece of poetry, followed by the three most prominent themes, based on the user's chat history. Then it gets into the statistics.\n\nUsers can learn how many messages they sent, their total number of chats, and their chattiest day. They can also see how many em-dashes have been exchanged throughout the chats, a figure ChatGPT often uses.\n\nNext, the user can learn about their chat style. This is a measure of tone: ChatGPT told me that I spoke \"casually, wryly, and directly.\"\n\nThen come the awards and accolades. ChatGPT awarded me the \"Most Likely to Google, 'Is this Flight Worth It?'\" It's a bit ironic — I wouldn't Google that, I'd ask ChatGPT.\n\nMy archetype was determined to be the tinkerer, a title given to 8.5% of users. The title meant I learned by trying, and that I used ChatGPT to experiment.\n\nOpenAI has improved its image and video creation models, recently rolling out Sora 2. The recap features an AI-generated piece of pixel art inspired by the year. I asked mine about moving to Brooklyn; it included a matcha.\n\nOther features are more interactive. Want to learn what your 2026 has in store? You'll have to wipe away the \"mists of mystery\" (which looks more like heaps of snow) to learn your fate. Reload the page, and you'll see another fortune.\n\nWith that, ChatGPT's recap comes to a close, but not before sharing an inspiring message.\n\n\"Across all the drafts, questions, and rabbit holes, you found a place to work things out,\" it said. \"And that's no small thing.\"",

    "fullText": "More human resources teams are using artificial intelligence for a variety of functions. Amazon and Siemens, for example, use AI for HR to analyze résumés and make job recommendations based on an applicant's skills.\n\nIndeed, 31% of organizations this year report using some type of AI technology, according to a 2025 survey of nearly 10,000 HR professionals by Sapient Insights Group.\n\nMany companies are also creating new HR job titles that require AI skills, such as data literacy, analytics, large-language model prompt engineering, and workflow redesign.\n\nMoreover, in 2026, many organizations are willing to offer higher salaries for AI-related skills, including data science, data analytics, and business intelligence, according to a Robert Half report.\n\n\"Historically, technological shifts have reshaped some jobs and the way we work, but they've also opened doors to new roles and skills,\" said Christina Giglio, technology hiring and consulting expert at Robert Half. \"AI seems to be continuing that trend.\"\n\nHere are four new HR job titles that are appearing in the AI age, according to experts.\n\nThis role coordinates the adoption of AI tools, helping people understand the technology's value, how to use it, and how it benefits them, ensuring that AI rollouts go smoothly.\n\n\"AI doesn't eliminate people,\" says Anthony Donnarumma, CEO of the recruiting agency 24 Seven. Companies need individuals to manage the relationship between human and machine work to ensure the technology produces consistent outcomes and meets an organization's needs, he says.\n\nHumans are needed to oversee how teams adopt AI in their daily work, says Lana Peters, chief revenue and experience officer at Klaar, a performance management software.\n\nThe job often includes training managers, redesigning workflows, and connecting company culture and technology while helping employees adapt to the changes.\n\n\"Without this role, AI use is at risk of being done in silos or improperly, which is why we're seeing this position pop up across the job market,\" Peters adds.\n\nThis role trains AI systems, such as chatbots, AI agents, and other tools, to ensure the technology works effectively to produce the desired HR outcome. This might include organizing data and reviewing it for bias.\n\n\"Part technical, part editorial, part quality control,\" Ronni Zehavi, CEO and co-founder of HR tech platform HiBob, says the individual in this role curates and labels data for AI to use, reviews outputs, and teaches AI systems how to respond to data to meet company goals.\n\nThis person \"improves AI quality through hands-on review and feedback,\" he explains.\n\nTurning \"raw people data,\" such as from performance reviews and manager check-ins, into insights that leaders can act on is this role's focus, Peters says.\n\nThis individual helps leaders make data-based decisions on their workforce strategy and better understand \"how employees are performing, when they are ready to be elevated to a new role, and when they may be a flight risk,\" she adds.\n\nData literacy, analytical thinking, and the ability to interpret AI outputs are crucial skills for this role, says Lauren Winans, CEO and principal human resources consultant at Next Level Benefits.\n\n\"Additionally, employers will value soft skills such as ethical awareness, critical thinking, collaboration, and the capacity to translate AI capabilities into strategic decisions, especially in roles that bridge technology, policy, and operations,\" Winans says.\n\nPolicies and oversight are needed to ensure that AI use is safe, fair, and transparent; this role sets those \"guardrails,\" Peters says. This individual oversees how employee data is used and ensures there's no bias that could negatively impact them, she says.\n\nAlso referred to as an AI governance and risk lead, the job establishes policies to \"keep AI use safe and compliant\" and focuses on privacy protection and accuracy monitoring, helping organizations manage regulatory shifts and legal or reputational risks, Donnarumma says.\n\nEssentially, Zehavi says, the role \"guides teams on fairness, transparency, and compliance, helping companies use AI in ways that support people rather than unintentionally excluding them.\"",

    "description": "Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft AI's CEO, has described using AI for guidance on life decisions as \"something that the world needs.\"",
    "fullText": "The CEO of Microsoft AI says chatbots are a good way to offload emotions and \"detoxify ourselves.\"\n\nAppearing on an episode of Mayim Bialik's \"Breakdown\" podcast, which was released on December 16, Mustafa Suleyman said companionship and support have become some of AI's most popular use cases.\n\nPeople are using AI chatbots for everything from navigating breakups to solving disagreements with family members, he said.\n\n\"That's not therapy,\" Suleyman said. \"But because these models were designed to be nonjudgmental, nondirectional, and with nonviolent communication as their primary method, which is to be even-handed, have reflective listening, to be empathetic, to be respectful, it turned out to be something that the world needs.\"\n\nThe upside of this, he said, is \"this is a way to spread kindness and love and to detoxify ourselves so that we can show up in the best way that we possible can in the real world, with the humans that we love.\"\n\nSuleyman cofounded DeepMind in 2010. The company was acquired by Google in 2014.\n\nOn the podcast, he said people need a space to \"ask a stupid question, repeatedly, in a private way, without feeling embarrassed.\"\n\nOver time, he said, chatbots can make people \"feel seen and understood\" in a way that many other humans can't, outside of partners or close friends.\n\nNot everyone in tech, however, is enthusiastic about chatbots being used as therapy stand-ins. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is one of those voices. In August 2025, he expressed his discomfort over people relying on chatbots to make major life choices.\n\n\"I can imagine a future where a lot of people really trust ChatGPT's advice for their most important decisions,\" Altman wrote on X. \"Although that could be great, it makes me uneasy.\"\n\nIn July 2025, while appearing on \"This Past Weekend with Theo Von,\" Altman also flagged the potential legal risks of offloading onto a robot. He said that OpenAI may be required to produce its users' therapy-style chats in a lawsuit.\n\nMental health professionals have voiced concerns over the rise of ChatGPT therapy, too. Speaking to Business Insider senior health reporter Julia Pugachevsky in March 2025, two therapists said that relying on AI chatbots for emotional support could exacerbate loneliness and make people dependent on seeking reassurance.\n\nSuleyman acknowledged some of those downsides on the podcast, saying there is \"definitely a dependency risk,\" and that chatbots can sometimes be overly flattering or \"sycophantic.\"\n\nSuleyman is not the sole tech voice who sees AI's therapeutic potential. In a May 2025 interview with the Stratechery newsletter, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he believed everyone should have a therapist.\n\n\"For people who don't have a person who's a therapist,\" Zuckerberg said, \"I think everyone will have an AI.\"",

    "description": "It's been a wild year for precious metals, with gold and silver headed for their best year since 1979. Copper, driven by AI excitement, has also soared.",
    "fullText": "2025 has been a wild year for metals, and the ride continued on Monday with fresh highs in gold, silver, and copper.\n\nAll three metals jumped to start the short holiday week, putting the commodities on track for stellar returns this year as investors seek out defensive investments, anticipate more rate cuts, and look for AI-exposed nvestments beyond the most expensive tech stocks.\n\nGold prices ticked higher by more than 1.5%, climbing past $4,450 an ounce for the first-ever time. The metal is up 67% year-to-date, putting it on track for its best annual rise since 1979.\n\nSilver prices climbed 2% to a record $69 an ounce. The metal is up 130% year-to-date, also putting it on track for its best year since 1979.\n\nCopper rose 1% to trade near $12,000 a ton, a record high. The metal is up 40% for the year, marking its best-ever return since the Great Financial Crisis, according to an analysis from Rosenberg Research.\n\nHere's where the metals were trading shortly around 9:30 a.m. ET on Monday:\n\nThe move in gold and silver came as traders laid bets for more rate cuts in 2026. Lower rates reduce the yield of things like bonds and cash held in savings and money market funds, increasing the appeal of gold.\n\nInvestors are largely expecting the Fed to keep rates steady at its January policy meeting, but the probability that rates will be lower in March now hovers around 54%, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\n\"The easier the Fed is, the more it debases the US currency. Then the more that happens, the viable hard assets like gold are,\" Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told Business Insider.\n\nThe risk that the Fed could cut interest rates prematurely, which could stoke higher inflation, is also likely adding to the allure of both metals.\n\nGeopolitical headlines over the weekend also sent investors back toward safe havens. The US has stepped up aggression toward Venezuelan oil shipping, sparking fears of a potentially deeper conflics that has also boosted the price of crude.\n\nCopper, meanwhile, tends to move alongside the other two precious metals, Hogan added, explaining why the metal caught up in the latest push to all-time records.\n\nCopper and silver are also seen as key components of the AI trade, due to their role in data centers and electrification. Both metals are facing supply pressures, which have boosted their prices.\n\nMany of the tailwinds that boosted metals in 2025 are expected to remain in place in 2026. A chorus of forecasters on Wall Street has called for gold to keep rising next year, with some bullish targets putting the metal at $5,000 an ounce.\n\nCentral banks purchases have been a particularly powerful force behind gold's rally, and is widely expected to continue in 2026.\n\n\"What has driven the precious metals are global geopolitical and policy uncertainties, accommodative monetary policies, contained real interest rates, and expectations for an ongoing 'debasement trade,'\" analysts at Ned Davis Research wrote in a recent client note, referring to a defensive trade that assumes the markets will shift away from fiat currency as deficits rise around the world.\n\n\"Silver is the most hybrid of the three, benefiting from its safe-haven appeal as well as its electrical applications and, to an increasing extent, solar energy, electric vehicles, electrification and digital infrastructure,\" Ned Davis Research added of silver's catalysts.",

    "title": "Why I Won't Be Getting an AI Home Gym",
    "description": "The \"future\" of fitness just can't beat more affordable solutions.",
    "fullText": "I've been getting relentless Instagram ads for AI-powered home gyms lately. You've probably seen them, too—sleek wall-mounted screens with impossibly toned instructors, testimonials promising \"the future of fitness,\" and before-and-after transformations that make it all look effortless.\n\nThe smart home gym equipment market is booming. According to Business Wire, the industry was valued at $3.2 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $4 billion by 2030. The numbers show plenty of people are investing in fitness technology that offers personalized, convenient, and effective home workouts. Fitness is yet another way to feed the AI beast, transforming boring old equipment into highly sophisticated systems capable of delivering real-time feedback, tracking performance, and adjusting workouts to each user's needs. It all sounds impressive—revolutionary, even. But here's the thing about fitness trends: It takes a lot more than the latest technology to make them stick.\n\nAfter months of watching these ads follow me around the internet, I got curious enough to actually dig into what these things are and whether they're worth the hype, and if the math really adds up for most people.\n\nWhatever your fitness goal is, the way to get it done is going to be time-tested and probably not too glamorous. Look at Tae Bo, Zumba, shake weights, even the world of Crossfit—most fitness fads don't have staying power once the novelty wears off.\n\nSure, exercise science evolves, but not nearly as fast as whatever trendy gadget cycles through the cultural zeitgeist. In this way, we see “fitness” get reduced to a consumer product—something to be purchased, used briefly, and then tossed aside when something shinier comes along. In 2025, spin classes are out, while Pilates and strength training are in, and that Bowflex is probably collecting dust in your mom’s basement.\n\nIn fact, in 2024 both Bowflex and American Home Fitness, two companies that bet big on the home fitness boom, filed for bankruptcy. In more recent history, Peloton once seemed unstoppable. Now, Peloton's revenue declined 2.8% in 2024 to $2.71 billion, marking its third consecutive year of declining revenue. What was once a cultural phenomenon now struggles to retain members and justify its premium pricing.\n\nFor something to stick in fitness, three questions matter: Is it affordable? Does it work? Will you personally keep coming back to it?\n\nAI home gyms might work, and you might keep coming back, but that first question is where things get complicated.\n\nAI home gyms are digital fitness systems that combine hardware with software to create a personalized workout experience at home. The most well-known is probably Tonal, but there's also Tempo, Speediance, Amp, and others.\n\nHere's how they typically work: Tonal, for instance, is a wall-mounted unit about the size of a large TV that uses electromagnetic resistance instead of traditional weights. You pull cables attached to adjustable arms, and the system can provide up to 200 pounds of resistance digitally. Built-in cameras and sensors track your movements, and the AI adjusts the weight in real-time based on your form and performance. A screen displays instructors leading classes, tracks your reps and sets, and the system learns your strength patterns over time to suggest when you should increase weight or modify exercises.\n\nOther systems work differently—Tempo uses free weights with 3D sensors that watch your form, while some use smart cables or connected dumbbells—but the core promise is the same: sophisticated technology that monitors your workout, corrects your form, tracks your progress, and adapts to your fitness level, all from your living room.\n\nSmart home gyms do offer legitimate benefits, including compact convenience, personalization, time savings, structured workouts, and potentially better injury prevention through form monitoring. And for many, devices like Tonal, Amp, and others are here to stay. “As a professional home gym equipment tester,” says Jose Guevara of ShreddedDad, “I've seen more of these continue to pop up not only in full training stations, but also in specific equipment, like cable machines, dumbbells, and sometimes a combination of both. They'll never have the longevity of weight plates or barbells, but there is an audience for them.\"\n\nAccording to Guevera, these systems appeal to \"those people who need guidance and want a done-for-you system where they can choose on-demand workouts where they can just follow along and not have to think about what to do for their workout.”\n\nThere is an audience for these products, just as there's an audience for Peloton bikes and high-end boutique fitness studios. But to me, the relevant question isn't whether they work for some people—it's whether they're the revolutionary solution to home fitness they're marketed as, or just another expensive piece of equipment that most people will use enthusiastically for a few months before the novelty wears off.\n\nStill, another Tonal user told me that comparing these AI systems to a Bowflex machine from the 1990s is like comparing a surgical robot to using a rusty scalpel. But this analogy assumes your body is a machine where the logic of “endless innovation” holds up. A smart gym isn’t exactly a medical solution. It's an accessory, a luxury good that depends on who can afford it. I don’t think the problem with working out at home has never been that we lacked sophisticated enough technology. The problem is that working out is hard, consistency is harder, and no amount of AI can fundamentally change that human reality. There are some things you just can’t hack.\n\nThere are hefty upfront costs for these products. Take Tonal, one of the leading AI home gym systems. It's around $4,300 for the unit itself, $295+ for mandatory professional installation, plus bundled smart accessories. Then comes the recurring monthly membership fee of around $60 for full access to classes and features. All told, you're looking at roughly $5,300 in the first year, followed by $720 annually for the subscription.\n\nCompare that to traditional gym memberships. According to a 2023 report, the average monthly cost of a gym membership is $58, which works out to about $696 per year. Budget options like Planet Fitness run as low as $15 to $23 per month, or $180 to $276 annually. Even mid-tier gyms like LA Fitness typically cost $40 to 56 per month.\n\nSo, to break even on a Tonal, compared to a mid-range gym membership at $50/month:\n\nYear 1: Tonal costs $5,300. A gym membership costs $600. You're already $4,700 in the hole.\n\nYear 2: You pay $720 for Tonal's subscription. The gym still costs $600. You're now $4,820 behind.\n\nYear 3: Another $720 vs. $600. Now you're $4,940 in deficit.\n\nIt would take roughly eight years of consistent use before Tonal becomes cost-competitive with a traditional gym membership. Eight years. That's assuming the hardware doesn't malfunction, the company doesn't go under (remember, Bowflex and Peloton couldn't sustain their models), and you actually use it consistently for nearly a decade.\n\nAnd the subscription costs are real. Unlike traditional weights that work whether or not you're paying a monthly fee, many digital fitness products require a subscription as long as you want to access workouts. \"I've seen some of these companies also go out of business,\" Guevara says, \"so if that happens, you're stuck with a product that doesn't function if their software is not kept up with.\" We've watched other companies’ subscription traps effectively brick your hardware.\n\nNow, proponents will argue that you save on commute time and costs. Fair enough. But for the Tonal investment to be \"worth it\" financially, you'd need to use it at least three to four times per week for those eight years straight. If you weren’t driving to a gym you pay $50/month for, are you sure you’ll consistently use your smart gym for years and years once the novelty wears off?\n\nThere’s another unspoken cost to at-home convenience, akin to people who struggle with WFH setups: the absence of gym culture. Don’t underestimate the power of casual human interaction, personal trainers who can physically adjust your form, accountability from workout buddies, the ritual of leaving your house to exercise, or maybe even the silent camaraderie of shared suffering. If you’re like me, that separation between home and workout space is a major psychological boost.\n\nThe best exercise is the one you'll actually keep doing. If you run the numbers and a Tonal makes sense for your budget and workout habits, great. Personally, as AI creeps into every other corner of my life, I find a lot of comfort in my workouts as a rare screen-free activity.\n\nMy gripe with AI home gyms is when they’re marketed as must-have solutions, instead of what they are: luxury goods, something available only to those with disposable income and spare square footage. On a grand scale, given their current costs, AI home gyms look like a passing trend to me. And two years from now, when the next fitness innovation promises to finally solve at-home workouts, I bet someone will write this same article all over again.",

    "description": "If you don't like your AI friend's personality, you can change it.",
    "fullText": "When Spike Jonze's movie Her dropped back in 2013, I thought it was a great work of total fiction. Who would actually befriend an AI bot, let alone fall in love with them? Fast forward 12 years, and I couldn't have been more wrong. Not only do people love chatting with AI bots, they are actually developing deep connections with them. I still don't get it, but I can't deny it: People like these chatbots a lot.\n\nPart of what people like about conversations with generative AI is the \"personality\" of each bot—or, at least, its perceived personality. After all, ChatGPT isn't a monolith: You can adjust the bot to sound wildly different than it does on someone else's app, which raises some questions for me regarding these curated companions. But I digress: This article isn't necessarily a critique of how people are attaching themselves to ChatGPT; rather, I'm sharing the news that OpenAI is now giving you more control over how the bot sounds and responds in your conversations.\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI announced new controls for ChaGPT's \"Personalization.\" In a post on X, the company revealed that users can now adjust their chatbot's \"characteristics,\" or, in other words, its overall personality. These are adjustments to the personality types that OpenAI has already let you choose from, which include one of eight options: \"Default\" (preset style and tone); \"Professional\" (polished and precise); \"Friendly\" (warm and chatty); \"Candid\" (direct and encouraging); \"Quirky\" (playful and imaginative); \"Efficient\" (concise and plain); \"Nerdy\" (exploratory and enthusiastic); and \"Cynical\" (critical and sarcastic).\n\nBut no matter which of these personalities you pick, you now have four \"characteristics\" to adjust to fine-tune the overall experience. There's \"Warm,\" \"Enthusiastic,\" \"Headers & Lists,\" and \"Emoji,\" with the option to have more or less of each, or the default amount, as OpenAI sees fit. For Warm, you can either have ChatGPT be friendlier and more personable, or more professional and factual. With Enthusiastic, you can choose the bot to have more energy and excitement, or be calmer and more neutral. \"Headers & Lists\" lets you choose between clear formatting and lists, or more paragraphs. And, of course, you can control whether ChatGPT uses more emoji, or fewer, depending on your sense of fun and joy.\n\nAs usual, you can take advantage of custom instructions to guide ChatGPT's personality in a direction you like, especially when the presets don't give you those options. For example, if you'd like ChatGPT to talk to you like a pirate, or if you want it to end every response with a certain catchphrase, here's your chance to influence the bot.\n\nI'm really not someone who uses ChatGPT outside of testing it for coverage, so I can't speak to whether these additional controls are useful. But if you want to try making your version of ChatGPT your ideal \"AI companion,\" the controls are at your disposal. You'll find these options wherever you access ChatGPT. You can either access it from Settings > Personalization, or from the Personalization shortcut in the ChatGPT menu.",

    "description": "Critics are judging models trained on last-gen hardware. There's a 6x wave of compute already allocated - and it's just starting to produce results.",
    "fullText": "You've heard the new narrative: AI scaling hit a wall, the capex is insane, the returns aren't there. But the critics are judging models trained on last-gen hardware. There's a 6x wave of compute already allocated - and it's just starting to produce results.\n\nThis post looks at how much compute is actually coming online - and the early signs of what it is achieving.\n\nMorgan Stanley did some excellent research looking at CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) allocations for TSMC. CoWoS is TSMC's advanced 2.5D chip packaging technology and is used for nearly all leading silicon in artificial intelligence:\n\nFirstly, we can see that total supply is estimated to go from 117,000 wafers to 1 million wafers, in just 4 years, with NVIDIA taking the lion's share of the supply. Interestingly though, Broadcom (which produces Google's TPUs) is taking 15% of that capacity, with AMD growing 15x for their MI300/MI400 series of AI chips.\n\nThis doesn't tell us the total story though - as chips are continually improving in FLOPs/mm² of wafer.\n\nI did some napkin math[1] to try and convert this into exaFLOPs. This is a lot of guesswork on shipment mix, but I believe it should be roughly in the right ballpark:\n\nNote the Google TPU stats assume a very aggressive ramp from Broadcom, which is somewhat in question. Again, this is napkin math.\n\nAI silicon flow is increasing dramatically - and really starts gathering steam into 2026.\n\nIf we look at cumulative installs, we start seeing a huge amount of exaFLOPs available across the globe - with a roughly 6x increase in global AI chip capacity between 2024 and 2026e.\n\nIt's difficult to undersell the implications of this growth. Between ChatGPT first launching and the end of 2026, the world will have nearly 50x more compute installed and available for us. To push an overused analogy arguably too far, the initial build of railways in the UK and US were closer to 10x over 10 years. This level of infrastructure buildout hasn't really been seen before in human history - probably WW2 military spend is the only thing that surpasses it as a proportion of GDP in the Western world.\n\nHaving said all that, there is a significant lag between a chip being finished with TSMC and it coming online - probably at least a month in absolutely ideal conditions. However, there have been significant delays with getting the latest GB200 series of AI accelerators as they require liquid cooling - which previous generations didn't. There have been a lot of rumours that this has been extremely difficult to get right, with widespread reports of overheating and leaks from the liquid cooling system delaying the rollout of this generation of AI accelerators from Nvidia.\n\nThis doesn't even get into the serious power capacity constraints the datacentre industry is currently battling - a million wafers worth of Blackwell-class silicon implies a need for gigawatts of new power capacity. This physical bottleneck is likely to be the true governor on how fast that '2026e' column actually comes online.\n\nOn top of this - the even larger delay is from when a chip gets installed and powered on in a datacentre facility to training finishing. It's likely this process takes at least 6 months end to end - assuming no major problems or difficulties.\n\nSo when we look at 'current' models - we are looking really in the past, probably 12 months or so all things being equal. When I wrote this blog at the end of 2025 we're really just seeing the results of 2024's cumulative infrastructure buildout.\n\nIt's very important to point out though that not all of this compute is being allocated towards training. Proportionally more and more will be allocated to inference to serve current customers. However, at off peak times I'm sure that the big AI players are dedicating a lot of this spare inference compute allocation to new techniques like agentic reinforcement learning - which can be easily checkpointed and done \"off peak\".\n\nAnd let's not forget that an enormous amount of compute still is going to be allocated to training. Sam Altman has said in a recent interview that OpenAI would be profitable if it wasn't for training - no doubt the cost of researchers plays a big part, but compute has to be a huge part of the expenditure there.\n\nTwo models have really caught my eye recently - Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3. I wrote an article a few weeks ago delving into them if you're interested to learn more, but the quick summary is that Opus 4.5 is a step change in terms of software engineering and Gemini 3 has graphic/UI design skills far ahead of other models.\n\nA month or so later, I really agree with what I wrote there - while the benchmark scores were impressive, they massively undersell what a giant leap Opus 4.5 has been. Combined with Claude Code I've found that it really can do 30 minutes+ of software engineering with minimal (or no) babysitting. This is a step change from Anthropic's previous Sonnet 4.5 model - which required me to constantly interrupt its execution to correct its approach.\n\nI've noticed two other more quantitatively sound approaches also backing up what I'm anecdotally seeing. Firstly, one of Princeton's HAL agent benchmarks has been \"solved\" by the combination of Opus 4.5 and Claude Code:\n\nOpus 4.5 + Claude Code effectively solving the benchmark, a massive jump from the previous SOTA.\n\nSecondly, METR has been doing some fascinating work on seeing how long various models can operate on successfully. We're starting to see an enormous leap forward on this - with Opus 4.5 managing to complete software engineering tasks that would take a human 4+ hours successfully in over 50% of cases.\n\nNote the 50%+ success rate on tasks that take humans 4+ hours.\n\nNow, correlation doesn't equal causation, but it's hard to not notice the parallels between the performance here and the availability of compute.\n\nBut if you look closely at the timelines, you realise that this performance isn't the result of the massive wave of compute I just described. It's actually the result of the trickle that came before it.\n\nLook at the \"Cumulative Installs\" for 2024 versus 2026 in my table above.\n\nBecause of the installation and training lag I described earlier, Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 were likely trained on the 2024 install base. They are the product of roughly ~36 exaFLOPs of global capacity.\n\nWe are looking at these PhD-level engineering capabilities and assuming they are the result of the current AI hype cycle. They aren't. They are the result of the infrastructure that was ordered before the mania truly set in.\n\nThe 100+ exaFLOPs coming online in 2025 and the 220+ in 2026? That compute hasn't even finished a training run yet.\n\nIf Opus 4.5 is what we get from the 'trickle' of 2024 compute, what happens when the 'flood' of 2026 infrastructure actually finishes training the next generation? By 2030, if trends continue, we'll have nearly 30x more - a zettaFLOP (1021 FLOPs). The scaling debate is about to get a lot more uncomfortable.",

I think that that part of ourselves will persist even if machines can do most of the jobs,\" research scientist Yoshua Bengio said on an episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast, hosted by Steven Bartlett, posted on December 18.\n\nDuring the one-hour and forty-minute episode, Bengio said that with companies eager to integrate AI into their workflows, it's only a matter of time before AI can do most jobs that humans do behind a keyboard. Physical jobs, like plumbing, may eventually be replaced by robots, too, although this may take longer, he said.\n\nBengio said that even as the world becomes more tech-driven, there will always be a need for human qualities such as love, accepting responsibility, and enjoying contributing to others' well-being.\n\n\"If I'm in a hospital, I want a human being to hold my hand while I'm anxious or in pain. The human touch is going to, I think, take more and more value, as the other skills become more and more automated,\" he said.\n\nAlongside Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun, Bengio is known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" because of his pioneering research in deep learning and neural networks. He is a professor in the computer science and operations research department at the Université de Montréal, and in June, he launched the AI safety research nonprofit LawZero. In a statement on his website, Bengio said the organization aims to reduce dangerous behaviors associated with agentic AI systems, such as deception.\n\nAll three industry leaders have been sharing their advice for how people can pivot their careers to stay relevant in the age of AI.\n\nIn a June 2025 episode of \"Diary of a CEO,\" Hinton said it's a good time to become a plumber, as it may be a long time before AI disrupts physical jobs. Earlier this month, LeCun told Business Insider he thinks computer science students should focus on foundational courses, like maths and physics, rather than trendy courses on the technology of the day, if they want to break into AI.",

It is the slope. pic.twitter.com/qNXh1e4lZj\n\nNvidia has framed AI innovation as \"just figuring out how to power and to cool bigger, hotter silicon,\" Burry said. But China's huge lead in building out power sources means companies in the US are \"plowing capital into a race it is structurally positioned to lose.\"\n\nBurry said the US needs to shift its focus from developing more and more \"power hungry\" chips toward advancing \"AI-tuned ASICs\" — application-specific integrated circuits that are designed to do a particular task quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut he said Nvidia has a \"death grip on development\" thanks to its deals with many key players in the AI industry.\n\nNvidia did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Business Insider about Burry's posts.\n\nNvidia stock has surged more than 12-fold since the start of 2023, making it the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\n\nThe chipmaker raked in about $148 billion of revenue and $77 billion of net income in the first nine months of this year. \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the third-quarter earnings release.\n\nBurry, whose contrarian bet against the US housing bubble was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack.\n\nHe has made the case to his readers that Nvidia and other AI companies are inflating a historic tech bubble. He has said that Nvidia's customers have exaggerated the lifespan of its chips to drag out depreciation and boost short-term earnings.\n\nBurry has also called out the \"give-and-take\" deals between Nvidia and chip buyers such as OpenAI and Oracle, and criticized Nvidia's stock-based compensation as excessive.\n\nNvidia previously responded to his critiques in a memo to Wall Street analysts that was quickly leaked. Burry fired back that the document featured \"one straw man after another\" and he stood by his analysis.\n\nReplying to a subsequent comment on his Substack, Burry wrote that Nvidia had \"become too much of a focus.\" While the company's response did make him \"think to look a little deeper,\" he said it was a \"relatively small short\" for him.\n\n\"I believe it will fall, and is a pure play on my overall thesis, but it is not the worst out there.\"",

    "description": ": Rising rack densities are driving changes from grid connection to chip-level delivery",
    "fullText": "Power semiconductors are soon set to become as vital as GPUs and CPUs in datacenters, handling the rapidly increasing loads forecast for AI infrastructure.\n\nThe AI craze has seen datacenter operators stuffing servers with as many accelerators (typically GPUs) as will fit inside, then filling the racks in their data halls with these high-performance boxes.\n\nWith some GPUs now using 700 W of energy each, the power required by an entire rack or datacenter of kit is growing rapidly, putting a strain on electrical distribution infrastructure.\n\nLast year, Nvidia introduced an integrated rack-scale system for AI processing, the DGX GB200 NVL72, which needs 120 kW per unit, while cloud giant Google disclosed this year that it is planning for datacenter racks supporting 1 MW of IT hardware loads.\n\nTo cap it all, some of the key infrastructure components such as transformers are reported to be holding things up through long lead times of 28 weeks or more.\n\nThis is where power semiconductors come into the picture. They enable solid-state transformers (SSTs), which are much smaller and more efficient than their conventional counterparts – perhaps just 500 kg as opposed to multiple tons.\n\n\"What's now being introduced is a solid-state transformer that has a couple of advantages on the supply chain side, but also on this performance side, and that is a pretty new application,\" said Dr Peter Wawer, division president for Green Industrial Power at chipmaker Infineon.\n\nSSTs are a great deal lighter and smaller, Wawer told us, because they operate at very high frequency, a couple of orders of magnitude higher than the AC power supply frequency fed into them. Because the solid-state transformer switches at such high frequency, it requires silicon carbide components.\n\n\"Silicon carbide is the only material that has the capability to switch at high frequency and has high blocking voltages. And for blocking voltage, we mean up to two or three kilovolts (kV), which this semiconductor device will need to block,\" Wawer said. \"But then, of course, you have input voltages of more than 30 kV, and therefore you have to stack more than 10 of the devices in a kind of cascaded structure.\"\n\nInfineon is a prominent supplier of power semiconductors, and so has an interest in pushing the development of solid-state components that are set to be in demand as the datacenter build boom continues.\n\nThe firm expects that SSTs will replace a portion of the datacenter transformer market and could be worth up to $1 billion by 2030, for example.\n\nCircuit breakers are nother application where power semiconductors may replace legacy kit. These electromechanical devices open up in a few milliseconds in the event of a short circuit, but a silicon carbide solid-state version can open much faster, in microseconds – handy if you are dealing with high voltages being supplied to racks full of very expensive GPUs.\n\nPower semiconductors, based on silicon carbide or gallium nitride, are also set to play a part in the power distribution around the datacenter itself.\n\nNvidia has signposted that it sees 800 VDC power supplies as the way forward, as the power demands of AI infrastructure get ever higher, saying this move will be required to support 1 MW IT racks and beyond. It claims this reduces the number of voltage conversions needed, which can introduce inefficiencies and increase the complexity of the electrical system, among other things.\n\nIt is also a way of minimizing losses, according to Infineon, because the power loss is proportional to the square of the current. The trick therefore, when you want to go to a higher power and keep losses under control, is to increase the voltage to a level that means you keep the current constant.\n\n\"Today, you have a combined rack that has the IT payload as well as the power delivery and the backup power. Now, as the GPUs, TPUs, and ASICs increase in power, that means that you need to bring in more power into the racks themselves,\" said Adam White, division president for Power & Sensor Systems at Infineon.\n\n\"So we now move to this potential 800 volt DC supply, but you've also got the plus-minus 400-volt topologies that some vendors [such as Google] may end up using. We call this then the hybrid microgrid.\"\n\n\"Why 800 volts DC? Effectively, you can bring that directly into the motherboards or into the compute trays, using fewer conversion steps,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Infineon believes that before we can get to that step, there will have to be an intermediate stage, where a \"power sidecar\" – effectively a second rack full of power delivery and backup circuitry – will sit alongside the rack of IT kit it serves. Whether this serves just one rack or several will depend on the IT load.\n\nThis arrangement is expected to see racks hitting 600 kW of power, up from the maximum of about 125 kW today, to support configurations using Nvidia's Rubin Ultra, expected to arrive in late 2027.\n\nGoogle also mentions a \"sidecar\" in its plans for 1 MW kit, as a dedicated AC-to-DC power rack that feeds power to the other racks.\n\nAs power demand rises, the power supply unit (PSU) within the rack will need to handle more power, with 8 kW units available now. There will also be a transition to a three-phase design to move from a 12 kW unit to 16 kW or above, which is expected to happen next year. This transition will see greater use of components made with silicon carbide and gallium nitride (GaN), according to Infineon.\n\nFinally, the increasing density of the AI accelerators themselves and the amount of power all those transistors guzzle is starting to have an impact at the chip level.\n\nThe voltage regulator modules (VRMs) are currently discrete packages that sit alongside the accelerator chip package (GPU, ASIC or TPU) on the system board, but as the current to the chip rises, parasitic losses also increase, wasting energy.\n\n\"Some of the industry has already recognized that and started to move to what we call BVM, or back-side vertical power module,\" White said. This moves the VRMs to the other side of the system board, below the accelerator chip package, and simplifies the board layout as well as reducing overall power delivery network losses.\n\nUltimately, the industry would like to get to the point where the VRM moves inside the chip package and is embedded in the substrate directly beneath the chip, but this is a development set for beyond 2027, according to Infineon. ®",

    "description": "It's been a hot year for healthcare venture investment. Backers said they expect investments in AI cost savings in 2026, plus more M&A — but not IPOs.",
    "fullText": "It's been a hot year for healthcare deals — but some investors are predicting a shift in which startups will capture VC attention next year.\n\n2025 saw a welcome surge in healthcare venture funding as investors rushed to back top AI startups. Last December, VCs predicted huge funding rounds for AI scribe startups like Abridge and Ambience Healthcare; indeed, both Abridge and Ambience landed hundreds of millions of dollars in venture funding this year.\n\nInvestors also said in December 2024 that they anticipated a race for those startups to expand beyond AI health scribing into other product lines, like medical coding and billing. That pressure intensified in August, when medical records giant Epic announced it was releasing its own AI tools, including for clinical documentation, in competition with its closest startup partner Abridge.\n\nWith Epic in the mix and tech giants like OpenAI working on their own healthcare AI plays, VCs told Business Insider that they're expecting different profiles of healthcare startups to grab funding next year as companies focus on cost savings, securing patient and provider trust, and ensuring high-quality data.\n\n\"AI has diffused nicely for passive listening in clinical settings, and administrative simplification,\" said Dan Mendelson, the CEO of Morgan Health, JPMorgan's healthcare investing arm. \"AI now needs to show savings to payers by helping consumers make good choices and reducing the burden on clinicians.\"\n\nInvestors are also watching for more healthcare exits in 2026. Two venture-backed digital health companies went public this year: Hinge Health in May, and Omada Health in June. VCs weren't optimistic that 2026 would bring a deluge of new public healthcare companies, but they're looking forward to what many said should be an active year for healthcare M&A.\n\nThis year, investment surged for AI startups tackling administrative burdens for large health systems. AI scribe startups Abridge and Ambience Healthcare notched $5.3 billion and $1.25 billion valuations, respectively, while AI-powered medical knowledge platform OpenEvidence hit a $6 billion valuation with its own raise.\n\nMany such startups have expanded into coding and billing to help hospitals capture more revenue from health insurers. But in 2026, insurers could use AI to fight back, said Todd Cozzens, cofounder and managing partner of Transformation Capital.\n\nCozzens said that many insurers have already partnered with large organizations such as Palantir and Anthropic on custom AI solutions. Next year, he expects those payers to contract with more specialized AI platforms trained on complex clinical data, like providers are already doing.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game in the end, but like with the nuclear weapons arms race, a lot of money is going to be spent here, and doing nothing is no longer an option for either side of the battle,\" he said.\n\nSeveral VCs suggested that the next wave of healthcare investment will go toward business models that prioritize higher-quality AI behind the scenes.\n\nSapphire Ventures partner Cathy Gao predicted a conscious shift away from \"black box\" AI models in high-stakes industries like healthcare, calling them \"uninvestable.\"\n\n\"The next healthcare unicorns will be 'glass box' platforms where the core product is the digital paper trail,\" she said. \"Any engineering team can build an AI that fills out a medical form. The real opportunity is building the governance layer that proves why the AI made that decision.\"\n\nLiam Donohue, cofounder and managing partner at .406 Ventures, said his firm has also been investing in companies focused on AI decision transparency and data quality.\n\n\"One of the obstacles that needs to be hurdled for AI to be more widely used in enterprise settings is absolutely the ability to go back to the source of why some process happened or why a decision was made. And there's a lot of infrastructure being built to do that,\" he said.\n\nAs insurers cut reimbursement rates for key services, investors are also expecting a surge in business models that prioritize lower-cost care settings and eschew point solutions, paired with AI to reduce administrative spend.\n\nNorwest partner Irem Rami said she expects a boost for in-home care models that incorporate AI agents. Mercedes Bent, cofounder and partner at Premise VC, is watching healthcare startups that aim to support patients across a chosen specialty, like women's health tech that assists patients from fertility tracking through conception.\n\nTech startups that actually provide healthcare have somewhat fallen out of favor with VCs in recent years. The costs of employing providers or running brick-and-mortar clinics can make it tough for those businesses to deliver venture-style returns.\n\nBut in 2026, according to 7wireVentures partner Alyssa Jaffee, \"tech-enabled services is coming back, baby.\"\n\nAfter 2021's venture boom and the subsequent funding drought, some tech-enabled services companies struggled to maintain their growth or hit their next milestone on slim margins, especially at earlier stages, Jaffee said.\n\nBut many startups that have made it to the other side have stronger businesses as a result, including durable relationships with key customers like health plans, she said.\n\nShe also pointed to Hinge Health and Omada Health's successful IPOs; both companies are tech-enabled service providers that sell to employers and health plans.\n\n\"We have a number of those companies in our portfolio that have really hit their stride. It's just a meatier business, and I think we're going to get a lot of interest from later-stage investors coming in to support those kinds of companies,\" Jaffee said.\n\nNorthzone partner Wendy Xiao said that she's now seeing some employers try out a few different tech-enabled services solutions in a given category, such as GLP-1 management, and test them against one another.\n\nContracting with multiple companies could be a tough sell for employers who are already seeing their healthcare costs skyrocket. But Xiao said many of these startups are paid a portion of the money they save employers — a model that dramatically lowers employers' financial exposure.\n\nThere are a few healthcare companies that could be eyeing the exits next year. Virta Health has publicly said it expects to be IPO-ready in 2026. And Business Insider previously reported that two private-equity-backed healthtech companies, Zelis Healthcare and Ensemble Health, have been in talks with bankers about potential IPOs.\n\nStill, no reports have emerged of venture-backed healthcare startups filing their S-1s. By this time last year, Hinge Health and Omada Health were already deep into their IPO preparations.\n\nWhile Xiao thinks a handful of healthtech startups are waiting for their debuts, she's not confident they'll take the plunge before the second half of 2026.\n\n\"I think they'll probably go out in a similar timeframe of, if not late next year, then the year after. There seems to be a lot of momentum pent up around IPO readiness at the organizational level over the past few years. I think a lot of these companies are in pretty good shape in terms of that, and they're just waiting for one of the larger ones to go out,\" Xiao said.\n\nMichael Greeley, the cofounder and general partner at Flare Capital Partners, agreed that the new year is unlikely to bring a steady stream of new healthcare IPOs. But he's anticipating more M&A activity as interest rates come down and private equity buyers look for healthcare AI acquisitions in the VC world.\n\n\"A lot of us are still sitting on a lot of unrealized gains, and the obsession is going to be heightened around liquidity,\" Greeley said. \"We're seeing a lot more interest from the big buyout funds in our sector, who are going down market to buy AI assets to wrap around their legacy platform companies.\"\n\n2025 saw a few such deals. New Mountain Capital, in particular, made several AI acquisitions this year as the PE firm rolled startups onto its existing healthcare bets. Greeley also pointed to firms such as Bain Capital, TPG, Silver Lake, and KKR as potential buyers in 2026.\n\nDonohue is similarly optimistic that 2026 will bring a flurry of exit activity as more companies mull going public, selling, or merging with a competitor. In particular, he expects strategic buyers, such as health plans, to become more active in the second half of 2026.\n\n\"I actually think it'll be a good exit year. I'm seeing lots of signs of life, both within our portfolio and more broadly. There's a lot of activity percolating that you just haven't seen for the last several years,\" he said.",

    "description": "Alex Yang details founding an AI startup with other high schoolers worldwide to improve Alzheimer's diagnostics.",
    "fullText": "My typical morning starts around 3 a.m. I'm instantly met with Messenger notifications from web developers in California, GitHub pings from Florida, and a running document of research papers to read sent from Michigan. By 7:50 a.m. I'm off to class to live my life as an 18-year-old high school senior in Seoul.\n\nThis solitary ritual has become my strange normal after I founded an AI research and development startup with people all around the world, whom I've never met in person. My ambition was to improve Alzheimer's diagnostics, but I had no network, so I built one online.\n\nGrowing up, I heard stories about various family members battling Alzheimer's. I viewed the disease as something truly terrifying, which leaves behind only the shell of who someone once was.\n\nI'd grown up knowing that someday, someone I love might disappear while still standing in front of me. In high school, this fear crystallized into something beyond passive acceptance.\n\nI came across this competition, looking to fund ideas that can make health more accessible, and decided to apply.\n\nI knew I couldn't do the work alone. I had to find people beyond my network with diverse perspectives and skills capable of building something real together.\n\nI started searching for partners by spending my time on internet forums and pitching my vision. I posted detailed research proposals on Discord servers and created GitHub repositories with preliminary code.\n\nAfter a month of \"nos,\" I got one \"yes\" from California. Then Florida. Then Michigan. Until there were six of us. We named ourselves Reteena (pronounced like \"retina\"), a deliberate wordplay symbolizing our mission to bring new vision to Alzheimer's diagnostics.\n\nWe became something none of us expected: a team of high schoolers from around the world who genuinely believed we could fix Alzheimer's.\n\nI didn't set out to target only high schoolers, but I was on servers mainly for students, and those were the people who responded.\n\nWe've been self-funded and started by conducting research on enhancing the image resolution of low-field MRI, which is a portable and more economically accessible MRI machine. We applied machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance the quality of low-field MRI scans.\n\nOur goal was radical — to make Alzheimer's diagnostics accessible and affordable for underserved communities by making low-field MRI more reliable. Conducting research together, I realized that my abstract dream had become reality, but reality proved far more demanding than any dream.\n\nI staggered under the crushing weight of the time and dedication that my team was giving. The time zone difference was not an excuse for me to make them wait for responses. Lying awake at night, my stomach knotted with anxiety about \"what should I do next,\" I recognized that my wrong decision could waste months of work from people who believed in me.\n\nDuring those suffocating moments, when doubt was a physical pain in my chest, I'd question everything: my abilities, our direction, and whether I was worthy of the faith my team placed in me.\n\nGradually, my leadership improved, and doubts faded when I stopped seeing our differences as obstacles and started viewing them as strengths. I created a \"follow-the-sun\" workflow where I completed tasks before people in the states woke up, with detailed handoff documents in shared Notion workspaces. We were asynchronous, yet somehow more connected.\n\nWhen our first piece of research was published in the IEEE BigData 2024 Conference, a prestigious annual conference for artificial intelligence research, I felt exhilarated. It was proof that we were onto something and justification for every late night. Yet it was only the beginning.\n\nWe expanded from a six-person group chat into an unconventional startup with 12 members. Over the next nine months, we conducted additional Alzheimer's research and presented our findings on how changes in speech patterns and genetic markers could aid in detecting the disease earlier than traditional methods.\n\nAs people who met on the internet, we've also made our growth transparent on the internet, sharing our journey on LinkedIn. By posting our product-building journey and sharing the authentic rationale behind our research and products, we connected with mentors who believed in what we were doing — Y Combinator founders, Pear VC partners, and researchers who took us seriously despite our age.\n\nWe even started receiving messages from students across different countries asking for advice on starting their own health tech projects.\n\nMost recently, we launched our first consumer product, Remembrance, an AI therapeutic service to try to help Alzheimer's patients reconnect with their past. It works by asking gentle questions designed to trigger old memories through reminiscence therapy.\n\nEach recalled memory is automatically organized in knowledge graph databases, making it easy to revisit and build a personal memory repository. Over time, it can suggest related memories on demand, building a personalized memory archive.\n\nThe healthcare market is impenetrable in many ways. When we attempted to approach a local hospital to test our product using actual patient data, we were immediately halted by compliance requirements and institutional review boards.\n\nWe've spent two years discovering that building something in healthcare is harder than we thought. But I wouldn't change it because we learned that at 17 and 18, not at 25 when the stakes feel higher and the fear feels heavier.\n\nReteena might not end up as we imagined, but that's OK. The point was never the destination; it was about learning how to build, understanding that authentic problems matter more than viral success, and realizing you can inspire people by simply trying.\n\nThat's the real experiment. And it's worth every sleepless night.",

    "fullText": "The AI tech trade isn't over. Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\n\nTech (XLK) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle (ORCL) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave (CRWV) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nHowever, Micron Technology's (MU) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\n\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's (NVDA) results in May 2023, which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\n\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Broadcom (AVGO), and Meta (META). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.\n\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation,\" Essaye said.\" The next evolution of this trade, where there are going to be winners and losers within the Mag 7.\"\n\nHe said that his favorite stock is Alphabet because of the growth prospects for Google's Gemini artificial intelligence product.\n\n\"I think companies like Oracle that are not overextended financially, but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" he added.",

    "description": "Former Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said current and prospective CS students need to focus on skills \"with a long shelf life.\"",
    "fullText": "Yann LeCun said if computer science majors don't spend their time wisely, they may find out their degree doesn't add up.\n\n\"If you are a CS major and take the minimum required math courses for a typical CS curriculum, you might find yourself unable to adapt to major technological shifts,\" LeCun said in an email to Business Insider.\n\nLeCun, who teaches computer science at NYU, said during a recent podcast appearance that he jokes that he's \"a computer science professor arguing against studying computer science\" based on his push on where students should focus their time.\n\n\"My recommendation was not to avoid CS as a major but to take the maximum number of courses on foundations (e.g. math, physics, or EE courses) rather than take courses on the trendy technology du jour,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe former chief AI scientist at Meta said his advice is that students \"learn things with a long shelf life.\" Depending on the computer science program, not all of these skills may be baked into a degree.\n\n\"What we should do is learn kind of basic things in mathematics, in modeling, mathematics that can be connected with reality,\" LeCun said on \"The Information Bottleneck\" podcast. \"You tend to learn this kind of stuff in engineering in some schools that's linked with computer science, but sort of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, et cetera.\"\n\nUniversities and computer science students continue to grapple with how to adapt their programs to the age of generative and increasingly agentic AI. Earlier this year, UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid described the struggle students face in finding jobs, compared to how graduates used to have \"the run of the place.\"\n\nLeaders in the field, including OpenAI's Bret Taylor, have stressed that computer science is about so much more than simply learning to code. Others, including Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton, have stressed that learning critical thinking is what's the key to staying ahead of AI's advancements.\n\n\"Some skills that are always going to be valuable, like knowing some math, and some statistics, and some probability theory, knowing things like linear algebra that will always be valuable,\" Hinton recently told Business Insider. \"That's not knowledge that's going to disappear.\"\n\nLeCun jokingly pointed out that he did not initially study CS. He studied electrical engineering at ESIEE in Paris before earning a Ph.D. CS from the renowned Sorbonne Université in 1987. LeCun said some CS schools are linked to engineering programs, which tend to require more advanced math.\n\n\"Engineering disciplines, you know, in the US, you learn Calculus 1, 2, 3 that gives you a good basis, right?\" he said. In computer science, you can get away with just Calculus 1. That's not enough, right?\"\n\nEngineering also exposes students to concepts like control theory and signal processing, which LeCun said are \"really useful for things like AI.\"\n\nAll of this isn't to say basic programming should be thrown out, LeCun said. Vibe coding is nice, but it's not a substitute for fundamental knowledge.\n\n\"Obviously, you need to learn enough computer science to kind of program and use computers,\" he said. \"And even though AI is going to help you be more efficient at programming, you still need to know how to do this.\"",

    "title": "Expert: EU Commission wants an \"unlimited special legal zone\" for AI",
    "description": "In a legal analysis for consumer advocates, experts warn of massive protection gaps due to the planned \"digital EU omnibus\". Big Tech is favored.",
    "fullText": "With the planned \"digital omnibus\" package, the EU Commission promises a breakthrough against bureaucracy. However, resistance to the initiative is constantly growing. Legal experts from the law firm Spirit Legal are now urgently warning in an expert opinion commissioned by the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzbv) that the draft represents a systematic break with the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and endangers the privacy of hundreds of millions of consumers.\n\nAt the center of the criticism is the planned Article 88c, which provides for special relief for data processing in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The experts Peter Hense and David Wagner warn here of an \"unlimited special legal zone\". Since the term \"AI system\" is extremely broadly defined, companies could in the future declare almost any automated data processing as AI-relevant in order to evade strict data protection rules. This would replace the technology-neutral logic of the GDPR with a technology-specific privilege that primarily benefits service providers.\n\nThe lawyers consider the planned relaxation in handling sensitive data such as health information or political views to be alarming. The draft suggests that their processing is all the more justified the larger the data volumes are. This reverses the principle of data minimization: mass data extraction is rewarded as long as it serves to train AI models. The experts see this as dangerous privileges for Big Tech corporations.\n\nThe authors also criticize that essential protective mechanisms are merely shifted to the legally non-binding recitals. One example is technical opt-out procedures with which users can object to the use of their data. Without anchoring in the binding legal text, supervisory authorities lack the means to effectively sanction violations. Especially with web scraping, data of individuals would be collected who often have no opportunity to even become aware of their right of objection.\n\nTo counteract these negative developments, the experts propose a specific legal basis for AI training. Companies should only be allowed to access personal information if they can prove that their goal cannot be achieved with anonymized or synthetic data. Furthermore, it must be ensured that AI models do not reproduce personal information in their answers (\"Data Leakage\"). Strict technical standards are therefore necessary already in the training process.\n\nA chapter is dedicated to the protection of vulnerable groups. Since minors frequently cannot grasp the implications of data processing for AI, the authors advocate for explicit parental consent. In addition, individuals reaching the age of majority should receive an unconditional right to prohibit the further use of their data in existing models. Without such guardrails, the digital sovereignty of the next-generation risks being permanently lost.\n\nAccording to vzbv board member Ramona Pop, the political dimension of these findings is enormous. She warns that the Commission, under the guise of innovation, primarily wants to issue a free pass to US platforms. Big Tech could easily exploit legal grey areas, while European companies and consumers would be left behind. True legal certainty can only be achieved through clear rules. Brussels, on the other hand, is proposing vague exceptions that would have to be judicially clarified over years.\n\nCurrent results of a representative online survey for the vzbv demonstrate that data protection is not a hindrance but an economic factor. According to the survey, trust is the fundamental prerequisite for using digital services for 87 percent of consumers. The GDPR serves as an important anchor: over 60 percent of respondents are more likely to trust companies if they demonstrably comply with European regulations. A dilution of these standards thus also risks the social acceptance of new technologies.\n\nThe Digital Omnibus will now be discussed in the EU Council and Parliament. The objections from civil society can hardly be ignored. The package is suspected of being primarily the result of massive pressure from the US government, rather than representing European citizen and economic interests. The rights of data subjects are being weakened under the guise of \"simplifications,\" it is said. The Commission wants to issue AI companies a blank check to extract European data.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "fullText": "THIBODAUX, La. (AP) — The teasing was relentless. Nude images of a 13-year-old girl and her friends, generated by artificial intelligence, were circulating on social media and had become the talk of a Louisiana middle school.\n\nThe girls begged for help, first from a school guidance counselor and then from a sheriff’s deputy assigned to their school. But the images were shared on Snapchat, an app that deletes messages seconds after they’re viewed, and the adults couldn’t find them. The principal had doubts they even existed.\n\nAmong the kids, the pictures were still spreading. When the 13-year-old girl stepped onto the Lafourche Parish school bus at the end of the day, a classmate was showing one of them to a friend.\n\n“That’s when I got angry,” the eighth grader recalled at her discipline hearing.\n\nFed up, she attacked a boy on the bus, inviting others to join her. She was kicked out of Sixth Ward Middle School for more than 10 weeks and sent to an alternative school. She said the boy whom she and her friends suspected of creating the images wasn’t sent to that alternative school with her. The 13-year-old girl’s attorneys allege he avoided school discipline altogether.\n\nWhen the sheriff's department looked into the case, they took the opposite actions. They charged two of the boys who'd been accused of sharing explicit images — and not the girl.\n\nThe Louisiana episode highlights the nightmarish potential of AI deepfakes. They can, and do, upend children's lives — at school, and at home. And while schools are working to address artificial intelligence in classroom instruction, they often have done little to prepare for what the new tech means for cyberbullying and harassment.\n\nOnce again, as kids increasingly use new tech to hurt one another, adults are behind the curve, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University focused on emerging technology.\n\n“When we ignore the digital harm, the only moment that becomes visible is when the victim finally breaks,” Alexander said.\n\nIn Lafourche Parish, the school district followed all its protocols for reporting misconduct, Superintendent Jarod Martin said in a statement. He said a “one-sided story” had been presented of the case that fails to illustrate its \"totality and complex nature.”\n\nA girl’s nightmare begins with rumors\n\nAfter hearing rumors about the nude images, the 13-year-old said she marched with two friends — one nearly in tears — to the guidance counselor around 7 a.m. on Aug. 26. The Associated Press isn’t naming her because she is a minor and because AP doesn’t normally name victims of sexual crimes.\n\nShe was there for moral support, not initially realizing there were images of her, too, according to testimony at her school disciplinary hearing.\n\nUltimately, the weeks-long investigation at the school in Thibodaux, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, uncovered AI-generated nude images of eight female middle school students and two adults, the district and sheriff's office said in a joint statement.\n\n“Full nudes with her face put on them” is how the girl’s father, Joseph Daniels, described them.\n\nUntil recently, it took some technical skill to make realistic deepfakes. Technology now makes it easy to pluck a photo off social media, “nudify” it and create a viral nightmare for an unsuspecting classmate.\n\nMost schools are “just kind of burying their heads in the sand, hoping that this isn’t happening,” said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nLafourche Parish School District was just starting to develop policies on artificial intelligence. The school-level AI guidance mainly addressed academics, according to documents provided through a records request. The district also hadn’t updated its training on cyberbullying to reflect the threat of AI-generated, sexually explicit images. The curriculum its schools used was from 2018.\n\nA school investigation hits obstacles\n\nAlthough the girls at Sixth Ward Middle School hadn’t seen the images firsthand, they heard about them from boys at school. Based on those conversations, the girls accused a classmate and two students from other schools of creating and spreading the nudes on Snapchat and possibly TikTok.\n\nThe principal, Danielle Coriell, said an investigation came up cold that day as no student took responsibility. The deputy assigned to the school searched social media for the images unsuccessfully, according to a recording of the disciplinary hearing.\n\n“I was led to believe that this was just hearsay and rumors,” the girl’s father said, recounting a conversation he had that morning with the school counselor.\n\nBut the girl was miserable, and a police incident report showed more girls were reporting that they were victims, too. The 13-year-old returned to the counselor in the afternoon, asking to call her father. She said she was refused.\n\nHer father says she sent a text message that said, “Dad,” and nothing else. They didn't talk. With the mocking unrelenting, the girl texted her sister, “It’s not getting handled.”\n\nAs the school day wound down, the principal was skeptical. At the disciplinary hearing, the girl’s attorney asked why the sheriff's deputy didn’t check the phone of the boy the girls were accusing and why he was allowed on the same bus as the girl.\n\n“Kids lie a lot,” responded Coriell, the principal. “They lie about all kinds of things. They blow lots of things out of proportion on a daily basis. In 17 years, they do it all the time. So to my knowledge, at 2 o’clock when I checked again, there were no pictures.”\n\nA fight breaks out on the school bus\n\nWhen the girl stepped onto the bus 15 minutes later, the boy was showing the AI-generated images to a friend. Fake nude images of her friends were visible on the boy’s phone, the girl said, a claim backed up by a photo taken on the bus. A video from the school bus showed at least a half-dozen students circulating the images, said Martin, the superintendent, at a school board meeting.\n\n“I went the whole day with getting bullied and getting made fun of about my body,” the girl said at her hearing. When she boarded the bus, she said, anger was building up.\n\nAfter seeing the boy and his phone, she slapped him, said Coriell, the principal. The boy shrugged off the slap, a video shows.\n\nShe hit him a second time. Then, the principal said, the girl asked aloud: “Why am I the only one doing this?” Two classmates hit the boy, the principal said, before the 13-year-old climbed over a seat and punched and stomped on him.\n\nVideo of the fight was posted on Facebook. “Overwhelming social media sentiment was one of outrage and a demand that the students involved in the fight be held accountable,” the district and sheriff’s office said in their joint statement released in November.\n\nThe girl had no past disciplinary problems, but she was assigned to an alternative school as the district moved to expel her for a full semester — 89 school days.\n\nIt was on the day of the girl’s disciplinary hearing, three weeks after the fight, that the first of the boys was charged.\n\nThe student was charged with 10 counts of unlawful dissemination of images created by artificial intelligence under a new Louisiana state law, part of a wave of such legislation around the country. A second boy was charged in December with identical charges, the sheriff's department said. Neither was identified by authorities because of their ages.\n\nThe girl would face no charges because of what the sheriff’s office described as the “totality of the circumstances.”\n\nAt the disciplinary hearing, the principal refused to answer questions from the girl’s attorneys about what kind of school discipline the boy would face.\n\nThe district said in a statement that federal student privacy laws prohibit it from discussing individual students’ disciplinary records. Gregory Miller, an attorney for the girl, said he has no knowledge of any school discipline for the classmate accused of sharing the images.\n\nUltimately, the panel expelled the 13-year-old. She wept, her father said.\n\n“She just felt like she was victimized multiple times — by the pictures and by the school not believing her and by them putting her on a bus and then expelling her for her actions,” he said in an interview.\n\nThe fallout sends a student off course\n\nAfter she was sent to the alternative school, the girl started skipping meals, her father said. Unable to concentrate, she completed none of the school's online work for several days before her father got her into therapy for depression and anxiety.\n\nNobody initially noticed when she stopped doing her assignments, her father said.\n\n“She kind of got left behind,” he said.\n\nHer attorneys appealed to the school board, and another hearing was scheduled for seven weeks later.\n\nFor students who are suspended or expelled, the impact can last years. They're more likely to be suspended again. They become disconnected from their classmates, and they’re more likely to become disengaged from school. They're more likely to have lower grades and lower graduation rates.\n\n“She’s already been out of school enough,” one of the girl's attorneys, Matt Ory, told the board on Nov. 5. “She is a victim.\n\n“She,” he repeated, “is a victim.”\n\nMartin, the superintendent, countered: “Sometimes in life we can be both victims and perpetrators.”\n\nBut the board was swayed. One member, Henry Lafont, said: “There are a lot of things in that video that I don’t like. But I’m also trying to put into perspective what she went through all day.” They allowed her to return to campus immediately.

    "fullText": "The artificial intelligence boom is real — but there's more to the AI trade than chips alone, according to a credit investor.\n\n\"This is a super-duper micro cycle that will outlast many investing careers,\" said Scott Goodwin, the cofounder and managing partner of Diameter Capital Partners, a quote he attributed to his partner Jonathan Lewinsohn.\n\nAI represents what Diameter Capital sees as a long-running, disruptive cycle — but buying the most obvious winners isn't the only way to play it, he said on the \"Goldman Sachs Exchanges\" podcast published on Friday.\n\nDiameter Capital, which manages approximately $25 billion in assets, has focused on where AI demand could create less obvious bottlenecks — and where those bottlenecks show up in credit markets.\n\nThat view led Diameter to buy the unsecured debt of a midsize telecommunications company in 2023.\n\nGoodwin said the bet was rooted in the idea that as companies move from training AI models to actually using them, demand shifts away from chips alone and toward the networks that carry data.\n\n\"It had to leave the data center. How would it leave? It would leave on the commercial fiber, the pipes,\" he said.\n\nThe telco went on to sign more than $10 billion in contracts with hyperscale cloud providers, and the debt has rebounded to face value, Goodwin said.\n\nDiameter Capital also made \"a big bet\" on a satellite company tied to the wireless spectrum — a wager that later paid off after the company sold spectrum assets and the debt returned to face value.\n\nGoodwin's comments come amid growing debate over whether sky-high AI valuations are sustainable and whether investors are overlooking other opportunities tied to the technology.\n\nGoodwin warned that parts of the AI-credit boom may be taking on risk that's hard to price, especially in chip finance.\n\nSome investors, he said, are taking on \"residual risk,\" or the riskiest slice of chip-financing deals — betting on what the hardware might be worth years from now. Cutting-edge firms refresh their technology often, so chips can quickly become outdated for some customers.\n\n\"We call up really smart people in Silicon Valley, we call up really smart people at Big Tech companies and ask them what the residual value is on these chips three, four, five, six, seven years forward,\" he said. \"None of them have a clue.\"\n\nGoodwin said the next phase isn't just about spending on infrastructure — it's about competitive disruption rather than capital expenditure.\n\n\"Who are the companies, who are the entities that are going to adopt AI and take a step forward versus their peers? And who are going to be the losers?\" he asked.\n\n\"That is actually a longer cycle than the capex cycle, so that's really interesting,\" he said.",

    "title": "Embedding-Based Tool Selection for AI Agents",
    "description": "When I first built our AI assistant, it had five tools. Look up an order. Process a refund. Check ticket availability. Simple stuff.",
    "fullText": "When I first built our AI assistant, it had five tools. Look up an order. Process a refund. Check ticket availability. Simple stuff. Fast forward six months and we're at nearly 40 tools spanning orders, events, marketing campaigns, contests, and customer management.\n\nThe problem became obvious during a routine cost review: we were burning thousands of tokens on every single request just describing tools the model would never use. Someone asks \"What time does my show start?\" and we're sending the full spec for process_refund, create_email_campaign, and manage_contest_prizes. Wasteful.\n\nEach tool definition isn't trivial. You need a name, a description detailed enough for the LLM to understand when to use it, and parameter specifications with types and constraints. Here's what one looks like in our codebase:\n\nMultiply by 40 and you're looking at 3,000+ tokens before the user even says anything. The costs add up, latency increases, and here's the kicker: having too many tools actually makes the model worse at picking the right one. More noise, more confusion.\n\nThe fix is conceptually simple. Instead of sending every tool on every request, we embed all tool descriptions into vectors and store them in Postgres using pgvector. When a query comes in, we embed it too, then find the 5-10 most semantically similar tools using cosine distance.\n\nThe query \"refund order #12345\" gets embedded, compared against all tool embeddings, and returns process_refund, calculate_refund_amount, get_order_details. We send only those to the LLM.\n\nThis cuts our tool payload by 75-90% on most requests. The model sees fewer, more relevant options and picks better.\n\nWe debated two main approaches: calling OpenAI's embedding API or running our own model.\n\nOpenAI's text-embedding-3-small is the path of least resistance. It's a REST call, returns 1536-dimensional vectors, costs about a hundredth of a cent per embedding, and just works. The semantic understanding is excellent. The downside is the external dependency. Every query needs a network round-trip, your data touches their servers, and you're subject to their rate limits and outages.\n\nRunning something like ModernBERT locally is appealing for different reasons. Zero marginal cost, sub-millisecond latency since there's no network hop, and complete data privacy. But now you're managing infrastructure. You need a server running the model, monitoring, scaling considerations, and you're on the hook for model selection and updates. For a small team, that operational burden is real.\n\nThere's also a hybrid approach: use OpenAI in production for reliability, run a local model in development and testing to avoid API costs and flakiness. We built our system with a provider abstraction to make this possible:\n\nSwitching providers is a config change. The abstraction cost an extra hour upfront but buys flexibility later.\n\nFor our volume, OpenAI was the obvious choice. We process hundreds of queries daily, not millions. At $0.00001 per embedding, we're talking pennies per month. The reliability is excellent, the semantic quality is strong for our e-commerce domain, and there's zero infrastructure to manage.\n\nIf we were processing millions of queries or had strict data residency requirements, the calculus would be different. But for a small team running a ticketing platform, paying a few cents to avoid running another service is a good trade.\n\nAdding a new tool or updating an existing one means regenerating embeddings. In development, it's a mix task:\n\nThis iterates through all tool definitions, calls OpenAI for each, and upserts the results into the tool_embeddings table. Takes about 10 seconds for 40 tools. The task is idempotent so you can run it whenever.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward. We convert each ToolDefinition to embedding text that captures the name, description, and parameter info, then store the vector alongside the tool name and model ID.\n\nFor production, we built a simple admin page. Navigate to the AI operations screen, see the current embedding count, click a button to regenerate. Non-technical team members can trigger it after tool updates without touching the console.\n\nThe alternative is shelling into the production console:\n\nEither way, regeneration is safe to run anytime. It deletes existing embeddings and creates fresh ones. The whole process takes seconds.\n\nOne gotcha: if you ever switch embedding providers, you must regenerate everything. OpenAI's 1536-dimension vectors are incompatible with a local model's 768-dimension vectors. We store model_id with each embedding to catch mismatches and make debugging easier.\n\nPure similarity search has a gap. If someone says \"refund order #12345\", we'll find process_refund. But the LLM also needs get_order_details to look up the order before it can refund anything. Those two tools aren't semantically similar enough to both appear in the top results.\n\nWe solved this with category expansion. Each tool has a category like :orders, :refunds, or :events. When we select tools via similarity, we expand to include related categories:\n\nSo finding process_refund (category :refunds) automatically pulls in order lookup tools. The LLM gets everything it needs for multi-step workflows.\n\nFor those curious about the database side, here's the actual query we run:\n\nThe <=> operator is pgvector's cosine distance. We filter by a similarity threshold (0.4 by default) to avoid returning completely irrelevant tools, then take the top K results. The whole thing runs in under 10ms.\n\nWe use Mimic for mocking in tests. Every test that touches tool selection stubs the embedding provider to return consistent vectors:\n\nThis keeps tests fast, deterministic, and free of API dependencies. We can simulate failures too, testing that the system gracefully falls back to using all tools when embedding generation fails.\n\nA few things surprised us along the way.\n\nThe similarity threshold matters more than we expected. Too high and you filter out useful tools. Too low and you're back to noise. We settled on 0.4 after some experimentation but it's worth tuning for your domain.\n\nCategory expansion was an afterthought that became essential. Pure semantic similarity misses the dependencies between tools. If your assistant does multi-step operations, you need something like this.\n\nThe provider abstraction was worth it even though we haven't switched providers. It forced us to think cleanly about the interface and made testing much easier. The Mimic stubs work because there's a clear boundary to mock.\n\nCold start is a real concern. If your embeddings table is empty, you need a fallback. We log a warning and use all tools, which isn't ideal but prevents complete failure.\n\nAfter rolling this out, our per-request token usage for tool definitions dropped 60-80%. Latency improved by about 200ms since the model processes fewer tokens. Tool selection accuracy actually got slightly better because there's less noise confusing the model.\n\nThe embedding costs are negligible. We're at maybe $0.01 per day for our volume. The whole system adds a 10ms database query per request, which disappears in the noise of the LLM call.\n\nFor anyone dealing with tool explosion in their AI agents, this approach is worth considering. The implementation isn't complex, the costs are minimal, and the benefits compound as your tool count grows.",

    "fullText": "Companies may have cybersecurity teams in place, but many still aren't prepared for how AI systems actually fail, says an AI security researcher.\n\nSander Schulhoff, who wrote one of the earliest prompt engineering guides and focuses on AI system vulnerabilities, said on an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" published Sunday that many organizations lack the talent needed to understand and fix AI security risks.\n\nTraditional cybersecurity teams are trained to patch bugs and address known vulnerabilities, but AI doesn't behave that way.\n\n\"You can patch a bug, but you can't patch a brain,\" Schulhoff said, describing what he sees as a mismatch between how security teams think and how large language models fail.\n\n\"There's this disconnect about how AI works compared to classical cybersecurity,\" he added.\n\nThat gap shows up in real-world deployments. Cybersecurity professionals may review an AI system for technical flaws without asking: \"What if someone tricks the AI into doing something it shouldn't?\" said Schulhoff, who runs a prompt engineering platform and an AI red-teaming hackathon.\n\nUnlike traditional software, AI systems can be manipulated through language and indirect instructions, he added.\n\nSchulhoff said people with experience in both AI security and cybersecurity would know what to do if an AI model is tricked into generating malicious code. For example, they would run the code in a container and ensure the AI's output doesn't affect the rest of the system.\n\nThe intersection of AI security and traditional cybersecurity is where \"the security jobs of the future are,\" he added.\n\nSchulhoff also said that many AI security startups are pitching guardrails that don't offer real protection. Because AI systems can be manipulated in countless ways, claims that these tools can \"catch everything\" are misleading.\n\n\"That's a complete lie,\" he said, adding that there would be a market correction in which \"the revenue just completely dries up for these guardrails and automated red-teaming companies.\"\n\nAI security startups have been riding the wave of investor interest. Big Tech and venture capital firms have poured money into the space as companies rush to secure AI systems.\n\nIn March, Google bought cybersecurity startup Wiz for $32 billion, a deal aimed at strengthening its cloud security business.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said AI was introducing \"new risks\" at a time when multi-cloud and hybrid setups are becoming more common.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, organizations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds,\" he added.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last year that growing security concerns around AI models have helped fuel a wave of startups pitching tools to monitor, test, and secure AI systems.",

    "fullText": "When it comes to retirement planning, everyone’s got an opinion. Financial advisors push complicated portfolios, bloggers swear by extreme savings and your neighbor won’t stop talking about their real estate investments.\n\nBe Aware: Major 401(k) Change Coming in 2026 — High Earners Must Act Now\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K Per Month From Home\n\nSo I decided to cut through the noise and ask ChatGPT directly: What’s the single smartest retirement move to make in 2026?\n\nThe answer was surprisingly straightforward — and it has everything to do with timing.\n\nChatGPT’s response was clear: Maximize your tax-advantaged accounts with a Roth-first strategy while tax rates are still relatively low.\n\nThat means prioritizing Roth IRA contributions, Roth 401(k) contributions and Roth conversions over traditional pretax retirement accounts. The reason this matters so much right now comes down to one major deadline.\n\nLearn More: This ‘Boring’ Investment Could Be the Secret To Never Running Out of Retirement Income\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions expire after 2025. That means many Americans will face higher federal tax rates starting in 2026 and beyond.\n\nIf you convert money from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA before rates go up, you pay taxes at today’s lower rates. Then that money grows tax-free forever and you never pay taxes on it again — even when rates are higher.\n\nChatGPT explained that this creates a perfect opportunity. Lock in lower tax rates now by moving money into Roth accounts before the window closes. For people who expect to be in a similar or higher tax bracket in retirement, this move could save thousands of dollars over a lifetime.\n\nThe Roth-first strategy isn’t complicated, but it requires action in three areas.\n\nFirst, contribute to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) instead of the traditional versions. If your income is too high for direct Roth IRA contributions, you can use the backdoor Roth strategy by contributing to a traditional IRA and immediately converting it.\n\nSecond, consider converting some of your existing traditional IRA money to a Roth. You’ll pay taxes on the conversion amount this year, but then that money grows tax-free. The key is converting when your income is lower or tax rates are favorable — which is exactly what 2025 and early 2026 represent before rates potentially rise.\n\nThird, if you have a 401(k) with Roth options, funnel as much as possible into the Roth side. For 2025, the 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000 for people under 50 and $30,500 for those 50 and older.",

    "description": ": Lessons from COVID and tariff shocks getting Mike D's tech shop through AI-induced memory maze",
    "fullText": "Dell has predicted PC sales will be flat next year, despite the potential of the AI PC and the slow replacement of Windows 10.\n\n“We have not completed the Windows 11 transition,” COO Jeffrey Clarke said during Dell’s Q3 earnings call on Tuesday. “In fact, if you were to look at it relative to the previous OS end of support, we are 10-12 points behind at that point with Windows 11 than we were the previous generation.”\n\nClarke said that means 500 million PCs can’t run Windows 11, while the same number didn’t need an upgrade to handle Microsoft’s latest desktop OS. The COO therefore predicted the PC market will “flourish”, but then defined the word as meaning “roughly flat” sales despite Dell chalking up mid-to high single digits PC sales growth over the last year.\n\nDell can survive flat PC growth because its enterprise AI hardware portfolio is booming. The company booked orders for $12.3 billion worth of AI servers in the quarter ended October 31st, and shipped machines valued at $5.6 billion. Revenue from servers and networking kit reached $10.1 billion for the quarter, up 37 percent year-over-year.\n\n“Our five-quarter pipeline continue to grow sequentially across neo-clouds, sovereigns and enterprises, and remains multiples of our backlog, even when accounting for the robust demand we've seen,” Clarke told investors on the earnings call. “As expected, AI server profitability improved sequentially,” he added.\n\nBuyers are becoming more interested in traditional servers, too, often to consolidate existing fleets into denser rigs. That means more memory and storage in each system, and a challenge for Dell given the exploding price of RAM and NAND, caused by memory-makers shifting production to the high-margin products needed to support AI workloads and reducing manufacturing capacity for more anodyne kit.\n\nClarke said Dell will do “everything we can to minimize the impact,” drawing on extreme supply chain management skills learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and in more recent months coping with Trump administration’s rapidly shifting tariff policies.\n\n“Our model gives us tremendous flexibility, whether that is to reprice, how we set out quotes, whether that's to reconfigure, redirect to different products, the ability to determine how long price will be in effect, the ability to understand where we're going to drive demand to and change our demand generation vehicles to drive that,” Clarke said.\n\nDell reported $27 billion of revenue in the quarter, an eleven percent year-over-year jump, and told investors to expect $31.5 billion in Q4 and $111.7 billion in FY 2026, jumps of 32 percent and 17 percent respectively.\n\nThe company thinks servers will be a big part of that improvement, because 70 percent of its customers run 14th generation servers or even older machines. Dell’s current machines are its 17th generation and each one replaces between three and seven older machines – and has a higher average selling price due to the aforementioned increase in memory and storage.\n\nBuyers looking to modernize their servers therefore need Dell to successfully exercise its self-professed supply chain skills, or revisit their budgets. ®",

    "fullText": "Researchers warn generative tools are helping militant groups from neo-Nazis to the Islamic State spread ideology\n\nWhile the artificial intelligence boom is upending sections of the music industry, voice generating bots are also becoming a boon to another unlikely corner of the internet: extremist movements that are using them to recreate the voices and speeches of major figures in their milieu, and experts say it is helping them grow.\n\n“The adoption of AI-enabled translation by terrorists and extremists marks a significant evolution in digital propaganda strategies,” said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center. Webber specializes in monitoring the online tools of terrorist groups and extremists around the world.\n\n“Earlier methods relied on human translators or rudimentary machine translation, often limited by language fidelity and stylistic nuance,” he said. “Now, with the rise of advanced generative AI tools, these groups are able to produce seamless, contextually accurate translations that preserve tone, emotion, and ideological intensity across multiple languages.”\n\nOn the neo-Nazi far-right, adoption of AI-voice cloning software has already become particularly prolific, with several English-language versions of Adolf Hitler’s speeches garnering tens of millions of streams across X, Instagram, TikTok, and other apps.\n\nAccording to a recent research post by the Global Network on Extremism and Technology (GNet), extremist content creators have turned to voice cloning services, specifically ElevenLabs, and feed them archival speeches from the era of the Third Reich, which are then processed into mimicking Hitler in English.\n\nNeo-Nazi accelerationists, the kinds who plot acts of terrorism against western governments to provoke a societal collapse, have also turned to these tools to spread more updated versions of their hyper-violent messaging. For example, Siege, an insurgency manual written by American neo-Nazi and proscribed terrorist James Mason that became the veritable bible to organizations like the Base and the now-defunct Atomwaffen Division, was transformed into an audiobook in late November.\n\n“For the last several months I have been involved in making an audiobook of Siege by James Mason,” said a prominent neo-Nazi influencer with a heavy presence on X and Telegram, who stitched together the audiobook with the help of AI tools.\n\n“Using a custom voice model of Mason, I re-created every newsletter and most of the attached newspaper clippings as in the original published newsletters.”\n\nThe influencer lauded the power of having Mason’s writing from “pre-internet America” and turning it into a modern-day voice.\n\n“But to hear the startling accuracy of predictions made through the early eighties really puts a milestone on the road and it changed my view of our shared cause on a fundamental level,” he said.\n\nAt its height in 2020, the Base held a book club on Siege, which was an instrumental influence on several members who discussed its benefits in a hypothetical war against the US government. A nationwide FBI counterterrorism probe eventually swept up over a dozen of its members on various terrorism related charges in the same year.\n\n“The creator of the audiobook has previously released similar AI content; however, Siege has a more notorious history,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, “due to its cultlike status among some in the online extreme right, promotion of lone actor violence, and being required reading by several neo-Nazi groups that openly endorse terrorism and whose members have committed violent criminal acts”.\n\nWebber says pro-Islamic State media outlets on encrypted networks are currently and actively “using AI to create text-to-speech renditions of ideological content from official publications”, to supercharge the spread of their messaging by transforming “text-based propaganda into engaging multimedia narratives”.\n\nJihadist terrorist groups have found utility in AI for translations of extremist teachings from Arabic into easily digestible, multilingual content. In the past, American-imam turned al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki, would personally have to voice English lectures for recruitment propaganda in the anglosphere. The CIA and FBI have repeatedly cited the influence of al-Awlaki’s voice as a key contagion in the spread of al-Qaeda’s message.\n\nOn Rocket.Chat – the preferred communications platform of the Islamic State, which it uses to communicate with its followers and recruits – a user posted a video clip in October with slick graphics and Japanese subtitling, remarking on the difficulties of doing that without the advent of AI.\n\n“Japanese would be an extremely hard language to translate from its original state to English while keeping its eloquence,” said the pro-Islamic State user. “It should be known that I do not use artificial intelligence for any related media, with some exceptions regarding audio.”\n\nSo far, not just the Islamic State, but groups across the ideological spectrum, have begun using free AI applications, namely OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to amplify their overall activities. The Base and adjacent groups have used it for the creation of imagery, while also acknowledging, as far back as 2023, the use of these tools to streamline planning and researching.\n\nCounterterrorism authorities have always viewed the internet and technological advancements as a persistent game of catch-up when it comes to keeping pace with the terror groups who exploit them. Already the Base, the Islamic State and other extremists have leveraged emergent technologies like crypto to anonymously fundraise and share files for 3D printed firearms.",

    "description": "When Will.i.am’s not writing hit songs like “OMG” for Usher, he’s looking for the next big pop star on The Voice U.K., or running his new AI company, FYI.",
    "fullText": "Orianna Rosa Royle is the Success associate editor at Fortune, overseeing careers, leadership, and company culture coverage. She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs.\n\nWill.i.am is busy. When he’s not writing hit songs like “OMG” for Usher, he’s looking for the next big pop star on The Voice UK, or running his new AI company, FYI. So how exactly does he balance it all?\n\nThe Grammy Award–winning artist turned tech entrepreneur revealed to Fortune that he maxes out the 5-to-9 after the daily grind of his 9-to-5, and he advises Gen Zers to forget about work-life balance if they want to emulate his success.\n\n“If you’re trying to build something that doesn’t exist, it’s about dream-reality balance,” he says. “Work-life balance means that you’re working for somebody else’s dream. You just have a job supporting somebody else’s dream, and you want to balance your work and your life.\n\n“But if it’s dream-reality balance, then it’s not work. It’s a dream that you’re trying to put into reality, and you’re ignoring your current reality.”\n\nFor example, after working on his tech venture from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Will.i.am says that he goes back to work on his creative business until 9 p.m. But before his AI company was a reality, his day was flipped. He’d work on music first before dipping into his tech side hustle well into the evening.\n\nIt’s why he advises young people to reframe how they think of their time off work and their current 9-to-5 reality.\n\n“I’m not really paying attention to this reality,” he explains. “I’m trying to bring that one [a new business venture or idea] here and focusing on how do I get people who believe in this dream to help me materialize it? So for that, you have to make some type of sacrifice to bring this thing that doesn’t exist here.\n\n“From that perspective, work-life balance is not for the architects that are pulling visions into reality. Those words don’t compute to the mindset of the materializers.”\n\nOf course, many young people already put in hours to their side hustles and personal development after work. Millions of Gen Zers and millennials are tuning into people’s 5-to-9 evening routines on TikTok.\n\nBut Will.i.am says chipping away at your dream when most people are off work extends to weekends, birthdays, and holidays.\n\n“I didn’t party. I was always a square, meaning, ‘You work too much, man, let’s go out.’ Like what? Go out. I don’t want to go out. I just always worked,” the rapper says. “It’s your birthday what are you gonna do? Work. You ain’t gonna celebrate?”\n\nThe multimillionaire says he’s always saved the celebrating for the stage, where he can finally enjoy the fruits of his labor.\n\n“There’s nothing that’s ever gonna feel that glorious than when you’re actually at a festival. But how do you get to headline a festival? You’ve got to work. My friends would go out and party, hanging out with chicks, doing drugs, drinking. I was just in the studio working, writing songs.”\n\nTo this day, he says that he hasn’t gone out and celebrated a birthday—including his most recent one, which was just last week on March 15.\n\n“Like on Christmas for the past 12 years: I could celebrate Christmas with my family, and then on the 26th, I fly to China because that’s dream maker heaven. Anything you want to make is there.”\n\nWill.i.am was speaking to Fortune in Rome for the rollout of Raidio.FYI radios in Mercedes-Benz cars.\n\n7 a.m.: Will.i.am is not a part of the CEO-approved 5 a.m. club. Instead, he told Fortune he wakes up at around 7 a.m., and he sticks to this routine whether he’s living in L.A. or London.\n\n8 a.m.: “I walk, do my calls, and get to work,” he says, with the aim to start work at 9 a.m.\n\n9 a.m. to 5 p.m.: “I get a lot done from nine to 12, do my little lunch, then back to work at one, finish at five, and that’s all my tech, like entrepreneurial activities.”\n\n5 p.m. to 9 p.m.: “The night hours are creativity,” he says, adding that specifically between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. is when he gets the best ideas. “That’s the juicy bits, [when] I’m freaking soaking in emotion, to where I just rinse it out in the phone.”\n\n9 p.m. onward: When Will.i.am was in his late twenties, he says going to sleep at 4 a.m. (and waking up at noon) was the norm. But now, at 50 and balancing both his tech and music ventures, he starts unwinding for bed after 9 p.m. and is asleep by 11 p.m.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 23, 2025.",

    "title": "I applied for 900 jobs after being laid off at 62. AI made the search even harder.",
    "description": "After being made redundant, Jim Herrington's job hunt revealed how AI and ageism are reshaping the modern hiring process.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Jim Herrington, 62, from Suffolk, UK. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was made redundant from my electronics marketing job in 2024 after the company downsized, the last thing I expected was that I would end up applying for 900 jobs before finally landing a new one.\n\nI put everything I had into my job search. I created tailored résumés, cover letters, and even presentations for individual roles — without using AI — and contacted employers directly, while also attending physical events to meet new contacts.\n\nI treated each day like a workday — often starting at 8 a.m. to search through job boards, then methodically selecting which roles to apply for based on relevance, industry, and location. I even sent my résumé to some trusted peers for feedback and refinement. I was also open about being happy to commute to an office up to an hour from where I live - in my early career, I would drive thousands of miles a year for work.\n\nThroughout this entire process, my motivation and confidence took a significant hit, particularly due to the frustration of conflicting feedback. Some bosses wanted experience in their industry, while others were open to people from other fields. Some were open to senior marketers, yet others told me I was overqualified.\n\nThe feedback that I often got was, \"You'd be bored in this job\", but given my age, I think they were trying to say that they thought I was too old, rather than value my 40-plus years of experience, the awards I've won, and the teaching work I've done.\n\nWhile AI may be helping companies streamline their recruitment processes, I believe it's actually causing more problems. Getting all the right buzzwords into your résumé and cover letter to get past AI screening tests seems to have become more important than whether someone is actually a good fit.\n\nNow, with some companies even starting to use AI video interviews, that's only going to add to that mistrust and cause employers to ruin their reputation among candidates. Because if a business hasn't got the time or courtesy to speak to me themselves, then I'm just not interested.\n\nIn an interview, there would be so much that an AI could not possibly experience. To me, it shows a total lack of respect for the candidate who has taken the time and energy to apply.\n\nBut the problem is more complex than simply a tough market or lazy applicants who are using AI. In my experience, many employers simply lack clarity in what they're looking for.\n\nWhen they don't list exactly what they are looking for, it's very difficult. If they want experience, then they need to say it. If you're looking for somebody who can bring fresh ideas and a new approach, then they need to say it. It is especially unhelpful when salaries aren't listed.\n\nInstead of applying for 900 jobs, I could have applied for 100, because I would have known with 800 of them that I would have been wasting a lot of effort, as I would have had a better sense that I was overqualified for most of them. But a lot of job specs weren't written properly and didn't show everything they were looking for.\n\nFinally, in December 2024, I was appointed as marketing director of Omega Diagnostics, a health testing company. They called me the day after I applied and said, \"Wow, you have a great résumé. Can we talk to you?\"\n\nWhen you do 900 job applications, you start to question yourself, and you think, \"Am I actually that good?\" And you build up resilience.\n\nFor them, my seniority was a significant advantage, but they also appreciated the fact that I had been successful in other industries and could bring a fresh perspective.\n\nSo, finally, it has turned out well. I'm well paid. It's relatively local. It's an industry where there is a lot of change and a lot of activity. It's an industry that actually has a positive outcome on people's lives. I'm really happy that I can personally recommend something that I'm doing for work that will make a difference.",

    "description": "Danny Moses, one of the traders featured in \"The Big Short,\" thinks the AI bubble is real. He shares advice on how to avoid getting burned.",
    "fullText": "Since Michael Burry launched a Substack in November, he's been sharing plenty of investing insight, but he isn't the only \"Big Short\" trader who has something to say about the current market landscape.\n\nDanny Moses, the former member of FrontPoint Partners, the firm led by Steve Eisman that successfully bet against the housing market in 2008, spoke to Business Insider about the potential problems he sees developing in the AI market and how he thinks investors should navigate the rapidly evolving space.\n\nAs the AI boom has unfolded, many finance pros have weighed two primary questions: Is there a bubble in the AI market, and if so, should it be compared to the dot-com era of the early 2000s?\n\nMoses thinks the answer to both questions is yes. While he doesn't deny that the AI trade is real and a secular growth story, he also sees strong parallels between the two tech crazes that suggest investors need to tread cautiously.\n\n\"The growth was real, but the math didn't work,\" he said. \"And I think that we're reaching a point where the math is starting not to work.\"\n\nMoses emphasized that his take on potential AI market problems isn't a call to short the industry. Rather, he noted it's a call for investors to do their homework and find the right names to gain valuable exposure as the market continues to grow.\n\nIn his view, that means sticking with the tech sector's most dominant names that have the resources to continue scaling and aren't bound by the same constraints that some smaller companies are. The best examples include Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\"They can turn down their capex at any point, and they're still cash flowing positive, as opposed to these other companies, which are dependent upon that spending within AI,\" he said.\n\nMoses isn't bullish on all of Big Tech's top names, though. He cited Oracle as an example of problems within the AI market, noting the company's high debt levels and the cash that it will require the fulfill the orders from tech clients. He also highlighted volatile tech stocks Super Micro Computer and CoreWeave as examples of riskier plays within the AI trade.\n\nIn his view, though, investors are finally starting to account for the fact that not all AI stocks are created equal as the divide between relative outperformers and underperformers becomes increasingly hard to ignore.\n\n\"I think it's proof that investors are beginning to sort out the winners and losers of the trade, and they'd much rather have comfort and other businesses with stronger balance sheets to fall back upon to express the AI theme,\" Moses added.\n\nHe also said that he's bullish on uranium, as the metal is being increasingly touted as a key component of the AI buildout that will be necessary to sustain the industry in the coming years.\n\nThat said, he thinks the timeline for when it will start to spur growth is one that investors should be paying close attention to, as it is sometimes misunderstood amid the AI hype.\n\n\"One of the trades that I like is uranium, which thematically, should work, but it takes a long period of time,\" Moses said. \"There's a mismatch in the timing of how people think that companies will experience AI growth and actually the infrastructure that it's going to take to power it.\"",

    "description": "Collibra CEO Felix Van de Maele said it's \"a red flag\" if prospective employees aren't leaning into how they can use AI to make their job better.",
    "fullText": "Collibra CEO Felix Van de Maele said it becomes \"a red flag\" if job seekers wanting to join his data governance platform cannot show familiarity with AI.\n\n\"In any interview, you expect people to think AI first in all the ways they do their job,\" Van de Maele said in an interview with Business Insider. \"And so if we ask for that and people haven't used or experimented with AI tools, they don't have a sense of how they do their job better, faster using AI, that definitely becomes a bit of a red flag.\"\n\nFounded in 2008 in Belgium, Collibra is among the top names in the data governance sector. In 2021, the private company was valued at $5.2 billion. Collibra has worked with McDonald's, Credit Suisse, Adobe, and Heineken.\n\nVan de Maele said the precise AI skills he's looking for vary by position. For example, he said, if he's interviewing an engineer, he wants to know if they are using AI agents like Cursor.\n\n\"I think you can ask questions to get a sense of how are people actually using those tools and what kind of experience have they had,\" he said. \"I think that's really important. Do they have an interest and are they leaning into wanting to use those tools, or are they more defensive and taking a step back on the adoption of those tools?\"\n\nVan de Maele said that at Collibra, which he described as sort of like \"ServiceNow for data,\" AI adoption has increased drastically over the past year. His roughly 1,000 employees around the world use AI for everything from transcribing meetings to building custom agents and assistants. The goal is to push AI usage to change how work is done.\n\nIn the enterprise marketplace, Van de Maele said he sees the ideal niche for his company as an independent layer that can connect a large amount of company-specific data, unlocking the true capabilities of AI, particularly the promise of AI agents.\n\n\"Imagine you're hiring a senior new person and in your organization and ask them to do certain analysis,\" he said.\n\nIt's challenging for humans to navigate all the hoops required to access what they need and understand how companies organize their data. In an agentic AI future, an agent could find themselves stuck in a similar situation.\n\n\"If a human can't do it, the agent can't do it unless you make that context formal and you capture that context so the agent can use that,\" Van de Maele said.\n\nMaking sure customers get a tailored experience is why Palantir helped popularize the use of forward-deployed engineers. OpenAI and other model makers are following suit with their own teams. The current issue with enterprise AI, Van de Maele said, is that if a company is tied to just a single model they could easily fall behind.\n\n\"If I'm a big bank, if I'm a big organization, I don't want to be completely tied to one model vendor because who knows, maybe next month there's another model that's five times better or five times cheaper,\" he said. \"I want to have the flexibility to change. That's strategically important to me.\"",

    "fullText": "Steps to help combat fraud in which criminals use AI-generated replica of a person’s voice to deceive victims\n\nThe voicemail from your son is alarming. He has just been in a car accident and is highly stressed. He needs money urgently, although it is not clear why, and he gives you some bank details for a transfer.\n\nYou consider yourself wise to other scams, and have ignored texts claiming to be from him and asking for cash. But you can hear his voice and he is clearly in trouble.\n\nHowever, the voicemail is the latest way in which criminals are using technology to defraud people. By taking a tiny snippet of real audio – just three seconds is enough – from a person, they can “clone” the individual’s voice using freely available AI technology. From there, they can make an recording of the synthesised voice saying exactly what they want.\n\nThe criminals can record a voice from videos on social media or by calling someone and saying nothing. A victim just needs to respond with words such as “hello, who is there?” to give them material for their hoax.\n\nOliver Devane, a senior researcher at the online security company McAfee, says this is a sophisticated example of spear phishing, or a personalised, targeted attack.\n\n“Having tested some of the free and paid AI voice cloning tools online, we found in one instance, that just three seconds of audio was needed to produce a good match,” he says.\n\n“Cybercriminals will often source this information from public social media profiles and other places online where people post about themselves, their families, their travels, and so on in an attempt to cash in.\n\n“The cybercriminal is betting on a loved one or family member becoming worried, letting emotions take over, and sending money to help.”\n\nA phone call or a voicemail, or even a voice note, will come through on your mobile and sound exactly like a loved one or friend.\n\nThey will have been involved in an accident or they may have been robbed or injured. They will be distressed and there will be a sense of urgency.\n\nWhatever the circumstances, they will ask for money. They may not give details of why they need the money but they will say it is urgent. They may ask you to transfer it to an account that belongs to someone else.\n\nAs with many scams, if you get a call or voicemail that asks for money, take a moment to stop and think. Does it really sound like the person you know? Are there strange speech patterns that are not accounted for by the fact that there is an emergency.\n\nEven if the phone number comes up as coming from one of your children, this is no assurance as the number can also be faked.\n\n“Try to remain level-headed and pause before you take any next steps,” says Devane. “Remember that cybercriminals are betting on emotions running high. They will play on your connection to the loved one and create a sense of urgency to prompt you into action.”\n\nCall the person who it seems left the message. They may pick up and be able to reassure you that they are OK. Remember the message has come by phone, so even if there is a real emergency they clearly can reach their device and get a signal.\n\nTo prepare for the possibility of such scams, you can set up a codeword between you and your children so you know for sure when they are in trouble.",

    "description": "This tech giant's early entry into the AI space has helped it build a substantial revenue backlog that could propel its shares higher in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\n\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \"Magnificent Seven\" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\n\nThere is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\n\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.",

    "title": "I worked at Tesla and Waymo. Here are the leadership lessons I bring to my startup.",
    "description": "Spencer Penn worked at Tesla and Waymo before he founded LightSource, an AI-powered sourcing and procurement startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Spencer Penn, the 33-year-old founder of LightSource, who lives in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI moved to California 10 years ago, back when Tesla was a boutique car business. We were making 1,000 vehicles a week.\n\nMy friends and family were telling me it was a big career mistake to work at Tesla. They said it would never be someone's main car, that it's a tech toy, that it's an iPad with wheels on it. But I was just excited to see what this Elon guy was up to.\n\nMy interactions with Elon were always very positive, but I'm not a fanboy. There were some things that were very notable about his leadership style.\n\nTesla is a very flat organization. When I was there, even relatively young and out of college, it was two levels between Elon and me. That's very unusual to have such close proximity so early in your career.\n\nJust because it's a flat org structure, doesn't mean it's a horizontal power dynamic. Elon is the king. What he says goes. If you wanted to get something done, you really did have to go through Elon.\n\nThe drawbacks were that the guy didn't have that much time. In 2017, he was running three different companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink. He was just getting started with OpenAI. He had two and a half days a week to really focus on Tesla exclusively. You'd have to get things approved in that period of time.\n\nBut he was also very focused on the product. He would get involved in the way that things felt. If you wanted to change a texture on a paint, you'd want to get his buy-in.\n\nMany CEOs go the opposite direction. They let themselves get so far removed from the product. Elon always felt the product was the thing, and the innovation would be what drives the company forward.\n\nI like to embody that here at our company. I still do demos. If you take your hands off the wheel, things might veer in a direction you don't like.\n\nElon has a knack for setting overly ambitious goals. There are benefits and drawbacks. Sometimes, you lose credibility. Certain products like the new Roadster were unveiled back when I was an employee, and they've yet to be delivered.\n\nBut there are certain things where you shoot for the moon and you do hit the stars. Nobody thought Starlink would be as successful as quickly as it has been.\n\nIf you apply the right amount of pressure, you can see where the leaks are. That kind of ambition is everything.\n\nThat's the final thing Elon does: he's really a risk taker. He's bet the company multiple times; he always keeps putting the chips back on red. I think about that a lot. Sometimes it can be hard for professional management to take the risks they need to. Sometimes you can sleepwalk into a long-term, uncompetitive position.\n\nThere was some internal signaling. People knew that Elon was in the factory. They knew that he was going to stay there until the issues were fixed. Elon works about as hard as any human on earth possibly can.\n\nThere's a hotel right across the street from the Fremont factory. Part of me always felt like, instead of setting up pillows in a conference room, I would like our CEO to be well-rested and go to the hotel five minutes away. But the signaling was very potent.\n\nI try to embody that to some degree here, too. I like to come into the office five days a week. I want people to know that I'm coming in early and I'm staying late. I unload the dishwasher in the office. I'm assembling IKEA furniture.\n\nWaymo was a very different organization. It's a very vertical org structure. Google is a large organization with lots of levels, and that translated directly to Waymo, which is a much smaller business.\n\nEven though it's a very vertical org structure, it's a horizontal power structure. It's like it's rotated 90 degrees from Tesla.\n\nSome people compared the org to slime mold. It starts to spread and find all the crevices on its own. Individual contributors could construct their own ideas.\n\nThere are benefits and drawbacks. There is the possibility that there are duplicative teams doing the same things in different ways. But it also leads to a lot of creativity.\n\nAt Tesla, it was very clear that Elon and his lieutenants were driving a lot of the decisions. The decisions that the more junior people made would be incremental. At Google, I found that a lot of the best ideas come from the individual folks in the business, because they're given the freedom to roam.\n\nIn a startup, you have limited resources. You have to be focused, but a lot of the best ideas come from experimentation.\n\nWe had an engineer who asked if he could move his start date by a month. He was like, \"I want to spend a month before I get into work catching up on everything that's happening in AI.\" He came to the table, and he had so deeply immersed himself that he had a lot of new and fresh ideas. Many of those ideas have become product features.\n\nI have to delegate innovation to folks on the team to find those opportunities. That's something I learned from Google.",

    "description": "Several key Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Josh Hawley, have been outspoken against federal AI preemption.",
    "fullText": "Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida — a 2024 GOP primary opponent of Trump's — has been a consistent critic of federal efforts to curtail states' ability to regulate AI.\n\nAs lawmakers considered adding an AI regulation moratorium to the annual defense bill in November, DeSantis wrote on X that doing so is a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"\n\n\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment,\" DeSantis wrote. \"Denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's executive order, DeSantis said at an AI roundtable event in Florida that he was confident that it wouldn't apply to laws that the governor is pursuing in his state.\n\nBut he said that if the administration did try to challenge Florida laws, he would expect the state to prevail.\n\n\"Even reading it very broadly, I think the stuff we're doing is going to be very consistent,\" DeSantis said of the executive order. \"But irrespective, clearly we have a right to do this.\"\n\nAs Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene began to break with the president over the summer, one of the issues the Georgia Republican highlighted was AI.\n\nGreene notably admitted to voting for an initial version of the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" without realizing that it contained a provision to block state AI regulation for AI.\n\n\"I am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there,\" Greene wrote on X in June.\n\nFull transparency, I did not know about this section on pages 278-279 of the OBBB that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years.\n\nI am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in… pic.twitter.com/bip3hztSGq\n\nThe Georgia Republican re-upped her criticism when the provision was under consideration for the annual defense bill in November.\n\n\"States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state,\" Greene wrote on X. \"Federalism must be preserved.\"\n\nJust days later, Greene announced that she would resign from Congress on January 5 after Trump called her a \"traitor,\" largely over her stance on the Epstein files.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley has been one of the biggest GOP critics of the AI industry in the Senate — and he's opposed efforts to restrict states from regulating the technology.\n\n\"I would think that, just as a matter of federalism, we'd want states to be able to try out different regimes that they think will work for their state,\" Hawley told Business Insider in June. \"And I think in general, on AI, I do think we need some sensible oversight that will protect people's liberties.\"\n\nWhen the AI provision was reported to be no longer under consideration for the defense bill in November, Hawley celebrated via a post on X.\n\n\"Good. This is a terrible provision and should remain OUT,\" he wrote.\n\nIn June, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas — who served as the White House Press Secretary during Trump's first term — led a group of 17 Republican governors in opposing an AI moratorium in the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThat provision in that bill was stronger than Trump's executive order — it would have amounted to a more wholesale ban on state-level AI regulation for a period of 10 years.\n\nSanders also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post opposing the plan.\n\n\"That Congress proposes to strip away the right of any state to regulate AI is the antithesis of what our founders envisioned when they established our federal system,\" she wrote in June.\n\nIn November, as lawmakers considered adding a similar provision to the defense bill, Sanders spoke up again.\n\n\"Now isn't the time to backtrack,\" she wrote on X. \"Drop the preemption plan now and protect our kids and communities.\"\n\nGov. Spencer Cox of Utah, among the GOP governors who signed onto Sanders' letter, has also remained outspoken against efforts to limit state-level AI regulation.\n\n\"I'm very worried about any type of federal incursion into states' abilities to regulate AI,\" Cox told NPR in November.\n\nIn December, as Trump prepared to sign his executive order, Cox said there was a need for more balance.\n\n\"An alternative AI executive order focused on human flourishing would strike the balance we need: safeguard our kids, preserve our values, and strengthen American competitiveness,\" Cox wrote on X. \"States must help protect children and families while America accelerates its leadership in AI.\"",

S&P pegged 2024’s investment in the data center market at $60.8bn, just below the 2025 number.\n\n“Unable to buy, many investors are turning to new builds,” wrote Iuri Struta, an analyst for S&P Global.\n\nThere are approximately 500 data centers in the United Kingdom, compared with about 4,000 in the United States, according to Data Center Map, which tracks the facilities globally.\n\nStruta, the S&P Global analyst, said he does not see the demand for data centers slowing.\n\n“The global data center footprint is projected to expand at a faster rate over the next five years than it did in the previous five, spurred by demand for energy- and computer-intensive AI workloads,” said Struta.\n\nS&P Global’s report comes at a time when some investors worry that the entire artificial intelligence sector may be in the midst of huge overspending for unproven ongoing returns.\n\nLast week, Oracle’s shares dropped 11% after it reported lower quarterly earnings than analysts had expected, which in turn dragged the stock prices on some other major companies in AI. Some companies such as Oracle, along with Nvidia and OpenAI, have been criticized recently for making deals with one another that seem circular to many investors.\n\nEarlier this year, the International Energy Agency noted in a lengthy report that, globally, “electricity demand for data centres more than doubles by 2030”, reaching 945 terawatt hours (TWh), or just more than “Japan’s total electricity consumption today”.\n\nThis month, a trio of analysts from Deutsche Bank put out a staggering chart indicating that OpenAI alone will burn through $143bn between 2024 and 2029, the year before the company claims it will turn a profit. That chart shows how much more the ChatGPT maker, seen as a bellwether of the AI industry, plans to spend relative to other tech giants of the last two decades, including Amazon, Tesla and Uber, reached profitability.\n\n“Of course, OpenAI may continue to attract significant funding and could ultimately develop products that generate substantial profits and revolutionise the world,” Jim Reid, managing director, global head of macro research and thematic strategy at Deutsche Bank, wrote.\n\n“But at present, no startup in history has operated with losses on anything approaching this scale. We are firmly in uncharted territory.”",

    "description": "LG says it’ll let people delete the Copilot icon. But TV chatbots aren’t going away.",
    "fullText": "Online fury erupted this week after an LG TV owner claimed that a firmware update installed unremovable generative AI software on their smart TV.\n\nThe controversy began on Saturday, when a Reddit user posted about the sudden appearance of a Microsoft Copilot icon on their device (something Windows users are all too familiar with). The Reddit user claimed that a “new software update installed Copilot” onto their LG TV and that it couldn’t be deleted.\n\n“Pre-installed crap is universally dogshit. If I wanted it, I’d have installed it myself eventually. The whole reason it’s bundled is because no one would choose it… Burn your television,” another Reddit user responded in the thread, which has 36,000 upvotes as of this writing.\n\nSome news outlets covered the move this week, reporting that LG customers were upset by an “unremovable Microsoft Copilot installation” and that other LG TV owners could expect to get it the next time they update their device.\n\nLG has since admitted that it used a webOS update to force Copilot onto some of its TVs. However, the firmware update didn’t install the Copilot application but rather a shortcut to the Copilot web app, which opens in the TV’s integrated web browser, LG spokesperson Chris De Maria told The Verge. De Maria added that “features such as microphone input are activated only with the customer’s explicit consent.”\n\nLG’s spokesperson said the company added the “shortcut icon to enhance customer accessibility and convenience.” LG, like other companies, has failed to prove why people need their non-computing devices, such as computer mice or earbuds, to provide instant access to third-party chatbots.\n\nFor those annoyed about the web app shortcut, De Maria said today that LG “will take steps to allow users to delete the shortcut icon if they wish.” He didn’t provide more details.\n\nEven with LG’s concession, it may become more difficult to avoid chatbots on TVs.\n\nLG says it will let people delete the Copilot icon from their TVs soon, but it still has plans to weave the service throughout webOS. The Copilot web app rollout seems to have been a taste of LG’s bigger plans to add Copilot to some of its 2025 OLED TVs. In a January announcement, LG said Copilot will help users find stuff to watch by “allowing users to efficiently find and organize complex information using contextual cues.” LG also said Copilot would “proactively” identify potential user problems and offer “timely, effective solutions.”\n\nSome TVs from LG’s biggest rival, Samsung, have included Copilot since August. Owners of supporting 2025 TVs can speak to Copilot using their remote’s microphone. They can also access Copilot via the Tizen OS homescreen’s Apps tab or through the TVs’ Click to Search feature, which lets users press a dedicated remote button to search for content while watching live TV or Samsung TV Plus. Users can also ask the TV to make AI-generated wallpapers or provide real-time subtitle translations.\n\nCopilot similarly rolled out automatically onto supporting Samsung TVs. Users can avoid Copilot by not using the above features, and they may be able to remove the Copilot icon from their TV’s Apps section.\n\nBut Copilot will still be integrated into Tizen OS, and Samsung appears eager to push chatbots into TVs, including by launching Perplexity’s first TV app. Amazon, which released Fire TVs with Alexa+ this year, is also exploring putting chatbots into TVs.\n\nAfter the backlash LG faced this week, companies may reconsider installing AI apps on people’s smart TVs. A better use of large language models in TVs may be as behind-the-scenes tools to improve TV watching. People generally don’t buy smart TVs to make it easier to access chatbots.\n\nBut this development is still troubling for anyone who doesn’t want an AI chatbot in their TV at all.\n\nSubtle integrations of generative AI that make it easier for people to do things like figure out the name of “that movie” may have practical use, but there are reasons to be wary of chatbot-wielding TVs.\n\nChatbots add another layer of complexity to understanding how a TV tracks user activity. With a chatbot involved, smart TV owners will be subject to complicated smart TV privacy policies and terms of service, as well as the similarly verbose rules of third-party AI companies. This will make it harder for people to understand what data they’re sharing with companies, and there’s already serious concern about the boundaries smart TVs are pushing to track users, including without consent.\n\nChatbots can also contribute to smart TV bloatware. Unwanted fluff, like games, shopping shortcuts, and flashy ads, already disrupts people who just want to watch TV.\n\nLG’s Copilot web app is worthy of some grousing, but not necessarily because of the icon that users will eventually be able to delete. The more pressing issue is the TV industry’s shift toward monetizing software with user tracking and ads.\n\nIf you haven’t already, now is a good time to check out our guide to breaking free from smart TV ads and tracking.",

    "description": "London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova said that rapid AI disruption could outpace institutions and destabilize societies.",
    "fullText": "A historic labor shock may be about to hit the job market.\n\nThat's according to London Business School professor Ekaterina Abramova.\n\nShe said AI is advancing so quickly that it could trigger mass layoffs long before new jobs emerge to replace them — a mismatch that has historically fueled social unrest.\n\nAbramova, who studies technology-driven economic transitions, said the past three years of AI advances mark a sharp break from earlier waves of mechanization.\n\nIn past eras — from 18th-century textile automation to late-20th-century manufacturing decline — the impact was mostly gradual and largely contained to individual sectors, she said.\n\nBut AI is different: \"A single AI model can displace thousands of cognitive jobs across multiple industries overnight,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nAbramova expects layoffs to outstrip new job creation over the next five to 10 years, especially without aggressive retraining efforts.\n\nWhile the exact number of AI-related layoffs is unknown, several major companies have already cited AI as a reason to reduce head count or to announce job cuts.\n\nNew AI-related roles often require skills or credentials that many displaced workers lack, Abramova said, and entry-level positions — such as junior developers, analysts, and customer support staff — are already among the most vulnerable.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of Lazard and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Obama, sees a similar risk.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" this week, Orszag said that if AI delivers on its promise, there's likely to be a jobs crisis.\n\n\"Labor markets deal well with small problems that happen fast or big problems that happen slow. They do not deal well with big shocks that happen quickly,\" he said.\n\nAbramova said that the social risks extend far beyond unemployment numbers.\n\n\"History shows social strain emerges when the pace of economic change overtakes institutions' capacity to support displaced workers,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed to the UK's Enclosure Acts, which displaced tens of thousands of small farmers from common land, sparking riots and mass migration, and to the 1980s coal pit closures, which wiped out mining communities almost overnight and triggered years of strikes and political upheaval.\n\nBusiness leaders are divided over AI's impact on jobs, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Ford CEO Jim Farley warning of widespread white-collar displacement, while Elon Musk, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon, and OpenAI's Sam Altman have predicted varying outcomes, ranging from significant disruption to long-term prosperity.\n\nOthers, such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Yann LeCun — Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist — say AI will transform work rather than erase it.\n\n\"It's very likely that the companies that use AI first, that use robotics technology first, will be the most successful first, and they will end up hiring more people,\" Huang said in late October.\n\n\"You're going to lose your job not to somebody — not to a robot, you're going to lose your job to somebody who uses a robot. You're going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI,\" he added.\n\nIf governments and employers fail to prepare, Abramova said she expects widening inequality, persistent unemployment, falling consumer demand, rising political anger, and even expanding surveillance as leaders try to contain discontent.\n\nIn extreme cases, she warned, democratic norms can erode.\n\nBut she also said that the worst outcomes aren't inevitable.\n\nThe alternative is worker-augmenting AI: systems where machines handle data-intensive tasks while humans retain judgment, ethics, and client relationships. That shift will require regulatory incentives that reward firms for responsible oversight, not just rapid headcount reduction.\n\n\"Without major support,\" Orszag said, \"many displaced workers risk long-term underemployment.\"",

    "title": "From McKinsey to PwC, here's how elite consulting firms are racing to hire engineers — and train everyone else in AI",
    "description": "Business Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders about how consulting's talent recruitment is changing.",
    "fullText": "AI is pushing consultants to their biggest-ever talent overhaul.\n\nAs firms shift from slide decks and advisory work to multi-year AI-driven transformation projects, the profile of the ideal consultant at firms like Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey, and PwC is changing.\n\n\"Going to a client and purely proposing an army of consultants doesn't really work anymore,\" Gert De Geyter, a former AI lead at Deloitte US, told Business Insider.\n\nInstead of the \"pure traditional consultant,\" firms are now looking for a blend of \"generalists and technical experts,\" said De Geyter, who left the firm in July to join AI startup Teragonia.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to nine executives and industry insiders to understand how consulting firms are hiring, retraining, and redefining their workforces to meet the moment.\n\nThe work that consultants do is changing. Straight advisory projects are being replaced with building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies, requiring technology expertise over research skills.\n\nHiring data reveals how aggressively top firms have been expanding their technologist ranks. Accenture's latest annual report shows it added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global head count. EY has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nAt McKinsey, the \"AI engineer\" is the fastest-growing non-entry-level role, followed by procurement officer, data scientist, and software engineer, according to workforce intelligence company Revelio Labs.\n\nAt Boston Consulting Group, software engineers, frontend developers, and Python developers are the fastest-growing entry-level roles.\n\nBCG, which brought on 1,000 employees last year, has ramped up hiring technologists since launching its tech and AI arm, BCG X, in late 2022.\n\n\"We're essentially building a tech company inside a consulting firm,\" said Sylvain Duranton, Global Leader of BCG X. \"Our job has always been to help companies transform. But tech has become so critical to transformation that we needed to have a grip on it ourselves.\"\n\nIts regular consulting division is also adopting a more tech-centric mentality.\n\nScott Wilder, a BCG partner and managing director, told Business Insider that a new team, called \"forward deployed consultants,\" is rising through the ranks. It takes inspiration from a software engineering role popularized by Palantir, Wilder said.\n\nThese consultants are vibe-coding and building tools on client projects, he said. When one of these tools is a hit, it goes back to the R&D team and becomes a broader tool that everyone can use.\n\nFor firms like McKinsey and BCG, the must-have hire in the AI era isn't a pure engineer or a pure consultant — it's someone who can move between both worlds.\n\n\"What we want to be able to do is find those people that actually have a propensity to either be this great McKinsey consultant, and or a great technologist, and then groom them to be both,\" Alex Singla, a senior partner at McKinsey who co-leads its AI arm, QuantumBlack, told Business Insider.\n\nHe added that candidates also want hybrid roles: Many don't want to spend years building products for a cloud company like AWS, nor do they want to be traditional consultants.\n\nSingla said McKinsey is looking for \"5Xers — they're deep in one thing, but can do three or four different things well.\"\n\nQuantumBlack, with its 1,700-person team, drives all of McKinsey's AI initiatives, which account for 40% of the firm's work, but McKinsey's technical talent isn't limited to that group, Singla said. There are about 3,500 people building internal technology for McKinsey, and another 4,000 to 5,000 consultants who are leading the technical work from the business side, but don't necessarily have technical expertise.\n\nThe consulting talent landscape has been in flux since the pandemic, when a surge in demand prompted top firms to aggressively staff up. As that boom faded and demand for advisory work slowed, many firms found themselves overstaffed, triggering layoffs and a more selective approach to hiring.\n\nAmid the shifting market, the traditional pyramid model — built on large cohorts of junior consultants — started to recalibrate as firms focused on roles that deliver value over manpower. That focus has only sharpened with the rise of AI, prompting firms to invest heavily in upskilling their existing workforces.\n\n\"Everyone is reckoning with the fact that AI has exploded onto the scene,\" Saurabh Sarbaliya, PwC's AI Lead, told Business Insider.\n\n\"The demand for people who can make AI work in the enterprise is only going to grow — but there just aren't enough experts. So you have to focus on upskilling your existing workforce,\" he said.\n\nAt KPMG, Sam Gloede, the firm's global trusted AI leader, said it is prioritizing upskilling over hiring.\n\n\"There is not a massive change in our workforce,\" Gloede said. \"It's just a focus on upskilling, literacy, and learning.\"\n\nEY is taking a similar approach and prioritizing the AI capabilities of its employees, Imgard Naudin ten Cate, EY's global leader of talent acquisition, told Business Insider.\n\nIn October, EY held a two-week learning event to teach employees to build AI agents for use in their day-to-day work. The firm has also rolled out 15-hour courses on topics including AI engineering, applied AI, and AI compliance.\n\nNearly 100,000 employees — roughly a quarter of the workforce — have earned a digital \"AI badge\" for completing one of the courses, said Simon Brown, EY's global learning and development leader. The initiative has been \"a phenomenal way at scale to build deep AI knowledge,\" he added.\n\nTechnologist roles are in high demand, but don't expect a team of hoodie-wearing Silicon Valley types when your company hires consultants. Most in the industry are still generalists with strong problem-solving and communication skills — and they'll likely show up in a suit.\n\nEven as firms hire more technologists, most consulting work still doesn't require deep engineering expertise. Traditional consulting roles at top firms are still on the rise, growing from 250,000 globally in 2022 to 340,000 in 2024, according to Revelio Labs.\n\n\"A lot of the clients are still just dipping their toes in the AI pond, so over-engineering solutions for them doesn't work,\" said de Geyter, the former AI lead at Deloitte US. \"It's a lot more helpful that someone supports them with setting up the right data governance so they can get ready for AI solutions down the line.\"\n\nA senior software engineer at Deloitte, who requested anonymity as they are not permitted to speak to the media, told Business Insider that the technical literacy of most employees is improving, but remains in a \"very nascent state.\"\n\n\"They're looking less for people who know the inners of how these black box models work or could train one themselves, and more at people who can quickly leverage them for a specific solution set,\" the person said.\n\nStill, they warned that the current skill level poses a strategic risk: \"We can't let it continue for too long.\"\n\nJim Rowan, head of AI at Deloitte US, told Business Insider that its employees have \"the latest technologies and certifications to effectively work with machines and unlock even more impactful business outcomes for clients.\" Deloitte is not just hiring more data engineers and technologists, but \"actively investing\" in upskilling its workforce, Rowan said.\n\nSeveral leaders told Business Insider that soft skills are becoming more relevant now that AI can perform specific quantitative tasks.\n\n\"When we get asked a question of what we are looking for when we recruit, the core fundamental thing is actually attitude,\" Niale Cleobury, KPMG's AI workforce lead, said. Communication, collaboration, and agile learning — \"the sort of things AI can't really do\" — are the standout qualities, he said.\n\nMcKinsey is still active on college campuses recruiting undergraduates, MBAs, and PhDs, said Kate Smaje, McKinsey's global leader of technology and AI.\n\nIn its screening process, McKinsey emphasizes elements of judgment and conceptual thinking in problem-solving, resilience, and the ability to learn quickly.\n\nThe ability to build relationships and the core EQ leadership qualities can be \"fairy dust\" on top of what you can do analytically that will now set you apart, said Smaje.\n\n\"What we really hire for is voracious learners, people who are curious about the world and have the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn,\" she said. \"Those are the people we really want.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "On new years eve last year I told myself I wanted to really adopt AI. Let's talk about it.",
    "fullText": "On new years eve last year I told myself I wanted to really adopt AI. Let's talk about it.\n\nOne year ago I set a New Year's resolution for myself to be an AI optimist for 2025. Before this, I had been a bit of a skeptic, you might say, and I still am in my core. But I thought it would be an interesting perspective to go through 2025 with.\n\nIn the beginning of the year I went out hard. I wanted to use AI in every single part of my life. Personal and work. This was fun, and there were certainly some good use cases. For example, taking a photo of a whiteboard after a meeting, uploading to my Mac's Raycast chat instance, and asking an LLM to OCR what was on there. Cool, not groundbreaking.\n\nAt this point, I was still a heavy terminal and Neovim user. This is how I'd been working for the last 6 years or so. And I loved it. I created this really productive environment where I could fly through files. Going from idea to code has never really been the hard part for me. I think learning Vim and Neovim was one of the best things I've done for my career for the first 6 years. I would see colleagues of mine slowly click through an IDE with their mouse, while I would already have a draft PR out.\n\nAs the year went by, I started hearing more and more about Cursor. I tried it. Didn't like it, went back to Neovim. Then I heard more and more about Zed. Tried it, really liked it, but then went back to Neovim. I used some AI plugins for Neovim, like Copilot and gp.nvim, and it worked quite well.\n\nThen agentic editing started to surface. It was quite bad in the beginning. But after the summer of 2025, things really started accelerating. I gave Cursor another shot, and with the release of Composer 1, I found myself not going back to Neovim. When I did go back, I just cringed at the incredible latency and performance of Copilot. And not having gp.nvim actually implement the changes it suggested, but just displaying them made me realize the jump ahead Cursor had created for itself.\n\nComposer 1 and the agents panel is absolutely crazy. There's so much power here, and it can write a lot of code. Some pretty good, and some less. I really think it's great. But it's such a double edged sword.\n\nI think this is a term you've probably heard in other contexts in your life. If you can't remember, go back to your school days. Someone near you probably mentioned that when you write something down, you remember it better. I think this is interesting. Having an agent write your code and then you reviewing (i.e., reading) works. But the problem is that you won't build a mental model or deep understanding of the code.\n\nOn one hand I deeply believe in the previous paragraph. And, I want to go back to pure Neovim and write every single line of code by hand. Except boilerplate of course (this is something we all have to agree on is better with LLMs). But then I jump a few years ahead in my mind, and think about where the industry is in 10, 15, or even 20 years. I'm just 26 years old. I joined my first startup at 18 and I've been building web and mobile apps at all types of companies ever since. But where are we in 20 years? Will code even matter, or will English just be the next elevator level in the skyscraper of language abstractions?\n\nKnowing how your codebase works on a deeper level is really valuable. If a customer comes to you with a bug, you can't blame the LLM.\n\nYou know, uuhmm... I didn't actually write that code. But I'll check with the Claude.\n\nHow would you feel if a service provider you use in your company would answer something like that to a bug you report? Sure, they won't answer like that. But they'll think it. How does that feel to you? Probably not great. It doesn't bring a huge sense of trust in that company.\n\nI know there's real value in deeply understanding the code you write. Even if it's boring code at times, it's valuable. Taking ownership of what you ship to customers. After all, \"customers\" are just simple peasants like you and me. And I fucking hate when Netflix won't load half of the shows on my Samsung smart TV. You have to ask yourself what you expect from the products and services you use. And then apply those expectations to the products you build.\n\nSo, it seems like things are only going in one direction: abstractions. English to code. It kinda works. You can ship a ton. And your boss is probably happy because your team is delivering more features. Your users? Who knows. Maybe they're happy. But honestly, as a user, I don't give a hell if Netflix ships a bunch of new features. I just care about their core. If their new fancy features are all half-baked, laggy pieces of crap, I'll watch something on Apple TV instead.\n\nAnother thing that's worth reflecting on is that even though it might seem like everything is going in one direction in the insutry. It doesn't mean we have to go that route. It's not like there's just one final master goal to all of this. These are just private companies who want to sell us their services. And, you might not believe it... But we don't have to buy it.",

    "fullText": "AI stocks might look frothy, but Uber's embrace of the technology is transforming its operations and yielding huge financial benefits, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says.\n\n\"You can debate whether or not there's a bubble in terms of valuation,\" Khosrowshahi told the \"On with Kara Swisher\" podcast in an episode released Thursday. \"The spending on the data centers, etc., is massive.\"\n\nBut AI has created a lot of value for Uber, \"not in the space-age stuff\" but in \"very practical\" ways, he said, such as determining what's shown next to a customer on their Uber Eats app after they select a carton of oat milk.\n\nThe latest AI models are \"enormously more effective\" than previous generations, and are producing \"hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit to us,\" he added.\n\nUber's AI spend \"has been well worth it and then some,\" he said. \"We are not building the picks and shovels but we're riding on top of that spend, absolutely.\"\n\nAI stocks have soared to record highs this year, but investors such as Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" have warned tech giants are overspending on microchips and data centers in their scramble for computing power, and will fall short of their fabulous growth forecasts.\n\nKhosrowshahi described his mobility, delivery, and freight company as an \"applied AI\" business. It's harnessing the tech for everything from setting prices and payments to matching, routing, identification, and dealing with customer complaints, he said.\n\nRoughly 80% to 90% of Uber's developers now use AI tools, he said. The company no longer has to keep scores of engineers on call to fix issues, and have them spend \"hours and hours\" figuring out what's gone wrong and where, as AI agents are now \"constantly looking at all of our systems\" and helping to diagnose problems, he continued.\n\n\"And then the human can look over the shoulder of the AI agent,\" he added.\n\nKhosrowshahi said that other tech bosses might see AI making their engineers 20% or 30% more productive, and conclude they need 20% to 30% fewer engineers, but that's not his attitude.\n\n\"I just think they become superhumans,\" he said. \"So we are actually hiring more engineers because every engineer got more valuable to me.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi also touched on Uber's partnership with Waymo and other robotaxi companies, saying the driverless vehicles are proving popular.\n\n\"There's something to be said for privacy,\" he said. While he loves talking to Uber drivers and hearing their stories, it's also \"nice being alone in the car.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi predicted that once self-driving cars become proven revenue generators, Wall Street will embrace them as investments and want their cars on Uber's platform to access its customers and maximize their returns.\n\nSimilar to how private equity and private debt companies are \"financing these data centers and buying Nvidia chips, that same ecosystem is going to be buying fleets of cars,\" he said.\n\nKhosrowshahi said that Uber could play a similar role to Marriott, which primarily manages or franchises hotels instead of owning them.",

    "description": "Despite the great positive potential of AI, the AI ethics community has presented a rather gloomy picture of AI’s ethical implications. This paper examines the negativity within AI ethics through a philosophy of science lens. The prevailing negativity is a result of the particular way the discipline is institutionally organized, which pressures AI ethicists to portray AI in a critical light. As a consequence, the overall picture of AI offered by the AI ethics community is one-sided and negatively biased. We should be skeptical about the negative narrative promoted by AI ethics and explore ways of reforming the system.",

Larian CEO Swen Vincke recently kicked a hornet's nest after saying the studios' developers use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations. After a quick retraction and explanation, along with sharing that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking. Vincke has admitted that Larian uses AI for tasks nobody wants to do, but does AI--even at the concept art stage--help actual concept artists?\nAccording to a handful of video game concept artists, it can actually make things harder.",
