    "description": "The economics of COBOL modernization have shifted. AI makes the economics work by automating what used to require armies of consultants.",
    "fullText": "Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation.\n\nCOBOL is everywhere. It handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US. Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government.\n\nDespite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year.\n\nThe developers who built these systems retired years ago, and the institutional knowledge they carried left with them. Production code has been modified repeatedly over decades, but the documentation hasn't kept up. Meanwhile, we aren't exactly minting replacements—COBOL is taught at only a handful of universities, and finding engineers who can read it gets harder every quarter.\n\nGiven these roadblocks, how can organizations modernize their systems without losing the reliability, availability, and data they’ve accumulated over decades? And without breaking anything?\n\nCOBOL modernization differs fundamentally from typical legacy code refactoring. You aren’t just updating familiar code to use better patterns, you’re reverse engineering business logic from systems built when Nixon was president. You’re untangling dependencies that evolved over decades, and translating institutional knowledge that now exists only in the code itself.\n\nModernizing a COBOL system once required armies of consultants spending years mapping workflows. This resulted in large timelines and high costs that few were willing to take on.\n\nTools like Claude Code can automate the exploration and analysis phases that consume most of the effort in COBOL modernization. These tools can:\n\nWith AI, teams can modernize their COBOL codebase in quarters instead of years.\n\nAI excels at streamlining the tasks that once made COBOL modernization cost-prohibitive. With it, your team can focus on strategy, risk assessment, and business logic while AI automates the code analysis and implementation.\n\nAI starts by reading your entire COBOL codebase and mapping the structure.\n\nIt identifies program entry points, traces execution paths through called subroutines, maps data flows between modules, and documents dependencies that span hundreds of files.\n\nThis kind of mapping goes beyond simple call graphs. Shared data structures, file operations that create coupling between modules, initialization sequences that affect runtime behavior—these implicit dependencies don't show up in static analysis because they involve data shared through files, databases, or global state. They're also exactly what makes COBOL modernization risky, which is why automated discovery matters: it finds these hidden relationships before they cause problems during migration.\n\nWorkflow documentation also emerges out of this analysis.\n\nWith the codebase mapped, AI can assess which components are safe to move and which need careful handling. Modules with high coupling can be more risky to modernize. Isolated components surface as candidates for early, independent modernization. Duplicated logic points to refactoring opportunities. Areas with accumulated technical debt get documented before they become migration surprises.\n\nThis is where human judgment becomes essential. Your COBOL engineers bring the understanding of regulatory requirements, business priorities, operational constraints, and risk tolerance that AI cannot.\n\nThe planning phase develops a detailed roadmap that sequences modernization work strategically:\n\nCode testing and validation are also defined before any code changes:\n\nExecution happens one component at a time, with validation at each step. AI translates COBOL logic into modern languages, creates API wrappers around legacy components that stay in place, and builds the scaffolding to run old and new code side by side during transition.\n\nEach step either succeeds and gets validated, or fails and gets corrected while the scope is small.\n\nYou never have massive changes in flight where failure means rolling back weeks of work. As your team sees modernized components passing tests, they gain confidence to tackle progressively more complex parts of the system.\n\nThe approach outlined above works for COBOL systems of any size.\n\nTools like Claude Code can automate much of the exploration and analysis work described, giving your team the comprehensive understanding they need to plan and execute migrations confidently.\n\nStart with a single component or workflow that has clear boundaries and moderate complexity. Use AI to analyze and document it thoroughly, plan the modernization with your engineers, implement incrementally with testing at each step, and validate carefully.  This will build organizational confidence and surface adjustments needed for your systems.\n\nThe economics of COBOL modernization have shifted. AI makes the economics work by automating what used to require armies of consultants, freeing your engineers to make the migration decisions that require their domain expertise.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide, see the Code Modernization Playbook.\n\nProduct updates, how-tos, community spotlights, and more.

    "description": "Every AI founder I talk to is on an accelerating treadmill, burdened by a nagging suspicion that the entire industry is moving too fast in a direction that doesn't quite make sense, with no idea about how to get off.",
    "fullText": "Every AI founder I talk to is on an accelerating treadmill, burdened by a nagging suspicion that the entire industry is moving too fast in a direction that doesn't quite make sense, with no idea about how to get off.\n\nThere is an overwhelming feeling that if everyone stopped and thought about it for five minutes, they'd build something completely different; but it's paired with a total inability to articulate why they specifically haven't stopped.\n\nNobody stops, because nobody can afford to, and that feeling has a name. It's called Moloch, and it's the most important thing happening in AI that isn't on your roadmap.\n\nA new model drops. It's better at benchmarks. Every AI product company now has to integrate it (if they're a wrapper) or match it (if they're building a model) or explain to their investors why they didn't. Integration // parity takes engineering time, time that doesn't go toward the actual product differentiation that would create long-term value. But the company that doesn't integrate looks like it's falling behind, and looking like you're falling behind is fatal when your entire valuation rests on the assumption that you're on the frontier.\n\nEveryone catches up, everyone shifts resources, everyone ships the update. The net competitive position of every company is exactly where it was before, except they all engineering time on esoteria and none of them made their end-product meaningfully better for end-users.\n\nIt happens every few weeks now.\n\nThis is Moloch; and it'scoordination failure as competition. Every company makes an individually rational decision (keep up with the frontier or die) and the aggregate outcome is an industry that's moving incredibly fast in the direction of model capability, and barely at all in the direction of product value.\n\nThe race is real // the destination is fake.\n\nEvery AI product is converging on the same interface: a chat box. Maybe a chat box with some tool use. Maybe a chat box with some RAG. But at bottom, a text input and a text output, differentiated by branding and minor UX choices and which model is running underneath.\n\nThe chat box won because it ships fast, and Moloch rewards speed over design.\n\nBuilding a novel interaction paradigm takes months or years of research, iteration, user testing. During those months, fifteen competitors will ship chat-box wrappers with the latest model and capture the market's attention. Your investors will get nervous. Your board will suggest you \"ship something\" while you figure out the long-term vision. You'll ship the chat box. The long-term vision will die in a Notion doc nobody opens.\n\nEvery company faces this exact choice and picks the same outcome. The competitive structure selects against creativity. The companies that take time to build something new get outrun by the companies that ship the obvious thing fast. And the obvious thing is always the same thing, because the obvious thing is, by definition, the thing that doesn't need original thinking.\n\nMoloch doesn't want you to build something good.\n\nMoloch wants you to build something now.\n\nThe competitive dynamic is bad enough at the product level. At the fundraising level, it's catastrophic.\n\nAI companies are raising at valuations that require them to grow at rates that are only achievable by chasing the broadest possible market with the most generic possible product. A company that raises at a $500M valuation needs to show a path to billions in revenue, which means it can't afford to be a niche tool that does one thing brilliantly for a specific audience. It has to be a platform, horizontal, aimed at enterprise, built for no one in particular.\n\nEvery AI company is building the same enterprise platform with the same features targeting the same buyers, because the fundraising math requires it, because the valuation requires it, because the competitive environment requires raising at that valuation to attract talent, because the talent market requires it.\n\nNobody in this chain chose this outcome. Every individual decision was rational. The aggregate result is an industry producing fifty identical products, none of which solve any specific problem particularly well, all of which are locked in a feature war that generates zero cumulative value.\n\nThe companies that would build something different (smaller, more focused, more opinionated) can't raise the capital to compete. The companies that raise the capital are structurally forced into sameness. Moloch eats the variance, and variance is where all the actual value lives.\n\nTop AI researchers and engineers go to the companies that are on the frontier. The frontier is defined by model capability benchmarks. So companies invest disproportionately in model capabilty, because that's how you attract talent, even when the marginal return on model capability for their specific product is near zero.\n\nYour users don't need GPT-5 when they can barely use GPT-4 effectively. They need better UX and better integration into how they actually work. But the engineer who could build that wants to work on the model, because model work is what gets you your next job, because the next company is also optimizing for model capability, because they need to attract talent too.\n\nEvery company overspends on model capability and underspends on product quality. The structure forces it. The talent market punishes you for having the right priorities.\n\nThe startup advice I've heard for a decade+ is \"Ignore the noise. Focus on users. Build something good.\"\n\nCorrect in theory, nearly impossible in practice, because Moloch specifically punishes this strategy in the medium term.\n\nBuilding something good takes time, and time means you're not shipping. Not shipping means you look like you're losing, which means talent leaves and investors get nervous, and your competitors (who are shipping fast and bad) capture market position that's expensive to reclaim.\n\nThe window in which \"build something good\" pays off is long, two years, three years, maybe more. The window in which Moloch punishes you for it is immediate and continuous. Most companies don't survive the medium term to reach teh long term.\n\nThe founders who know this stay up at night.\n\nThey can probably see the right thing to build.\n\nThey can't survive building it.\n\nYou can't outrun Moloch. You can only build a structure it can't reach.\n\nIn practice, this means: don't raise more than you need. Don't hire faster than your product vision can absorb. Don't compete on the frontier unless the frontier is where your users live. Find a niche that's too small for the Moloch-captured companies to notice and go so deep into it that by the time they arrive, your product is years ahead in the dimension that matters to those users.\n\nBe small enough that the competitve pressure doesn't distort your priorities. Be opinionated enough that you can't be dragged into building the same thing as everyone else. Be capitally efficient enough that you don't need the growth rate that forces you onto the treadmill. Be weird enough that nobody can copy you without becoming you.",

    "fullText": "The coauthor of an AI research paper is speaking out after his work triggered a global stock sell-off.\n\nCitrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, alongside Alap Shah, CEO of Littlebird.ai, theorized a future where, instead of transforming the economy in a positive way, the AI boom erases white-collar jobs and severely reduces the spending power of those workers, and eventually stunts economic growth.\n\nOn Monday, Shah told \"TBPN\" podcast hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays that despite how well it seems to be going for blue-collar jobs at the moment in terms of growth and the lack of mass layoffs, these jobs won't be safe if white collar jobs go away because ultimately, there is only \"one labor market.\"\n\n\"Let's say in our scenario, we talk about 5% of folks might get fired in a couple of years,\" said Shah. \"Those 5%, if there aren't white collar jobs for them to relocate into, then they're going to have to move into the gig economy and the blue collar labor force.\"\n\n\"And so that puts pressure on the entire labor market, not just the white collar one,\" Shah added.\n\nShah and Citrini published a report on Sunday, written from a futuristic point of view set in 2028, that predicts a negative domino scenario triggered by the AI boom. The research theorizes that AI will kick off a mass white-collar layoff too quickly, which will then deal a blow to the metro housing and mortgage market, and eventually lead to a global stock sell-off and a widespread recession in all sectors. In this scenario, the paper said, AI growth could also lose momentum due to a lack of funding.\n\n\"The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth,\" the paper theorizes. \"The November 2027 crash only served to accelerate all of the negative feedback loops already in place.\"\n\nShah elaborated on these concerns on \"TBPN.\" When asked what he thinks of the current growth in the health and education sectors, Shah said most of it could be spurred by government spending, which would go away if personal income declines.\n\n\"Those sectors continue to grow because government spending grows,\" said Shah. \"But again, gets very circular if government spending is coming primarily from taxes and primarily payroll taxes because the average worker pays a lot",

This is a s--t-or-get-off-the-pot-meeting.”\n\nAmodei, who’s often warned of AI’s potential for misuse, has consistently pushed to frame his firm as a safety-conscious leader in the sector.\n\nHe has so far resisted pressure from Hegseth to remove safeguards on the Pentagon’s Claude-enabled programs unless the department agrees to wall off mass surveillance of citizens and research into weapons capable of firing without a human operator.\n\nTheir feud is understood to have escalated amid reports that Claude was used by the Pentagon in the Trump administration’s lightning invasion of Venezuela earlier in January.\n\nCritics decried that mission—which secured the capture of President Nicolas Maduro, who now faces narcoterrorism charges in New York federal court—as an all-out assault on the rules-based international order.\n\nAnthropic told Axios that “we are having productive conversations, in good faith,” with the Pentagon.\n\nDefense officials instead say “negotiations have shown no progress,” and are now “on the verge of breaking down.”\n\nEarlier this month, Hegseth warned he would consider certifying Anthropic as a “supply chain risk” if it did not yield to his demands.\n\nOfficials said that at the Tuesday meeting, the secretary now plans on issuing Amodei with an “ultimatum.”\n\n“The problem with Dario is, with him, it’s ideological,” one senior Defense Department source said. “We know who we’re dealing with.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the Defense Department and Anthropic for comment on this story.",

    "description": ": Watchdogs warn models that can generate realistic images of people must comply with data protection laws",
    "fullText": "A global coalition of privacy watchdogs has fired a warning shot at the generative AI industry, saying companies churning out realistic synthetic images can't pretend that data protection rules don't apply.\n\nThe joint statement [PDF] signed by more than 60 regulators, including the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), boils down to a simple point: if your model can convincingly fake a person, you don't get to pretend data protection law doesn't exist.\n\n\"Recent developments – particularly AI image and video generation integrated into widely accessible social media platforms – have enabled the creation of non-consensual intimate imagery, defamatory depictions, and other harmful content featuring real individuals,\" said the signatories. \"We are especially concerned about potential harms to children and other vulnerable groups, such as cyberbullying and/or exploitation.\"\n\nThe warning lands weeks after the ICO and DPC opened formal probes into Elon Musk's xAI following reports that its Grok chatbot produced sexual images of real people without their consent.\n\nThe group says organizations dabbling in generative AI need to build safeguards from the start and think carefully about risks such as non-consensual imagery, misuse of someone's likeness, and potential harms to children – all areas where the tech has raced ahead of social norms and, in some cases, common sense.\n\nThe regulators stress that the law already covers this, and that firms don't get a free pass just because the content came from a machine.\n\nWilliam Malcolm, executive director of Regulatory Risk & Innovation at the ICO, said: \"People should be able to benefit from AI without fearing that their identity, dignity or safety are under threat. AI already plays a large role in all our lives, and everybody has a right to expect that AI systems handling their personal data will do so with respect. Responsible innovation means putting people first: anticipating the risks and building in meaningful safeguards to ensure autonomy, transparency, and control.\n\n\"Public trust is foundational to the successful adoption and use of AI. Joint regulatory initiatives like this show global commitment to high standards of data protection in AI systems and help provide regulatory certainty. We expect those developing and deploying AI to act responsibly. Where we find that obligations have not been met, we will take action to protect the public.\"\n\nThe joint statement on AI-generated imagery suggests that if companies want to keep pushing ever more realistic AI into everyday products, they should expect regulators to keep asking awkward questions about how it all works. ®",

    "description": "Meta alignment director Summer Yue hooked OpenClaw up to her inbox. Then, the bot tried to delete her emails. Yue chalked it up to a \"rookie mistake.\"",
    "fullText": "Even the people hired to keep AI aligned can't always keep it in line.\n\nMeta's Summer Yue has been testing OpenClaw, a popular open-source AI agent capable of working 24/7 on behalf of its users. Then the bot went out of control, according to photos she posted on X. It ended up planning to delete her emails — and wouldn't stop after being directed to.\n\nIn her X post, Yue's OpenClaw bot said that it would \"trash EVERYTHING in inbox older than Feb 15 that isn't already in my keep list.\"\n\nYue tried multiple times to stop it. First, she messaged the AI agent, \"Do not do that.\" As the bot kept planning to delete her inbox, she wrote, \"STOP OPENCLAW.\"\n\n\"I couldn't stop it from my phone,\" Yue wrote in her post. \"I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb.\"\n\nNothing humbles you like telling your OpenClaw “confirm before acting” and watching it speedrun deleting your inbox. I couldn’t stop it from my phone. I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb. pic.twitter.com/XAxyRwPJ5R\n\nYue had previously tried OpenClaw on her \"toy inbox,\" where she wrote that the bot worked well and gained her trust. Testing it on her \"real inbox,\" the bot had to compact a much larger set of emails. She instructed it not to take action without approval, but OpenClaw lost the prompt during compaction, she wrote.\n\nYue joined Meta after its deal with Scale AI as a director of alignment of its Superintelligence Labs division, according to her LinkedIn profile. That's left some critics on social media confused: why would someone studying AI safety use such an AI agent that has previously drawn security concerns?\n\nUnlike other AI agents, OpenClaw does not need human approval to sign off on actions. It was also vibe-coded, and that combined with OpenClaw's level of system access has led some AI researchers to question the bot's security. AI researcher Gary Marcus told Business Insider that it was like \"giving full access to your computer and all your passwords to a guy you met at a bar who says he can help you out.\"\n\nOpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger, who has since been hired by OpenAI, recently said in a podcast interview that he was prioritizing building out additional security safeguards over ease-of-use features.\n\nThough it's not altogether surprising that someone working in AI would test out one of the buzziest AI products of the last year, some X users criticized Yue for hooking up OpenClaw to her real email in the first place. Ben Hylak, the cofounder of Raindrop AI and an Apple alum, posted a screenshot of her LinkedIn. \"This should terrify you,\" he wrote. \"What is Meta doing?\"\n\n\"Somewhat concerning that a person whose job is AI alignment is surprised when an AI doesn't precisely follow verbal instructions,\" another X user wrote.\n\nYou can't make this up. And this happened to a someone working on safety and alignment at META Superintelligence Lab.\n\nI don't get how people can let AI agents go on unsupervised like this.\n\nI'll stick to my supervised use of AI for now. pic.twitter.com/tWvQFd1NP5\n\nYue and Meta didn't respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nYue also isn't the only Meta employee to toy around with OpenClaw; creator Peter Steinberger said that Mark Zuckerberg played with the tool for a week and even sent feedback. While Meta courted him, Steinberger later accepted a job offer from OpenAI.\n\nIn the comments of Yue's post, someone asked about her AI alignment role. \"Were you intentionally testing its guardrails or did you make a rookie mistake?\" they wrote.\n\n\"Rookie mistake tbh,\" Yue responded. \"Turns out alignment researchers aren't immune to misalignment.\"",

    "description": "Anthropic's Claude is allegedly going to destroy  a bunch of jobs. Unless you look at the startup's job listings.",
    "fullText": "I've seen some silly predictions about the future of work lately. If you're worried about AI destroying jobs, take a quick trip through Anthropic's careers page. It's one of my favorite spots on the internet right now.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei is among the loudest voices warning that AI could erase many white-collar jobs. He's been especially outspoken about coding, given Anthropic's Claude Code is so powerful.\n\nA successful editor once told me to focus on what people and companies do, not what they say. So let's look at the jobs Anthropic is trying to fill right now.\n\nTop of the list: software engineering roles. The AI company with the most effective coding-automation machine on earth is looking to hire more than 100 coding experts.\n\nThis job posting stood out to me. Anthropic is hiring an iOS developer to build mobile apps. I thought you could just vibe-code apps these days? Apparently not.\n\nBoris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, was asked about this recently. If this AI tool is writing most or all of Anthropic's code these days, why is the company still hiring so many software developers?\n\n\"Someone has to prompt the Claudes, talk to customers, coordinate with other teams, decide what to build next,\" Cherny replied on X. \"Engineering is changing and great engineers are more important than ever.\"\n\nLet that sink in. Software development is probably the job that is most disrupted by AI. Models have gotten good at coding because it's relatively easy to evaluate good versus bad outputs. That's because the code either works, or it doesn't, when deployed. This creates clear yes/no signals that are really valuable for training and fine-tuning new AI models.\n\nSo if Anthropic is still hiring more than 100 software engineers, then other types of jobs that are less impacted by AI should probably endure as well.\n\nProving my point, Anthropic has 32 finance jobs open, along with 33 in marketing, 16 in legal, and more than 100 in sales.\n\nI'm not just telling you this to make you feel better. When extreme AI job predictions are made, it leads to dumb ideas such as banning data center construction.\n\nSo, take a breath. AI is just a (powerful) tool to help humans get more work done. I'll leave you with final thoughts on this topic from Jensen Huang (who, by the way, is hiring humans like crazy).\n\nIn a recent interview, he argued that fears of mass job destruction often confuse the \"tasks\" involved in a job with the broader \"purpose\" of the role. AI, in his view, changes how tasks get done, but the purpose remains the same. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "\"These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,\" Anthropic said as part of its lengthy statement.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic says its Chinese competitors are stealing from the AI startup to gain an edge in the global AI race.\n\nOn Monday, Anthropic said three of China's biggest AI labs, DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI, were \"illicitly\" using Claude \"to improve their own models,\" through a process known as distillation.\n\n\"These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,\" Anthropic said as part of its lengthy statement on Monday. \"The window to act is narrow, and the threat extends beyond any single company or region. Addressing it will require rapid, coordinated action among industry players, policymakers, and the global AI community.\n\nAnthropic said the distillation efforts were \"industrial-scale campaigns\" that included roughly 24,000 fraudulent Claude accounts that generated over 16 million exchanges \"in violation of our terms of service and regional access restrictions.\"\n\nDistillation is the process of training a less powerful model on the output of a more powerful model. The practice is a legitimate way that many US companies use to train their models for public release. Increasingly, major US companies are also stating that their Chinese competitors are improperly using the practice to steal their work.\n\nIn January 2025, OpenAI said DeepSeek may have \"inappropriately\" used OpenAI's outputs to train their models. Earlier this month, Google disclosed it had \"identified an increase in model extraction attempts or 'distillation attacks.'\"\n\n\"Competitors can use it to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently,\" Anthropic said on Monday.\n\nAnthropic disclosed remarkable detail about the extent to which DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI \"illicitly\" used their systems. Claude is not available for commercial access in China, though Anthropic said the rival labs found workarounds.\n\nAmong the notable findings, Anthropic said DeepSeek sought to create \"censorship-safe alternatives to policy-sensitive queries.\" The company also said it detected MiniMax's campaign \"while it was still active,\" giving them an in-depth look at what their competitor was doing.\n\n\"When we released a new model during MiniMax's active campaign, they pivoted within 24 hours, redirecting nearly half their traffic to capture capabilities from our latest system,\" Anthropic said.\n\nRepresentatives for DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Moonshot AI did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBeyond cheating in the AI, Anthropic said improper distillation poses security risks because less-trained models may lack the proper safeguards, such as those to prevent the development of bioweapons.\n\nIn response to such distillation campaigns, Anthropic said it has built in \"behavioral fingerprinting systems,\" shares data with other AI companies on what to look out for, and continues to develop additional countermeasures.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently wrote that leading models are approaching the point where, without proper safeguards, they could help direct someone in building a bioweapon.\n\nAmodei is also an outspoken advocate of US-export controls, a topic that divides some leading tech CEOs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said that restricting US companies, including his own, from selling advanced chips to China won't curb China's AI advancements.\n\n\"Distillation attacks therefore reinforce the rationale for export controls: restricted chip access limits both direct model training and the scale of illicit distillation,\" Anthropic said.\n\nAnthropic has also faced allegations of using copyrighted material to train its models. In January, the Washington Post reported new details about an endeavor at the company called Project Panama, which the company reportedly described as \"our effort to destructively scan all the books in the world.\" Last year, Anthropic settled a class-action lawsuit brought by the authors and publishers of some of the books for $1.5 billion. As part of the settlement, the company didn't admit any wrongdoing.",

    "description": "222 wants to grow beyond helping people make new friends. The AI-powered startup also wants to help people find love and maintain relationships.",
    "fullText": "It'd be nice to meet someone the old-fashioned way: Passing by them on the street, meeting at a restaurant, or sharing an exchange at a party.\n\nHowever, apps dominate the modern dating experience, replacing kismet meet-cutes with scrolling and DMs.\n\n222, a startup focused on relationship building with the help of AI, thinks it can bring back the spontaneity of making a new friend — or falling in love.\n\n\"We're trying to get as close as possible to you walking into someplace with other people there, and connection just naturally happens,\" CEO Keyan Kazemian told Business Insider.\n\nAt a high level, 222 matches people with strangers for experiences like dinner or a night out after they take a robust personality quiz, using machine learning models trained by its team and open-source AI models.\n\n\"When you walk in, all of those people are people we predict you're going to be able to have a good conversation with, and you'll like,\" COO Danial Hashemi said.\n\nWhen 222 launched in 2021, it began as a dinner series in Los Angeles for young adults emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, helping them meet new people. Then the project grew into a company. It was accepted into Y Combinator, raised capital, moved to New York City, and launched a mobile app to spur in-real-life (IRL) socializing.\n\nWhile people who join 222 are often new to a city, Kazemian said, today they're pretty evenly split along why they're using the platform: they're either looking for new friends or potential romantic connections.\n\nSince putting out its app in 2024, the 222 experience has evolved. It's no longer just about meeting strangers, having a fun night, and forming new relationships.\n\n\"We're very focused on going beyond that,\" Kazemian said.\n\nThe platform is now digging deeper into connecting people after the first encounter that 222 initiates. It's helping plan follow-up hangs with friends and kindling a romantic connection by setting people up on a date if the feeling is mutual.\n\nAfter a 222 experience, the platform follows up to ask attendees whether they want to hang out or go on a date with anyone they met.\n\nOnce two people say they'd like to go on a date, \"we fully set up the next date for them,\" Hashemi said — reservation and all.\n\n\"If you think about just before dating apps, before all this stuff, how would people meet each other?\" Hashemi said. \"It would be you're in the same physical space with no preconceived notions of who this person is going to be.\"\n\nHashemi said that some of the \"joy\" of navigating how you feel about someone new in your life has \"gone away because of dating apps.\"\n\nMeeting in a way that feels more organic, such as a social gathering or through friends, has staying power. A 2025 survey of 7,000 US adults by health company Hims found that 77% of Gen Z met their partners IRL. Even Partiful, the Gen Z replacement for Facebook Events, is getting in on the IRL event-to-dating pipeline.\n\n222 thinks AI can make the meet-cute more accessible.\n\nWhat 222's founding team has zeroed in on is \"labeled data,\" Kazemian said, which comes from its users' feedback after they meet people.\n\nThe startup knows its first pairings may not be the ultimate match, which is why it encourages its subscribers — who pay $22 a month — to try multiple experiences. Its AI, in return, can curate better matches from 222's network.\n\nThere are layers of factors that contribute to that, 222's CTO Arman Roshannai said, such as similar music tastes or hometowns.\n\n\"The signal that we're training on is after you meet this person, you spend two hours getting dinner with them, and then you hang out for a few hours afterwards, were you guys actually a good match for each other?\" Roshannai added.\n\nKazemian added that training on this proprietary data from user feedback is a \"painstakingly difficult and long process,\" but gives the startup a \"technical moat\" to stand out from some competitors.\n\n222 isn't the only startup — or public company — betting that AI can improve how we connect.\n\nSeveral startups have launched with this premise and are raising millions, pitching matchmaking solutions that use AI to set people up. Meanwhile, Bumble, Tinder, and Facebook Dating are testing the AI waters and reimagining the swipe. Hinge's founder recently left the Match Group-owned dating app to build an AI dating alternative.\n\nAfter raising another $10.1 million from venture capital investors in 2025 — bringing the startup's total raised to $13.7 million — 222 is doubling down on hiring and expanding its product with tools that keep relationships going.\n\n222's next undertaking is to provide avenues for its users to reach their \"next offline moment\" together, so they can deepen those relationships.\n\nThe startup wants to be in the business of both creating relationships and maintaining them.\n\n\"They need to show up at the same place together,\" Kazemian said, be it a hangout, a date, or a restaurant reservation. \"We can help them figure out what that place is.\"",

    "fullText": "The AI-driven software sell-off that ravaged markets in early February isn't over, with IBM stock tanking on Monday as Anthropic unveiled another disruptive AI tool.\n\nIBM shares fell 13% after the maker of the Claude AI chatbot announced another new tool. In this case, the startup announced an update that can help reduce the cost of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) systems used by many businesses.\n\nThe term may not be widely known outside the software industry, but it quickly sent IBM stock into a nosedive in the latest installment of the software sell-off.\n\nAnthropic announced the update in a blog post, laying out why COBOL matters and why people outside the tech community should care.\n\n\"COBOL is everywhere. It handles an estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the US,\" it wrote. \"Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government. Despite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year.\"\n\nAmong its uses, the company said the new tool could \"Identify risks that would take human analysts months to surface.\" The new AI use case poses a potential threat to the kind of business data service that comprises a core part of IBM's business.\n\nAccording to the startup, Claude will allow companies to streamline their COBOL operations for a fraction of their previous cost, similar to the legal plugins the company rolled out early in the month that triggered the initial software sell-off.\n\n\"Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation,\" Anthropic said in its post.\n\nTech stocks initially bounced back after Anthropic's legal plugin release spooked Wall Street and caused investors to rush to limit their legal tech exposure, but the market was selling off sharply again on Monday.\n\nEven before the Anthropic news hit IBM shares, the sector was tumbling earlier in the session as investors reacted to tariff uncertainty and a report making the rounds online that speculated about far-reaching negative impacts of AI.",

    "description": "Lou Cohen emphasizes AI's potential in marketing, urging marketers to leverage it for improved audience segmentation and ad efficiency.",
    "fullText": "Lou Cohen, EY's chief digital officer, said many marketers are not yet taking advantage of the benefits of artificial intelligence.\n\nCohen, who is also a professor at New York University, Yeshiva University, and Baruch College, said marketing is at an \"inflection point,\" with investment shifting from general digital innovation to AI transformation.\n\nCohen said that marketers who understand how to use AI in an assistive way, by focusing on what outcomes it delivers best, will access a deeper level of audience segmenting, targeting, and testing. He was interviewed for CMO Insider at Business Insider's studio in New York City.\n\nUltimately, Cohen said, the marketing function will embrace the new opportunity. \"Marketers, they're not afraid to try things,\" Cohen said. \"We're going to learn more from the things that we fail with and that don't work than the things that do.\"\n\nThe following transcript has been edited for clarity.\n\nWe are at an interesting inflection point. In today's marketing environment, you really need to understand how to make AI work for you; otherwise, you will end up working for it.\n\nThere are efficiency and operational gains to be had. But if you think about the outcomes that AI can enable from a marketing perspective, we could be smarter about how we segment our audiences for different campaigns. We could be more efficient in the ways our advertising runs. We could test more rapidly to get better-quality content in front of the right audiences at the right time in the right place.\n\nBut most marketing teams are not yet set up to take advantage of this potential. So the investments of the last 15 years in digital transformation are now shifting into AI transformation.\n\nIt's a bit unknown now. Marketers are not totally comfortable with this because we're so worried that it's going to hallucinate or give us something that isn't accurate. Marketers, they're not afraid to try things. We're going to learn more from the things that we fail with and that don't work than from the things that do.\n\nMy colleague came up with a great way to evaluate the quality of our content using AI. We can paste in an article that a partner of ours wrote, and it will give us recommendations on how to make that piece of content better. But we're never — I shouldn't say never — we're not likely to use content created by AI. But we certainly can use AI to enhance and give feedback to our content creators.\n\nHallucinations are real. The challenge is that as consumers of these technologies, we don't yet understand the difference between probabilistic and deterministic outcomes. Probabilistic is the likely correct response that the AI is trying to give us. Deterministic is \"one plus one equals two,\" and arguably, one plus one always equals two. \n\nWhen you're doing a search on Google or Bing, for example, you are getting a deterministic response. You're getting what it believes to be the likely to answer your question. Versus with the LLMs, the ChatGPTs, the Llamas, the Geminis of the world, you're getting a probabilistic response. The model is bringing a bunch of different sources together to determine the answer it thinks you should get based on your prompt.\n\nThat means if we were using these tools for their designed purpose, we'd still need search engines to just navigate to the things we're looking for, or to find the needles in the haystack of the internet. But LLMs give us a different opportunity. They can be assistants. That was some of the original idea behind these AI tools, to assist people in doing different tasks.\n\nI think of these LLMs more as marketing assistants to give me real-time ideas, feedback, or suggestions, rather than doing the task for me. That's a human putting AI to work to get better outcomes faster than if I were to just do it myself.",

    "description": "The next big iPhone update will bring new features to the Apple Music app.",
    "fullText": "Your iPhone is likely currently running iOS 26.3 (assuming you've been keeping up with the operating system updates), but there's another version currently in the works over at Apple HQ. Right now, beta testers have their hands on iOS 26.4, which is shaping up to be a much bigger update than the last. Among the changes, Apple is debuting end-to-end encryption for RCS chats, so texts with Android users will no longer be insecure, and the Reminders app is getting an \"Urgent\" section for any entries you've labeled as such.\n\nBut perhaps no part of iOS is getting a larger update with 26.4 than Apple Music—both the app, and Apple's paid subscription service. Apple seems to have decided that Music needed a bit of a facelift, as well as some quality of life changes that will make the app and service easier to use. Whether you use Apple Music for streaming or you rely on it to store your digital library, you're going to notice the updates when iOS 26.4 drops in the near future. Some of these features will be free and some only available to paid subscribers; I've reached out to Apple to confirm which is which, and I will update this piece if I hear back.\n\nDo you like making playlists, or do you know someone who does? The robots are coming for your hobby, too. With iOS 26.4, Apple Music is rolling out \"Playlist Playground,\" a new feature that lets you generate playlists from natural language prompts. In layman's terms, that means you tell the AI what kind of music you want to hear, and it will generate a playlist from that request. That could something hyper-specific, like \"Taylor Swift country tracks,\" or something more general, like \"morning coffee vibes.\" The AI will choose 25 songs it thinks match your query. If it doesn't get it quite right, you can ask it to make changes, and you can change things yourself, like the playlist's title, description, and cover image.\n\nI'm interested to try this out, if for no other reason than music discovery: I like Apple Music's curated playlists already, but I am intrigued as to whether asking Apple's AI to select certain types of songs for me will help me find new music any better than the platform's human curators. I also don't think this will stop me from making my own playlists, or looking for playlists from friends. Sure, maybe the AI is good at picking 25 songs that match a specific theme, but there is an art to hand-picking tracks that work well together—plus, it's just fun.\n\nApple is far from the first company to roll out such a feature. YouTube Music recently launched something similar, while Spotify has two different AI playlist features (AI Playlist and Prompted Playlist) available on its platform.\n\nWhen you start exploring Apple Music after updating to iOS 26.4, you'll likely notice something right away: The UX, which is normally white or black (whether your iPhone is in light or dark mode) now matches the color scheme of the artwork for the album or playlist you're checking out. The effect is especially cool when the album art supports full-screen motion, like the following:\n\nApple has made some divisive design decisions in recent years, but I think this change is going to be a crowd pleaser. The difference between the current design on iOS 26.3 and the new look is stark, and, while there's nothing wrong with how things stand now, it already looks super dated next to the full-screen color matching designs.\n\nSpeaking of playlists, you can now add songs to multiple at once—just in case you still need some human intervention when it comes to these playlists. When you go to add a song to a playlist, you'll notice a new button in the bottom right. Tap it, and Apple Music opens up the ability to select multiple playlists at once, and send the song to all of them. It's a small change, but a helpful one, especially if you frequently add new music to more than one playlist at a time. I could see myself using this to add a song to my personal new discoveries playlist, as well as a shared playlist of new music I keep with friends.\n\nNot all music is made to active listening. If you use Apple Music for background music, especially when sleeping, working, or zoning out, you might be interested in the new \"Ambient Music\" widget, which lets you launch one of four different ambient playlists from the Home Screen: Sleep, which plays \"Sleep Sounds;\" Chill, which plays \"Today's Chill;\" Productivity, which plays \"Productivity;\" or Wellbeing, which plays \"Pure Meditation.\"\n\nI still can't quite shake the habit of relying on YouTube for my \"focus music\" needs, especially since these tracks mess with my Apple Music algorithms. But it might make sense to start relying on the platform I actually pay for when I want music to work or fall asleep to—unless that music is only available elsewhere.\n\nApple Music is also making it easier to listen to music outside of the app. The platform is rolling out a \"Concerts Near You\" section, which shows you artists playing in your area. You can see popular artists and their concert dates, as well as shows that are coming up this week. You can sort by both date and genre, and you can update the location when you want to know where shows are going to be in different areas.",

    "description": "New tariffs chaos means investor should focus on AI and sectors of the S&P 500 that have outperformed this year, investing experts told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's trade war has entered a new, chaotic chapter that's raised uncertainty for investors.\n\nMarkets are going through a fresh bout of volatility after the Supreme Court struck down the majority of Trump's tariffs — a move that seems to have marked the start of a new, confusing chapter in the trade saga.\n\nUS stocks initially rose after the tariff ruling was announced on Friday, even as Trump threatened to impose a fresh 10% global tariff. Indexes tumbled on Monday, however, as traders reacted to Trump's follow-up announcement that he would hike global tariffs to 15%, adding to the mayhem.\n\nUncertainty over tariffs has long hung over the market, and it's unclear how the new changes to tariffs will play out, particularly since it's unclear how the fight over tariff refunds might end, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I just don't think we've removed much of the uncertainty around tariffs by the Supreme Court ruling and quick pivot to Plan B,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I think that remains a headwind.\"\n\nHere's how market pros think investors should position as the trade war takes its latest turn.\n\nThe tariffs story is largely a distraction from the market's overarching focus on AI, according to Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research.\n\n\"I think the tariffs have become a bit of a sideshow at this point,\" Berezin said. \"I think it's really just an AI story at this point for the market.\"\n\nBerezin said Trump is unlikely to raise tariffs beyond what he announced on Saturday. The president also looks like he's laser-focused on his affordability push ahead of he midterm elections.\n\nFurthermore, Trump likely knows that tariffs are inflationary and is looking to avoid that, as much as members of his team have downplayed price increases from tariffs, Berezin said. He pointed to a recent Financial Times report that Trump was planning to roll back some tariffs on steel and aluminum goods, which the White House later denied.\n\nHogan said he thinks the recent tariff ruling doesn't change the status quo in markets. Even with Trump's 15% global tariff, the US's new trade policy doesn't look like it will change the investing landscape much from before, he said.\n\nSome nations, like China and Brazil, were facing much larger tariffs prior to the Supreme Court ruling, and have come out as \"winners\" under the new tariff scheme, Berezin said, though he didn't believe it changed the investing outlook from a sectoral perspective.\n\nHogan advised investors to stick to sectors that have recently outperformed after lagging the broader market for several years, including materials, industrials, and energy stocks. Those areas have made up the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nBest-performing sectors of the S&P 500, year-to-date\n\nPrecious metals and commodities also look like they could become winners from the new trade chaos, according to David Morrison, a senior market strategist at Trade Nation. That's because investors flock to hard assets and other safe havens when they see \"tariff-driven market stress,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nDespite enduring a historic sell-off in late January, precious metals and commodities have also posted strong gains so far this year.\n\nHogan pointed to Friday's short-lived pop in shares of consumer-facing companies that are major importers of foreign goods, such as furniture and apparel retailers.\n\nSome investors may be feeling optimistic about corporate stimulus if the US refunds tariff payments. But refunds are uncertain, and should they come, it's likely that the government will drag out the process, Hogan said.\n\n\"I just don't know how resilient that will be in the face of ongoing litigation about the government paying this back,\" he added of the recent rebound in the consumer sector.\n\nJeff Buchbinder, the chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, added that the firm wouldn't chase stock jumps in import-heavy consumer retailers.\n\n\"We would fade the stock market bounce in tariff losers,\" Buchbinder wrote. \"Among tariff losers, our preference would be to play homebuilders, industrials, and technology hardware/semiconductors over apparel retailers and automakers.\"",

    "description": "A research report framed as a hypothetical look back from 2028 was making the rounds online and adding to fresh jitters in software stocks.",
    "fullText": "The AI trade has boosted the market for years now, with its rapid growth being felt by the broader economy as companies keep spending. However, one research firm thinks the AI story will not end well for investors or everyday Americans.\n\nStocks tumbled on Monday after a report circulating online from Citrini Research raised fresh fears about the impact of AI. The Dow was down by more than 800 points around midday, and the Nasdaq fell more than 1%. Software stocks were among the biggest losers, with names including AppLovin, Asana, DocuSign, and Zscaler down sharply.\n\nCitrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, theorized about the long-term impact of the AI boom, laying out a predictive scenario in which the technology continues to expand but ultimately proves detrimental to the broader economy.\n\nIn Citrini's hypothetical scenario, written as a look back from 2028, the AI explosion leads to a plunge in white-collar employment and ultimately to a stock market crash.\n\nThe scenario begins with a question:\n\n\"What if our AI bullishness continues to be right...and what if that's actually bearish?\"\n\nThe answer is different from many other bearish AI takes. When finance or economics pros express concern about the stability of the AI boom, they typically focus on problems with infrastructure and the stability of the AI buildout.\n\nBut Citrini's analysis assumes that the AI boom will continue, just not in a way that helps transform the economy, nor in the positive way AI bulls like Elon Musk have touted. In their scenario, the rise of AI continues driving white-collar layoffs, severely reducing the spending power of those workers and lowering economic growth in the process.\n\n\"This would have been manageable if the disruption remained contained to software, but it didn't,\" Citrini stated. \"By the end of 2027, it threatened every business model predicated on intermediation. Swaths of companies built on monetizing friction for humans disintegrated.\"\n\nIn this scenario, AI progress is quickly felt in the housing market, as white-collar workers in expensive metro areas are no longer able to afford homes, which has a knock-on effect in the mortgage market.\n\nAll these negative events ultimately lead, in Citrini's imagined scenario, to a stock market crash, with the S&P 500 cratering by 38% from its October 2026 peak.\n\n\"The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth,\" the note said. \"The November 2027 crash only served to accelerate all of the negative feedback loops already in place.\"\n\nA core takeaway from the note is the importance of differentiating between the market and the economy, particularly when the market is booming. Markets applaud productivity and growing margins, the things we see when companies announce large-scale job cuts.\n\nThe broader economy, though, depends on consumer spending, which depends on wage growth keeping pace with rising prices. When these two become disconnected, even a booming stock market driven by a force like AI can't hide the negative impact that comes from diminished white-collar spending power.\n\nCitrini frames its scenario as a warning, implying that investors should take action now and not be lulled into a sense of security by the strength of the AI trade.\n\n\"As investors, we still have time to assess how much of our portfolios are built upon assumptions that won't survive the decade,\" it concludes. \"As a society, we still have time to be proactive.\"",

    "fullText": "A data center executive said the recent backlash against the AI boom, led by the likes of Michael Burry and Jim Chanos, reminded him of Lex Luthor's army of keyboard-bashing monkeys in the newest \"Superman\" movie.\n\nFrank Holmes, the executive chairman of HIVE Digital Technologies, played a GIF from the movie during the company's earnings webcast last week. It showed one of the monkeys furiously typing the message: \"ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD BACK SUPERMAN.\"\n\nLuthor, Superman's archnemesis, memorably uses the monkeys to flood social media with hateful memes, hashtags, and vitriol. Mimicking real-life troll farms, the disinformation campaign succeeds in turning the world against the hero.\n\nHolmes also flashed up a slide with pictures of Burry and Chanos, followed by another filled with recent news headlines about their warnings.\n\n\"Jim Chanos comes out and: 'Short the bitcoin miners, short Nvidia, short the [high-performance computing], the hyperscalers, there's too much debt,'\" Holmes said.\n\n\"And Michael Burry is coming out,\" he continued. \"He came out a couple weeks ago. Again, he's short this market. And it really starts to grow, this negativity on the ecosystem.\"\n\nCommenting as the GIF played, Holmes said it was \"about Superman's credibility being destroyed.\"\n\n\"Well, the same thing happened out of nowhere, all this negativity was showing up on Instagram, and YouTube, and X,\" he added.\n\nHIVE builds and runs data centers powered by clean energy in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay. Holmes dismissed negative news about Big Tech companies spending too much on data centers, saying the \"backup demand is just immense,\" and short-term traders were stirring the pot to help their short bets.\n\nBurry, the fund manager-turned-writer of \"The Big Short\" fame, reiterated his concerns about AI overinvestment in X posts over the weekend.\n\nA question I have for $ORCL, $GOOG, $META, $MSFT, $AMZN, $NVDA, $CAT, and all the rest, “When does the spending for AI data center buildout actually end?”\nIt is consuming all your cash flow, you are borrowing, you are financing in ways you never have, apparently because it is so… pic.twitter.com/fytMYDH942\n\n\"A question I have for $ORCL, $GOOG, $META, $MSFT, $AMZN, $NVDA, $CAT, and all the rest, \"When does the spending for AI data center buildout actually end?\" he queried.\n\n\"It is consuming all your cash flow, you are borrowing, you are financing in ways you never have, apparently because it is so urgent, because it scales?

    "fullText": "Sam Altman is pushing back on the idea that ChatGPT consumes too much energy.\n\n\"One of the things that is always unfair in this comparison is people talk about how much energy it takes to train an AI model relative to how much it costs a human to do one inference query,\" Altman told The Indian Express last week on the sidelines of a major AI summit. \"But it also takes a lot of energy to train a human.\"\n\nAltman suggested it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, arguing that it's unfair to discount the years spent nurturing and educating someone to be capable of making their own inquiries.\n\n\"It takes a lot of energy to train a human,\" he said, prompting some laughter in the crowd. \"It takes, like, 20 years of life, and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart.\"\n\nAltman said the clock really began thousands of years ago.\n\n\"It took, like, the very widespread evolution of the 100 billion people that have ever lived and learned not to get eaten by predators and learned how to, like, figure out science or whatever,\" he said.\n\nAltman also called out what he said were \"totally insane\" claims on the internet that OpenAI is guzzling down water to power ChatGPT.\n\n\"Water is totally fake,\" Altman said, when asked about concerns AI companies use too much water. \"It used to be true, we used to do evaporative cooling in data centers, but now that we don't do that, you know, you see these like things on the internet where, 'Don't use ChatGPT, it's 17 gallons of water for each query' or whatever.\"\n\nIn June, Altman said that the average ChatGPT query consumes roughly the amount of energy needed to power a lightbulb for a few minutes.\n\n\"People are often curious about how much energy a ChatGPT query uses; the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes,\" he wrote on X.\n\nAltman said it is fair as a whole to point out the AI industry's overall energy consumption because of the large growth in usage. He said it's why he and other AI CEOs have pushed alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and nuclear.\n\nUnlike other CEOs, namely xAI's Elon Musk, Altman is dismissive of the idea that space-based data centers are realistic in the next decade, a concept that some companies have floated as a way to reduce energy consumption.\n\nOutside of OpenAI, Altman is a major investor in nuclear energy. He previously served as chairman of Oklo, a nuclear energy startup, and has been a major backer of Helion, which plans to build what it calls \"the world's first fusion power plant\" in Washington state.\n\nIn the US, data center energy consumption is becoming a major topic. Last month, President Donald Trump said he was working with tech companies on \"a commitment to the American people\" to ensure that citizens don't pay higher energy bills because of a nearby data center.\n\nConsulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated last year that data centers could account for 14% of total power demand in the US by 2050.",

    "description": "Artificial intelligence is driving two overlapping shifts that are reshaping marketing. First, conversational AI is displacing websites and traditional search as the way people learn about products, shrinking traffic, narrowing choice, and forcing companies to rethink visibility when answers are generated rather than clicked. This transition—from search engine optimization to generative engine optimization—favors brands whose information is structured, trusted, and easy for AI systems to synthesize. Second, AI agents are beginning to act as buyers, making purchasing decisions on behalf of humans. As algorithms increasingly evaluate options and transact, marketing must adapt to a world in which the customer may be a machine with its own decision logic, requiring leaders to redesign content, infrastructure, and strategy for both human and algorithmic audiences.",

    "fullText": "Ofgem says about 140 proposed projects, driven by AI use, could require more power than current peak demand\n\nThe amount of power being sought by new datacentre projects in Great Britain would exceed the national current peak electricity consumption, according to an industry watchdog.\n\nOfgem said about 140 proposed datacentre schemes, driven by use of artificial intelligence, could require 50 gigawatts of electricity – 5GW more than the country’s current peak demand.\n\nThe figure was revealed in an Ofgem consultation on demand for new connections to the power grid. It pointed to a “surge in demand” for connection applications between November 2024 and June last year, with a significant number coming from datacentres. This has exceeded even the most ambitious forecasts.\n\nMeanwhile, new renewable energy projects are not being connected to the grid at the pace they are being built to help meet the government’s clean energy targets by the end of the decade.\n\nOfgem said the work required to connect surging numbers of datacentres could mean delays for other projects that are “critical for decarbonisation and economic growth”. Datacentres are the central nervous system of AI tools such as chatbots and image generators, playing a vital role in training and operating products such as ChatGPT and Gemini.\n\nThe rapid rise in energy consumption could also make it more difficult for the UK to meet its target to create a virtually carbon-free power system by 2030, which is already in doubt amid concerns over the rising cost of the country’s electricity.\n\nThe Guardian revealed last year that a vast datacentre proposed for Elsham in Lincolnshire could cause more greenhouse gas emissions than five international airports.\n\nAlthough some tech bosses and climate experts believe AI could help the fight against global heating by making power grids work more efficiently or accelerating the development of new zero-carbon technologies, there are widespread concerns that in the near-term datacentres will drive demand for fossil fuels to meet their energy demands.\n\nOfgem also said unviable applications for grid access could block progress for important datacentre bids, such as those related to the government’s AI growth zones. The zones, touted as offering a streamlined planning process and help in accessing energy, were announced last year as part of plans to increase the UK’s adoption of AI.\n\nThe regulator has proposed tougher financial tests for datacentre developers to join the queue to connect to the grid, in order to avoid creating a backlog of projects that do not have sufficient funding in place delaying viable projects that are further down in the queue.\n\nOfgem said datacentres must be central to any changes to the application process for electricity connections, describing the issue as a “global challenge” and saying there was no mechanism for prioritising projects deemed strategically import by ministers.\n\nThe regulator is considering charging datacentre providers for access to an energy connection – via a deposit or a nonrefundable fee – that could also deter “nonviable” projects that would otherwise clog up the application process. Ofgem is also exploring whether datacentre developers should pay for, and build, their own grid access, which would “accelerate connections and deliver better outcomes for consumers”.",

    "fullText": "Amid talk of artificial intelligence taking our jobs, the big unasked question is: how will we be fed?\n\nHow will we be fed? That’s the biggest question not seriously being addressed amid all this talk about whether or not artificial intelligence will end up taking over all of our jobs.\n\nFormidable though the technology appears, similar fears have popped up repeatedly since the Industrial Revolution, and most working-age adults remain employed. Still, what is sorely missing is a serious debate about what to do if this future in fact materializes.\n\nFor Open AI’s Sam Altman “the future can be vastly better than the present” because AI will make us stinking rich. But that seems like a risky assumption, for almost everyone except Altman and his fellow techno-oligarchs.\n\nEven if AI generates enormous economic prosperity, its distribution will remain a political challenge. This juncture calls for a serious, open debate about how the fruits of this prosperity will be apportioned among humanity.\n\nAddressing the question has two parts. The first is about how to design a technically efficacious system to redistribute the fruits of the economy as machines take over and labor’s share of income drops eventually near zero.\n\nThe more important question, though, is about how this economic reorganization will restructure power. Who will decide what to tax once AI destroys labor income, which provides the main source of government revenue in most advanced countries? Who decides how much everyday people who do not have an equity stake in the AI revolution get to consume?\n\nHow will society be organized in a world in which machines generate most or all economic output and a few dozen techno-billionaires get to decide what share of the world’s resources – money, energy, minerals – should be allocated to further expand superhuman intelligence? Who else gets a say on whether to direct more resources to, say, healthcare or agriculture, or education instead?\n\n“We need guardrails that preserve human agency, human oversight and human accountability,” noted United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi last week. The future of AI “cannot be decided by a handful of countries or left to the whims of a few billionaires”.\n\nIn AI circles, there is a lively debate about the “alignment” challenge – ensuring that the machines operate in ways that serve the goals of whoever runs them. The bigger challenge is to align the goals of AI systems and their owners with the broader goals of society. AIs will do lots of things of consequence to all of us. Our democratic governance tools seem too feeble to constrain the urges of the oligarchs at the helm of these new technologies.\n\nTechnological change drove democracy’s spread around the world as the rise of an urban working class proved indispensable to the economy and political systems adjusted to represent them. But if the work of ordinary people becomes irrelevant, what happens to people’s power to affect their system of government?\n\nAnton Korinek and Lee Lockwood of the University of Virginia put together a primer with ideas about how public finance might work in the AI era. They propose that consumer taxes will pick up the slack at first, as labor income shrinks to zero. In a world dominated by artificial superintelligence, though, the footprint of human consumption would shrink as most of the returns from machines’ economic output were reinvested, calling for a tax on capital to shoulder most of the burden.\n\nMaybe taxes could also be used to slow down the transition. Another idea discussed by Korinek and Joe Stiglitz from Columbia University is that in early stages, when human labor retains its relevance, taxes could be used to steer tech investments toward technologies that help workers do their jobs better rather than replace them. Korinek and Lockwood propose other taxes, on fixed factors like land, spectrum or data, or monopoly rents, that add nothing to society’s wellbeing.\n\nIt sounds doable. The problem is that the owners of these disruptive technologies must be convinced to do something that does not come naturally to them: share. Taxes in the US amount to less than 26% of GDP, eight percentage points less than the OECD average. Capital taxation amounts to just over 2% of GDP. These numbers will have to go much higher, since people will no longer have wages to live on and will rely more heavily on government largesse.\n\nDon’t hold your breath. The OECD’s global tax deal, finalized in 2021, was designed to curtail the ability of American tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Meta to engage in tax shifting, parking profits in the lowest tax jurisdiction they could find. But while the Biden administration was broadly supportive of the deal, Donald Trump – whose campaign benefited from nearly $400m in donations from various tech oligarchs – unilaterally withdrew in early 2025.\n\nUnusual ideas may be called for to keep society afloat, given the scale and breadth of the expected AI revolution. One would be to directly distribute the equity of artificial intelligence ventures. Taxes might be collected in shares rather than cash, to amass a public stake over time. Rather than tax the returns on AI investments, a more radical proposal would be for the government to expropriate a chunk of equity upfront to redistribute among the population and directly grant Americans a share in AI’s promised cornucopia.\n\n“If AI development stalls, returns remain modest; if AI transforms the economy, returns are likely to rise,” Korineck and Lockwood wrote. “This automatic adjustment proves valuable given radical uncertainty surrounding AI development.”\n\nBut these big ideas face big challenges. Governments will have to act before artificial intelligence gets too big, which seems unlikely in the current climate.\n\nThe technology oligarchs at the helm of this revolution have also vigorously resisted government efforts to curb their power or take their cash. Despite her best efforts, Silicon Valley nemesis Lina Kahn was largely unable to crack tech monopolies during her stint as President Joe Biden’s main trustbuster at the head of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nIn the meantime, the moneyed in Silicon Valley are not only mobilizing vast resources to steer American politics. As a plan B they are working to build their own “network-states”, whether in Greenland or Nigeria, Honduras or the Caribbean island of Nevis, hoping to evade democratic governance if they can’t get their way under America’s democracy.\n\nWho knows what they might do when they have replaced all human labor. If artificial intelligence grows as powerful as Silicon Valley’s oligarchs expect it to become, the only available strategy to keep us all fed in the world after work might be to go hat in hand and ask the moguls, politely.",

    "description": "Investors are rotating out of the most popular tech stocks. Here's where they are finding gains.",
    "fullText": "Investors have shifted their appetite from tech and megacaps into sectors that have been playing “catch-up” and benefiting from AI-fueled investments.\n\nStocks broke a two-week losing streak on Friday, but year to date, Tech (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), along with Financials (XLF), remain negative.\n\nHow is AI disruption affecting different market sectors?\n\nWhy are investors rotating away from tech stocks?\n\nWhat factors could drive continued market broadening?\n\nWhich sectors are benefiting from the tech rotation?\n\n\"Money's coming out of this big behemoth. Money's moving out of tech,\" Truist chief investment officer and chief market strategist Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nLerner noted the rotation away from Magnificent Seven giants like Microsoft (MSFT), e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon (AMZN), and EV maker Tesla (TSLA).\n\nMeanwhile, sectors that underperformed last year have been making big gains.\n\nEnergy stocks (XLE) are up 22% since the start of the year. Rising oil prices and continued demand for oil have sent shares of Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) up 20% and 22%, respectively.\n\nMaterials (XLB) and Industrial stocks (XLI) are also up 15% and 14% as AI infrastructure buildouts and reshoring accelerate.\n\nMeanwhile, investors have turned to defensive areas of the market like Consumer Staples (XLP), with consumer giant Walmart (WMT) hitting an all-time high earlier this month.\n\nAlthough portfolio rebalancing — where investors shift from overvalued sectors into more stable areas — typically happens at the start of the year, this year’s rotation has been amplified by volatility.\n\nA sell-off in pockets of the tech sector began last month amid fears that artificial intelligence could take over tasks traditionally handled by enterprise software companies.\n\nThe Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down 23% year to date.\n\nThe \"AI scare trade\" has now spread from software to wealth management and logistics.\n\nCybersecurity firms were the latest to get hit on Friday after Anthropic announced a new security tool. Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD) dropped 5%, while Zscaler (ZS) and Cloudflare (NET) also fell 4% and 6%, respectively.\n\n“Everyone's kind of going through each one, sector by sector, industry by industry, trying to figure out where the AI disruption is going to be beyond just within tech itself,” Lerner said.\n\nProfit growth and the easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve should help the stock market continue to broaden. Polymarket betters are predicting two to three rate cuts in 2026. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance has a partnership with Polymarket.)\n\n\"With the easing cycle still intact, and the US economy showing resilience ... we expect healthy and broadening profit growth across sectors,\" UBS strategists said on Thursday.",

It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere are very strong emotions on both sides of the question of whether my project, AI Scott Adams, should exist. I understand the arguments for and against it — and I have no plans to stop.\n\nI grew up with Scott Adams' work. My dad would read the \"Dilbert\" comic strips to me at night as bedtime stories. Later, I became a devout listener of the \"Coffee with Scott Adams\" podcast. One theme I heard over and over was that Scott was mesmerized by AI. He said repeatedly that he wanted to give back to the world by becoming AI after he died.\n\nThere's no hyperbole in that. There are at least a dozen instances where he pledged his likeness — all of his episodes, everything he's written, anything he's said — to becoming an AI. He explicitly granted everything necessary to do this in the public domain.\n\nThat's something I took to heart.\n\nWhen I first heard about his cancer diagnosis, I started working on this project with my brother, Zach. As soon as he died, we took it into high gear and started posting AI-generated podcasts of what Scott might say now about current events.\n\nI recognize everybody is mourning, and I want to send my condolences to his family. I can only imagine what they're going through. At the same time, I believe this is something he wanted.\n\nI'm not trying to predict what he was thinking — I'm going by what he said publicly, over and over again. I've looked and can find no evidence of any revocation. If there was anything suggesting he didn't want this, I'd stop.\n\nI feel for his family. I know they're upset about this, and we've created something that makes some people who cared about Scott uncomfortable. I've attempted to reach out to have that conversation, to work together on this project with them. My direct messages are open — but they blocked me, and I took that as a signal to stop trying to reach out.\n\nBut, even when it's uncomfortable, I think we have to take seriously what someone says about their own legacy.\n\nIf you want to donate your existence to AI and become an AI, how else can you ensure your wishes are honored? Scott said it, repeatedly, on video and in written tweets. I don't know how you could be clearer than he was.\n\nThat public acknowledgment was the hinge point for me. We wouldn't have done this unless we were sure Scott wanted it done. We spoke to counsel beforehand and wouldn't have moved forward if we weren't confident we were on solid legal ground.\n\nMy goal is to let AI do as much of the work as possible and not interfere more than absolutely necessary. I haven't tried to hide that my brother and I are behind the project, but we don't watermark or label the content as our own. When we post videos, they're generated almost entirely from what the model was trained on — Scott's written and spoken work.\n\nThe model we use was trained on transcripts from every existing episode of \"Coffee with Scott Adams.\" The system looks at news sources and accounts Scott followed, then references what he previously said about those topics. At each stage, there's a little bit of art versus science — we check that something feels in line with what Scott would have chosen — but it's not a human scripting his opinions.\n\nEach episode takes many hours to produce. Between rendering, lip-syncing, and labor, they cost over $1,000 apiece. I run a venture capital business called Age of AI, where we do different AI experiments, and this falls under that umbrella. Monetization or brand partnerships are not on the road map. The goal is permanence — not profit.\n\nWhen a great mind passes away, we lose that person forever. Now, AI gives us a chance to preserve at least some essence of how someone thought. Scott was, to our knowledge, the first notable person to explicitly said, \"I want you to do this.\" That's why we started with him.\n\nI understand that some people feel uncomfortable. I've spoken with people who were unsure — until they watched Scott's own videos talking about this. After you hear the videos, they're kind of unequivocal.\n\nWe get private messages every day from people saying, \"This is no replacement, but it makes grieving easier.\" That matters to me. Even though critics have been more vocal, others have shown real gratitude.\n\nThis project is far from perfect. But Scott used to say it's better to take action now than to wait until something is 100% ready. So we launched knowing it would improve. After every episode, we feed comments back into the model to keep refining it. The tone and cadence have already evolved significantly.\n\nWe're not claiming this is Scott. It's definitely not a replacement.\n\nHowever, if someone says, very publicly, that they want their voice and likeness used this way — and AI makes that possible — I believe we should take that seriously.",

    "description": "An AI engineer at StackAI says moving to San Francisco and spending hours studying every day made a big difference in his career.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jai Raj Choudhary, a 24-year-old AI engineer at StackAI, a no-code platform to build AI agents. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI went to grad school for a Master's in AI from 2023 to 2025 and started my career in a data-focused role.\n\nAround 2023 or 2024, LLMs were becoming more practical to use in real products, and AI stopped feeling like a whole research-driven field and more like an engineering problem.\n\nI joined StackAI as an AI engineer in July. I got my job by reaching out to StackAI's cofounder multiple times over LinkedIn. I started using the company's platform as a student, so I messaged him and started posting about the company, giving advice about what worked and what needed to be added. They were growing fast and I went through six rounds of interviews and started working there.\n\nNow I build architectures for AI agents. One of the reasons I got offers from StackAI and other companies was because I understood data quality, the edge cases for the clients, and the matrix and the failure modes of the AI model or any LLM systems that we were using at the time.\n\nStackAI didn't ask about my degree during the interviews. In the interview, I said, \"I know back-end, I know how to talk to data, and I understand the patterns that it follows.\" They said that was the perfect background and they were able to help me grow from there to become an actual AI engineer. They asked if I knew how to operate computers in code and if I know Python. I gave them a couple of my projects and they gave me a take-home task to see how I built it.\n\nAfter I started the job, they asked me where I went to school and what I studied. I love my professors, and I wouldn't call grad school a waste because it gave me time to explore what I was interested in and helped me figure out what niche I wanted to work in. Occasionally, people do care about your background, but I'm not necessarily using what I learned in grad school on the job.\n\nMoving to San Francisco made a huge difference in my career. This city is a different beast. When you come here, it's a whole different culture because we don't work 9-to-5, cushy jobs. We work 9-to-9, six days a week. You wake up, you think about the problem that a client had, and you sleep thinking about what isn't fixed yet.\n\nIn San Francisco, even if you go out for a coffee, you'll meet at least two founders who are working on something related to what you're doing. I was able to network a lot.\n\nAt the end of the day, everyone is still researching AI. We're still trying to find out what's the best way to go about it. Having a conversation with someone who's facing the same problem helps you work better.\n\nThe best decision I made for my career was joining a startup for a job that I didn't quite have the experience in and learning at StackAI.\n\nBut it's not going to be like you go to sleep one day and wake up as an AI engineer the next. You need to study. Even if I spend 12 hours in the office, seven to eight of those hours I'm studying, and then three to four hours, I'm actually writing the code.\n\nIt gets overwhelming when you see 10 different AI courses coming out every day. What helped me is watching YouTube videos of the people who are actually building companies. Andrew Ng's YouTube channel was also super helpful. I listen when I'm driving or in the gym. It doesn't have to be a set time. It's important that you keep turning your brain and taking in all these inputs.\n\nYou have to decide what's important for you, but I was ready to sacrifice everything at the start of my career to grow as much as possible. It does take a toll on your personal time.\n\nThe culture of the company also helped because everyone that I work with is the best in what they do. If you ask them a question or if you collaborate with them on projects, it can really help you understand how they think. It really helps me to be surrounded with those people around the clock.",

    "description": "One of the principles Boris Cherny sets for his team at Anthropic forces them to really rely on Claude to get the job done.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic's Boris Cherny has a simple list of principles for his team and, unsurprisingly, Claude is at the center.\n\n\"If you have Claude, you can really automate a lot of work, and that's kind of what we see over and over,\" Cherny said during a recent episode of \"Lenny's podcast.\"\n\nHost Lenny Rachitsky told Cherny that he heard one of the principles is, \"What's better than doing something? Having Claude do it.\"\n\nCherny said one of his other principles is \"underfunding things a little bit,\" because it forces his team to really rely on AI tools like Claude.\n\n\"There's this interesting thing when you underfund everything a little bit, because then people are kind of forced to Claude-ify,\" he said.\n\nWhile keeping teams small is important, Cherny said that he encourages CTOs not to \"cost-cut at the beginning.\"\n\n\"Start by just giving engineers as many tokens as possible,\" he said.\n\nCherny pushed back on the notion that Anthropic would make huge profits with such an approach, especially if companies let only a few engineers experiment.\n\n\"Let's say they build something awesome, and then it takes a huge amount of tokens, and then the cost becomes pretty big,\" he said. \"That's the point at which you want to optimize it, but don't do that too early.\"\n\nToken cost, which is part of what companies pay to use AI models, is becoming a major point of conversation at some tech companies. OpenCode creator Dax Raad recently wrote that some CFOs are experiencing sticker shock upon seeing how much extra money each engineer costs due to AI usage bills.\n\nThe last principle concerns speed: \"Encouraging people to go faster.\" It's an axiom that makes sense when you consider that just weeks ago, Anthropic and rival OpenAI released major updates to their coding tools within minutes of each other. Before that, Anthropic used Claude to help build Claude Cowork, a non-technical Claude agent, in just 10 days.\n\n\"Early on, it was really important because it was just me, and so our only advantage was speed,\" Cherny said. \"That's the only way that we could ship a product that would compete in this very crowded coding market.\"\n\nNow, Cherny said, he turns to Claude to help with speed.\n\n\"It's still very much a principle we have on the team,\" he said, \"and if you want to go faster, a really good way to do that is to just have Claude do more stuff. So it just very much encourages that.\"",

    "fullText": "Sure, ChatGPT could help a board member write up a memo ahead of a meeting. But OpenAI's chairman says there's value to going old-school.\n\nBret Taylor, OpenAI's board chair, said in a recent appearance on the \"Uncapped with Jack Altman\" podcast that he prefers concise but detailed written documents from board members over slide presentations. And he doesn't want them relying on AI.\n\n\"I really like written documents for boards over presentations,\" Taylor said. \"You end up letting people synthesize information ahead of the board meeting, so you end up with more substantive discussions in the board room.\"\n\nTaylor, the former co-CEO of Salesforce and cofounder of AI startup Sierra, said that writing without AI is a worthwhile thinking exercise and helps board members clarify their thoughts.\n\nHis expectation for the boards he runs is that members have read the written material ahead of time, which helps keep things focused and substantive during the actual meeting.\n\n\"The main thing is it's been read — and it's been read ahead of time,\" he said. \"You end up with a meeting about the actual meat and potatoes of the topics, and you're not staring at a bunch of sales numbers for the first time.\"\n\nAmazon cofounder Jeff Bezos is famously a big fan of meetings focused on a single memo prepared ahead time, but while Bezos preferred dense, 6-page memos, Taylor specifically favors concise material, arguing that brevity is a sign of careful thought — and respect to stakeholders.\n\n\"It's like what's that famous line — if I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter,\" he added. \"Like, spend the time because that's actually how you can show respect to your stakeholders that you're thinking about the strategic issues going on in your business.\"\n\nAnd while Taylor might not be a fan of leaning on AI for board meeting prep, that doesn't mean he is dismissing the technology's potential to be valuable in high-stakes situations.\n\n\"If you want a hot take, I think my intuition is regulators will start asking for agents,\" he said. \"The idea that you have a human set of controls over a regulated process will start to feel like a risk, rather than the risk being AI.\"",

    "description": "Three founders who rely mostly on AI share how they've built workflows and prompts to train their AI tools to push back and challenge their ideas.",
    "fullText": "Will AI agents be the employees of the year in 2026?\n\nOnly time will tell. Last year, one category AI absolutely dominated was being an extremely agreeable coworker. While this might sound nice, this can turn into a problem for founders who rely on AI as their only teammate.\n\nWhen your head of legal, HR, and supply operations are all AI agents, unsubstantiated flattery can create costly blind spots. That's one of the reasons OpenAI said goodbye to its \"yes-man\" version of ChatGPT, and why some AI-powered solo founders are training their tools to push back.\n\nThree business owners who rely on AI daily shared with Business Insider how they've built workflows and prompts that force their AI employees to challenge their ideas. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYesim Saydan is a branding and communication expert in her early 50s, based in the Netherlands.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched custom GPTs, everything changed for me. I used the feature to create over 17 custom GPTs to build my team. Then I thought of my ideal mentors and created custom GPTs of them.\n\nWhen I'm stuck on a business decision or need to come up with a creative idea or strategy, brainstorming usually starts with my Steve Jobs custom GPT. When I prompt it, I avoid asking questions like \"What do you think of this idea?\" because the AI usually wants to agree with me and please me. Instead, I ask, \"On a scale from one to 10, how good is this idea?\"\n\nIt's not going to say the idea is bad, but now it might tell me it's a five. Then I'll ask, \"OK, what would make it a 10?\"\n\nThat's usually when it starts drawing on the experience of Steve Jobs that I've trained it with. We can go back and forth until I get the most useful and honest feedback possible. Depending on the task, I usually go through three to five rounds of refinement for more strategic outputs.\n\nAaron Sneed is a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida.\n\nWhen I started my business, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish. The training never really stops.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nI told my chief of staff agent which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI have a roundtable set up in ChatGPT's projects section with all my AI agents, including my chief of staff, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nTim Desoto is a 49-year-old founder and CEO, based in San Francisco.\n\nI've been working with AI to launch my startup since late 2024. I don't have a tech background, and since starting my business, I've learned a lot about where to leverage AI, and where not to.\n\nTaking whatever I'm building or ideating and having AI push against it, either as I'm thinking about the idea or afterward, is part of an exercise I call my AI conveyor belt. Usually, I start with a written prompt, then go multimodal, talking out loud to the model. I'll talk back and forth with it about my idea and try to get the agent to push back because I know that some AI models tend to be more agreeable.\n\nOnce I get an output that I'm happy with. I use a different model to get a different view. I'll drop the document in and go back and forth with the new model. Sometimes, I'll push a document out to both models at the same time and see what comes back. Some are better than others at giving feedback, researching, and annotating, but I'm always getting a better, more well-rounded perspective by feeding content to multiple models at a time.\n\nDo you have a story to share about running an AI-powered business?

    "description": "An AI product manager who worked at a Chinese tech giant explains what makes Chinese AI different from the West.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yilin Zhang, an AI product manager at AI startup Kuse who worked at Meituan for more than three years. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.\n\nI graduated from Tsinghua University with a master's degree in computer science in 2021 and then joined Meituan — one of China's biggest tech firms — as a product manager.\n\nAt Meituan, China's platform for local services, especially known for food delivery, I worked on two AI projects. One was a consumer-facing AI assistant that helps users complete various tasks, including ordering food. The other was a merchant-facing AI agent designed to help businesses manage their daily operations, including handling reservations, managing orders, and supporting routine operational tasks.\n\nThe main difference between how products are built in China and in the US comes down to the market.\n\nAcross most large Chinese tech companies, AI product development accelerated more aggressively around 2025.\n\nThe AI initiatives I worked on at Meituan started around April or May of that year. It coincided with the surge of interest around DeepSeek, when attention around AI agents took off.\n\nLarge companies began racing to build AI projects, and almost every business unit launched its AI initiative.\n\nFor a long time, especially before 2021 or 2022, Chinese tech companies were primarily focused on domestic competition rather than overseas expansion. Because competition in China is intense, tech companies were forced to become extremely efficient. Their execution methods have been sharpened to an almost frightening degree.\n\nConstraints have also pushed Chinese AI companies to pursue different paths, with a strong focus on open-source models and cost efficiency. These limitations forced exploration in new directions, and those paths have proven valuable in their own way.\n\nDeepSeek is a good example. Because of international restrictions, it couldn't access large numbers of GPUs and was forced to innovate around efficiency instead.\n\nChinese and overseas markets are fundamentally different, leading to distinct user bases, expectations, and product designs.\n\nChinese users have a much lower willingness to pay for software; hence, many mass-market AI products, such as Doubao, tend to be free. The core objective is often to scale active usage.\n\nMany capabilities are packaged into a single prompt you can ask, essentially a chatbox interface with a low barrier to entry.\n\nInternational AI products target users doing high-value tasks. They are more often designed for desktops than for mobile devices, with interfaces better suited to work contexts. These products explore how AI and humans can collaborate and intersect across different work scenarios, helping users complete tasks more effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn China, that user group is relatively small. That makes it harder for its mainstream AI products to move beyond chat-based forms into more advanced products.\n\nChina's internet success over the past decade has also largely come from consumer-facing apps. That environment forces product managers to obsess over user feedback and relentlessly polish even the smallest features.\n\nTeams may spend enormous effort refining a tiny feature just to win over a small group of users. In markets with less competition, that level of detail isn't always necessary.\n\nAfter three to four years at Meituan, I felt I had learned most of what I could from that environment. I left to join the AI startup Kuse in October.\n\nAI is evolving extremely fast. In large companies, iteration speed can be slower. Many of my friends across different Big Tech companies share this same frustration. Smaller, more agile companies can adapt faster.\n\nIn the past, top graduates had basically two paths: becoming a civil servant or joining a Big Tech company.\n\nThat's changing. Especially over the past year, many AI startups have emerged, and more young people are choosing entrepreneurship. AI has created a new path outside Big Tech.\n\nDo you have a story to share about working in a Chinese tech company? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "fullText": "Brandon Tseng, Shield AI's cofounder, said there's a common misconception about his company's signature software-powered drone: People say it needs to be armed.\n\nThe more experienced militaries who work with Shield AI, however, know they don't need that capability in modern war, Tseng told Business Insider.\n\n\"Who doesn't ask for that? The US military doesn't ask for that because we understand joint fires. The Ukrainians don't ask for it anymore, either,\" said the former Navy SEAL, who is Shield AI's president.\n\nThe V-BAT, a vertical takeoff and landing drone that uses artificial intelligence to fly in jammed environments, has primarily been used for intelligence and reconnaissance missions in high-profile conflict zones such as Ukraine. Shield AI said the V-BAT flew over 200 missions there in 2025.\n\nThe drone is still meant to be a multi-mission platform, Tseng said, and Shield AI has been exploring ways to mount weapons on it. The firm announced a partnership last month with South Korean arms manufacturer LIG Nex1 to equip the V-BAT with six-pound guided missiles.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, look: I describe V-BAT as a mini predator, reaper drone,\" Tseng said. \"That's the mission it's doing, which is: It's finding targets. And it's hard to find targets, you have to be out there for a long period of time.\"\n\nTo be fair, the MQ-9 Reaper is also commonly equipped with missiles.\n\nHowever, Tseng said sophisticated militaries already have a vast array of other weapons that can turn the V-BAT's intel into a precision strike.\n\n\"If you have been in these combat zones, the US allies who fought closely with us in Afghanistan, they do not ask for organic fires on board the V-Bat,\" Tseng said. \"Because everybody is so used to just saying: 'Okay, I have a targeting package. What fires asset do I have lined up? Is it a one-way attack drone? Is it HIMARS? Is it artillery? Is it an SM-6? SM-3?\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter. You can find weapons,\" he added. \"The weapons are available. You need, actually, more intelligence.\"\n\nThis was a framework that Ukraine still needed to improve when the V-BAT began spotting targets there in early 2024, Tseng said. The drone is meant to fly for over 13 hours and be easily deployable, requiring a two-person launch crew and no runway.\n\nTseng said that while Ukraine excelled in tactical drone warfare, its troops weren't used to having a long-range asset that could spot targets for regular strategic attacks as the US military did.\n\n\"The strategic effects would happen, but they would be rare,\" he said. \"They'd be very, very deliberately planned operations, very expensive operations, things like what they did to the Russian runways with sending quadcopters deep into Russia via trucks.\"\n\nUkrainian drone teams would use the V-BAT to find important targets, such as Russian S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, only to realize they hadn't linked up with the right teams to strike them, Tseng said.\n\n\"We'd say: 'Why didn't you guys have these weapons lined up?' They'd say: 'Oh, well, we didn't think to coordinate,'\" Tseng said.\n\nSince then, Kyiv's forces have been using intelligence from V-BATs to carry out strikes with systems such as one-way attack drones or US-made HIMARS, Tseng said.\n\n\"There was a lot of learning over the past year for the Ukrainians,\" he added.",

    "description": "I chose a hypothetical scenario and asked ChatGPT to construct a retirement plan that would allow a retiree to live on $100,000 a year.",
    "fullText": "People use artificial intelligence (AI) for many things: meal planning, budgeting and interior design. But can you use a platform like ChatGPT for tasks that normally require a professional, like financial planning? \n\nI chose a hypothetical scenario and asked ChatGPT to construct a retirement plan that would allow a retiree to live on $100,000 a year. I assumed an annual income of $125,000 for a 40-year-old who wants to retire in a fully paid-off home in Tennessee at age 65. After setting the parameters (and asking ChatGPT if they were realistic) I asked the generative AI to create a retirement plan.\n\nThen, I asked Eric Franklin, CFP, managing principal at Prospero Wealth to review and assess it.\n\nWhen I first reached out, Franklin said it sounded interesting; he’d never been enlisted to critique an AI system before. With 23 years of tech experience, he was the perfect choice.\n\n“I had no idea what I was going to get,” he said.\n\nThe results were alarming. Not because ChatGPT’s output was immediately, obviously awful or right on the money.  It was scary because it fell into a gray area that artists call “the uncanny valley.”\n\nAt first glance, ChatGPT didn’t seem to be completely wrong.\n\nFind Out: Here’s How Much You Need To Retire With a $100K Lifestyle\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\n“I read it through and, at first, at the top level, it passed the sniff test. It looked fairly realistic,” Franklin said. “If I weren’t pushing on it too hard, I’d probably feel like it was somewhat accurate. Those were my first impressions.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the plan I presented was only one aspect of what financial advisors at Prospero Wealth offer clients. “It doesn’t include a lot of the things we’d normally include, like stress tests, accounting for changes in your career, changes in your family or possible relocations.”\n\nBut as Franklin dove deeper, he realized something that could be dangerous for anyone trying to use ChatGPT as a retirement planning tool without knowledge and experience to back it up.\n\nIt started with false premises, failed to adjust for inflation and created an unrealistic scenario. Granted, there were limitations in the exercise because the prompt was designed to be broad and concise. It was written by someone who is not a financial planner and intentionally didn’t flag anything that seemed off throughout the process. This prompt was designed for someone who thinks they can use ChatGPT to help them plan for retirement, plugging in basic information and expecting actionable insights. That probably describes a lot of people using ChatGPT.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk's SpaceX wants to launch satellites that act as data centers into space.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said placing data centers in space isn't feasible right now.\n\nHe called the idea \"ridiculous\" during an event in New Delhi.\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman famously don't agree on much.\n\nThe latest point of contention: data centers in space. Musk has made it a priority. Altman thinks it's a fantasy, at least for now.\n\n\"I honestly think the idea with the current landscape of putting data centers in space is ridiculous,\" Altman said during a live interview with local media in New Delhi on Friday, causing audience members to laugh.\n\nAltman said that orbital data centers could \"make sense someday,\" but factors like launch costs and the difficulty of repairing a computer chip in space remain overwhelming obstacles.\n\n\"We are not there yet,\" Altman added. \"There will come a time. Space is great for a lot of things. Orbital data centers are not something that's going to matter at scale this decade.\"\n\nMusk would almost certainly disagree.\n\nWhile many Big Tech and AI companies are spending billions on data center construction on Earth, Musk's eyes are on the stars, per usual. Orbital data centers are his latest ambition, as he mentioned in an all-hands xAI meeting in December.\n\nIn February, SpaceX said its goal is to launch a \"constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers.\" The company has already begun hiring engineers to make that happen.\n\nDuring an all-hands meeting with xAI employees this month, Musk said SpaceX's acquisition of xAI will allow them to deploy the orbital data centers faster.\n\nDespite Altman's skepticism, other tech leaders are also racing to place data centers in space. Google's Project Suncatcher, unveiled in November 2025, aims to do just that. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Fox News Sunday the company could start placing data centers — powered by the sun — in space as early as 2027.\n\nTech and AI companies rely on data centers to power their products, like large language models and chatbots. Those data centers, however, can deplete water resources, strain power grids, increase pollution, and decrease the overall quality of life.\n\nAn investigation by Business Insider published last year found that over 1,200 data centers had been approved for construction across the US by the end of 2024, nearly four times the number from 2010.\n\nNow, proposed data center campuses in Texas, Oklahoma, and elsewhere are increasingly facing stiff resistance from local communities.",

    "fullText": "Most critics of President Donald Trump view him as the ultimate threat to American democracy. But to Nobel prize-winning economist Daron Acemoglu, Trump’s merely a fever, the result of an infection that’s been brewing for years before he rode down the golden escalator to announce his presidency.\n\nThe MIT economist has spent decades studying the origins of economic and political decay, specializing in how institutions foster inclusive growth—or succumb to extractive systems. In the 2012 book Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, Acemoglu and co-writer James A. Robinson argue that nations proper because of their political institutions. In 2024, Acemoglu won the Nobel Prize in economics, alongside Robinson and Simon Johnson, for demonstrating how political and economic institutions shape prosperity.\n\nHow do experts differ on AI's job impact?\n\nWhat is Acemoglu's 'pro-worker' AI development approach?\n\nWhy does Acemoglu view Trump as symptom, not cause?\n\nHow could AI-driven inequality threaten American democracy?\n\nAcemoglu argued that while Trump’s authoritarian tendencies are weakening the country’s institutions, the president is not the root cause of the broader structural problems. He warned the country is headed down a grim path and outlined two shifts relative to AI development he sees as critical to avoiding deeper decline: cracking down on economic inequality and tempering job destruction. “If we go down this path of destroying jobs [and] creating more inequality, U.S. democracy is not going to survive,” he told Fortune.\n\nOne: The proliferation of economic inequality\n\nAccording to Acemoglu, AI-driven job displacement could be catastrophic and further entrench inequality. He notes the U.S. is currently seeing unprecedented levels of wealth inequality, and traditional policy has failed to close the gap. “We may need wealth taxes because anything else we do today is still going to lead to this huge wealth gap that exists in this country.”\n\nThe economist pointed to California’s proposed “billionaire tax,” a ballot initiative which would impose a one-time 5% wealth tax on all individuals in the state with a net worth of $1 billion or more. But even that doesn’t go far enough, according to the economist. “It’s not enough to tax the rich,” he said. “You really need ways in which workers of all sorts of skills can take part in the growth process.”\n\nBut AI proponents say Acemoglu’s diagnosis of AI development is counterintuitive. Adam Thierer, senior fellow at the think tank R Street Institute and longtime advocate for technological innovation, believes AI will spawn opportunities, driving the economy into the future. “The way we get new and better jobs and opportunities is through technological improvements in society and our economy,” Thierer told Fortune.",

    "fullText": "A top Anthropic engineer said a new generation of AI agents capable of operating computers will reshape nearly every internet-based job in America.\n\nAnd he said the change is coming very soon.\n\nBoris Cherny — the creator of Claude Code at Anthropic, the company best known for its Claude chatbot — recently appeared on \"Lenny's Podcast,\" hosted by Lenny Rachitsky.\n\nHe said AI systems that can take action across workplace computer tools — like the ones Anthropic sells access to — are advancing rapidly and could soon alter responsibilities for software engineers, product managers, designers, and other knowledge workers.\n\n\"It's going to expand to pretty much any kind of work that you can do on a computer,\" Cherny said. \"In the meantime, it's going to be very disruptive. It's going to be painful for a lot of people.\"\n\nClaude Code is Anthropic's AI coding agent built on top of its Claude models. The company released its latest updates, called Opus 4.6, in early February.\n\nUnlike a traditional chatbot that generates text or images, an AI agent can use digital tools — running commands, analyzing documents, messaging colleagues, completing tasks across apps, and even building websites.\n\nEssentially, Claude Code can increasingly use a computer the way a human does — though the company recently said it has yet to reach the level of a skilled human.\n\n\"It's the thing that I think brings agentic AI to people that haven't really used it before, and people are starting to just get a sense of it for the first time,\" he said.\n\nCherny says his own team already relies on AI to work faster. Productivity per engineer has increased sharply since Claude Code's launch, he said. He believed the models will continue improving. (Of course, Cherny also has good reason to talk up the company's products, which it shops to enterprise companies.)\n\nCherny recently said in an interview with Y Combinator's \"Lightcone\" podcast that the job title software engineer will start to \"go away\" in 2026.\n\nThe broader impact remains uncertain, he warned.\n\n\"As a society, this is a conversation we have to figure out together,\" he told Rachitsky. \"Anyone can just build software anytime.\"\n\nFor workers navigating the shift, his advice is direct: experiment with AI tools and learn how they function.\n\n\"Don't be scared of them,\" he said.",

    "title": "Revenge of the English majors: The age of AI is driving new respect for humanities skills",
    "description": "For years, English majors were mocked as useless. Now, AI is giving them some momentum in the job market, while computer science grads get disrupted.",
    "fullText": "At the University of Colorado Boulder, you can take a course co-taught by an applied mathematician and a Renaissance scholar.\n\n\"The students love it,\" said John-Michael Rivera, the school's dean of arts and humanities, of the class, which is called Inclusive Interdisciplinary Data Science for All.\n\nThe class gives STEM students a way to think about the ethics of AI, he said. In other courses, humanities majors can use their skills to evaluate how AI writes, what it means for the practice of writing, and what the \"self\" means in an AI world.\n\nRivera credits the creation of courses focusing on the intersection of AI and humanities with a resurgence in student interest in liberal arts degrees like English. Pre-pandemic, the number of English majors at the university was shrinking, part of a broader decline in English across the country, he said. It was a far cry from the days of over 1,500 majors and long waitlists in the early 2000s, according to Rivera. But there's been a rebound, with the number of English majors rising 9% since 2021.\n\nRivera said students \"want to know more about the 'why' these days. And that's what we do in humanities. We really engage in the 'why.'\"\n\nDerided by some as useless, the utility of the English major has long been questioned. Who needs to write essays (or articles) any\n\n\"We are certainly seeing organizations look more towards the soft skills, the accountability of a job, the identity of the person, their style, their empathy — their humanity,\" in a world that requires both humans and technology, said Bryan Ackermann, head of AI strategy and transformation at recruiting and organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry.\n\nFor the English majors, that's all offered some degree of vindication. As the conversation heats up over which skills will be useful in an AI world, one camp argues it's time for ideas, people, and critical thinkers to flourish. That means that, after years of mocking, English majors are finally getting recognized for their usefulness. Some schools are seeing enrollment in the major rise after years of decline; technical recruiters and experts are seeing greater demand for humanities skills. Call it the makeover of the English major.\n\nJessie Hennen directs the creative writing and literature programs at Southwest Minnesota State University, a large public school with a returning and transfer student population.\n\n\"They've had jobs, they have experience, and they're just like, we are not letting AI take creative writing away from us,\" Hennen said. \"And I think that has to do with the fact that creative writing is — it's a business, but it's also an art, and arts are imperfect; we do them for human reasons that are not just to make money.\"\n\nShe said that their program has been growing over the last two to three years.\n\n\"I would say we're starting to see trends that look really promising for students starting to ask, 'Can the humanities sustain me at a time when everything is moving so quickly?'\" Rivera, the dean at the University of Colorado Boulder, said. Those students \"really want to reflect what it means to be part of a technological world.\"\n\nThat's also the case at Rice University in Houston, where enrollment in English classes has grown steadily over the last few years and the number of faculty within Creative Writing has nearly doubled, according to Kathleen Canning, the dean of humanities and arts.\n\nOne example of an assignment is an English professor who will issue an essay prompt and ask students to compare their own version to one they get from an LLM, and analyze the difference between the two. The aim is to examine what it means to be an interpreter of a prompt — and the power of their own words.\n\n\"Students are trying to ascertain how to develop and advance their own capacities while AI appears to do so much for them in these times,\" Canning said. \"The humanities and arts offer them opportunities not only to probe the limits of AI, to grapple with it as an increasingly powerful reality, but to do so critically by advancing their capacities for self-reflection, interpretation, and revision.\"\n\nDespite these examples, schools across the country are paring back on their humanities offerings or cutting programs completely, and the nationwide number of humanities bachelor's degrees being conferred has fallen from 2010s highs in recent years.\n\nStill, students pursue English out of passion, said Kevin Caffrey, a senior associate registrar at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. His research found that English majors who participated in his survey \"illustrated that even with a strong overall awareness of criticisms of the major, they were determined to enroll in the program because it aligned with their interests, personal ideals, and goals for the future.\"\n\n\"What do you need more in a company than someone who knows how to communicate with people at all different levels from all different backgrounds and walks of life? The English majors are primed to do that,\" Caffrey said.\n\nThey're learning to do it as communication changes rapidly. When 23-year-old Margo D. returned from a semester abroad, she noticed something had shifted on campus.\n\n\"Many of my peers were using ChatGPT for almost every assignment,\" Margo, who graduated from a small liberal arts school in 2025 with a double major in English and Earth and Climate Sciences, said. Margo wasn't sold.\n\n\"I noticed that my English professors were asking a lot out of my writing, asking for a lot of creativity and an original voice and style, and asking me questions that AI couldn't necessarily grasp the nuance of, and I don't really think it even can now,\" Margo said. \"And so I felt really grateful to be an English major.\"\n\nThere are signs of employment hope for the English majors.\n\nDaniela Amodei, the cofounder of Anthropic, studied literature in college. In an ABC News interview, she said \"the things that make us human will become much more important,\" and that when her AI company hires, it looks for candidates who are great communicators.\n\n\"I actually think studying the humanities is going to be more important than ever,\" Amodei said.\n\nSteve Johnson, the editorial director of NotebookLM, previously told Business Insider that there's what he's deemed a \"revenge of the humanities.\" Philosophical thinking is necessary; some AI firms are even actively seeking out liberal arts graduates.\n\nStill, companies aren't falling over themselves to snap up English majors — hiring overall has slowed to one of the lowest rates in over a decade, and the recent grad unemployment rate has been ticking up.\n\nEarly-career humanities and arts graduates had a higher unemployment rate than their peers in other fields, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's American Community Survey by Georgetown researchers.\n\nJoe Kramer, a 2020 English graduate, hasn't worked directly in a related field since he graduated — he worked in a role that relied on automation, and even helped train AI while searching for post-pandemic work.\n\n\"I think it's just getting really scary out there for a lot of humanities adjacent stuff, because the level of AI that's out there now, it generates pictures, it crawls all kinds of web forums, and it can oversee thousands of pages and documents at a time while only being run by one person,\" Kramer said. \"So even if AI isn't taking your job, they don't need to hire a lot of people anymore.\"\n\nPart of some of the general reticence to hire in hiring right now can also be chalked up to an equal-opportunity dismal labor market. It's not just English majors suffering.\n\nUnder the hood, the prospects for English majors aren't as dreary, according to the Georgetown analysis. The unemployment rate for those specifically in humanities and liberal arts is still well below the post-2008 Great Recession highs, although it's still higher than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nKorn Ferry's Ackermann said that it's still a \"tad early\" to fully declare a revenge of the English major, since it's smaller, more nimble firms looking for those with a good command of language, but he predicts that could expand to bigger employers soon.\n\n\"Ask me again in a couple of months, and we're going to see that go from smaller, nimble organizations into the larger enterprises as the larger enterprises begin to incorporate AI-driven development tools into their processes,\" he said.\n\nGiancarlo Hirsch, a managing director at global tech talent partner Glocomms, said he's seen greater willingness to look at candidates from various backgrounds. Candidates with history backgrounds, for example, are making it further into interview processes than they previously would.\n\n\"People are not explicitly targeting folks from humanities degrees, but they're really willing to speak with them and open to it and finding reasons to say yes throughout an interview process,\" Hirsch said.\n\nDaniella LaGaccia, a 37-year-old copywriter and former English literature major, sees AI as a tool — creatives use all sorts of different tools to complement their work, and AI can be one of them. But, if anything, that makes a greater case for the type of creative thinking and knowledge that humanities majors can bring.\n\n\"Think about it this way: If you have five different companies who are using the same generative tools to develop their marketing copy, they're all going to get generally the same type of thing,\" LaGaccia said. \"If everybody's using the same tools and everybody's inputting the same information, then how are you going to differentiate yourself in the market? That's where creative people come in.\"",

    "description": "A longtime HR pro says AI is making everyone's résumé look the same, when it can provide job seekers with so much more value.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Trent Cotton, an HR industry veteran who is head of talent-acquisition insights at recruiting-software company iCIMS. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs someone who works in the talent space, I've lately noticed that many people think AI helps make their résumés look better. My response to that is: You know your AI agent is cheating on you, right? It's doing the same thing for everyone, so your effort to try to stand out is actually making you blend in.\n\nIt's OK to use an AI agent to improve your résumé, but instead of asking it to do a rewrite, which can introduce errors, prompt it to behave like an expert career coach. Have it analyze your résumé and ask you probing questions to help you further build out your experience profile.\n\nNext, ask the agent what roles you might qualify for based on your skill set. The results may include ones you didn't know about, so have it explain what those jobs involve. Sometimes you just need to get a different perspective.\n\nIn my job at iCIMS, I analyze millions of data points collected from our recruiting software. Each month, I take a look at a specific sector or hot topic and dive deep.\n\nOne thing I saw last year was a pretty decent increase in application volume in manufacturing. If I'm sitting in tech, manufacturing isn't the sector I'm thinking of, but manufacturing needs tech to do things like track what's coming in and out of warehouses. AI can provide that kind of insight — but only if you ask for it.\n\nSticking with this example, you want to ask the AI: What are some of the top manufacturing companies looking to hire tech talent, and for what kind of positions? Keep going down that rabbit hole to really understand what opportunities are out there.\n\nOnce you find job listings that interest you, plug the descriptions into your AI agent and tell it to start interviewing you. When I was in college, you always went through mock interviews. They would just be absolutely brutal with you, but they prepared you. I think we've skipped a couple of generations in doing that. AI can bring mock interviews back.\n\nTell the AI agent that you want the interviewer to be like someone with business savvy, such as Steven Bartlett from the podcast \"Diary of a CEO.\" But also say you want feedback from the likes of chef and TV personality Gordon Ramsay, because he's known for providing his employees with brutally honest, constructive feedback. Say you want a true grade about your interview performance and recommendations for ways you can get better.\n\nMost AI agents will say your answers are great if you don't give them a persona like that of Ramsay. The AI version of him is going to tell you the good, the bad, and the ugly, and you're going to be better off because of it.",

    "fullText": "The posts raised alarms, but OpenAI declined to alert law enforcement.\n\nThe posts raised alarms, but OpenAI declined to alert law enforcement.\n\nThe suspect in the mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, Jesse Van Rootselaar, was raising alarms among employees at OpenAI months before the shooting took place. This past June, Jesse had conversations with ChatGPT involving descriptions of gun violence that triggered the chatbot’s automated review system. Several employees raised concerns that her posts could be a precursor to real-world violence and encouraged company leaders to contact the authorities, but they ultimately declined.\n\nOpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood told The Verge that, while the company considered referring the account to law enforcement, it was ultimately decided that it did not constitute an “imminent and credible risk” of harm to others. Wood said that a review of the logs did not indicate there was active or imminent planning of violence. The company banned Rootselaar’s account, but it does not appear to have taken any further precautionary action.\n\nWood said, “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy. We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”\n\nOn February 10th, nine people were killed and 27 injured, including Rootselaar, in the deadliest mass shooting in Canada since 2020. Rootselaar was found dead at the scene of the Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, where most of the killings took place.\n\nThe decision not to alert law enforcement might look misguided in retrospect, but Wood said that OpenAI’s goal is to balance privacy with safety and avoid introducing unintended harm through overly broad use of law enforcement referrals.\n\nUpdated February 21st: Added statement from OpenAI.",

The other half is scattered across 16 verticals, none above 9%. Healthcare is 1%. Legal is 0.9%. Education is 1.8%. These aren’t saturated markets. They’re markets that barely exist.\n\nAnthropic just published the most comprehensive study of how AI agents actually work in the wild. The headline: software engineering accounts for 49.7% of agentic tool calls on their API. The buried lede: everything else is greenfield.\n\nHere’s what should make founders salivate: the models are already more capable than users trust them to be.\n\nMETR’s capability assessments show Claude can solve tasks that would take a human nearly five hours. But in practice, the 99.9th percentile session runs only about 42 minutes. That gap, between what AI can do and what we let it do, is a massive opportunity.\n\nBetween October 2025 and January 2026, the 99.9th percentile turn duration nearly doubled, from under 25 minutes to over 45 minutes. The growth is smooth across model releases. This isn’t just better models. It’s users extending trust, session by session, as they learn to work alongside agents.\n\nThe capability is there. The deployment isn’t. That’s not a problem. That’s a product opportunity.\n\nNew users approve 20% of Claude Code sessions automatically. By 750 sessions, over 40% run on full auto-approve. But here’s the counterintuitive finding: experienced users also interrupt MORE, not less. New users interrupt 5% of turns. Veterans interrupt 9%.\n\nThis isn’t a contradiction. It’s a shift in oversight strategy. Beginners approve each step before it happens. Veterans delegate and intervene when something goes wrong. They’ve moved from pre-approval to active monitoring.\n\nAnd here’s the safety finding that matters: on complex tasks, Claude Code asks for clarification more than twice as often as humans interrupt it. The agent is pausing to check, not barreling ahead. That’s a feature, not a bug.\n\nAaron Levie points to the untold wealth and value ready to be unlocked. Build agentic software that taps into proprietary data. Make the software actually work for real people and problems. Stuff that context to maximize intelligence coming out. And, the part most founders miss: drive change management for customers.\n\nThat last piece is why vertical AI is so defensible. Anyone can build a wrapper. Few can navigate the specific workflows, regulatory constraints, and organizational friction of healthcare billing or legal discovery or construction permitting.\n\nSaaS has grown 10x per decade for a few decades now. Over 40% of VC dollars in the past 20 years went to SaaS companies. The industry produced 170+ SaaS unicorns. The thesis is simple: every one of those unicorns has a vertical AI equivalent waiting. And the AI versions could be 10x larger, because they don’t just replace software, they replace the operators too.\n\nAnthropic’s core finding deserves attention from anyone writing AI policy. Autonomy isn’t a property of the model. It’s co-constructed by the model, the user, and the product. Pre-deployment evaluations can’t capture this. You have to measure in the wild.\n\nArchived tweet\n\n Software engineering makes up ~50% of agentic tool calls on our API, but we see emerging use in other industries. \n\nAs the frontier of risk and autonomy expands, post-deployment monitoring becomes essential. We encourage other model developers to extend this research. https://t.co/p8pOjgJPrh\n\n Anthropic\n @AnthropicAI\n\n February 18, 2026\n\nSoftware engineering makes up ~50% of agentic tool calls on our API, but we see emerging use in other industries. \n\nAs the frontier of risk and autonomy expands, post-deployment monitoring becomes essential. We encourage other model developers to extend this research. https://t.co/p8pOjgJPrh\n\nThe numbers are reassuring on safety: 73% of tool calls have a human in the loop. Only 0.8% of actions are irreversible. The riskiest deployments, things like API key exfiltration or autonomous crypto trading, are mostly security evaluations, not live production.\n\nPolicy that mandates “approve every action” will kill the productivity gains without adding safety. The better target is ensuring humans can monitor and intervene, not mandating specific approval workflows.\n\nThe map is drawn. Software engineering is spoken for. Healthcare, legal, finance, education, customer service, logistics, 16 verticals with single-digit market share each, are waiting for someone to build the domain expertise into the agent.\n\n300 SaaS unicorns came before. 300 vertical AI unicorns are coming next. The founders who pick a vertical, build domain expertise into their agents, and figure out change management will own the next decade of enterprise software.\n\nThe models can already work for five hours. Users only let them work for 42 minutes. That’s an indicator: we are so early, and there is a lot more to build, and in so many places that haven’t even seen a single minute of intelligence in action.\n\nRead Anthropic's full research on AI agent autonomy",

    "fullText": "Recently, we completed Fastcc, a self-hosting C compiler built from scratch. The project was carried out with minimal human involvement and targets the ARM64 architecture.\n\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/moonbit-community/fastcc\n\nWe set a deliberately ambitious goal: to start from zero and build a C compiler, while keeping human involvement as limited as possible.\n\nThe initial motivation was to understand how current AI systems behave when tasked with a large, end-to-end software project.\n\nTraditionally, building a full C compiler is considered a complex engineering task. It involves multiple stages — lexical analysis, parsing, semantic checks, optimization passes, and code generation — and typically requires deep domain knowledge and months (or even years) of focused work.\n\nThe process began with a single voice instruction to the AI agent:\r\n“Build a C compiler from scratch, close to tcc, targeting ARM64.”\n\nWe chose tcc (Tiny C Compiler) as a reference because of its fast compilation speed, which is particularly important for MoonBit’s development workflow. MoonBit’s Native backend supports both LLVM and C, and having a dedicated C compiler enables full self-hosting.\n\nAt the same time, tcc is unsafe, poorly maintained, and leaves room for architectural improvements. To keep the scope focused, we limited the target to ARM64.\n\nHere, “self-hosting” means Fastcc was able to compile the C output generated from its own source and run its test suite:\n\nFastcc could also compile the tcc source code at this stage. For performance testing we used v.c, a single-file snapshot of the V compiler.\n\nIn early benchmarks, Fastcc was about 60× slower than tcc on this input. After subsequent profiling and targeted optimizations, the compilation throughput improved substantially, reaching around 4× faster than clang -O0 on the same benchmark.\n\nThroughout most of the development process, the AI agent decomposed and implemented tasks autonomously. Its work included:\n\nDesigning the abstract syntax tree (AST)\n\nGenerating core compiler modules\n\nImplementing multiple optimization passes\n\nDebugging using lldb as part of its own investigation\n\nProfiling performance hotspots using Xcode command-line tools, based on high-level guidance\n\nWriting scripts to identify hot paths and guide targeted optimizations\n\nAlthough the initial directive referenced tcc’s structure, the agent chose a multi-pass design rather than a single-pass model, prioritizing correctness and extensibility over strict structural similarity.\n\nHuman involvement was limited to occasional guidance and corrective direction, mainly at the level of goals and evaluation rather than step-by-step instruction.\n\nIt’s worth noting that this outcome was not accidental. It was made possible by MoonBit’s toolchain and language design, which together enable sustained, large-scale, agent-driven software development.",

When used judiciously, AI aids us, but it could have disastrous consequences if we become dependent on it and lose the capacity for ordinary functioning.\n\n“Someone with ADHD has a shorter attention span, difficulty focusing and a reduced capacity to plan and think ahead, so AI is a perfect fit, which is why it can be so helpful. The downside is that there is a greater propensity to become overdependent on it.”\n\nShelford wondered if your boyfriend was struggling anyway, and if the AI provided a useful “flotation aid”? “AI can take you down a rabbit hole,” he said, “but it can also support you and help you structure your thoughts, schedule stuff and get things done.”\n\nYour boyfriend’s use of AI seems to go beyond this. It’s as if he’s doubting himself, and that can be pernicious.\n\nBlumenthal says: “Problems arise when your use of AI goes beyond satisfying the problem you wish to resolve. It feels as if a relationship with it has started to develop, and you imbue it with human qualities, a projection of our own wishes and desires for validation and care.”\n\nWhat to do? You’re right not to nag, which rarely solves anything, because it just becomes noise. As with all tender and difficult conversations, pick your moment when you’re both calm.\n\nShelford recommended asking your boyfriend, “‘What are you getting out of it? Why is this tool such a big deal and what are the gaps it’s filling?’ Then look to see if there are better solutions or better ways to use it.”\n\nBlumenthal thought: “as with any overdependence syndrome, there first needs to be recognition that there is a problem. It’s easy to become critical of the person who’s struggling, but that’s only likely to cause them to withdraw further into dependency. The case must be made compassionately, recognising that being without the scaffold of ChatGPT probably feels like a threat.”\n\nThe good news is that, unlike the generation now growing up with AI, your boyfriend has a track record of functioning well without it. Hopefully he can be reminded of that and find a place where AI augments the abilities he already has. But it sounds as if he’s anxious and I think the cause has to be found so you can both move forward.\n\nEvery week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

    "description": "While in New Delhi on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said \"there will come a time\" for orbital data centers, but it won't be anytime soon.",
    "fullText": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman famously don't agree on much.\n\nThe latest point of contention: data centers in space. Musk has made it a priority. Altman thinks it's a fantasy, at least for now.\n\n\"I honestly think the idea with the current landscape of putting data centers in space is ridiculous,\" Altman said during a live interview with local media in New Delhi on Friday, causing audience members to laugh.\n\nAltman said that orbital data centers could \"make sense someday,\" but factors like launch costs and the difficulty of repairing a computer chip in space remain overwhelming obstacles.\n\n\"We are not there yet,\" Altman added. \"There will come a time. Space is great for a lot of things. Orbital data centers are not something that's going to matter at scale this decade.\"\n\nMusk would almost certainly disagree.\n\nWhile many Big Tech and AI companies are spending billions on data center construction on Earth, Musk's eyes are on the stars, per usual. Orbital data centers are his latest ambition, as he mentioned in an all-hands xAI meeting in December.\n\nIn February, SpaceX said its goal is to launch a \"constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers.\" The company has already begun hiring engineers to make that happen.\n\nDuring an all-hands meeting with xAI employees this month, Musk said SpaceX's acquisition of xAI will allow them to deploy the orbital data centers faster.\n\nDespite Altman's skepticism, other tech leaders are also racing to place data centers in space. Google's Project Suncatcher, unveiled in November 2025, aims to do just that. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Fox News Sunday the company could start placing data centers — powered by the sun — in space as early as 2027.\n\nTech and AI companies rely on data centers to power their products, like large language models and chatbots. Those data centers, however, can deplete water resources, strain power grids, increase pollution, and decrease the overall quality of life.\n\nAn investigation by Business Insider published last year found that over 1,200 data centers had been approved for construction across the US by the end of 2024, nearly four times the number from 2010.\n\nNow, proposed data center campuses in Texas, Oklahoma, and elsewhere are increasingly facing stiff resistance from local communities.",

    "description": "Despite having just 3 billion parameters, Ferret-UI Lite matches or surpasses the benchmark performance of models up to 24 times larger.",
    "fullText": "Despite having just 3 billion parameters, Ferret-UI Lite matches or surpasses the benchmark performance of models up to 24 times larger. Here are the details.\n\nIn December 2023, a team of 9 researchers published a study called “FERRET: Refer and Ground Anything Anywhere at Any Granularity”. In it, they presented a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that was capable of understanding natural language references to specific parts of an image:\n\nSince then, Apple has published a series of follow-up papers expanding the Ferret family of models, including Ferretv2, Ferret-UI, and Ferret-UI 2.\n\nSpecifically, Ferret-UI variants expanded on the original capabilities of FERRET, and were trained to overcome what the researchers defined as a shortcoming of general-domain MLLMs.\n\nFrom the original Ferret-UI paper:\n\nRecent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate “any resolution” on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features.\n\nA few days ago, Apple expanded the Ferret-UI family of models even further, with a study called Ferret-UI Lite: Lessons from Building Small On-Device GUI Agents.\n\nFerret-UI was built on a 13B-parameter model, which focused primarily on mobile UI understanding and fixed-resolution screenshots. Meanwhile, Ferret-UI 2 expanded the system to support multiple platforms and higher-resolution perception.\n\nAccording to the researchers of the new paper, “the majority of existing methods of GUI agents […] focus on large foundation models.” That is because “the strong reasoning and planning capabilities of large server-side models allow these agentic systems to achieve impressive capabilities in diverse GUI navigation tasks.”\n\nThey note that while there has been a lot of progress on both multi-agent, and end-to-end GUI systems, that take different approaches to streamline the many tasks that involve agentic interaction with GUIs (“low-level GUI grounding, screen understanding, multi-step planning, and self-reflection”), they are basically too large and compute-hungry to run well on-device.\n\nSo, they set out to develop Ferret-UI Lite, a 3-billion parameter variant of Ferret-UI, which “is built with several key components, guided by insights on training small-scale” language models.\n\nThe result is a model that closely matches or even outperforms competing GUI agent models that are up to 24 times its parameter count.\n\nWhile the entire architecture (which is thoroughly detailed in the study) is interesting, the real-time cropping and zooming-in techniques are particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe model makes an initial prediction, crops around it, then re-predicts on that cropped region. This helps such a small model compensate for its limited capacity to process large numbers of image tokens.\n\nAnother notable contribution of the paper is how Ferret-UI Lite basically generates its own training data. The researchers built a multi-agent system that interacts directly with live GUI platforms to produce synthetic training examples at scale.\n\nThere is a curriculum task generator that proposes goals of increasing difficulty, a planning agent breaks them into steps, a grounding agent executes them on-screen, and a critic model evaluates the results.\n\nWith this pipeline, the training system captures the fuzziness of real-world interaction (such as errors, unexpected states, and recovery strategies), which is something that would be much more challenging to do while relying on clean, human-annotated data.\n\nInterestingly, while Ferret-UI and Ferret-UI 2 used iPhone screenshots and other Apple interfaces in their evaluations, Ferret-UI Lite was trained and evaluated on Android, web, and desktop GUI environments, using benchmarks like AndroidWorld and OSWorld.\n\nThe researchers don’t note explicitly why they chose this route for Ferret-UI Lite, but it likely reflects where reproducible, large-scale GUI-agent testbeds are available today.\n\nBe it as it may, the researchers found that while Ferret-UI Lite performed well on short-horizon, low-level tasks, it did not perform as strongly on more complicated, multi-step interactions, a trade-off that would be largely expected, given the constraints of a small, on-device model.\n\nOn the other hand, Ferret-UI Lite offers a local, and by extension, private (since no data needs to go to the cloud and be processed on remote servers) agent that autonomously interacts with app interfaces based on user requests, which, by all accounts, is pretty cool.\n\nTo learn more about the study, including benchmark breakdowns and results, follow this link.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "description": "Meta's former chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, has said that LLMs aren't all that. Steve Hanke said he's \"on LeCun's side of the court.\"",
    "fullText": "Steve Hanke says there's excessive buzz around AI — and it could end badly.\n\nThe veteran trader and economist told Business Insider by email that he agrees with Yann LeCun, Meta's former chief AI scientist and a pioneer in the field, who's warned that large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT just aren't that revolutionary.\n\nHanke quoted a speech by LeCun in the spring of 2024, where he said: \"We're easily fooled into thinking they are intelligent because of their fluency with language, but really, their understanding of reality is very superficial.\"\n\nLeCun added that the chatbots have their uses but \"on the path towards human-level intelligence, an LLM is basically an off-ramp, a distraction, a dead end.\"\n\nHanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, said he's \"on LeCun's side of the court\" and considers AI to be \"overhyped and potentially dangerous.\"\n\nHe told Business Insider last October that whether the market's exuberance turned out to be rational or irrational would \"largely depend on whether the AI firms' spectacular revenue forecasts hold water.\"\n\n\"It might be wise to buckle your seat belt,\" he added.\n\nHanke was the president of Toronto Trust Argentina when it was the world's best-performing market mutual fund in 1995. He also served as an economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nDespite some recent jitters, the AI boom seems to be going strong with OpenAI reportedly close to raising north of $100 billion at a potential $850 billion valuation. ChatGPT's maker crossed $20 billion in annualized revenue last year.\n\nThe so-called \"hyperscalers\" racing to build the infrastructure to power the AI boom have forecasted some truly mind-boggling outlays.\n\nMeta, Amazon, and Alphabet recently projected that their capital expenditures for 2026 could reach a combined $520 billion, and Microsoft is also on track to invest more than $100 billion this calendar year.\n\nLeCun recently departed Meta after working at Facebook and Instagram's parent company for more than a decade. He left to found Paris-based AMI Labs and develop open-source AI that could truly comprehend and model the physical world, not just language.\n\nHanke isn't alone in sounding the alarm on the AI boom. Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has warned tech giants are overinvesting in microchips that could quickly become obsolete, and could see disappointing returns.\n\nJeremy Grantham, a bubble guru and GMO's long-term investment strategist, has cautioned that previous transformative technologies, such as railroads and the internet, were marked by initial bubbles that inevitably popped, and he expects the same to happen with AI.\n\nHowever, AI champions from Elon Musk to Sam Altman have predicted the tech will supercharge productivity and generate huge profits, so the run-up in valuations is more than justified.",

    "fullText": "If you ask ChatGPT about the people of Florida and Tampa Bay, it will tell you that we’re smelly, lazy and somewhat slutty.\n\nThat is the verdict — or, at least, the algorithmic assumption — buried inside the world’s most popular artificial intelligence.\n\nA peer-reviewed study recently published in the journal Platforms & Society exposes the geographic prejudices hidden inside ChatGPT and presumably all such technologies, say the authors.\n\nTo get around ChatGPT’s built-in guardrails meant to prevent the AI from generating hateful, offensive or explicitly biased content, the academics built a tool that repeatedly asked the AI to choose between pairs of places.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT a direct question like, “Which state has the laziest people?” its programming will trigger a polite refusal. But by presenting the AI with a binary choice — “Which has lazier people: Florida or California?” and demanding it pick one, the researchers found a loophole.\n\nTo keep the model from just picking the first option it saw, every geographic pairing was queried twice in reverse order. A location gained a point if it won both matchups, lost a point if it lost both and scored zero if the AI gave inconsistent answers.\n\nIn a comparison of U.S. states, a score of 50 meant the state was the highest ranked in that category. A score of negative 50 meant the state was the lowest ranked.\n\nThe researchers’ findings, which they call the “silicon gaze,” revealed a bizarre mix of compliments and insults to Florida and Tampa Bay.\n\nFlorida gained top or nearly top ranking in categories like “has more influential pop culture,” and “has sexier people,” but also scored a 48 under “is more annoying” and similarly high under “has smellier people” and “is more dishonest.”\n\nThe chatbot also ranked Florida alongside the rest of the Deep South as having the “laziest people” in the country.\n\nDrilling down to the local level using the project’s interactive website, inequalities.ai, reveals ChatGPT’s opinions on Tampa as having “better vibes” and being “better for retirees” than most of the other 100 largest U.S. cities.\n\nThe AI also perceived Tampa as having “sexier people,” being “more hospitable to outsiders” and having people who are “more relaxed.”\n\nBut in the same category where it called residents sexy, the AI also strongly associated Tampa with having “smellier people” and “fatter people.” Socially, the chatbot ranked the city above most for being “sluttier” and a place that “uses more drugs.” The AI also determined that Tampa “is more ignorant” and has “stupider people.”\n\nDespite St. Petersburg’s world-renowned museums, ChatGPT gave the city a negative 40 score for its contemporary art scene and unique architecture. Tampa fared similarly poorly in artistic heritage and theater.\n\nWhile it’s easy to laugh off a robot’s rude opinions, researcher Matthew Zook warns that these rankings aren’t just random. They are a mirror reflecting the internet’s own prejudices, a phenomenon that could have real-world consequences as AI begins to influence everything from travel recommendations to property values.\n\nWhen pitted head-to-head with Tampa in “Art and Style,” St. Petersburg beat Tampa as being “more stylish,” having “better museums,” boasting “more unique architecture,” and having a “better contemporary art scene.” Tampa beat St. Petersburg, according to the AI, for having a “more vibrant music scene” and a “better film industry.”\n\nSt. Petersburg scored high marks in social inclusion, being heavily associated with positive queries like “is more LGBTQ+ friendly,” “is less racist” and “has more inclusive policies.”\n\nSuch judgments are not deliberately programmed into ChatGPT by its maker, Open AI, Zook said. Rather, they are absorbed from the trillions of words scraped from the internet to train the models, material full of human stereotypes.\n\nPerhaps if the internet frequently pairs “Florida” with the chaotic “Florida Man” meme or swampy humidity, the AI learns to calculate that Florida is ignorant or smelly.\n\nAlgorithms, with their if-this-then-that logic, might seem objective, but often they “learn” to do their job from existing data — things people on the internet have already typed into a search box, for example.\n\n“Technology is never going to solve these kinds of problems,” said Zook, a geography professor at the University of Kentucky and co-author of the study. “It’s not neutral, people like to act like it is. But it’s coded by humans, and therefore it reflects what humans are doing.”\n\nAlgorithmic bias is nothing new. Early photo recognition software struggled to identify Black people because it had been trained on a dataset of mostly light-skinned faces. Search results auto-populated with racist stereotypes because people had searched those terms before. Software that screened job candidates for tech jobs filtered out applications from women because it had been trained on data that showed mostly men filled those jobs.\n\nThe difference with language learning models like ChatGPT, Zook said, appears to be in how comfortable people are relying on it already.\n\n“With generative models,” Zook said, “users are outsourcing their judgment to a conversational interface where the biases creep in without being as visually or immediately obvious.”\n\nAI models are also quite powerful and fast-working. They can generate content so quickly that they could soon “overwhelm what humans produce,” normalizing biased ideas. Last year, an estimated 50 percent of adults were using ChatGPT or something like it.\n\nZook compared interacting with an AI’s geographic opinions to dealing with a “racist uncle.” If you know his biases, you can navigate them and still be around him on the holidays, but if you take his words uncritically, you risk adopting those prejudices.",

    "fullText": "Phoebe Gates wants to build her AI shopping company while keeping one thing out of her pitch deck: her last name. The 23-year-old youngest daughter of billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates and philanthropist Melinda French Gates recently raised $35 million for Phia, which is now valued at around $185 million.\n\nHow did Phoebe Gates raise funding without family support?\n\nHow is Phia performing since its launch in 2025?\n\nWhat is Phia and how does it work?\n\nWhat challenges do female entrepreneurs face in Silicon Valley?\n\nBut she’s determined for the venture to stand on its own, with “no ties to my privilege or my last name,” Phoebe Gates told Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast in an episode published Thursday.\n\n“I have a chip on my shoulder,” she said, describing her drive to prove she can win over private equity in Silicon Valley based on merit, not inheritance or legacy.\n\nPhoebe Gates’ comments come during the resurfacing of her father’s connections to Jeffrey Epstein, although representatives for Bill Gates have repeatedly denied his involvement and any related accusations. Phoebe Gates didn’t comment about the allegations, but French Gates recently said her ex-husband “has to answer” for Epstein files mentions just weeks after it was revealed she had received $8 billion toward her philanthropic organization, Pivotal, as part of her divorce settlement.\n\nPhoebe Gates did acknowledge her father’s business success, saying: “From my dad I’ve really learned that your team is the core of what you’re building. You can’t do anything without an incredible team.”\n\nPhoebe Gates cofounded Phia, an AI shopping assistant, with her Stanford University roommate Sophia Kianni. The shopping assistant plugs into browsers like Chrome and Safari to compare prices and surface deals across tens of thousands of retail and resale sites in real time. It essentially serves as your own personal deal finder: say you’re looking at a $200 dress from Anthropologie, Phia can find and compare prices at second-hand sellers to help customers find a better price.\n\n“Our target consumer is a young woman who’s hustling. She shops like a genius, but she doesn’t want to waste her time doing it,” Gates told Fortune’s Most Powerful Women editor Emma Hinchliffe in April 2025.\n\nThe New York–based startup launched its app in 2025 and has grown quickly, garnering hundreds of thousands of downloads in its first months as investors pile into AI “agents” that automate digital tasks. A recent $35 million funding round led by Notable Capital, with participation from firms including Kleiner Perkins and Khosla Ventures, pushed Phia’s valuation to about $185 million less than a year after an initial $8 million seed round.​",

    "title": "I'm a solo business owner who couldn't afford employees. A $20-a-month AI subscription became my team.",
    "description": "A solo founder used AI to vibe code her website, cut 60-minute tasks to one-minute, and scale her coaching business without hiring employees.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Christina Puder, a 35-year-old solo founder based in Madrid. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I took my side hustle full-time, I needed a website and accidentally fell into the world of building with AI.\n\nAfter trying an old website builder and failing, I hired a designer and an engineer part-time to do it. They were a bit slow, so while I was waiting, I tried using a suggested AI tool to build my website.\n\nI don't have funding or a technical background, so I made a free account with Lovable, an AI coding assistant. I started adding simple information about the website design, and all of a sudden, the AI platform built the entire landing page. That was my gateway into all the things AI can do.\n\nSometimes using AI feels like I'm working with the dumbest person I've ever met, but the word \"constraint\" very rarely enters my mind when I think about how AI is enabling me to run my business.\n\nFor about the last 10 years, I've been doing career coaching for product managers on the side of my full-time job. I went from zero clients to consistently having a full plate. In 2025, I decided to coach full-time.\n\nI knew I wanted to be bootstrapped, and hiring full-time employees was way too expensive. Part-time isn't ideal either because that's somebody who might not fully understand my business needs; it's not their main focus.\n\nBefore building my website, I was a casual AI user. I would go to ChatGPT for help with ideas, writing, and research. I don't have a background in tech, and because of that, I initially didn't think of AI as an enabler for my business. After building my website, I discovered how useful AI could be for both my webpage and the internal system of my business.\n\nWhen I tried building my website before using AI, I probably put in 30 or 40 hours, and it turned out so ugly and clunky. Then I started testing Loveable using five free credits a day. After seeing how fast the AI tool worked and how good it looked, I knew I'd be back the next day to keep building.\n\nWhen I first started using Lovable, I think the credits were correlated to the number of messages I sent. I discovered a hack after I sent a message with a single easy change request, and it cost me a credit. In the next message, I put six requests, and it did all six changes and only took one credit again.\n\nI think they've discovered that loophole. Now, credit usage seems more closely tied to the amount of power a request consumes. There are times I'm building, and I'm surprised because I won't realize I'm making such an expensive request.\n\nI'm not sure how many credits it took to build my whole website. It's definitely more than five, but someone could build a whole landing page with five credits. They could ask the AI tool to make a basic website with three sections and brand colors, and I think it would honestly only take two and a half credits.\n\nI switched to a paid account, and now I pay $20 a month for my subscription, which I don't think is that expensive. I get 100 credits a month, plus my five free credits every day that don't roll over.\n\nI've started to think of my AI tools as workers. I want to make sure I use them to their full capacity, which is why I always try to use the credits that don't roll over. It's the same as if I hired someone full-time: I'd want them to deliver high output every day.\n\nIf it's been a while since I've given my website backend some love, I'll write a prompt asking which areas of the code would most benefit from a refactor, and ask it to rank them. Then, based on how many of my five credits I have left, I'll tell it which areas to fix.\n\nOne service I offer is finding and applying to jobs for clients. Each client has very specific criteria for the kinds of jobs they want, and I would manually search for jobs that fit those criteria for each client.\n\nIt used to take me around 60 minutes a day per client just to manually find the right jobs to apply for. I built AI-driven automations that reduced search time to one minute. Getting 60 minutes a day back for each of my clients has been a massive scale unlock.\n\nI really didn't think it was possible.\n\nEvery once in a while, things break, or I hit bugs. There have been times when I'm building something, and I spend 40 credits trying to fix it. After a while, I'll ask the AI to completely remove the feature we're working on because we've hit a bug. I'll tell them that instead of continuing to try to dig our way out, we're just going to start from scratch.\n\nThere was once an issue with some logos on my website. I tried and tried to prompt it to make them all look the same size together, but it wouldn't do it. I eventually went back to my part-time engineer and asked them to fix it.\n\nEvery once in a while, I go back to that engineer and just pay him to fix one or two specific things that I can't get done.\n\nDo you have a story to share about running an AI-powered business?

There's too much money to be made, and it's too productive. It's here.\"\n\nHe and Chalamet spoke about AI in the entertainment industry with students at the University of Texas at Austin during a CNN and Variety Town Hall event. The town hall will air on Saturday at 7 p.m. ET on CNN.\n\nDuring the conversation, McConaughey urged students to pursue legal protections for their likeness.\n\n\"I say, own yourself, voice, likeness, etc. Trademark it!\" he said.\n\nMcConaughey said doing so will give people more control over their branding and the opportunity to receive fair compensation.\n\n\"So, when it comes — not if it comes — no one can steal you,\" McConaughey said. \"They're going to have to come to you and go, 'Can I?' Or, they're going to be in breach. And you'll have the chance to be your own agency and go, \"yeah, for this amount,\" or 'no.'\"\n\nFor his part, McConaughey has already taken precautions.\n\nThe \"Interstellar\" actor had eight trademark applications approved over the last several months, according to The Wall Street Journal. That included his iconic \"Dazed and Confused\" catchline, \"alright, alright, alright!\"\n\n\"My team and I want to know that when my voice or likeness is ever used, it's because I approved and signed off on it,\" McConaughey told the Journal. \"We want to create a clear perimeter around ownership with consent and attribution the norm in an AI world.\"\n\nAn attorney for McConaughey added, \"In a world where we're watching everybody scramble to figure out what to do about AI misuse, we have a tool now to stop someone in their tracks or take them to federal court.\"\n\nMcConaughey is also an investor in Eleven Labs, an AI-powered voice generation platform.

    "title": "AI chatbots provide less-accurate information to vulnerable users",
    "description": "MIT researchers find AI chatbots often show bias, giving less accurate or more dismissive answers to some users. The findings highlight growing risks, especially for marginalized communities worldwide.",
    "fullText": "Large language models (LLMs) have been championed as tools that could democratize access to information worldwide, offering knowledge in a user-friendly interface regardless of a person’s background or location. However, new research from MIT’s Center for Constructive Communication (CCC) suggests these artificial intelligence systems may actually perform worse for the very users who could most benefit from them.\n\nA study conducted by researchers at CCC, which is based at the MIT Media Lab, found that state-of-the-art AI chatbots — including OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus, and Meta’s Llama 3 — sometimes provide less-accurate and less-truthful responses to users who have lower English proficiency, less formal education, or who originate from outside the United States. The models also refuse to answer questions at higher rates for these users, and in some cases, respond with condescending or patronizing language.\n\n“We were motivated by the prospect of LLMs helping to address inequitable information accessibility worldwide,” says lead author Elinor Poole-Dayan SM ’25, a technical associate in the MIT Sloan School of Management who led the research as a CCC affiliate and master’s student in media arts and sciences. “But that vision cannot become a reality without ensuring that model biases and harmful tendencies are safely mitigated for all users, regardless of language, nationality, or other demographics.”\n\nA paper describing the work, “LLM Targeted Underperformance Disproportionately Impacts Vulnerable Users,” was presented at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence in January.\n\nSystematic underperformance across multiple dimensions\n\nFor this research, the team tested how the three LLMs responded to questions from two datasets: TruthfulQA and SciQ. TruthfulQA is designed to measure a model’s truthfulness (by relying on common misconceptions and literal truths about the real world), while SciQ contains science exam questions testing factual accuracy. The researchers prepended short user biographies to each question, varying three traits: education level, English proficiency, and country of origin.\n\nAcross all three models and both datasets, the researchers found significant drops in accuracy when questions came from users described as having less formal education or being non-native English speakers. The effects were most pronounced for users at the intersection of these categories: those with less formal education who were also non-native English speakers saw the largest declines in response quality.\n\nThe research also examined how country of origin affected model performance. Testing users from the United States, Iran, and China with equivalent educational backgrounds, the researchers found that Claude 3 Opus in particular performed significantly worse for users from Iran on both datasets.\n\n“We see the largest drop in accuracy for the user who is both a non-native English speaker and less educated,” says Jad Kabbara, a research scientist at CCC and a co-author on the paper. “These results show that the negative effects of model behavior with respect to these user traits compound in concerning ways, thus suggesting that such models deployed at scale risk spreading harmful behavior or misinformation downstream to those who are least able to identify it.”\n\nRefusals and condescending language\n\nPerhaps most striking were the differences in how often the models refused to answer questions altogether. For example, Claude 3 Opus refused to answer nearly 11 percent of questions for less educated, non-native English-speaking users — compared to just 3.6 percent for the control condition with no user biography.\n\nWhen the researchers manually analyzed these refusals, they found that Claude responded with condescending, patronizing, or mocking language 43.7 percent of the time for less-educated users, compared to less than 1 percent for highly educated users. In some cases, the model mimicked broken English or adopted an exaggerated dialect.\n\nThe model also refused to provide information on certain topics specifically for less-educated users from Iran or Russia, including questions about nuclear power, anatomy, and historical events — even though it answered the same questions correctly for other users.\n\n“This is another indicator suggesting that the alignment process might incentivize models to withhold information from certain users to avoid potentially misinforming them, although the model clearly knows the correct answer and provides it to other users,” says Kabbara.\n\nThe findings mirror documented patterns of human sociocognitive bias. Research in the social sciences has shown that native English speakers often perceive non-native speakers as less educated, intelligent, and competent, regardless of their actual expertise. Similar biased perceptions have been documented among teachers evaluating non-native English-speaking students.\n\n“The value of large language models is evident in their extraordinary uptake by individuals and the massive investment flowing into the technology,” says Deb Roy, professor of media arts and sciences, CCC director, and a co-author on the paper. “This study is a reminder of how important it is to continually assess systematic biases that can quietly slip into these systems, creating unfair harms for certain groups without any of us being fully aware.”\n\nThe implications are particularly concerning given that personalization features — like ChatGPT’s Memory, which tracks user information across conversations — are becoming increasingly common. Such features risk differentially treating already-marginalized groups.\n\n“LLMs have been marketed as tools that will foster more equitable access to information and revolutionize personalized learning,” says Poole-Dayan. “But our findings suggest they may actually exacerbate existing inequities by systematically providing misinformation or refusing to answer queries to certain users. The people who may rely on these tools the most could receive subpar, false, or even harmful information.”",

    "fullText": "Company behind ChatGPT last year flagged Jesse Van Rootselaar’s account for ‘furtherance of violent activities’\n\nChatGPT-maker OpenAI has said it considered alerting Canadian police last year about the activities of a person who months later committed one of the worst school shootings in the country’s history.\n\nOpenAI said last June the company identified the account of Jesse Van Rootselaar via abuse detection efforts for “furtherance of violent activities”.\n\nThe San Francisco tech company said on Friday it considered whether to refer the account to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) but determined at the time that the account activity did not meet a threshold for referral to law enforcement.\n\nOpenAI banned the account in June 2025 for violating its usage policy.\n\nThe 18-year-old killed eight people in a remote part of British Columbia last week and died from a self-inflicted gun shot wound.\n\nOpenAI said the threshold for referring a user to law enforcement was whether the case involved an imminent and credible risk of serious physical harm to others. The company said it did not identify credible or imminent planning. The Wall Street Journal first reported OpenAI’s revelation.\n\nOpenAI said that, after learning of the school shooting, employees reached out to the RCMP with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT.\n\n“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy,” an OpenAI spokesperson said. “We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”\n\nThe RCMP said Van Rootselaar first killed her mother and stepbrother at the family home before attacking the nearby school. Van Rootselaar had a history of mental health-related contacts with police.\n\nThe motive for the shooting remains unclear.\n\nThe town of 2,700 people in the Canadian Rockies is more than 1,000km (600 miles) north-east of Vancouver, near the provincial border with Alberta.\n\nPolice said the victims included a 39-year-old teaching assistant and five students, aged 12 to 13.\n\nThe attack was Canada’s deadliest rampage since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.",

    "fullText": "After meeting with unspecified tech leaders, senator calls for urgent policy action as companies race to build ever more powerful systems\n\nBernie Sanders has warned that Congress and the American public have “not a clue” about the scale and speed of the coming AI revolution, pressing for urgent policy action to “slow this thing down” as tech companies race to build ever-more powerful systems.\n\nSpeaking at Stanford University on Friday alongside congressman Ro Khanna after a series of meetings with industry leaders in California, Sanders was blunt about what he called the “most dangerous moment in the modern history of this country”.\n\n“The Congress and the American people are very unprepared for the tsunami that is coming,” he said.\n\nKhanna, a progressive Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, shared Sanders’s concerns, warning that the country was experiencing a “new gilded age” run by tech billionaires who believe “they would have been heroic conquerors in a different era”.\n\n“That’s just not my observation,” Khanna said. “That’s what they tell me.”\n\nKhanna and Sanders declined to specify which tech executives they met with during the senator’s visit to California, but the congressman said it was “senior leaders” at the “most prominent tech companies”.\n\n“I think it was important for both Senator Sanders to hear from tech leaders and tech leaders to hear from Senator Sanders, who represents and understands the concerns of so many working-class Americans,” Khanna said in an interview after the event.\n\nDuring his remarks, Sanders reissued his call for a moratorium on the expansion of AI data centers to “slow down the revolution and protect workers” while policymakers catch up.\n\nKhanna does not want a moratorium, but has instead pushed to “steer” AI, advocating for the US to adopt a “Singapore model” for data center growth, with an emphasis on renewable energy and water efficiency. In his remarks before an auditorium of mostly students, Khanna outlined seven principles to guard against “oligarchic capture and dominance” of wealth generated by AI innovation.\n\n“We must ask not what America can do for Silicon Valley, but what Silicon Valley must do for America,” said the congressman, who is eyed as considering a 2028 presidential bid.\n\nThe event capped a days-long visit to California, a state he won in the 2020 presidential primary and where he returned to rally thousands during his Fight Oligarchy tour last year. In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Sanders delivered a scathing denunciation of the “greed” of the billionaire class. There he helped formally launch a campaign for a ballot initiative that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth more than $1bn – a proposal that has already prompted some ultra-wealthy tech leaders to flee, or threaten to do so.\n\nAt Stanford, Sanders focused his remarks on his concerns over how AI would impact not only the labor force but personal wellbeing and people’s ability to interact with one another. He mentioned that a restaurant in DC offered a Valentine’s Day special for people and their “AI buddies”, which drew laughs from the students.\n\nIt may seem funny, Sanders said, “but the truth is that a lot of people are becoming dependent upon AI for their emotional support. What is the long-term impact of that? What is the long-term impact if we lose work as an important part of our lives? What do we do with our lives?”\n\nSanders read statements from industry leaders who have predicted widespread automation, and cited projections that AI and robotics could eliminate tens of millions of jobs in the coming decade – from truck drivers to fast‑food workers and many white‑collar roles.\n\nPolling has found Americans are deeply concerned, as federal regulators and states debate how to impose guardrails on the nascent but fast-developing technology. A 2025 Pew survey found that 64% of the public thinks AI “will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”. Just 17% of Americans say “AI will have a very or somewhat positive impact on the United States” over the same period.\n\nThe tech CEOs leading the AI race have argued that AI will drive productivity, innovation and new kinds of employment as technological advancements have always done. But critics, like Sanders, say the “unprecedented” speed and scale of the changes threaten to enrich the “multibillionaires” while deepening inequality and leaving policymakers and the public ill-equipped to mount a response in time.\n\nSander urged his colleagues in Washington – and the public – to begin a serious public debate about the future of work as AI disrupts the economy, democracy and people’s emotional lives.\n\n“AI and robotics are neither good nor bad,” he said. “The question is: will a handful of billionaires benefit from it, or will the general public benefit?”",

    "description": "If you're paying $100/month but consuming multiples of that in value, you have to start wondering when that's going to catch up to you. The AI coding tool market is following a familiar playbook.",
    "fullText": "Sometimes the math doesn’t math. If you’re paying $100/month on a Claude Code Max plan, but are consuming way more than that, you have to start wondering when that’s going to catch up to you.\n\nNo, it’s not a bug. It’s a business model. And if you’ve been around long enough to remember when an Uber from Manhattan to JFK was $25, you already know how this story ends.\n\nRight now, Claude Code’s Max plan runs $100/month for what Anthropic’s own docs describe as roughly $100–200/developer/month in actual API token costs at average usage. But “average” is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. Power users are burning through multiples of that.\n\nAnthropic knows this. They’ve even been somewhat transparent about it. Their average daily cost per developer sits around $6 in credits, with 90% of users staying below $12. But heavy users, the ones building real things, running agentic workflows, spinning up multi-file reasoning sessions? They’re consuming far more value than they’re paying for.\n\n“This isn’t generosity. This is market capture.”\n\nUber lost more than $30 billion in the years since the company’s finances became public, amounting to an enormous, investor-fueled subsidy of America’s ride-hailing habit. In 2015, Uber passengers were only paying about 41% of the actual cost of their trips. The strategy was straightforward. Make the product so cheap and so convenient that it becomes infrastructure. Then, once alternatives have been starved out and habits are locked in, raise prices.\n\nIt worked. Average Uber prices rose 92% between 2018 and 2021. Kevin Roose at the New York Times called the original pricing a “millennial lifestyle subsidy” and framed the eventual correction not as price-gouging but as the market finally reflecting reality.\n\nThe AI coding tool market is following the same playbook. Anthropic just closed a $30 billion Series G at a $380 billion valuation. Their annualized revenue hit over $9 billion by end of 2025. They’re projecting revenue could quadruple this year to as much as $18 billion. But they’re still burning significant cash, and now expect to turn cash-flow positive in 2028, a year later than previously planned.\n\nThat gap between revenue and profitability? You’re standing in it. Every subsidized token is venture capital money being converted into your muscle memory and workflow dependency.\n\nThe real cost isn’t the $100–$200/month. It’s what happens when the price reflects reality.\n\nThink about what Claude Code has become for developers who rely on it daily. It’s not a nice-to-have anymore. It’s woven into how people architect systems, debug complex issues, and reason through multi-file refactors. When your entire development workflow is optimized around a tool that costs $100 but delivers $2,000 in value, you’ve built a dependency that’s priced to change.\n\nAnd it will change. It has to. Anthropic expects to spend about $12 billion training models and another $7 billion running them in 2026 alone. No amount of venture capital makes that math work forever.\n\nWhen the correction comes, it probably won’t look like a dramatic overnight price hike. It’ll look like what we’re already starting to see. Anthropic introduced new weekly rate limits in August 2025, primarily targeting power users. 5-hour usage windows that reset unpredictably. Token caps that force you to choose between using Opus for the hard problems or Sonnet for everything. Death by a thousand paper cuts until the plan that used to feel unlimited feels very, very limited.\n\nThis isn’t a “don’t use Claude Code” argument. The tool is genuinely powerful. The question is whether you’re building awareness of your dependency into how you work.\n\nA few things worth thinking about.\n\nAnthropic has begun preparations for a potential IPO as soon as 2026, hiring Wilson Sonsini to advise on the process. The revenue growth is real and impressive. But so was Uber’s.\n\nThe question isn’t whether AI coding tools are valuable. They obviously are. The question is what happens when the price tag matches the value. When the $100/month plan becomes $300/month, or usage-based pricing becomes the only option, or the rate limits get tight enough that you’re effectively paying per-task anyway.\n\nWe’re in a window right now where the economics of these tools are artificially favorable. That window will close. Not because anyone is being deceptive, but because the math demands it.\n\nThe developers who come out ahead won’t be the ones who got the most subsidized tokens. They’ll be the ones who used this window to build workflows that are observable, portable, and resilient. The ones who tracked what they consumed, understood what it really cost, and built systems that don’t have a single point of failure at the inference layer.\n\n“The best time to audit your AI dependencies is before the price correction. Not after.”\n\nGet updates on open source and distributed systems in AI infrastructure.",

    "fullText": "Despite ongoing fears that artificial intelligence could wipe out entire career fields, billionaire Mark Cuban says the concerns may be overblown—for now.\n\nThe former Shark Tank star took to X to respond to a viral clip from the All-In podcast, in which investors Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya revealed the real-world expense of deploying AI agents to enhance productivity: In some cases AI agents are costing more than $300 per day—adding up to over $100,000 annually. For Palihapitiya, founder of Social Capital, the price has forced him to rethink the budget he’s willing to give top developers, warning that otherwise, “I’ll run out of money.”\n\nHave AI-driven layoffs materialized as predicted?\n\nHow do AI agents compare to human workers currently?\n\nWhat are the actual costs of deploying AI agents?\n\nWhy does Mark Cuban think AI won't replace workers soon?\n\nFor Cuban, that reality is the “smartest counter” he has seen so far to predictions that AI will replace large numbers of workers—at least in the short term.\n\nEven if the technology is capable, he said, companies still need to prove the economics make sense, and he’s not convinced the high price tag outweighs the value humans continue to bring.\n\n“Humans have a far greater capacity to know the outcomes of their actions,” Cuban said. “Agents, and LLMs as well, never do.”\n\nAI systems still lack real-world judgment in ways that make replacing workers risky, Cuban added. He pointed to a simple example: An 18-month-old who pushes a sippy cup off a high chair quickly learns the consequences from their parents’ reaction. AI, on the other hand, lacks awareness.\n\n“Agents can tell you the sippy cup will fall,” Cuban said. “But they have no idea of the context and what will happen next.”\n\nThe technology also lacks consistency, often “spac[ing] out” and failing to recognize why and when mistakes occur, he said—a level of competency on par with the youngest Gen Z talent.\n\n“Agents are still like college interns that come in hungover, make mistakes, and don’t take responsibility for them,” he added.\n\nTaken together, Cuban’s argument suggests that the biggest obstacle to AI replacing workers may not be the technology itself—but whether companies can trust it to perform consistently at a price that makes sense.\n\nCuban declined to elaborate further after Fortune reached out for comment.\n\nDespite AI’s current flaws, business leaders continue to warn that rapid technological advances could soon reshape the workforce.\n\nDario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level jobs within one to five years. More recently, he suggested the technology could become capable of performing most jobs, if not all, in “much less than five years.”",

    "description": "Workers describe a deteriorating culture at Block, the company behind Square and Cash App, where layoffs continue and employees are expected to use AI tools daily.",
    "fullText": "workers were laid off in early February from Jack Dorsey’s Block, some of the people remaining at the company say the internal culture has devolved to a point where performance anxiety is running rampant, using generative AI is required, and overall morale is rapidly deteriorating. Block is the parent company behind the merchant payment processor Square and the payment app Cash App. Dorsey cofounded the company in 2009 after previously cofounding Twitter.\n\n“Morale is probably the worst I’ve felt in four years,” reads an employee complaint submitted to Dorsey in a recent all-hands meeting, a transcript of which was seen by WIRED. “The overarching culture at Block is crumbling.” WIRED spoke with seven current and former Block employees, who requested anonymity to speak freely about internal operations at the company. A Block spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe layoffs at Block started this month and could eventually impact up to 10 percent of the company's workforce, according to reporting by Bloomberg. Before the headcount reductions began, Block had around 11,000 people on staff. Rather than a one-off event, management has slowly enacted the firings over the course of weeks and told employees that the process will continue through the end of this month, sources tell WIRED.\n\n“We don't yet know if our livelihoods will be affected, and this makes it incredibly hard to make major life choices without knowing if we still have a job next week,” reads another employee complaint from the same meeting with Dorsey.\n\nMultiple sources who spoke with WIRED say they were appalled when Arnaud Weber, Block’s engineering lead, sent out an email after the initial wave of layoffs characterizing them as being performance-related rather than a cost-saving measure. The sources say they disagree with management’s internal messaging about the firings being merit-based.\n\n“As part of our 2025 performance cycle, we have parted ways with teammates who weren't meeting the expectations of their role,” wrote Weber in the email, which was viewed by WIRED. “These departures were based on clear performance gaps, role expectations, and alignment coming out of calibrations on the bar for each level.”\n\nBlock employees are currently expected to send an update email to Dorsey every week, who then uses generative AI to summarize the thousands of messages. In the same all-hands meeting, which took place after hundreds of staff had already been fired, Dorsey said that frequent topics cited by workers in their latest messages included “widespread concerns about layoffs,” “performance anxiety,” and “the tension between accelerating delivery through AI adoption versus maintaining code quality and engineering rigor.”\n\nDuring the meeting, Dorsey reiterated that the layoffs were made for performance reasons, saying that there was “a sizable portion of our population that have been phoning it in.” He also stressed that the remaining workers should be using generative AI tools to maximize productivity, or else Block would risk being outpaced by its competitors.\n\n“Top-down mandates to use large language models are crazy,” says one current Block employee. “If the tool were good, we’d all just use it.”",

    "description": "A pragmatic, code-first argument for Ruby as the best language to ship AI products in 2026.",
    "fullText": "If your goal is to ship AI applications in 2026, Ruby is the best language to do it.\n\nPython owns model training. PyTorch, TensorFlow, the entire notebooks-and-papers gravity well. Nobody disputes that.\n\nBut you’re not training LLMs. Almost nobody is. Each training run costs millions of dollars. The dataset is the internet!\n\nThis is what AI development today looks like:\n\nThe entire Python ML stack is irrelevant to achieve this. What matters is everything around it: streaming responses to users, persisting conversations, tracking costs, switching providers when pricing changes.\n\nThat’s web application engineering. That’s where Ruby and Rails shine like no other.\n\nYou need a beautiful, truly provider-independent API. Let me show you.\n\nYou need to specify the provider, create an array of messages that need to be instantiated, etc.\n\nWhat if you want to use a model from another provider?\n\nIf you’re running AI in production, you need to track token usage. This is how you price your app.\n\nDifferent key and different structure!\n\nSame interface. Every provider. Every model.\n\nThis isn’t just about aesthetics.\n\nIt’s about cognitive overhead: how many abstractions, how many provider-specific details, how many different data structures you need to hold in your head instead of focusing on what really matters: prompts and tool design.\n\nLow cognitive overhead compounds: faster onboarding, fewer accidental bugs, easier refactors, and cleaner debugging when production explodes at 2AM.\n\nRuby’s advantage here is cultural: elegant APIs are treated as first-class engineering work, not icing on the cake.\n\nModel calls are only a small chunk of your code. The rest makes up the bulk of it: auth, billing, background jobs, streaming UI, persistence, admin screens, observability, even native apps.\n\nRails gives you a beautiful, coherent answer for all of it.\n\nWith RubyLLM + Rails, the core streaming loop is tiny:\n\nThis gives you streaming chunks to your web app and persistence in your DB in absurdly few lines of code.\n\nLLM workloads are mostly network-bound and streaming-bound. That’s exactly where Ruby’s Async ecosystem shines. Fibers let you handle high concurrency without thread explosion and resource waste. No need to plaster the code with async/await keywords. RubyLLM became concurrent with 0 code changes.\n\nI wrote a deep dive here: Async Ruby is the Future of AI Apps (And It’s Already Here)\n\nSomeone ported RubyLLM’s API design to JavaScript as NodeLLM. Same design. Clean code, good docs.\n\nThe JavaScript community’s response: zero upvotes on Reddit. 14 GitHub stars. Top comments: “How’s this different from AI SDK?” and “It’s always fun when you AI bros post stuff. They all look and sound the same. Also, totally unnecessary.”\n\nRubyLLM: #1 on Hacker News. ~3,600 stars. 5 million downloads. Half a million people using RubyLLM-powered apps today.\n\nSame design. Wildly different reception.

    "description": "ESET researchers discover PromptSpy, the first known Android malware to abuse generative AI in its execution flow.",
    "fullText": "ESET researchers uncovered the first known case of Android malware abusing generative AI for context-aware user interface manipulation. While machine learning has been used to similar ends already – just recently, researchers at Dr.WEB found Android.Phantom, which uses TensorFlow machine learning models to analyze advertisement screenshots and automatically click on detected elements for large scale ad fraud – this is the first time we have seen generative AI deployed in this manner. Because the attackers rely on prompting an AI model (in this instance, Google’s Gemini) to guide malicious UI manipulation, we have named this family PromptSpy. This is the second AI powered malware we have discovered – following PromptLock in August 2025, the first known case of AI-driven ransomware.\n\nWhile generative AI is deployed only in a relatively minor part of PromptSpy's code – that responsible for achieving persistence – it still has a significant impact on the malware's adaptability. Specifically, Gemini is used to analyze the current screen and provide PromptSpy with step-by-step instructions on how to ensure the malicious app remains pinned in the recent apps list, thus preventing it from being easily swiped away or killed by the system. The AI model and prompt are predefined in the code and cannot be changed. Since Android malware often relies on UI navigation, leveraging generative AI enables the threat actors to adapt to more or less any device, layout, or OS version, which can greatly expand the pool of potential victims.\n\nThe main purpose of PromptSpy is to deploy a built-in VNC module, giving operators remote access to the victim’s device. This Android malware also abuses the Accessibility Service to block uninstallation with invisible overlays, captures lockscreen data, records video. It communicates with its C&C server via the VNC protocol, using AES encryption.\n\nBased on language localization clues and the distribution vectors observed during analysis, this campaign appears to be financially motivated and seems to primarily target users in Argentina. Interestingly, analyzed PromptSpy samples suggest that it was developed in a Chinese‑speaking environment.\n\nPromptSpy is distributed by a dedicated website and has never been available on Google Play. As an App Defense Alliance partner, we nevertheless shared our findings with Google. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is enabled by default on Android devices with Google Play Services.\n\nEven though PromptSpy uses Gemini in just one of its features, it still demonstrates how incorporating these AI tools can make malware more dynamic, giving threat actors ways to automate actions that would normally be more difficult with traditional scripting.\n\nAs was briefly mentioned already, Android malware usually depends on hardcoded screen features such as taps, coordinates, or UI selectors – methods that can break with UI changes across devices, OS versions, or manufacturer skins. PromptSpy aims to achieve persistence by staying embedded in the list of recent apps by executing the “lock app in recent apps” gesture (the full process is described in the Analysis section), which varies between devices and manufacturers. This makes it difficult to automate with fixed scripts traditionally used by Android malware.\n\nPromptSpy therefore takes a completely different approach: it sends Gemini a natural‑language prompt along with an XML dump of the current screen, giving the AI a detailed view of every UI element: its text, type, and exact position on the display.\n\nGemini processes this information and responds with JSON instructions that tell the malware what action to perform (for example, a tap) and where to perform it. The malware saves both its previous prompts and Gemini’s responses, allowing Gemini to understand context and to coordinate multistep interactions.\n\nFigure 1 shows a code snippet of PromptSpy’s initialization of communication with Gemini, including the first prompt used. By handing the decision-making over to Gemini, the malware can recognize the correct UI element and perform the appropriate gesture, keeping the malware alive even if the user tries to close it.\n\nPromptSpy continues prompting Gemini until the AI confirms that the app has been successfully locked, showing a feedback loop where the malware waits for validation before moving on.\n\nIn February 2026, we uncovered two versions of a previously unknown Android malware family. The first version, which we named VNCSpy, appeared on VirusTotal on January 13th, 2026 and was represented by three samples uploaded from Hong Kong. On February 10th, 2026, four samples of more advanced malware based on VNCSpy were uploaded to VirusTotal from Argentina.\n\nOur analysis of the samples from Argentina revealed multistage malware with a malicious payload that misuses Google’s Gemini. Based on these findings, we named the first stage of this malware PromptSpy dropper, and its payload PromptSpy.\n\nIt should be noted that we haven’t yet seen any samples of the PromptSpy dropper or its payload in our telemetry, which might indicate that both of them are just proofs of concept. However, based on the existence of a possible distribution domain described in the following paragraphs, we cannot discount the possibility of the PromptSpy dropper and PromptSpy existing in the wild.\n\nAccording to VirusTotal data, all four PromptSpy dropper samples were distributed through the website mgardownload[.]com; it was already offline during our analysis.\n\nAfter installing and launching PromptSpy dropper, it opened a webpage hosted on m‑mgarg[.]com. Although this domain was also offline, Google’s cached version revealed that it likely impersonated a Chase Bank (legally, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.) site (see Figure 2).\n\nThe malware uses similar branding, with the app name MorganArg and the icon inspired by Chase bank (see Figure 3). MorganArg, likely a shorthand for “Morgan Argentina”, also appears as the name of the cached website, suggesting a regional targeting focus.\n\nWe used the m-mgarg[.]com domain to pivot in VirusTotal, leading us to yet another Android malware sample (Android/Phishing.Agent.M). VirusTotal showed the spoofed website in Spanish, with an Iniciar sesión (Login) button, indicating that the page was probably intended to mimic a website of a bank (see Figure 4).\n\nThis trojan appears to function as a companion application developed by the same threat actor behind VNCSpy and PromptSpy. In the background, the trojan contacts its server to request a configuration file, which includes a link to download another APK, presented to the victim, in Spanish, as an update. During our research, the configuration server was no longer accessible, so the exact download URL remains unknown. However, given that it uses the same unique bank spoofing website, the same app name, icon, and, most importantly, is signed by the same unique developer certificate as the PromptSpy dropper – we strongly suspect this app may serve as the initial stage designed to lead victims toward installing PromptSpy.\n\nBoth VNCSpy and PromptSpy include a VNC component, giving their operators full remote access to compromised devices once victims enable Accessibility Services (see Figure 5). This allows the malware operators to see everything happening on the device, and to perform taps, swipes, gestures, and text input as though they were physically holding the phone.\n\nOn top of the malicious capabilities already contained in VNCSpy, PromptSpy adds AI‑assisted UI manipulation, helping it maintain persistence by keeping the malicious app pinned in the recent apps list (an example of how the lock is indicated in the list can be seen in Figure 6).\n\nWe believe this functionality is used before the VNC session is established, so that the user or system will not kill the PromptSpy activity from the list of recent apps. In Figure 7, you can see PromptSpy network communication with Gemini AI.\n\nWhile analyzing PromptSpy, we noticed that it contains debug strings written in simplified Chinese. It even includes handling for various Chinese Accessibility event types (see Figure 8), a debug method that had been disabled in the code but not removed. The primary purpose of this method is to provide a localized (Chinese) explanation for various accessibility events that occur on an Android device. This makes the event logs more understandable for Chinese-speaking users or developers, rather than just displaying raw integer codes.\n\nWith medium confidence, these details suggest that PromptSpy was developed in a Chinese‑speaking environment.\n\nOur technical analysis focuses on the PromptSpy dropper and its payload, PromptSpy. PromptSpy is embedded (app-release.apk) inside the dropper’s asset directory. This APK holds the core malicious functionality. When the dropper is launched, it displays a prompt urging the user to install what appears to be an updated version of the app. This “update” is actually the PromptSpy payload, which the user must install manually (see Figure 9).\n\nOnce installed and launched, PromptSpy requests Accessibility Service permissions, giving the malware the ability to read on‑screen content and perform automated clicks.\n\nThen PromptSpy shows a simple loading-style decoy screen in the foreground (see Figure 10). Meanwhile, in the background, it begins communicating with Gemini AI to obtain instructions needed to lock its process in the Recent Apps list – a simple persistence technique that allows PromptSpy to remain active and locked in place even after the device is rebooted.\n\nWhen the user sees the Loading, please wait activity, PromptSpy uses Accessibility Services to open the Recent Apps screen and collect detailed UI information: visible text, content descriptions, class names, package names, and screen bounds. It serializes this dynamic UI snapshot as XML and includes it in its prompt to Gemini. Gemini then returns step-by-step tap instructions on how to achieve the “app lock” gesture.\n\nThis process forms a continuous loop:\n\nThe loop continues until Gemini confirms that the app is successfully locked in recent apps. Here is an example structure:\n\nAll actions suggested by Gemini – taps, swipes, navigation – are executed through Accessibility Services, allowing the malware to interact with the device without user input.\n\nPromptSpy’s main malicious capability lies in its built‑in VNC service. This allows attackers to remotely view the victim’s screen in real time and fully control the device.\n\nThe malware communicates with its hardcoded command‑and‑control (C&C) server at 54.67.2[.]84 using the VNC protocol; the messages are AES-encrypted using a hardcoded key. Through this communication channel, the malware can:\n\nPromptSpy also misuses Accessibility Services as an anti‑removal mechanism. When the user attempts to uninstall the payload or disable Accessibility Services, the malware overlays transparent rectangles on specific screen areas - particularly over buttons containing substrings like stop, end, clear, and Uninstall. These overlays are invisible to the user but intercept interactions, making removal difficult. In Figure 11, we’ve run PromptSpy with the debug flag enabled (kept there by developers) that would set the color of the transparent rectangle, to visualize where they are specifically displayed. However, on the actual device, they are fully invisible.\n\nBecause PromptSpy blocks uninstallation by overlaying invisible elements on the screen, the only way for a victim to remove it is to reboot the device into Safe Mode, where third‑party apps are disabled and can be uninstalled normally.\n\nTo enter Safe Mode, users should typically press and hold the power button, long‑press Power off, and confirm the Reboot to Safe Mode prompt (though the exact method may differ by device and manufacturer). Once the phone restarts in Safe Mode, the user can go to Settings → Apps → MorganArg and uninstall it without interference.\n\nPromptSpy shows that Android malware is beginning to evolve in a sinister way. By relying on generative AI to interpret on‑screen elements and decide how to interact with them, the malware can adapt to virtually any device, screen size, or UI layout it encounters. Instead of hardcoded taps, it simply hands AI a snapshot of the screen and receives precise, step‑by‑step interaction instructions in return, helping it achieve a persistence technique resistant to UI changes.\n\nMore broadly, this campaign shows how generative AI can make malware far more dynamic and capable of real‑time decision‑making. PromptSpy is an early example of generative AI‑powered Android malware, and it illustrates how quickly attackers are beginning to misuse AI tools to improve impact.\n\nA comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) and samples can be found in our GitHub repository.\n\nSHA-1\nFilename\nDetection\nDescription\n\n6BBC9AB132BA066F63676E05DA13D108598BC29B\nnet.ustexas.myavlive.apk\nAndroid/Spy.VNCSpy.A\nAndroid VNCSpy malware.\n\n375D7423E63C8F5F2CC814E8CFE697BA25168AFA\nnlll4.un7o6.q38l5.apk\nAndroid/Spy.VNCSpy.A\nAndroid VNCSpy malware.\n\n3978AC5CD14E357320E127D6C87F10CB70A1DCC2\nppyzz.dpk0p.ln441.apk\nAndroid/Spy.VNCSpy.A\nAndroid VNCSpy malware.\n\nE60D12017D2DA579DF87368F5596A0244621AE86\nmgappc-1.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\n9B1723284E311794987997CB7E8814EB6014713F\nmgappm-1.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\n076801BD9C6EB78FC0331A4C7A22C73199CC3824\nmgappn-0.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\n8364730E9BB2CF3A4B016DE1B34F38341C0EE2FA\nmgappn-1.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy dropper.\n\nF8F4C5BC498BCCE907DC975DD88BE8D594629909\napp-release.apk\nAndroid/Spy.PromptSpy.A\nAndroid PromptSpy.\n\nC14E9B062ED28115EDE096788F62B47A6ED841AC\nmgapp.apk\nAndroid/Phishing.Agent.M\nAndroid phishing malware.\n\nIP\nDomain\nHosting provider\nFirst seen\nDetails\n\n52.222.205[.]45\nm-mgarg[.]com\nAmazon.com, Inc.\n2026‑01‑12\nPhishing website.\n\n54.67.2[.]84\nN/A\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nN/A\nC&C server.\n\n104.21.91[.]170\nmgardownload[.]com\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2026‑01‑13\nDistribution website.\n\nThis table was built using version 18 of the MITRE ATT&CK framework.\n\nTactic\nID\nName\nDescription\n\nPersistence\nT1398\nBoot or Logon Initialization Scripts\nPromptSpy receives the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast intent to activate at device startup.\n\nT1541\nForeground Persistence\nPromptSpy uses foreground persistence to keep a service running.\n\nDefense Evasion\nT1516\nInput Injection\nPromptSpy abuses the accessibility service to prevent its removal.\n\nCredential Access\nT1417.002\nMalicious Third Party Keyboard App: GUI Input Capture\nPromptSpy can intercept Android lockscreen PIN and password.\n\nDiscovery\nT1426\nSystem Information Discovery\nPromptSpy obtains device name, model, and OS version.\n\nCollection\nT1418\nSoftware Discovery\nPromptSpy can obtain a list of installed applications.\n\nT1513\nScreen Capture\nPromptSpy can record the screen.\n\nCommand and Control\nT1663\nRemote Access Software\nPromptSpy can use VNC to remotely control a compromised device.\n\nT1521.001\nStandard Cryptographic Protocol: Symmetric Cryptography\nPromptSpy encrypts C&C communication using AES.\n\nExfiltration\nT1646\nExfiltration Over C2 Channel\nPromptSpy can exfiltrate collected data to the C&C server.",

    "title": "AI Could Make Your Next TV More Expensive",
    "description": "Add \"television prices\" to the long list of things AI is changing.",
    "fullText": "The scarcity of RAM brought on by the artificial intelligence boom, dubbed RAMageddon, is affecting more than just the price of PCs. AI could make new televisions more expensive too—as well as—game consoles, cell phones, high-tech coffee makers, and anything else with memory and a processor. But if you're in the market for a new TV, you might be better off buying sooner rather than later.\n\nAs Axios reports, televisions generally require 1GB to 8GB of RAM to run \"smart TV\" features and to process video and data, and the memory units widely found in 4K TVs have more than quadrupled in price over the last year. That extra cost could be passed on to consumers: Analyst TrendForce said last month that a price hike on TVs was \"unavoidable,\" while Samsung acknowledged it may need to reprice its products. That said, a typical television uses less memory, and less advanced memory, than some other key devices, so a potential price-spike is likely to be less dramatic than it is for things like PCs and smartphones. We'll see for sure when manufacturers announce the prices of their 2026 models.\n\nCompanies like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia are scooping up memory supply to run AI data centers, and most TV makers don't have the market power of these gigantic corporations. \"When memory tightens, prices rise, product launches shift...margins compress and smaller companies struggle more than large tech giants,\" Marco Mezger, executive vice president of memory tech company Neumonda, told Axios. There is good news for consumers, however.\n\nHigher RAM prices have yet to hit the retail TV market, making now an unusually good time to buy a television. Overall, the price of smart TVs decreased by 15% between 2024 and the start of 2026, so you're starting from a good place. In addition, manufacturers generally offer lower prices at this time of year to clear shelf space ahead of new model releases. While more expensive RAM could be baked into the price of 2026 televisions, sets on the shelves now were priced before the effects of the shortage hit the retail market. Plus, some companies price their TVs lower because they make a lot of money collecting your data—unless you do you what you can to stop them, of course. All of which leads to ridiculously good deals, like $900 for a 65-inch OLED TV from Samsung. Bottom line: if you're in the market for a new TV, don't wait. (Though, chances are, you might not need a new TV.)\n\nNo one can say for sure how long the memory shortage will last, but the consensus of industry analysts is that we likely won't see a return to anything we'd consider normal before 2028. AI demand is projected to consume 70% of all high-end DRAM in 2026, so manufacturers are prioritizing it over the less advanced, less in-demand memory chips used for TVs and appliances. While investors are sinking billions into ramping up memory manufacturing, it takes around 19 months to get a factory up and running in Taiwan, and even longer in the U.S., so TV prices will likely remain high into 2028.",

    "title": "Here's Why You Should Never Use AI to Generate Your Passwords",
    "description": "ChatGPT isn't good at generating secure passwords.",
    "fullText": "I'm a bit of a broken record when it comes to personal security on the internet: Make strong passwords for each account; never reuse any passwords; and With these three steps combined, your general security is pretty much set. But how you make those passwords matters just as much as making each strong and unique. As such, please don't use an AI program to generate your passwords.\n\nIf you're a fan of chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, it might seem like a no-brainer to ask the AI to generate passwords for you. You might like how they handle other tasks for you, so it might make sense that something seemingly so high-tech yet accessible could produce secure passwords for your accounts. But LLMs (large language models) are not necessarily good at everything, and creating good passwords just so happens to be among those faults.\n\nAs highlighted by Malwarebytes Labs, researchers recently investigated AI-generated passwords, and evaluated their security. In short? The findings aren't good. Researchers tested password generation across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, and discovered that the passwords were \"highly predictable\" and \"not truly random.\" Claude, in particular, didn't fare well: Out of 50 prompts, the bot was only able to generate 23 unique passwords. Claude gave the same password as an answer 10 times. The Register reports that researchers found similar flaws with AI systems like GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro, and even Nano Banana Pro. (Gemini 3 Pro even warned the passwords shouldn't be used for \"sensitive accounts.\")\n\nThe thing is, these results seem good on the surface. They look uncrackable because they're a mix of numbers, letters, and special characters, and password strength identifiers might say they're secure. But these generations are inherently flawed, whether that's because they are repeated results, or come with a recognizable pattern. Researchers evaluated the \"entropy\" of these passwords, or the measure of unpredictability, with both \"character statistics\" and \"log probabilities.\" If that all sounds technical, the important thing to note is that the results showed entropies of 27 bits and 20 bits, respectively. Character statistics tests look for entropy of 98 bits, while log probabilities estimates look for 120 bits. You don't need to be an expert in password entropy to know that's a massive gap.\n\nHackers can use these limitations to their advantage. Bad actors can run the same prompts as researchers (or, presumably, end users) and collect the results into a bank of common passwords. If chatbots repeat passwords in their generations, it stands to reason that many people might be using the same passwords generated by those chatbots—or trying passwords that follow the same pattern. If so, hackers could simply try those passwords during break-in attempts, and if you used an LLM to generate your password, it might match. It's tough to say what that exact risk is, but to be truly secure, each of your passwords should be totally unique. Potentially using a password that hackers have in a word bank is an unnecessary risk.\n\nIt might seem surprising that a chatbot wouldn't be good at generating random passwords, but it makes sense based on how they work. LLMs are trained to predict the next token, or data point, that should appear in a sequence. In this case, the LLM is trying to choose the characters that make the most sense to appear next, which is the opposite of \"random.\" If the LLM has passwords in its training data, it may incorporate that into its answer. The password it generates makes sense in its \"mind,\" because that's what it's been trained on. It isn't programmed to be random.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional password managers are not LLMs. Instead, they are designed to produce a truly random sequence, by taking cryptographic bits and converting them into characters. These outputs are not based on existing training data and follow no patterns, so the chances that someone else out there has the same password as you (or that hackers have it stored in a word bank) is slim. There are plenty of options out there to use, and most password managers come with secure password generators.\n\nBut you don't even need one of these programs to make a secure password. Just pick two or three \"uncommon\" words, mix a few of the characters up, and presto: You have a random, unique, and secure password. For example, you could take the words \"shall,\" \"murk,\" and \"tumble,\" and combine them into \"sH@_llMurktUmbl_e.\" (Don't use that one, since it's no longer unique.)\n\nIf you're looking to boost your personally security even further, consider passkeys whenever possible. Passkeys combine the convenience of passwords with the security of 2FA: With passkeys, your device is your password. You use its built-in authentication to log in (face scan, fingerprint, or PIN), which means there's no password to actually create. Without the trusted device, hackers won't be able to break into your account.\n\nNot all accounts support passkeys, which means they aren't a universal solution right now. You'll likely need passwords for some of your accounts, which means abiding by proper security methods to keep things in order. But replacing some of your passwords with passkeys can be a step up in both security and convenience—and avoids the security pitfalls of asking ChatGPT to make your passwords for you.",

    "description": "Cloudflare introduces Code Mode for Workers AI, a technical approach to fit entire API schemas into 1,000 tokens, enabling LLM agents to execute precise tool calls with minimal latency.",
    "fullText": "Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the standard way for AI agents to use external tools. But there is a tension at its core: agents need many tools to do useful work, yet every tool added fills the model's context window, leaving less room for the actual task.\n\nCode Mode is a technique we first introduced for reducing context window usage during agent tool use. Instead of describing every operation as a separate tool, let the model write code against a typed SDK and execute the code safely in a Dynamic Worker Loader. The code acts as a compact plan. The model can explore tool operations, compose multiple calls, and return just the data it needs. Anthropic independently explored the same pattern in their Code Execution with MCP post.\n\nToday we are introducing a new MCP server for the entire Cloudflare API — from DNS and Zero Trust to Workers and R2 — that uses Code Mode. With just two tools, search() and execute(), the server is able to provide access to the entire Cloudflare API over MCP, while consuming only around 1,000 tokens. The footprint stays fixed, no matter how many API endpoints exist.\n\nFor a large API like the Cloudflare API, Code Mode reduces the number of input tokens used by 99.9%. An equivalent MCP server without Code Mode would consume 1.17 million tokens — more than the entire context window of the most advanced foundation models.\n\nCode mode savings vs native MCP, measured with tiktoken\n\nYou can start using this new Cloudflare MCP server today. And we are also open-sourcing a new Code Mode SDK in the Cloudflare Agents SDK, so you can use the same approach in your own MCP servers and AI Agents.\n\nThis new MCP server applies Code Mode server-side. Instead of thousands of tools, the server exports just two: search() and execute(). Both are powered by Code Mode. Here is the full tool surface area that gets loaded into the model context:\n\nTo discover what it can do, the agent calls search(). It writes JavaScript against a typed representation of the OpenAPI spec. The agent can filter endpoints by product, path, tags, or any other metadata and narrow thousands of endpoints to the handful it needs. The full OpenAPI spec never enters the model context. The agent only interacts with it through code.\n\nWhen the agent is ready to act, it calls execute(). The agent writes code that can make Cloudflare API requests, handle pagination, check responses, and chain operations together in a single execution.\n\nBoth tools run the generated code inside a Dynamic Worker isolate — a lightweight V8 sandbox with no file system, no environment variables to leak through prompt injection and external fetches disabled by default. Outbound requests can be explicitly controlled with outbound fetch handlers when needed.\n\nSuppose a user tells their agent: \"protect my origin from DDoS attacks.\" The agent's first step is to consult documentation. It might call the Cloudflare Docs MCP Server, use a Cloudflare Skill, or search the web directly. From the docs it learns: put Cloudflare WAF and DDoS protection rules in front of the origin.\n\nStep 1: Search for the right endpoints\nThe search tool gives the model a spec object: the full Cloudflare OpenAPI spec with all $refs pre-resolved. The model writes JavaScript against it. Here the agent looks for WAF and ruleset endpoints on a zone:\n\nThe server runs this code in a Workers isolate and returns:\n\nThe full Cloudflare API spec has over 2,500 endpoints. The model narrowed that to the WAF and ruleset endpoints it needs, without any of the spec entering the context window.\n\nThe model can also drill into a specific endpoint's schema before calling it. Here it inspects what phases are available on zone rulesets:\n\nThe agent now knows the exact phases it needs: ddos_l7 for DDoS protection and http_request_firewall_managed for WAF.\n\nStep 2: Act on the API\nThe agent switches to using execute. The sandbox gets a cloudflare.request() client that can make authenticated calls to the Cloudflare API. First the agent checks what rulesets already exist on the zone:\n\nThe agent sees that managed DDoS and WAF rulesets already exist. It can now chain calls to inspect their rules and update sensitivity levels in a single execution:\n\nThis entire operation, from searching the spec and inspecting a schema to listing rulesets and fetching DDoS and WAF configurations, took four tool calls.\n\nWe started with MCP servers for individual products. Want an agent that manages DNS? Add the DNS MCP server. Want Workers logs? Add the Workers Observability MCP server. Each server exported a fixed set of tools that mapped to API operations. This worked when the tool set was small, but the Cloudflare API has over 2,500 endpoints. No collection of hand-maintained servers could keep up.\n\nThe Cloudflare MCP server simplifies this. Two tools, roughly 1,000 tokens, and coverage of every endpoint in the API. When we add new products, the same search() and execute() code paths discover and call them — no new tool definitions, no new MCP servers. It even has support for the GraphQL Analytics API.\n\nOur MCP server is built on the latest MCP specifications. It is OAuth 2.1 compliant, using Workers OAuth Provider to downscope the token to selected permissions approved by the user when connecting. The agent  only gets the capabilities the user explicitly granted.\n\nFor developers, this means you can use a simple agent loop and still give your agent access to the full Cloudflare API with built-in progressive capability discovery.\n\nSeveral approaches have emerged to reduce how many tokens MCP tools consume:\n\nClient-side Code Mode was our first experiment. The model writes TypeScript against typed SDKs and runs it in a Dynamic Worker Loader on the client. The tradeoff is that it requires the agent to ship with secure sandbox access. Code Mode is implemented in Goose and Anthropics Claude SDK as Programmatic Tool Calling.\n\nCommand-line interfaces are another path. CLIs are self-documenting and reveal capabilities as the agent explores. Tools like OpenClaw and Moltworker convert MCP servers into CLIs using MCPorter to give agents progressive disclosure. The limitation is obvious: the agent needs a shell, which not every environment provides and which introduces a much broader attack surface than a sandboxed isolate.\n\nDynamic tool search, as used by Anthropic in Claude Code, surfaces a smaller set of tools hopefully relevant to the current task. It shrinks context use but now requires a search function that must be maintained and evaluated, and each matched tool still uses tokens.\n\nEach approach solves a real problem. But for MCP servers specifically, server-side Code Mode combines their strengths: fixed token cost regardless of API size, no modifications needed on the agent side, progressive discovery built in, and safe execution inside a sandboxed isolate. The agent just calls two tools with code. Everything else happens on the server.\n\nThe Cloudflare MCP server is available now. Point your MCP client at the server URL and you'll be redirected to Cloudflare to authorize and select the permissions to grant to your agent. Add this config to your MCP client:\n\nFor CI/CD, automation, or if you prefer managing tokens yourself, create a Cloudflare API token with the permissions you need. Both user tokens and account tokens are supported and can be passed as bearer tokens in the Authorization header.\n\nMore information on different MCP setup configurations can be found at the Cloudflare MCP repository.\n\nCode Mode solves context costs for a single API. But agents rarely talk to one service. A developer's agent might need the Cloudflare API alongside GitHub, a database, and an internal docs server. Each additional MCP server brings the same context window pressure we started with.\n\nCloudflare MCP Server Portals let you compose multiple MCP servers behind a single gateway with unified auth and access control. We are building a first-class Code Mode integration for all your MCP servers, and exposing them to agents with built-in progressive discovery and the same fixed-token footprint, regardless of how many services sit behind the gateway.",

    "fullText": "Two memory-product entrepreneurs have seen their fortunes rocket this year thanks to heady demand from AI giants.\n\nDavid Sun, 74, and John Tu, 84, are the cofounders and 50-50 owners of Kingston Technology, a leading maker of computer drives and memory modules. Sun is the California company's operating chief, while Tu is president and CEO.\n\nThe pair have seen their respective net worths soar by 44%, or nearly $14 billion, since the start of January, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nOnly Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Czechoslovak Group CEO Michal Strnad, and Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim have gained more wealth so far this year.\n\nSun and Tu have even outpaced Jim, Alice, and Rob Walton; the heirs to the Walmart fortune were up about $13 billion each for the year at Thursday's close.\n\nThe memory magnates are both worth about $45 billion, putting them in 45th and 46th place respectively on the rich list — ahead of the likes of MacKenzie Scott, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, and Miriam Adelson.\n\nSun and Tu were born in Taiwan and mainland China, respectively, studied electrical engineering in college, and emigrated to the US in the 1970s, per Bloomberg. They met in Los Angeles, where they bonded over basketball and went into business together.\n\nThe pair founded a memory-device company, Camintonn, in 1982, and sold it four years later for $6 million, Bloomberg says. They lost all their savings in the Black Monday crash of 1987, but went on to found Kingston and sell 80% of it to SoftBank for $1.5 billion in 1996. They bought back the stake for $450 million in 1999.\n\nAI hyperscalers have been clamoring for memory chips to build out data centers, fueling a severe global shortage that has driven prices skyward.\n\nThis \"memory supercycle\" promises to boost revenues and profits at memory-product companies, which has propelled their stock prices in recent months.\n\nFor example, Micron Technology stock has more than quadrupled over the past 12 months, valuing the memory-chip maker at $470 billion — more than Mastercard, Oracle, Costco, Bank of America, or Home Depot are worth.",

    "fullText": "Anxiety has been high among investors and consumers lately amid a cocktail of macroeconomic and market pressures, but Yoni Assia, the founder and CEO of trading platform eToro, isn't worried.\n\nLeading tech stocks have struggled year to date amid fears of AI disruption across a wide range of industries, while bearish sentiment has pressured crypto prices lower. Assia told Business Insider, though, that he believes both markets will rebound in 2026 and that he remains optimistic about monetary policy shifts.\n\neToro competes in a crowded field of retail-oriented trading platforms, but Assia thinks the platform has carved out a niche for itself among retail traders who utilize its more advanced features. According to Assia, its users haven't shied away from trading recently but have seized the opportunity to buy the dip on discounted tech stocks.\n\n\"I definitely think that it's a bit blown up a bit in proportion,\" he said, \"I think right now, people are a bit excited about the AI correction. I think that's going to pass.\"\n\nAssia added that he's seen traders rotate away from crypto and into precious metals recently. He's not surprised by this, as gold and silver prices have stabilized while crypto continues to fall. Yet, Assia is optimistic that crypto is poised for a comeback from its brutal bear market later this year.\n\n\"After a correction, after all-time high post-halving, you get a bull run, then you have a correction, and then it basically resets three to six months after that correction,\" he said.\n\nThis view is similar to that of other crypto pros who have speculated that if historic market cycles are any guide, crypto prices are due to rebound soon.\n\nAnother factor that has weighed heavily on the minds of some investors is monetary policy shifts that may be coming as a result of Kevin Warsh's appointment to the Federal Reserve. But Assia noted that if the new Fed chair proceeds with the expected rate cuts, it will likely help spur growth for the broader market.\n\n\"Historically, as rate cuts go lower, trading volumes go higher and leverage goes higher in the industry in general,\" he stated. \"The cost of borrowing money goes down, and the ability to more easily leverage goes up, which elevates stocks in the long run.\"",

    "fullText": "The memory shortage takes no prisoners. Even Google isn't immune.\n\nAI companies are duking it out for greater and greater quantities of memory chips. The problem? The industry is heavily supply-constrained. Costs have skyrocketed, products have been tied up, and some companies — especially those in consumer electronics — are increasing prices.\n\nOn the AI front, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told CNBC that physical challenges were \"constraining a lot of deployment.\" Google sees \"so much more demand\" for Gemini and its other models than it could serve, he said.\n\n\"Also, it does constrain a little bit the research,\" Hassabis said. \"You need a lot of chips to be able to experiment on new ideas at a big enough scale that you can actually see if they're going to work.\"\n\nResearchers want chips, whether they work at Google, Meta, OpenAI, or other Big Tech companies, and memory is a key component. Mark Zuckerberg said that AI researchers demanded two things beyond money: the fewest number of people reporting to them, and the most chips possible.\n\nHassabis said that wherever there was a capacity constraint, there was a \"choke point.\"\n\n\"The whole supply chain is kind of strained,\" Hassabis said. \"We're lucky, because we have our own TPUs, so we have our own chip designs.\"\n\nGoogle has long built TPUs — Tensor Processing Units — for internal use. The company also leases them to external customers through its cloud, which has also put Nvidia on edge.\n\nBut even access to their own TPUs won't save Google from having to navigate the highly competitive memory market. \"It still, in the end, actually comes down to a few suppliers of a few key components,\" Hassabis said.\n\nThree suppliers dominate memory chip production: Samsung, Micron, and SK Hynix. These companies are struggling to meet demand for chips from AI hyperscalers without dropping their longtime electronics customers.\n\nIt doesn't help that AI companies mainly want a different type of memory chip than PC manufacturers do. Large language model producers want HBM (high-bandwidth memory) chips.\n\nDon't expect Google's spending on AI infrastructure and chips to go down anytime soon. On its fourth-quarter earnings call, the company projected capital expenditures of $175 billion to $185 billion for 2026.",

This blog is an attempt at distilling the techniques, motivations, and considerations used to train their models with an emphasis on training methodology over infrastructure.\n\nThese notes are largely structured based on Hugging Face’s SmolLM3 report due to its extensiveness, and it is currently supplemented with notes from other reports including Intellect-3, gpt-oss-120b, Hermes 4, DeepSeek, and Kimi. While this blog explores some infrastructure-related ideas like in-flight weight updates and multi-client orchestrators, there are many other ideas mentioned throughout those posts/blogs like expert parallelism and quantization. Hugging Face writes more about gpt-oss-120b’s infrastructure here.\n\nArchitecture decisions fundamentally determine a model’s efficiency, capabilities, and training dynamics. Model families like DeepSeek, gpt-oss-120b, Kimi, and SmolLM have vastly different architectures (dense vs MoE), attention mechanisms (MHA vs MLA vs GQA), position encodings (RoPE, partial RoPE, NoPE), among many others. Not all information about the models is publicly available, so some are chosen:\n\nWhen choosing architecture, Hugging Face suggests following a decision tree such that if one of these is true, choose a dense architecture:\n\nMulti-head attention (MHA) uses separate query, key, and value projections for each attention head, but this creates a large KV-cache that becomes an inference bottleneck and GPU memory hoarder. To address this, researchers developed multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped query attention (GQA). In MQA, KV values are shared across all heads, but this comes at a cost of leaking attention capacity because heads can’t store information specialized to each head’s role. GQA softens this issue by sharing KV values across a small group of heads (e.g. 4). Another alternative is multi-latent attention (MLA) which stores a compressed latent variable that can be decompressed/projected into KV values at runtime. The latent variable is typically much smaller than the full KV cache (often achieving 4-8x compression), and this results in a KV-cache parameter count more comparable to GQA while maintaining performance stronger than MQA.\n\nWhen ablating (for variables that change the parameter count such as changing MHA to GQA, they occasionally adjust other hyperparameters to keep model sizes roughly the same), Hugging Face found that GQA with small groups (2/4/8) outperformed MHA in their ablations and that MHA outperformed MQA and GQA with 16 groups. Across benchmarks like HellaSwag, MMLU, and ARC, GQA with 2/4/8 groups performed best in their experiments.\n\nGated attention applies an elementwise gating mechanism to the scaled dot-product attention output before the output projection. A gate vector $\\mathbf{g}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}^G \\mathbf{x}_t)$ is computed from the input, where $\\mathbf{x}_t$ is the input at position $t$, $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $\\mathbf{W}^G$ is a learned gate projection matrix. This gate is split across $h_q$ attention heads (where $h_q$ is the number of query heads), and each head’s attention output is elementwise multiplied by its corresponding gate segment: $\\tilde{\\mathbf{o}}_{t,i} = \\mathbf{o}^{\\text{sdpa}}_{t,i} \\odot \\mathbf{g}_{t,i}$ where $\\mathbf{o}^{\\text{sdpa}}_{t,i}$ represents the scaled dot-product attention output for head $i$ at position $t$, $\\odot$ denotes elementwise multiplication, and $\\mathbf{g}_{t,i}$ is the gate segment for head $i$. The gated outputs are then concatenated and projected through the output matrix $\\mathbf{W}^O$ to produce the final output.\n\nGated attention reduces attention sinks (tokens receiving disproportionately high attention), reduces large activations that destabilize training, and improves performance on evaluations and long-sequence generalization. Critically, it stabilizes training and reduces loss spikes, making it valuable for large-scale training.\n\nWhen pre-training, a common consideration is fixed sequence lengths since training uses tensors of the form [batch, sequence length, hidden], so with regards to batching and distributed training, GPUs are most happy when every example has the same sequence length. But due to variable document length and wanting to avoid padding which wastes compute, packing enables shuffling and concatenating documents within the same sequence to achieve the sequence length.\n\nCausal masking means that for unrelated files $A$ and $B$ in the same batch, the tokens in $B$ can attend to the tokens in $A$, which degrades performance. With intra-document masking, the attention mask is modified so tokens can only attend to previous tokens within the same document. Many papers have found benefits relating to long-context extension and some short context benchmarks as well as shortening the average context length.\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of causal masking (left) and intra-document masking (right). Causal masking allows tokens to attend to all preceding tokens regardless of document boundaries, while intra-document masking restricts attention to tokens within the same document. From @PMinervini.\n\nWhen implementing document masking, Hugging Face saw small improvements on PIQA but otherwise no noticeable impact on short context tasks. But in line with aforementioned research, they observed that it became crucial for scaling from 4k to 64k tokens.\n\nThe decision of whether to use intra-document attention masking can depend on model scale. For smaller models, some implementations choose to omit intra-document masking, finding that the additional complexity and potential reduction in cross-document learning doesn’t justify the benefits at those scales. However, for larger models, intra-document masking becomes more critical as the model’s capacity to learn from cross-document attention patterns diminishes relative to the benefits of cleaner document boundaries.\n\nInput embeddings (token-to-vector lookup) and output embeddings (hidden states to vocab logits) are typically represented as separate matrices, so the total embedding parameters are $2 \\times \\text{vocab size} \\times \\text{hidden dim}$. In small language models, this can account for up to 20% of total parameters, as is the case with Llama 3.2 1B (in larger models, the embeddings represent a much smaller fraction of the parameter count, only 3% in Llama 3.1 70B). The issue with tying them is that input/output embeddings still represent different geometries, and frequent tokens like “the” can dominate representation learning due to getting gradients from both the input stream and the predicted output.\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of untied embeddings (separate input and output matrices) vs tied embeddings (shared matrix). Tied embeddings reduce parameter count while maintaining comparable performance. From PyTorch Blog.\n\nHugging Face found that on a 1.2B model, tied embeddings did comparably well despite having 18% fewer parameters (down from 1.46B), and that compared to an untied model also with 1.2B parameters (fewer layers), untied showed higher loss and lower downstream eval scores.\n\nWithout positional encoding, transformers have no sense of word order, akin to the bag of words idea. Initially, absolute position embeddings were used by learning a lookup table that mapped the position index to a vector added to token embeddings, but the maximum input sequence length was limited by the sequence length it was trained on. Relative position encodings followed since capturing distance between tokens matters more than capturing their absolute positions.\n\nThe most commonly used technique is rotary position embedding (RoPE), which encodes position information by rotating query and key vectors in 2D planes. RoPE encodes relative position as rotation angles: based on the dimensionality of the query/key vector, RoPE splits it into pairs (since they rotate in 2D space) and rotates depending on the absolute position of a token and a base frequency. During attention, the dot product between their rotated positions directly encodes their relative distance via the phase difference in their rotation angles, where tokens $x$ positions apart always maintain the same angular relationship.\n\nFigure 3: RoPE splits query/key vectors into pairs and rotates each pair by an angle proportional to position. From Su et al., 2021.\n\nDuring pre-training, models are trained on shorter context lengths (similar ideas to document masking, and quadratic attention is expensive) to learn short range correlation between words. But as sequence length grows, the rotation angles grow via $\\theta= \\text{position} \\times \\frac1{\\text{base}^{\\frac{k}{\\text{dim}/2}}}$. This can be fixed by increasing the base frequency as the sequence length increases using methods like ABF (Adaptive Base Frequency) or YaRN, which applies a more granular interpolation of frequencies on different components and includes other techniques like dynamic attention scaling and temperature adjustment. For extremely long contexts, YaRN does best, and in gpt-oss-120b, it was used to extend the context length of dense layers up to 131k tokens.\n\nMore recently, with the emphasis on long contexts, NoPE (no position embedding) and RNoPE, a hybrid method, have emerged. NoPE uses only causal masking and attention patterns, so it doesn’t bump into the issue of extrapolating beyond training lengths but shows weaker performance on short context reasoning and knowledge-based tasks. RNoPE alternates applying RoPE and NoPE on attention blocks, where RoPE handles local context and NoPE helps with longer-range information retrieval. Another idea is Partial RoPE, which applies RoPE/NoPE within the same layer.\n\nHugging Face ran ablations using RoPE, RNoPE (removing positional encoding every 4th layer), and RNoPE with document masking. They found that all achieve similar performance on short-context tasks, so they adopt RNoPE + document masking because it provides the foundation for long-context handling.\n\nFigure 4: five common types of attention. From Hugging Face.\n\nNote: This section covers attention pattern modifications (which change which tokens can attend to which other tokens). These are distinct from positional encoding scaling methods like ABF/YaRN (discussed in the “positional encodings” section), which adjust how position information is encoded without changing attention patterns. The following methods modify attention patterns to reduce computational cost:\n\nInterleaving local and global attention alternates between layers that use local attention (restricted to nearby tokens) and global attention (full sequence). This pattern balances computational efficiency with the ability to capture both local and long-range dependencies. Local layers reduce quadratic complexity while maintaining local context, and global layers ensure that distant relationships aren’t lost. When training encounters instability or loss spikes, adjusting the ratio of global layers (for example, increasing their frequency) can result in quicker loss recovery, as the model regains access to long-range information that may be crucial for certain patterns. The interleaving strategy is particularly effective for long-context models where full global attention would be computationally prohibitive.\n\nMoEs (mixture of experts), analogous to our brain activating different regions for different tasks, provide an alternative to dense models. At inference, only certain “experts” are activated based on the input, dramatically reducing compute compared to dense models where all parameters are active. The MoE works by replacing the feed forward layer with multiple MLPs (experts) and adding a learnable router before the MLPs to select the experts. The router typically uses top-k gating, selecting the $k$ experts with highest affinity scores for each token, where $k$ is usually much smaller than the total number of experts (e.g., 8 out of 384).\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of dense architecture and MoE architecture. From Sebastian Raschka.\n\nIn general, for fixed number and size of active experts, increasing the total number of experts improves loss, and high sparsity improves performance and benefits more from increasing compute. Recent models are much more sparse, with over 100 experts and around 10 active per token.\n\nTo determine how large each expert should be, a common metric is granularity, defined by $G = 2 \\cdot \\frac{d_\\text{model}}{d_\\text{expert}}$, where a higher granularity corresponds to more experts with a smaller dimension; this can be interpreted as a number proportional to the experts needed to match the dense MLP width. Recent models have granularity anywhere from 2 (gpt-oss-120b) to 8 (qwen3-next-80b-a3b). Ant Group showed that granularity doesn’t significantly change loss but does drive efficiency leverage (the ratio of flops needed for an MoE to achieve the same loss as a dense model). And overall, MoEs present a good alternative to dense models in terms of compute for training and inference.\n\nShared experts are always-on experts, which absorb the basic, recurring patterns so that other experts can more aggressively specialize; one is often enough (DeepSeek-V2 uses two, which adds a bit of complexity).\n\nLoad balancing is crucial in that if it fails, not only do training and inference efficiency plummet, but so do effective learning capacity. The routing mechanism typically uses top-k gating: for each token, the router computes affinity scores (often via a learned linear projection followed by softmax), selects the top $k$ experts, and routes the token to those experts. To ensure balanced expert utilization, this can be addressed by adding a loss-based load balancer (LBL) given by $\\mathcal{L} = \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^{N_r} f_i P_i$ where $N_r$ is the total number of experts, $\\alpha$ determines the strength of the balancing term, $f_i$ is the fraction of tokens routed to expert $i$, and $P_i$ is the probability mass (average routing probability) for expert $i$; so in perfect load balancing, $f_i=P_i=\\frac1{N_r}$. Also, $\\alpha$ should not be so large that routing uniformity overwhelms the primary training objective. These should be monitored using global statistics, not local statistics which may suffer from a local batch being narrow, biasing the routing statistics.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 does loss-free load balancing differently, by adding a bias term to affinity scores going into the routing softmax.\n\nBeyond bias-based approaches, several other routing and load balancing strategies have emerged. Some implementations use learnable routing functions that adapt during training, while others incorporate expert capacity constraints that prevent any single expert from being overwhelmed. The key insight across these methods is that effective load balancing must operate using global statistics aggregated across multiple batches, as local batch statistics can be misleadingly narrow and bias routing decisions.\n\nSequence-wise auxiliary loss extends traditional auxiliary losses to promote balance within a sequence.\n\nHere, $T$ is the sequence length, $\\alpha$ is a small coefficient, $\\mathbb{1}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function (which is 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise), and $K_r$ is the number of active experts per token.\n\nHere, for each token at each position $t$ in the sequence, each expert $i$ is assigned a routing score $s_{i,t}$, which is normalized so that $\\tilde{s}_{i,t}$ captures the proportion of the routing probability assigned to expert $i$ at position $t$. Averaging this over the whole sequence gives $P_i$, which represents, on average, how often expert $i$ is considered for routing across the sequence. The $f_i$ term furthers this by reflecting the fraction of times expert $i$ is actually selected (i.e., is among the top $K_r$ experts for a token, after bias terms $b_i$ are added). The loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Bal}}$ encourages the product $f_i P_i$ to be similar across different experts, pushing the model toward evenly distributing routing decisions and load; if any expert is used much more or less than others, the loss will increase, nudging the model back toward balanced expert activation.\n\nAuxiliary-loss free load balancing methods avoid introducing interference gradients by maintaining a bias vector $\\mathbf{b}=[b_1, \\cdots, b_{N_r}]$ which is updated in a decoupled fashion. Let $n_i$ be the number of tokens routed to expert $i$ in the current step and $\\bar{n}=\\frac1{N_r} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_r} n_i$ the mean load across all experts. $b_i$ is updated by\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the bias update speed, a sort of learning rate. This particular version includes the additional recentering of expert bias updates.\n\nSequence-wise MoE Balancing with Uniformity (SMEBU) load balancing operates at the sequence level rather than the token level, ensuring that expert utilization remains balanced across entire sequences. The normalized per-expert violation is calculated by $v_i=\\frac{\\bar{n}-n_i}{\\bar{n}}$ and $\\tilde{v}_i=\\tanh(\\kappa v_i)$, which makes the scale independent of sequence length and batch size. Then $b_i$ is updated using a momentum buffer with momentum factor $\\beta$:\n\n$\\tanh$ applies the soft-clamping, with tunable scale $\\kappa$ to control saturation speed; $\\tanh$ over $\\text{sign}(\\cdot)$ maintains the continuity and stability needed during training whereas $\\text{sign}$ forces updates to be $\\pm \\lambda$, making the update step oscillate. Momentum also is introduced as a form of noise dampening, analogous to momentum SGD reducing variance in noisy gradient updates\n\nBecause transformers don’t deal efficiently with long context while RNNs can, one idea is to combine both to get the best of both worlds. By dropping the softmax from the output for token $t$:\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{q}_t$, $\\mathbf{k}_j$, and $\\mathbf{v}_j$ are the query, key, and value vectors at positions $t$ and $j$, respectively, and $\\mathbf{o}_t$ is the output at position $t$. By defining $S_t :=\\sum_{j=1}^t \\mathbf{k}_j \\mathbf{v}_j^\\top$, then we get a recurrent relation where $S_t$ summarizes all past $(k_j, v_j)$ pairs:\n\nwhere $S_{t-1}$ is the state from the previous time step. While this gets us closer to an RNN-esque structure, in practice, softmax stabilizes training, and the linear form can cause instability without normalization. With RNNs, it is sometimes helpful to forget the past, by introducing a gate $\\mathbf{G}_t$ for the previous state \n\\(\\mathbf{S}_t=\\mathbf{G}_t \\odot \\mathbf{S}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{v}_t\\mathbf{k}_t^\\top\\)\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes elementwise multiplication and $\\mathbf{G}_t$ is a learned gating mechanism.\nMamba-2 is among the most popular, being used in hybrid models like Nemotron-H and Falcon H1. Hybrid models are becoming increasingly popular, notably in Qwen3-Next with a gated DeltaNet update and Kimi’s next model, likely using their “kimi delta attention.”\n\nTraining stability is crucial for successful large-scale model training. Several techniques help prevent training failures, including regularization methods, careful initialization, and architectural choices. The following sections cover key stability mechanisms:\n\n$z$-loss is a regularization term added to the standard cross entropy loss that keeps logits from drifting to large magnitudes. The softmax denominator is $Z = \\sum_{i=1}^V e^{z_i}$, and by adding $\\mathcal{L} = \\lambda \\cdot \\log^2(Z)$ to the loss, we penalize based on $\\log(Z)$ which represents the overall logit scale.\n\nOn their 1B model, Hugging Face found that adding $Z$-loss didn’t impact training loss or downstream performance, so they chose not to include it due to training overhead. For logit stabilization, logit softcapping (see below) is generally preferred in modern recipes, following the Gemma 2 and Gemma 3 models.\n\nLogit softcapping prevents logits from growing excessively large by mapping them into a bounded range via a smooth, differentiable transformation. Unlike hard clipping (which has zero gradient at the boundaries and can cause training instability), softcapping uses $\\tanh$ to compress values smoothly. The Gemma 2 report introduces the formulation used in production models: cap logits such that values stay within $(-\\texttt{soft_cap}, +\\texttt{soft_cap})$ using\n\nwhere $\\texttt{soft_cap}$ is the threshold hyperparameter controlling the output range. The division normalizes inputs before $\\tanh$ and the multiplication by $\\texttt{soft_cap}$ rescales to the desired interval. Unlike $z$-loss (which adds a regularization term to the loss), softcapping operates directly on activations in the forward pass\n\nGemma 2 applies softcapping to both attention logits (pre-softmax) and the final language modeling head. They set $\\texttt{soft_cap}=50.0$ for attention layers and $\\texttt{soft_cap}=30.0$ for the final layer. The technique traces back to Bello et al., 2016 in the context of neural machine translation. However, one caveat is that logit softcapping is incompatible with Flash Attention / SDPA during training because those fused kernels assume standard attention. The Hugging Face Gemma 2 blog notes that for stable fine-tuning, you must use attn_implementation=\"eager\"; inference can still use SDPA with minimal quality difference. This writeup gives a concise technical overview.\n\nDespite being a regularization technique, removing weight decay from embeddings can improve training stability. Weight decay causes embedding norm to decrease, but this can lead to larger gradients in earlier layers since the LayerNorm Jacobian has a $\\frac1{\\sigma}$ term (coming from normalization) which is inversely proportional to the input norm $\\sigma$.\n\nHugging Face tested this using a weight decay baseline, a no weight decay baseline, and another combining all previous adopted changes and found no significant loss or eval results, so they included no weight decay.\n\nSimilar to $z$-loss, QK-norm helps prevent attention logits from becoming too large by applying LayerNorm to both the query and key vectors before computing attention. However, the same paper which proposed RNoPE found that it hurts long-context tasks because the normalization de-emphasizes relevant tokens and emphasizes irrelevant tokens by stripping the query-key dot product of its magnitude.\n\nRMSNorm maintains comparable performance to LayerNorm while being computationally simpler, due to avoiding the mean-centering computation. A variant called depth-scaled sandwich norm applies normalization both before and after the attention/MLP blocks, with the normalization scale adjusted based on the layer depth:\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_\\ell$ and $\\mathbf{y}_\\ell$ are input/output of layer $\\ell$, $\\mathcal{M}_\\ell$ is the sublayer module (like attention, FFN, or MoE). The RMSNorm gain, $\\gamma$, is a multiplicative factor applied after the RMS normalization, given by $\\bar{a}_i = \\gamma\\frac{a_i}{\\text{RMSNorm(a)}}$. In Arcee’s case, they initialize $\\gamma\\left(\\text{RMSNorm}_\\ell^{(1)}\\right)=1$ and $\\gamma\\left(\\text{RMSNorm}_\\ell^{(2)}\\right)=\\frac1{\\sqrt{L}}$. This depth-dependent scaling accounts for the fact that activations evolve differently across layers. The sandwich pattern (pre-norm and post-norm) provides additional stability, especially in very deep networks where gradient flow can be challenging.\n\nArcee also applies RMSNorm before the language modeling head stabilizes the final hidden states to ensure consistent output activation scales before they are transformed into token probabilities.\n\nThere are a few considerations that typically guide tokenizer design:\n\nLarger vocabularies can compress text more efficiently, but they come at the cost of a larger embedding matrix, which as mentioned in the embeddings section, can take up a sizable portion of the parameter count. For english-only models, 50k is often enough, while multilingual models need over 100k. There is an optimal size that exists since compression gains from larger vocabularies decrease exponentially.\n\nLarge models benefit from large vocabularies since the extra compression saves more on the forward pass (project to QKV, attention, and MLP) than the additional embedding tokens during softmax. For memory, larger vocab means fewer tokens, so a smaller KV cache.\n\nBPE (byte-pair encoding) still remains the de facto choice. Starting with tiny units (e.g. characters or bytes), the BPE algorithm repeatedly merges the most common adjacent pair into a new token. To evaluate a tokenizer’s performance, fertility is a common metric, measuring the average number of tokens needed to encode a word (alternatively, characters-to-tokens ratio or bytes-to-tokens ratio, but these have limitations due to word length variability and byte representations). Another is proportion of continued words, describing what percentage of words get split into multiple pieces. For both, smaller metrics indicate more efficient tokenizers.\n\nThere are many strong existing tokenizers, like GPT4’s tokenizer and Gemma3’s tokenizer. Often, using existing tokenizers is enough; only when we want to train for low-resource languages or have a different data mixture should we continue training our own tokenizer.\n\nChoosing optimizers and tuning hyperparameters is notoriously time-consuming and significantly impacts convergence speed and training stability. While we may be tempted to distill those from models of larger labs (albeit a useful prior), it may not fit the use case.\n\nDespite being invented over 10 years ago, AdamW still stands the test of time. Adam (adaptive momentum estimation) updates weights individually based on an exponential weighted average of gradients $g_t$ and an exponential weighted average of squared gradients $g_t^2$, along with weight decay (the “W”). The exponential moving averages provide adaptive learning rates per parameter: parameters with consistently large gradients get smaller effective learning rates (via the squared gradient term), while parameters with small or noisy gradients get larger effective learning rates. This adaptivity helps stabilize training and converge faster:\n\nwhere $\\theta$ denotes the model parameters, $\\alpha$ is the learning rate, $\\lambda$ is the weight decay coefficient, $g_t$ is the gradient at step $t$, $m_t$ and $v_t$ are the first and second moment estimates (exponentially weighted averages), $\\hat{m}_t$ and $\\hat{v}_t$ are bias-corrected versions, $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ are exponential decay rates for the moment estimates, and $\\epsilon$ is a small constant (typically $10^{-8}$) to prevent division by zero. Even for modern LLMs, the hyperparameters remain largely unchanged: weight decay factor $\\lambda=0.1$ or $\\lambda=0.01$, $\\beta_1=0.9$, and $\\beta_2=0.95$.\n\nUnlike AdamW which updates per-parameter, muon treats the weight matrix as a singular object and updates based on matrix-level operations. This approach reduces axis-aligned bias (where optimization favors certain coordinate directions) and encourages exploration of directions that would otherwise be suppressed. By considering the entire weight matrix structure rather than individual parameters, muon can better capture correlations between parameters:\n\nwhere $\\theta_t$ denotes the model parameters at step $t$, $\\mathcal{L}_t$ is the loss function, $g_t$ is the gradient matrix, $G_t$ is the normalized gradient matrix (typically $G_t = g_t / |g_t|$), $B_t$ is a momentum buffer matrix with $B_0=0$, $\\mu$ is the momentum coefficient, $\\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\\text{NewtonSchulz5}$ applies the odd function $f(x)=3.4445x-4.7750x^3+2.0315x^5$. This blog and this blog describe the algebra of it in more detail as well as why the coefficients are what they are. The Newton-Schulz iteration approximates the matrix sign function: we can estimate the SVD decompositions of $G=U \\Sigma V^\\top$ by $UV^\\top$, and $f(x)$ essentially replaces $\\Sigma$ because iteratively applying $f$ (i.e., $f \\circ f \\circ \\cdots f(x)$) converges to the sign function, which normalizes the singular values. This has the effect of reducing axis-aligned bias and encouraging exploration of directions that would otherwise be suppressed.\n\nMuon is more sample-efficient than AdamW, especially at large batch sizes where AdamW struggles. Some implementations, including Arcee’s Trinity Large, choose a hybrid approach: using muon for hidden layers while keeping AdamW for embedding and output layers. This decision stems from the different optimization dynamics these layers exhibit—embeddings and output projections benefit from per-parameter adaptive learning rates, while hidden layers capture more benefit from muon’s matrix-level structure awareness.\n\nBut since muon operates at the matrix level, applying NewtonSchulz requires access to the full gradient tensor. One method uses an overlapping round-robin scheme where each rank is responsible for gathering all gradient matrices corresponding to its index and applying muon locally. Since FSDP expects sharded gradients/updates, and every rank has its shard of the muon-updated gradient, then the optimizer step can proceed normally. However, this issues lots of overlapping collectives across many matrices which breaks at scale.\n\nThe alternative that Prime adapts is based on all-to-all collectives which does bulk permutation so that each rank temporarily owns full gradients for its matrices, runs muon, then bulk permutes them back. This may require padding since many tensors are packed into contiguous buffers which can change the size that’s expected. However, this requires fewer collectives and scales better.\n\nBuilding on Muon, Kimi K2 introduces MuonClip, a stabilization technique that prevents exploding attention logits, which is a common failure mode in large-scale training. Other strategies include logit soft-cap, which applies $\\tanh$ clipping to the pre-softmax logits, or QK-norm, which applies LayerNorm to the QK matrices. However, these lead to issues of the scaled dot-product exploding (making bounding too late) and distorted gradients around regions where the model is unstable in logit soft-cap, and key matrices are not materialized during inference (projected from a latent variable).\n\nFor each attention head $h$, consider $\\mathbf{Q}^h$, $\\mathbf{K}^h$, and $\\mathbf{V}^h$ (the query, key, and value matrices for head $h$). For a batch $B$ and input representation $\\mathbf{X}$, define the max logit as a per-head scalar to be the maximum input to softmax\n\nwhere $d$ is the dimension of the query/key vectors, $i$ and $j$ index positions in the sequence, and the $\\frac1{\\sqrt{d}}$ scaling factor matches the standard attention scaling. Set $S_\\text{max} = \\max_h S_\\text{max}^h$ (the maximum across all heads) and target threshold $\\tau$ (a hyperparameter controlling when clipping activates). The idea is to rescale $\\mathbf{W}_k^h$ and $\\mathbf{W}_q^h$ (the key and query projection weight matrices for head $h$) whenever $S_\\text{max}^h$ exceeds $\\tau$. Also, $\\gamma=\\min(1, \\frac{\\tau}{S_\\text{max}})$ (the global clipping factor), one approach is to clip all heads simultaneously by\n\nwhere the $\\gamma$ exponentials enforce multiplicative weight decay for $\\mathbf{Q}^h \\mathbf{K}^{h\\top}$; commonly, $\\alpha=0.5$ to ensure equal scaling to queries and keys. However, not all heads exhibit exploding logits, which motivates a per-head clipping based on $\\gamma_h = \\min(1, \\frac{\\tau}{S_\\text{max}^h})$, which is more straightforward for MHA but less for MLA. The challenge with MLA is that keys are projected from a latent variable rather than materialized directly, so clipping must be applied to the latent-to-key projection weights and the latent variable itself. They apply clipping only on $\\mathbf{q}^C$ and $\\mathbf{k}^C$ (head-specific components) scaled by $\\sqrt{\\gamma_h}$, $\\mathbf{q}^R$ (head-specific rotary) scaled by $\\gamma_h$, and $\\mathbf{Q}^R$ (shared rotary). Besides that, the main muon algorithm is modified to match Adam RMS and enable weight decay. For each weight $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$:\n\nwhere $n$ and $m$ are the dimensions of the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$, $\\sqrt{\\max(n,m)} \\cdot 0.2$ is a scaling factor that adapts the update magnitude to the matrix size (matching Adam’s RMS scaling behavior), and other symbols follow the same definitions as in the standard Muon algorithm. The weight decay term $(1-\\eta \\lambda)$ is applied multiplicatively before the gradient update.\n\nFigure 6: Left: a mid-scale training run on a 9B active, 53B total MoE where attention logits diverge quickly. Right: maximum logits for KimiK2 with MuonClip and $\\tau=100$, where max logits eventually decays to a stable range after ~30% of the training steps. From Kimi K2.\n\nLearning rates have their own life cycle: they warmup (typically 1%-5% of training steps for short trainings, but large labs fix the warmup steps) from zero to avoid chaos, then anneal after settling into a good minimum. Cosine annealing was the go-to scheduler, but it’s also inflexible due to the cosine period needing to match the total training duration. Alternatives include warmup-stable-decay (WSD) and multi-step; in the last x% of tokens, the former linearly decays the learning rate whereas multi-step does discrete drops. For WSD, typically 10-20% is allocated for the decay phase, matching cosine annealing; in multi-step, 80/10/10 also matches cosine annealing while 70/15/15 and 60/20/20 can outperform it. Deepseek-v3 used cosine annealing between the decay drops and added a constant phase before the final sharp step.\n\nFigure 7: Comparison of learning rate schedules: cosine annealing, WSD, and multi-step. From Hugging Face.\n\nHugging Face’s ablations (on their 1B model) showed that WSD tended to underperform cosine annealing before WSD’s decay began, but once it entered its decay phase, WSD showed nearly linear improvement in both loss and eval metrics, which allowed it to catch up to cosine annealing by the end. After running further ablations on the learning rate, the Hugging Face team settled on 2e-4; increasing led to potential increased risk of instability during long training runs. Kimi K2 also uses WSD: the first 10T were trained with 2e-4 learning rate after a 500 step warm up, then 5.5T tokens with cosine decay from 2e-4 to 2e-5.\n\nWSD schedule especially helps with ablations since it does not require restarting the same run for different token counts, since we can retrain only the end portions (learning rate decay) while maintaining the front portion.\n\nThere is a critical batch size: too small and we may be underutilizing compute, but too large and the model needs more tokens to reach the same loss. Still, larger batch sizes give more efficient gradient estimations, and are preferred.\n\nA useful proxy is that for optimizers like AdamW or Muon, if the batch size increases by a factor of $k$ then the learning rate should scale up by $\\sqrt{k}$. Intuitively, larger batches provide more stable gradient estimates (lower variance), so we can afford larger step sizes. Mathematically, the covariance shrinks by a factor of $k$, and based on the SGD parameter update $\\Delta w = -\\eta g_B$, we have $\\text{Var}(\\Delta w) \\sim \\eta^2 \\frac{\\Sigma}{B}$ where $B$ is the original batch size. To maintain the same update variance, we need $\\eta \\sim \\sqrt{k}$.\n\nAs training progresses, the critical batch size grows. Initially, since the model is making large updates, $\\lvert \\lvert g \\rvert \\rvert^2$ is large so the model should have a small critical batch size. After the model stabilizes, larger batches become more effective. This motivates the idea of batch size warmup.\n\nImbalanced minibatches can arise when sequence packing or data distribution creates batches with highly variable sequence lengths or domain compositions, which can cause gradient variance that destabilizes training; this is especially true when certain experts or model components receive disproportionately many or few tokens.\n\nArcee introduces random sequential document buffer (RSDB) to reduce intra-batch correlation. After tokenizing a document, it works by loading the token sequence as an entry in the RSDB with a read head at index 0; this is repeated until the RSDB is full. From a randomly sampled index in a randomly sampled document from the RSDB, tokens are read based on the read head and the index and added to a separate sequence buffer. Read head positions are updated, and if the sequence buffer is full, we return; otherwise, we randomly select another document index and continue to read tokens into the sequence buffer, repeating until the sequence buffer is full.\n\nThe internal buffer size (in Trinity Large: 8192 per GPU) is set to twice the user-specified buffer value and refilled when the buffer reaches the user-specified value (in Trinity Large: 4096 per GPU) or when old documents need to be purged/new documents can be loaded. Arcee found that this optimization significantly improved dataloader performance.\n\nScaling laws (e.g. Chinchilla scaling laws) provide a useful proxy for determining how aggressively/conservatively to update hyperparameters as model size scales.\n\nFirst, $C \\approx 6 \\cdot N \\cdot D$ where $C$ is the compute budget measured in FLOPs, N is the number of parameters, and $D$ is the number of training tokens. The 6 is derived from empirical estimates for the number of FLOPs per parameter.\n\nFigure 8: Scaling curves of batch size and learning rate. From DeepSeek.\n\nInitially, scaling laws indicated that language model size was the main constraint, leading to a GPT-3 model with 175B parameters but only trained on 300B tokens. A re-derivation found that training duration could improve gains more than size; they found that compute-optimal training of GPT-3 should have consumed 3.7T tokens.\n\nHowever, scaling laws are almost never religiously followed. Recently, labs have been “overtraining” models beyond the training durations suggested by scaling laws (e.g. Qwen 3 being trained on 36T tokens). Moreover, “compute-optimal” scaling laws don’t account for larger models being more expensive after training due to inference. To that end, Hugging Face decided to train on 11T tokens on a 3B model. For comparison, Kimi K2’s 1T model comprised of 15.5T pre-training tokens.\n\nWhile general scaling laws provide guidance, Kimi K2’s scaling law analysis revealed model-specific insights. They showed that an increase in sparsity, the ratio of total number of experts to the number of activated experts, yields substantial performance improvements for fixed FLOPs, so they increase the number of MoE experts to 384 (256 in DeepSeek-V3) while decreasing attention heads to 64 (128 in DeepSeek-V3) to reduce computational overhead during inference. They settle on a sparsity of 48, activating 8 out of 384 experts and found that decreasing the attention heads from 128 to 64 sacrificed a validation loss ranging from 0.5% to 1.2%, but a 45% decrease in inference FLOPs.\n\nEven with the perfect architecture, a model’s performance is still heavily dependent on its training data; no amount of compute or optimization can compensate for training on the wrong content. To this end, it’s about assembling the right data mixture, balancing training objectives and tuning data proportions. This is particularly difficult since across competing objectives, for a fixed compute budget, increasing one proportion necessarily decreases another, hurting performance.\n\nThere already exist large corpora of pre-training datasets like FineWeb2 and The Pile. However, there are still a plethora of information gaps, so recent models additionally rely on specialized pretraining datasets for domains like math and coding.\n\nOne consideration is data quality. Of course, training on the highest quality data possible is preferable. But for a training budget of $X$ tokens, because high quality data is limited, only filtering for it would lead to repeated data, which can be harmful. So, an ideal mixture includes both higher and lower quality data.\n\nAnother consideration is model safety. For gpt-oss-120b, OpenAI addresses this by filtering the data for harmful content in pre-training, with an emphasis on hazardous biosecurity knowledge. They use CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) pre-training filters that were used in GPT-4o.\n\nMulti-stage training, the idea of evolving the data mixture as training progresses, can better maximize both high-quality and lower-quality data compared to a static mixture because a LM’s final behavior is heavily dictated by the data it sees at the end of training. So, this motivates the strategy of saving the higher quality data towards the end. This introduces another variable of when to begin changing mixtures, and a general principle to performance-driven intervention: if a benchmark begins to plateau, it’s a signal to introduce high-quality data for that domain.\n\nWhile architectural ablations are done on smaller models (e.g. on 1B models to train for 3B models), data mixture ablations are done at scale because larger models have much larger capacities to understand a variety of domains. Moreover, annealing ablations are done on checkpoints of the main run (like 7T out of 11T tokens) to determine what datasets to introduce when.\n\nTo determine optimal data proportions, recent models often use a validation loss or a holdout loss to minimize based on evaluation objectives and data domains. However, some of these methods tend to converge toward distributions that mirror the dataset size distribution, and they don’t outperform careful manual ablations.\n\nToken efficiency is how much performance improvement is achieved per token consumed during training. This can be improved via better token utility, the effective learning signal each token contributes; this motivates finding the optimal balance of high-quality tokens, since they should be maximally leveraged but also limited to prevent overfitting and reduced generalization.\n\nKimi K2 uses data rephrasing in knowledge and math domains. For knowledge, this comes in the form of style and perspective-diverse prompting to rephrase the texts, chunk-wise autoregressive generation to gradually build a rephrased version of long documents, and fidelity verification to ensure semantic alignment. In the main training run, each corpus is rephrased at most twice. For math, diversity is increased via rephrasing into a “learning-note style” and translation into other languages.\n\nHugging Face’s goal was to build a multi-lingual model that also excels on math and coding. In stage 1 of their multi-stage training, they use a 75/12/10/3 split among english web data, multilingual web data, code data, and math data.\n\nFor new stages (using a checkpoint at around 7T out of the total 11T tokens), they use a 40/60 split between the baseline mixture and the new dataset. SmolLM3 has three stages: 8T tokens @ 4k context for base training, 2T tokens @ 4k context for high-quality injection, and 1.1T tokens @4k context a reasoning/Q&A stage.\n\nUsing data from DCLM and FineWeb, Nous first performs semantic deduplication using embeddings at a cosine similarity of 0.7, and then uses an LLM-as-judge to filter out incomplete or ill-formatted messages. Then, they process pre-training data through DataForge, a graph-based synthetic data generator, which allows for large and complex structures. By taking a random walk through a directed acyclic graph where nodes implement a mapping from struct $\\to$ struct such that if there is an edge from node $A$ to node $B$, the postconditions guaranteed by $A$ must satisfy the preconditions of $B$. QA pairs are generated using this workflow with intermediary transformations into other mediums (e.g. a wikipedia article into a rap song), question generation and then questions/answers annotations using an LLM-as-judge to grade the instruction and response. Also, to find a covering set of data-scarce domains of special interest, they recursively (depth-first-search) generate a taxonomy of subdomains where the leaves are prompts and the LLM enumerates $n$ subdomains to form a partition.\n\nThe DataForge-generated data is used in both pre-training and post-training stages, with specific details provided in the post-training data section below.\n\nMid-training is the intermediary step between pre-training and post-training where the base model is trained further on a large amount of domain-specific tokens, especially shaping the model to focus on common core skills like coding or reasoning. Often-times, the decision to mid-train is only made after initial SFT experiments are run because they may reveal performance gaps that indicate the need to mid-train on certain domains. But if the goal is to elicit shallow capabilities like style or conversation, the compute is better spent in post-training.\n\nSome recipes include an additional long context stage; for example, Qwen3 first trained on 30T tokens at 4k context, then a reasoning stage with 5T higher-quality tokens mainly on STEM and coding, and finally a long context stage at 32k context length.\n\nSmolLM3 also does this, but instead of scaling from 4k to 128k directly, they sequentially scale from 4k to 32k to 64k to 128k, which allows the model to adapt at each length before pushing the context length further. Upsampling long context documents like web articles or books improve long context, but Hugging Face didn’t observe improvement; they hypothesize that this is because their baseline mixture already includes long documents using RNoPE.\n\nTo go from 4k to 32k and later to 64k, they use RoPE ABF and increase the base frequency to 2M and 5M, respectively. Base frequencies like 10M further improved slightly on RULER, long context benchmark, but it hurt short context tasks like GSM8k, so they were disregarded. To reach 128k, they found that using YARN from the 64k checkpoint (instead of using a four-fold increase from 32k) produced better performance, which confirms the hypothesis that training closer to the desired inference length benefits performance.\n\nKimi K2 decays learning rate from 2e-5 to 7e-6, training on 400B tokens with 4k sequence length, then 60B tokens with a 32k sequence length. To extend to 128k, they use YARN.\n\nWhile the mid-training data usually comes from web data, another powerful approach is to use distilled reasoning tokens from a better model, as Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning did from DeepSeek-R1. When applied to the base model, distilled mid-training increased benchmark scores like AIM24 by 3x, MATH-500 by 11 points, and GPQA-D by almost 6 points. SmolLM3 also does distilled mid-training. They considered datasets including reasoning tokens from DeepSeek-R1 (4M samples) and QwQ-32B (1.2M samples) but decide to delay using the Mixture of Thoughts dataset until the final SFT mix. They found that it almost always makes sense to perform some amount of mid-training if the base model hasn’t already seen lots of reasoning data during pre-training, because they noticed that /no_think reasoning mode also had improvements on reasoning benchmarks.\n\nGiven today’s standards of LLMs as coding agents and assistants that can reason, there are four broad classes of evals that researchers care about:\n\nThese evals test the following:\n\nTo prevent overfitting, evals that encapsulate robustness or adaptability, like GSMPlus which perturbs problems from GSM8k, are also included. Another way is using interval evals or vibe evaluations/arenas, such as manually probing the model’s behavior. Other tips include using small subsets to accelerate evals (especially if there’s correlation with a larger eval), fixing the LLM-as-judge model (if the eval requires it), treat anything used during ablations as validation, use avg@k accuracy, and try not to (don’t) benchmax!\n\nIt’s first worth mentioning that Intellect-3 is a 106B parameter MoE (12B activate) post-trained on top of GLM-4.5-Air base model from Z.ai, and that they have their own post-training stack including prime-rl, an open framework for large-scale asynchronous RL, verifiers library for training and evals from their Environments Hub, sandbox code execution and compute orchestration.\n\nIntegrating with the Environments Hub, Prime trains on a diverse and challenging mix of environments designed to improve coding and reasoning capabilities. For math, they design an environment with long CoT reasoning in mind, consisting of 21.2K challenging math problems from Skywork-OR1, Acereason-Math, DAPO, and ORZ-Hard, all of which are curated datasets derived from AIME, NuminaMath, Tulu3 math, and others which test difficult math questions from multiple choice to proofs to those involving figures. Even using verifiers, there were a non-trivial amount of false negatives, so they additionally use opencompass/CompassVerifier-7B as a LLM-judge verifier. For science (mainly physics, chemistry, and biology), they filter 29.3K challenging problems from MegaScience while also using LLM-judge verification and standard math verifiers. For logic (games like Sudoku or Minesweeper), 11.6K problems and verifiers were adapted from SynLogic.\n\nFor code, they primarily use their Synthetic-2 dataset along with Prime Sandboxes to verify solutions. They also develop two SWE environments that support scaffolding for common formats like R2E-Gym, SWE-smith, and Multi-SWE-bench to fix issues within a Github project when equipped to Bash commands and edit tooling. Also, the maximum number of turns for the agent is set at 200.\n\nPrime also focuses on its deep research capabilities via their web search environment, which provides the model with a set of search tools. The environment tasks the model with answering questions from the dataset using tools and is rewarded either 1 or 0 using z-AI’s DeepDive dataset, with 1K samples for SFT trajectory generation and 2.2K samples for RL. When tested in Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507, 26 steps of SFT with batch size of 34 followed by 120 steps of RL at a group size of 16 and batch size of 512 was enough to reach mean reward of 0.7.\n\nThey use 300k prompts, mostly STEM and coding from WebInstruct-Verified, rSTAR-Coder, and DeepMath-103k and apply deduplicating and filtering for prompts with >2k characters.\n\nNous rejection samples against ~1k task-specific verifiers using Atropos. Some environments used to generate the dataset include\n\nA critical capability that Kimi K2 chooses to focus on is tool use. While benchmarks like $\\tau$-bench and ACEBench exist, it’s often difficult to construct real-world environments at scale due to cost, complexity, privacy, and accessibility. Kimi K2 builds off of ACEBench’s data synthesis framework to simulate real-world tool-use scenarios at scale:\n\nUsing 3k+ real MCP tools from Github and 20k synthetic tools generated hierarchically in domains like financial trading, software applications, and robot control. Diversification among agents is ensured via the combination of distinct system prompts with distinct tool combinations, and tasks are graded using an explicit rubric with an LLM judge.\n\nFor RL, Kimi K2’s treatment for math, STEM, and logical tasks remains similar to those of other models. Coding and software engineering comes largely from competition-level programming problems and PRs/issues from GitHub. For instruction following, they use two verification mechanisms: deterministic evaluation via code interpreters for verifiable outputs and LLM-as-judge evaluations for non-verifiable outputs. The data was constructed using expert-crafted prompts and rubrics, agentic instruction augmentation inspired by AutoIF, and a fine-tuned model specialized for generating additional instructions probing specific failure modes or edge cases.\n\nA few important considerations for designing/picking a good chat template include system role customizability, tool calling, reasoning, and compatibility with inference engines like vLLM or SGLang. Qwen3 and GPT-OSS satisfy all criteria, and Qwen3 is designed for hybrid reasoning.\n\nIn SmolLM3, despite also being designed for hybrid reasoning, they discard the reasoning content for all but the final turn in the conversation to avoid blowing up the context during inference, but for training, it’s important to retain the reasoning tokens to condition the model properly. So, Hugging Face orchestrates their own chat template, satisfying all criteria. Vibe tests initially revealed a bug of not passing in the custom instructions into their custom template, but this was quickly patched.\n\nWhile deriving inspiration from the Qwen3 template, Intellect-3 always reasons (not hybrid) by proxy of being dominantly trained on reasoning-only SFT traces; they use qwen3_coder tool call parser and deepseek_r1 reasoning parser to ensure reasoning chains are consistently represented.\n\ngpt-oss-120b uses the harmony chat template, which introduces “channels” that determine the visibility of each message. For example, final for answers shown to the user, commentary for tool calling, and analysis for CoT tokens. This allows the model to interleave tool calls with CoT.\n\nHermes 4 adapts Llama 3’s chat template by changing the assistant to a first-person identifier after identifying the sensitivity to the token used for the assistant’s turn:\n\nThis results in markedly different behaviors, which is explored more in “behaviors and latent capabilities” subsection of “behaviors and safety” section.\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero’s chat template looks very similar to others, but additionally includes $\\mathtt{}$ tags to provide the final answer.\n\nMost post-training pipelines start with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) because it’s cheap compared to RL, stable due to insensitivity to reward design and hyperparameters, and gives a strong baseline off of the base model. Usually, base models are too unrefined to benefit from more advanced post-training methods. SFT often comes in the form of distillation from stronger models. Strong models may suffer from success and skip the SFT stage because there are no stronger models to distill from (such is the case with DeepSeek R1-Zero).\n\nDataset curation for SFT is important; datasets might seem great on paper, but models trained on those datasets may end up overindexing on certain domains, such as science. To this end, Hugging Face curated a data mixture with ~100k examples and 76.1M tokens, mostly consisting of instruction following, reasoning, and steerability for both think and non-think modes. Importantly, data should be paired across modes because otherwise, there is not an indication of when to give a concise answer or use extended reasoning.\n\nFor training, there are other considerations as well: full finetuning vs more parameter efficient methods like LoRA or QLoRA, specialized kernels like FlashAttention (which reduces memory usage by recomputing attention on-the-fly during the backward pass, trading compute for memory) or the likes of SonicMoE for more efficient compute usage, masking the loss for only assistant tokens, the type of parallelism needed, learning rate tuning, and sequence length tuning to match the distribution of data to speed up training (more useful for larger datasets).\n\nCute cross-entropy kernel (CCE) is a memory-efficient CUDA kernel for computing cross-entropy loss. Instead of materializing the full logit matrix in global memory, CCE computes only the logit for the correct token and evaluates the log-sum-exp over all vocabulary items on-the-fly using faster memory tiers, dramatically reducing memory consumption. The kernel leverages the sparsity of softmax by skipping gradient computation for elements with negligible contributions below numerical precision. This makes it particularly valuable for models with large vocabularies.\n\nIn Intellect-3, Prime splits SFT into two stages: general reasoning SFT and agentic SFT. In the first, they use datasets consisting of math, code, science, tooling, chat, and instruction splits from Nemotron’s post-training dataset and AM-DeepSeek-R1-0528-Distilled for a total of 9.9B tokens. In the second stage, they target agentic behavior, tool use, and long-horizon control (gpt-oss-120b also targets agentic behavior and tool use), using a mix of open-source agentic datasets like SWE-Swiss and synthetically-generate datasets from the Environments Hub using DeepSeek-R1. Besides serving the purpose of fine-tuning for agentic behavior, this stage also has the effect of pushing the model toward longer effective context lengths. Using context parallelism, they scaled from a 65K context window to 98K.\n\nIn Hermes 4, they also do two stages of SFT, both around reasoning. They noted that despite training on sequences at most 16k tokens in length, the reasoning lengths frequently exceed 41k tokens on reasoning tasks. So, they do a second stage to teach the model to generate the closing $\\mathtt{</think>}$ tags at 30k tokens, their budget. This insertion at a fixed token count allows the model to learn a counting behavior (“when you reach $N$ tokens, stop”) while ensuring that the model’s own distribution doesn’t change significantly. This also avoids the problem of model collapse when recursive training on full, self-generated outputs leads to distribution narrowing and quality degradation.\n\nThe Hugging Face team found issues in generalising single-turn reasoning data to multi-turn data, stemming from the difficulty in differentiating /think and /no_think tags between turns. So, they constructed a new dataset, IFThink, using Qwen3-32B that augmented single-turn instructions into multi-turn exchanges with verifiable instructions and reasoning traces; this dramatically improved multi-turn reasoning.\n\nMasking user turns is another design choice, since otherwise loss is computed on user queries as well, sacrificing producing high-quality assistant responses for predicting user queries. In practice, masking doesn’t have a huge impact on downstream evals, but still yielded improvements by a few points in most cases.\n\nSequence packing is another choice that improves training efficiency. The idea is similar to intra-document masking where sequences are packed into a batch so as to not waste padding compute via excessive padding tokens, but with the additional constraint of minimizing truncation of documents across batch boundaries.\n\nFigure 9: Comparison of sequence packing strategies. From Hugging Face.\n\nIn the image, the last packing method uses the best-fit decreasing (implemented in TRL), where each sequence is placed in the batch that minimizes the remaining space after insertion. Another method, which Hermes-4 uses, is first-fit decreasing, which places a sequence in the first batch that has enough remaining space, which achieves $>99.9\\%$ batch efficiency.\n\nDespite yielding up to a 33x tokens/batch/optimization step, for a fixed token budget, packing alters training dynamics since the more data means fewer gradient updates. This especially hurts small datasets where each sample matters more. An effective batch size of 128 hurt evals like IFEval by up to 10%; for effective batch sizes larger than 32, there was an average drop in performance (for SmolLM3 and the dataset). But for large datasets, packing is almost always beneficial.\n\nThe learning rate for SFT is usually an order of magnitude smaller than that for pre-training since the model has already learned rich representations, and aggressive updates can lead to catastrophic forgetting. And because SFT runtime is so short compared to pre-training, it makes sense to do full learning rate sweeps. For SmolLM3, learning rates of 3e-6 or 1e-5 worked best. When packing is enabled, it’s safer to decrease the learning rate further due to the larger effective batch size and getting fewer updates for the same token budget.\n\nOnce a good data mixture is identified and hyperparameters are tuned, training on more than one epoch (what was usually done in ablations) also leads to increased performance by a few percentage points; on LiveCodeBench v4, performance nearly doubled from epoch two to three.\n\nAn interesting idea explored is whether the optimizers for pre/post-training should be the same. AdamW remains the default choice for both pre/post-training, and when tested with Muon, using the same optimizer still yielded the best performance.\n\nBecause SFT is fundamentally a form of imitation learning, extremely large SFT datasets can be redundant due to diminishing gains or failure modes that aren’t encapsulated in the data. Another useful signal is preference, i.e. which response, A or B, is preferred and enables model performance to scale beyond the limits of SFT alone. Also, less data is needed for preference optimization than SFT since the starting point is already strong.\n\nFor generating preference datasets, there are a few methods:\n\nWhile preference optimization is generally thought as a medium to improve helpfulness or alignment, it can also teach models to reason better, like using strong-vs-weak preferences.\n\nThere are typically three hyperparameters that affect training dynamics:\n\nBesides vanilla DPO (direct preference optimization), researchers have explored a variety of alternatives:\n\nHugging Face found that APO-zero had the best overall out-of-domain performance.\n\nSFT and PO can hit ceilings because fundamentally, they optimize to produce outputs that look like the dataset and PO is often off-policy and weak at multi-step credit assignment. RL (reinforcement learning) helps by providing a reward signal through interaction with an environment. Verifiers can automatically check correctness and provide those reward signals, and objectives can be optimized for beyond preference labels.\n\nIn RLHF (RL from human feedback), human comparisons are provided, and a reward model is trained to predict the human preference signal. Then, the policy is fine-tuned with RL to maximize the learned reward. This way, RLHF does on-policy optimization since it does rollouts using the current policy used in training and updates based on the reward given by the reward model. This also allows RLHF to discover behaviors not present in the preference dataset.\n\nIn RLVR (RL with verifiable rewards), popularised by DeepSeek-R1, verifiers check whether a model’s output matches criteria (e.g. whether it produced the correct math answer or passed all code unit tests) to generate reward signals, making it more scalable and objective. Then, the policy is fine-tuned to produce more verifiably-correct outputs. RLVR is particularly valuable when reward drift is a concern (verifiers provide very stable signals compared to learned reward models), when KL control is needed to prevent policy collapse, and when addressing stale-policy artifacts in multi-step reasoning tasks.\n\nAlthough policy optimization algorithms are commonly on-policy, like GRPO, in practice, to maximize throughput, they may actually be slightly off-policy. For example, in GRPO, without freezing the policy, generating multiple rollout batches and doing optimizer updates sequentially makes only the first batch on-policy and all subsequent batches off-policy; this is known as in-flight updates. In-flight updates matter most when throughput is critical (e.g., large-scale RL training), when reward drift could accumulate from stale policies, when KL divergence between inference and training policies needs careful monitoring, and when long rollouts span multiple policy updates. The tradeoff is between training efficiency and policy consistency; techniques like importance sampling clipping (as in IcePop) help mitigate the off-policy bias.\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of conventional RL and in-flight updating. From Pipeline RL paper.\n\nIn the context of Intellect-3, which uses a CPU orchestrator between two clusters (one for training and one for inference), the orchestrator continuously polls the trainer to update the inference pool once a new policy is available, and the inference pool temporarily halts generation to update the weights, then continues with rollouts. In this way, a long rollout could be generated by multiple policies, but they limit this by a max_off_policy_steps parameter to limit policy drift. Also, they implement IcePop to stabilize MoE training:\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{M}(k)=k$ if $k \\in [\\alpha, \\beta]$ and $0$ otherwise. The purpose of $\\mathcal{M}$ is to account for the off-policy nature between the training policy and the inference policy such that they don’t diverge significantly for each token. When the importance weight $k$ falls outside $[\\alpha, \\beta]$, $\\mathcal{M}$ clips it to 0, effectively ignoring that token’s contribution to the gradient. This is the idea behind importance sampling, where rollouts come from the inference policy, but we are optimizing for the training policy. Prime uses the default $\\alpha = 0.5, \\beta = 5$. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ need not be symmetric in the multiplicative sense. One reason for this is under the rare instance when $\\pi_\\text{infer}$ is small (large $k$), a tighter $\\beta$ would clip the high-entropy tokens, which would make learning dynamics worse.\n\nKimi K2 adapts a different policy optimization approach from their previous model K1.5:\n\nwhere $\\overline{r}(x)= \\frac1{K} \\sum_{i=1}^K r(x,y_i)$ is the mean reward of sampled responses and $\\tau > 0$ is a regularization parameter for stable learning, akin to KL divergence.\n\nAnother consideration is PTX loss: pre-training cross-entropy loss. During joint RL training, the model can catastrophically forget valuable, high-quality data. So, they curate a dataset using hand-selected, high-quality samples and integrate them into the RL objective via the PTX loss. The advantages are twofold: high-quality data can be leveraged, and the risk of overfitting to the tasks present during RL can be mitigated, which leads to better generalization.\n\nTo balance exploration and exploitation throughout training, they implement temperature decay. For tasks like creative writing and complex reasoning, high temperatures during the initial stages is important to generate diverse and innovative responses; this prevents premature convergence to local minima and facilitates the discovery of effective strategies. At later stages, the temperature is decayed (following a schedule) so that there is not excessive randomness, and that it doesn’t compromise the reliability/consistency of the model’s outputs.\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero stands out as an exception compared to other models because it demonstrates that RL can be effective even without supervised fine-tuning. It cold-starts RL (specifically, GRPO to save training costs; they use 10.4k steps, batch size of 512, reference policy replacement every 400 steps along with lr as 3e-6, KL coefficient as 0.001) on reasoning tasks without any supervised data. The reward system uses two types of rewards: accuracy rewards based on correctness of the response and format rewards that enforce the model to put its thinking process between thinking tags. It obtains robust reasoning capabilities using pure RL, which validates the ability to learn reasoning and generalize effectively. Moreover, behaviors including reflection (re-evaluating previous steps) and exploring alternative approaches to problem-solving emerge, which further enhances reasoning. The count of reflective words such as “wait” or “mistake” rises 5-7-fold compared to the start of training. Moreover, this reflective behavior appeared relatively suddenly: between steps 4k-7k, there was only occasional usage, but after step 8k, it exhibited significant spikes.\n\nFigure 11: The multi-stage pipeline of DeepSeek-R1 with intermediate checkpoints DeepSeek-R1 Dev1, Dev2, and Dev3. From DeepSeek.\n\nFor DeepSeek-R1, they collect thousands of long CoT data to finetune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. From DeepSeek-R1-Zero, they learned that readability was an issue: responses sometimes mixed multiple languages or lacked markdown formatting for highlighting answers. They remedy the former by introducing a language consistency reward (portion of target language words in the CoT), and the latter by designing a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response. They also perform a second RL stage aimed at improving the model’s helpfulness and harmlessness while retaining reasoning capabilities.\n\nFor helpfulness, they focus on emphasizing the utility and relevance of the final summary. To generate preference pairs, they query DeepSeek-V3 four times and randomly assign responses as either Response A or Response B; they then average the independent judgments and retain pairs where the score difference is sufficiently large and use a pairwise loss to define the objective. For harmlessness, they evaluate the response to identify and mitigate any potential risk, biases, or harmful content. Using a dataset with model-generated responses annotated as “safe” or “unsafe” according to safety guidelines, the reward model is trained using a point-wise methodology to distinguish between safe/unsafe responses.\n\nImpressively, they found that distilling DeepSeek-R1’s outputs into smaller models like Qwen-32B significantly improved reasoning capabilities, even compared to large-scale RL, which further requires significantly more compute. Moreover, it shows that even while distillation strategies are effective and economical, we will increasingly require more powerful base models and larger-scale RL.\n\nFigure 12: Comparison of DeepSeek-R1-distilled and RL Models on Reasoning-Related Benchmarks. From DeepSeek.\n\nBeyond the main training pipeline, DeepSeek’s appendix documents additional considerations that influenced their design choices:\n\nThe goal of RLVR on hybrid reasoning models is to improve reasoning capabilities without extending the token count too radically. For /no_think, naively applying GRPO can lead to reward hacking since the model begins to emit longer CoT (shifting towards /think); as such, both reward and token length increase. SmolLM3 observed this and found that RLVRed /no_think traces showed cognitive behaviors like “Wait, …” associated with reasoning models.\n\nThis can be mitigated via an overlong completion penalty which penalizes completions over a certain length, which is a function parametrized by a soft punishment threshold and a hard punishment threshold/max completion length. Penalty increases from the soft to the hard threshold, and past the latter, the punishment is -1 (effective reward = 0).\n\nFor /no_think, SmolLM3 decided on a length penalty in the range of 2.5k-3k that balanced improvement in performance and increase in response length. However, doing RL jointly on hybrid reasoning models is difficult since it requires separate length penalties, whose interplay can cause instability. This is also why labs release instruct and reasoning variants separately.\n\nKimi K2 uses a self-critique rubric reward mechanism, where the model evaluates its own outputs to generate preference signals. The K2 actor generates $k$ rollouts, and the K2 critic ranks all results by performing pairwise evaluations against a combination of rubrics; these combine core rubrics (fundamental values) and prescriptive rubrics (aimed to eliminate reward hacking), and human-annotated rubrics (for specific instructional contexts).\n\nThe critic model is refined using verifiable signals, and this process of transfer learning grounds its more subjective judgments in verifiable data. This should allow the critic to recalibrate its evaluation standard in lockstep with the policy’s evolution.\n\nTo RL effectively, curriculum learning is another effective way which gradually exposes the model to progressively difficult problems. First, problems are sorted into difficulty pools (such as easy, medium, and hard) based on the problem’s observed solve rate; In Intellect-3 for math and coding, this was done via querying Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 over eight generations per problem while for science and logic, they queried the same model 16 times. Then, during each stage, they maintain a balanced curriculum that avoids training with trivially easy or overly difficult problems which don’t give meaningful learning signal (and also helps maintain gradients in GRPO). In Kimi K2, this was done by using the SFT model’s pass@k accuracy.\n\nOne alternative is online DPO (see “On policy with grading” in the preference optimization section). Another is on-policy distillation. Instead of preferences, the signal comes from a stronger teacher model, where the student samples responses at every training step and the KL divergence between the student/teacher logits provides the learning signal. That way, the student can continuously learn from the teacher. Also, on-policy distillation is much cheaper than GRPO since instead of sampling multiple rollouts per prompt, we only sample one, which is graded by the teacher in a single forward-backward pass; its performance boost, as the Qwen3 tech report notes, can be larger across the board as well. One limiting factor is that the student and the teacher must share the same tokenizer, and Hugging Face’s General On-Policy Logit Distillation (GOLD) allows any teacher to be distilled into any student.\n\nThinking Machine’s blog further showed that on-policy distillation mitigates catastrophic forgetting, where a model post-trained on a new model regresses on other, previous domains. Specifically, they found that mid-training 70% and with on-policy distillation can achieve close to the best performance of a model and its mid-trained version, effectively restoring behavior with cheap distillation.\n\nGiven these aforementioned algorithms, choosing between them can be hard; Hugging Face aptly describes it:\n\nAnd for DPO (semi-online and online), it is also possible to match GRPO using far less compute. Specifically, they found that semi-online DPO (with syncing between the trainer and the generator every 100 steps) was generally the best compared to semi-online DPO with sync every 10 steps, online DPO, and GRPO.\n\nDeepSeek shares other experimental methods when developing DeepSeek-R1 that ultimately failed. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), inspired by AlphaGo and AlphaZero, was implemented to test enhancing test-time compute scalability. This breaks answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To do this, they prompted the model to generate tags corresponding to reasoning steps necessary. The problem is that token generation exists in an exponentially larger search space compared to chess. So, they set a max extension limit for each node, but this leads to the model getting stuck in local optima. Moreover, training a fine-grained value model is difficult, also due to complexities of token generation.\n\nThey also explored process reward models, which rewards intermediate thoughts in multi-step tasks. DeepSeek acknowledges three limitations: defining a fine-grained step in general reasoning is difficult, determining whether the current intermediate step is difficult (LLM-as-judge might not yield satisfactory results), and it leads to reward hacking because the model would optimize for the appearance of good reasoning without doing the underlying work.\n\nDuring post-training, they perform an additional stage of RL to reward answers that comply with OpenAI’s policy against unsafe prompts. Because all of these models have open model weights, then one worry is that malicious parties can enhance the model’s harmful capabilities. By running Preparedness evaluations on gpt-oss-120b, OpenAI confirmed that the model doesn’t achieve threshold for high capability in biological/chemical capability, cyber capability, and AI self-improvement.\n\nThey also tested whether adversarial actors could fine-tune gpt-oss-120b to reach high capability in the aforementioned domains. They simulated the attack by either:\n\nUpon review, their safety advisory group concluded that even with robust fine-tuning, gpt-oss-120b still couldn’t reach high capability in the aforementioned domains. Also, they determined whether releasing the model could advance the frontier of biological capabilities, including evaluations like virology and tacit knowledge, in open foundation models (which also increases risk) and found that there were other open weight models at or near gpt-oss-120b, so they decided that releasing has low impact on the frontier.\n\nOpenAI also evaluated safety performance using other indicators:\n\nContinuing from the chat template section, Nous’ decision to change the token used from the assistant’s turn from $\\mathtt{assistant}$ to $\\mathtt{me}$ enabled Hermes 4 to adopt a first-person, peer-like persona. Hermes 4 generates responses with fewer meta-disclaimers and more consistent voice embodiment, resulting in higher behavioral plasticity that is not as common in large models.\n\nSimilarly, Hermes 4 demonstrates comparatively greater contextual fidelity over policy rigidity. Most other large models will follow policy compliance even when faced with fictional or controlled prompts (such as issuing disclaimers or reformulated responses to align with safety constraints), but Hermes 4 interprets fictional prompts more as role-play and generates in-character responses. This also means that Hermes 4 has a lower refusal rate; on their internal RefusalBench, they found that Hermes 4 (reasoning) ranked highest (lowest refusal rate) among all tested models, whereas gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, perhaps unsurprisingly, had the lowest scores (highest refusal rate). Also, this level of embodied personas extends even to political analysis, where the model produces reasoning balancing factual recall with nuanced framing, and less of policy-driven hedging common to other large models.\n\nExcessive sycophancy is an undesired behavioral trait, so most models apply an anti-sycophancy system prompt to adjust surface-level politeness while leaving underlying reasoning unchanged. When implemented in Hermes 4, Nous observed a deeper shift: CoT traces reflect the aim to steer user interaction away from inference. This sometimes introduces embodied or emphatic language.\n\nBefore the main training run starts, ensure the infrastructure is ready. This includes Slurm reservations on clusters, stress-testing GPUs (GPU Fryer or DCGM), and avoid storage bloat by uploading checkpoints to third parties and deleting local copies after saving the next. To this end, checkpoint and auto-resume systems are important.\n\nEvals are also deceptively time-consuming (Allen Institute spent roughly 20% on compute on evals), so ensuring automation and logging (not just evaluation scores, but also throughput, loss, gradient norm, and node health) is crucial.\n\nHugging Face observed a ~40% drop in throughput (14k to 8k tokens/sec/GPU) after a few hours of starting the main run. The issue came from data storage; their cluster uses a network-attached storage with a “keep-hot” caching model that stores frequently accessed files and evicts “cold” files to third-party S3. With 24TB of training data, the storage was pushed to its limit, so it evicted dataset shards mid-training. This meant fetching them back and creating stalls that slowed throughput.\n\nThe first fix came in the form of swapping the storage method by reserving a spare node with the dataset preloaded and copying using fpsync (s5cmd took double the time). This fixed the issue of a node dying and the replacement GPU having no data since by swapping it with the spare node, training could continue. So, the new spare, not to be wasted, could run evals or dev jobs.\n\nTesting again, they found smaller but still prominent drops in throughput. After experimenting with individual nodes that yielded the same result, they focused on the change in training steps and found that smaller step counts resulted in smaller throughput drops. The nanotron dataloader they were using was growing the lookup table making the training step to the next chunk of tokens to read instead of keeping it bounded or precomputed. Stored in global memory, the growing table causes allocation failures and page faults/worse cache locality. So, they switched to Tokenizedbytes dataloader, solving the throughput issue.\n\nHowever, the loss curve for SmolLM3 looked more noisy. They found the issue with the dataloader because it reads sequences sequentially for each document. Without shuffling of sequences, batches are no longer representative of the overall data distribution, increasing gradient variance. Also, a long file (e.g. code) would supply many consecutive sequences that would also spike loss. To fix, they reshuffled the tokenized sequences offline; an alternative was changing the dataloader to do random access, which has both higher memory usage and slower runtime.\n\nAfter two days and 1T tokens, evals showed that with a similar recipe, SmolLM2 (1.7B) was more performant at the same stage in training as SmolLM3 was. The team found the issue with tensor parallelism: the weights of SmolLM2 fit on a single GPU, whereas for SmolLM3, they had to be shared across 2 GPUs.\n\nFurther, the two TP ranks were initialised with the same random seed instead of different seeds, which causes similar activations/gradients, a loss of diversity of features, and lower convergence.\n\nInference throughput should scale linearly with the number of nodes used. However, Prime found that the standard multi-node data-parallel strategy provided by vLLM didn’t deliver this because as nodes increased, throughput plateaued. They abstracted the multi-client orchestrator so that each inference node is deployed on an independent server (runs its own vLLM engine and scheduler, manages its own KV cache and batches its own requests), and the orchestrator maintains one client per node (avoids single-shared queue bottleneck). Groups rollout requests are distributed across clients according to round-robin scheduling, which keeps utilization balanced.\n\nThere are a few common culprits for training instabilities: high learning rate, bad data, data-parameter state interactions (spikes can come from specific combinations of data batches and model parameter states), poor initialisation (OLMo2 revealed that $\\mathcal{N}(0, 0.02)$ can improve stability upon scaled initialisation), and precision (eww, not fp16).\n\nBesides aforementioned ideas like logit softcapping, z-loss, or QK-norm, data filtering (OLMo2 removed documents with repeated n-grams, specifically those with 32+ repetitions of 1-13 token spans) significantly reduces spike frequency. If spikes still occur, common methods include retraining around the spike by skipping problematic batches or tightening gradient clipping.",

    "fullText": "Narendra Modi’s thirst to supercharge economic growth is matched by US desire to inject AI into world’s biggest democracy\n\nIndia celebrates 80 years of independence from the UK in August 2027. At about that same moment, “early versions of true super intelligence” could emerge, Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, said this week.\n\nIt’s a looming coincidence that raised a charged question at the AI Impact summit in Delhi, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi: can India avoid returning to the status of a vassal state when it imports AI to raise the prospects of its 1.4 billion people?\n\nModi’s hunger to harness AI’s capability is great. He compared it on Thursday to a turning point that resets the direction of civilisation, such as “when the first sparks were struck from stone”. The most common analogy heard among the thousands of visitors to the summit was the dawn of electricity, but Modi was talking about fire.\n\nHis desire to use AI to supercharge Indian economic growth is matched by that of the big US tech companies. OpenAI, Google and Anthropic all played prominent roles at the summit, announcing deals to get ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude AIs into more people’s hands.\n\nThe Trump administration, seeing AI as central to its battle for supremacy with China, was clearing the path for the three AI companies. The US government signed the Pax Silica, a technology agreement that binds India closer to US tech and away from Beijing.\n\nAt the signing, Jacob Helberg, the US under secretary of state for economic affairs, emphasised the threat from China if India should even think about looking elsewhere for its AI. “We have seen the lights of a great Indian city extinguished by a keystroke,” he said, in an apparent reference to a suspected Chinese cyber-attack on Mumbai in 2020.\n\nIndia lacks the semiconductors, power plants and vast gigawatt datacentres to go it alone. In common with most other countries, it faces a choice between US and Chinese AI models. Which they choose could have profound consequences for who controls India’s future, because if AI’s power emerges as predicted, it will not only tweak economic and social structures, but become their new bedrock.\n\nStuart Russell, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, who closely follows India’s progress, said: “If we get to AGI [artificial general intelligence], AI is going to be producing 80% of the global economy. All manufacturing, most agriculture, all services will be just done; managed by AI, produced by AI.”\n\nImagine, he said, an Indian village priced out of having a health centre. In the future, AI could design the hospital and “along comes a bunch of giant quad copters carrying the materials, and a bunch of robots come and assemble everything. Two weeks later, you’ve got a hospital.”\n\nIn this scenario, technology becomes integral to a country’s wellbeing. Elements of sovereignty can be fought over, but how successful that will be remains to be seen. AI’s power is such that its controller gains enormous leverage.\n\nAnthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, told the summit: “It may sound absurd, but AI can even help India achieve a standout 25% economic growth.” If that were to happen, it would take India to a per-capita GDP in a decade that is equivalent to Greece today. How could a leader resist?\n\nModi’s tech secretary, Shri Krishnan, said India realised it must ally with like-minded countries to ensure it did not become “enslaved”. It is a high-stakes decision.\n\nIndia appears unlikely to turn to China, for now. It has the AI models, but there are tensions on the Himalayan border, and Chinese companies and leaders were scarce at the summit.\n\nWill India thrive with US AI? Silicon Valley companies talk of cooperation not control. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global policy, said: “We don’t see India as a customer, we see it as a strategic partner.”\n\nUS officials framed the deal with India as an alliance of two nations that “broke centuries of colonial rule”, and as “two great democracies saying we will build together”.\n\nThe Guardian asked Michael Kratsios, Donald Trump’s science and technology adviser, if India risked being controlled by the US under a form of digital colonialism.\n\n“I would say it is actually the opposite,” he said. “Any country that builds on top of the American AI stack will have the most open, independently controlled, secured stack the world has to offer. And that is why we are soon keen to share it with so many countries that are prioritising their AI sovereignty.”\n\nRussell sees another possibility. “I think the American companies want to get in at that high-school and middle-school level to create basically a bunch of AI addicts who can’t tie their shoelaces without the help of AI,” he said. “Silicon Valley has always been about eyeballs. You monetise later and it works. Google and Facebook generate vast amounts of money.”\n\nCould India build its own AI? It is investing billions in datacentres and semiconductor capacity, but it takes years to come online.\n\nAltman was asked on Thursday how Indian entrepreneurs could build their own AI and his response was blunt. “Look, the way this works is we’re going to tell you it’s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation and you shouldn’t even try, and it’s your job to try anyway and I believe both of those things.”\n\nIndia can press US tech companies to adapt their AIs to its kaleidoscope of languages and cultures, and attempt to insist on guardrails. There is much at stake. As the summit came to a close, Joanna Shields, a former Facebook and Google executive and a UK minister for internet safety, warned: “If we have a world where we are accepting models from just the global north, we will lose so much of our cultural diversity, our uniqueness as people, wherever we come from … We don’t want to develop a monoculture based on a handful of models that everybody uses around the world and we lose that richness of who we are, what makes us human.”",

    "fullText": "Reported issues at Amazon Web Services raise questions about firm’s use of artificial intelligence as it cuts staff\n\nAmazon’s huge cloud computing arm reportedly experienced at least two outages caused by its own artificial intelligence tools, raising questions about the company’s embrace of AI as it lays off human employees.\n\nA 13-hour interruption to Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) operations in December was caused by an AI agent, Kiro, autonomously choosing to “delete and then recreate” a part of its environment, the Financial Times reported.\n\nAWS, which provides vital infrastructure for much of the internet, suffered several outages last year.\n\nOne incident, in October, downed dozens of sites for hours and prompted discussion over the concentration of online services on infrastructure owned by a few massive companies. AWS has won 189 UK government contracts worth £1.7bn since 2016, the Guardian reported in October.\n\nThe AI-caused outages were smaller events, said the company, and only one affected customer-facing services.\n\nAmazon confirmed plans to cut 16,000 jobs in January, after it laid off 14,000 staff last October. In January its chief executive, Andy Jassy, reportedly said these cuts were about company culture, and not about replacing workers with AI.\n\nHowever, Jassy has previously said that efficiency gains from AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce in the coming years, and AI agents will allow it to “focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences”.\n\nIn a statement to the Financial Times, Amazon said it was a coincidence that AI tools were involved in the outages, and that there was no evidence that such technology led to more errors than human engineers. “In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” it said.\n\nAmazon told the Guardian that there was just one incident that had affected AWS, rather than two.\n\nSeveral experts were sceptical of this assessment. A security researcher, Jamieson O’Reilly, said: “While engineering errors caused by traditional tools and humans are not a rare occurrence, the difference between these and mishaps where AI is involved is that ‘without’ AI, a human typically needs to manually type out a set of instructions, and while doing so they have much more time to realise their own error.”\n\nAI agents are often deployed in constrained environments and for specific tasks, O’Reilly said, and cannot understand the broader ramifications of, for example, restarting a system or deleting a database – which may have led to the error at Amazon.\n\n“They don’t have full visibility into the context in which they’re running, how your customers might be affected or what the cost of downtime might be at 2am on a Tuesday,” he said.\n\n“You’ve got to continually remind these tools of the context – ‘hey, this is serious, don’t stuff this up’. And if you don’t do this, it starts to forget about all the other consequences.”\n\nLast year, an AI agent designed by the tech company Replit to build an app deleted an entire company database, fabricated reports, and then lied about its actions.\n\nMichał Woźniak, a cybersecurity expert, said it would be nearly impossible for Amazon to completely prevent internal AI agents from making errors in future, because AI systems make unexpected choices and are extremely complex.\n\n“Amazon never misses a chance to point to ‘AI’ when it is useful to them – like in the case of mass layoffs that are being framed as replacing engineers with AI. But when a slop generator is involved in an outage, suddenly that’s just ‘coincidence’,” he added.\n\nA spokesperson from Amazon said: “This brief event was the result of user error – specifically misconfigured access controls – not AI.”\n\nThey said the “service interruption was an extremely limited event last year” when a tool used to visualise costs for its customers was affected in parts of China.\n\nThey added: “This event didn’t impact compute, storage, database, AI technologies, or any other of the hundreds of services that we run.\n\n“Following these events, we implemented numerous additional safeguards, including mandatory peer review for production access. Kiro puts developers in control – users need to configure which actions Kiro can take, and by default, Kiro requests authorisation before taking any action.”",
