    "fullText": "If you're wondering whether JPMorgan's tech spend is paying off, here's Jamie Dimon's answer: \"Trust me.\"\n\nThat's how the CEO responded to questions about the bank's ROI on its ever-growing tech budget during JPMorgan's fourth-quarter earnings calls. The bank is projecting it'll spend roughly $9.7 billion \n\nHe won't be the last executive pressed on money spent on tech and AI. The quiet concerns that started last year regarding massive AI investments are escalating into loud protests in 2026.\n\nDimon wasn't just asking for blind faith from his shareholders. He discussed the threat posed by his peers and fintechs, and said spending on technology and AI is far more important than trying to \"meet some expense target.\"\n\n(For what it's worth, JPMorgan is actually top of the class when it comes to AI maturity across Wall Street, according to Evident's AI index.)\n\nThe players might be different, but other businesses will likely defend their AI spend with a similar argument: Every dollar I don't spend is one my competitor is willing to, and that could be the difference between winning and losing.\n\nI'm not endorsing FOMO-inspired spending, but I see the rationale. I'd rather go down swinging in the AI wars than not enter the fray at all.\n\nThere's another fight JPMorgan isn't interested in getting into.\n\nThe bank's CFO said the credit card rate cap proposed by President Donald Trump could force JPM to rethink its business entirely.\n\nIt's the latest company to weigh in on Trump's proposal, and it's a biggy. JPMorgan's card services sales totalled roughly $360 billion last quarter.\n\nOpponents of Trump's pitch say capping credit card rates will backfire. If lenders can't charge higher rates to riskier borrowers, they'll just limit the credit they offer them instead of lowering their rates.\n\nAnd it's not like people will stop borrowing. (This is America, after all.) They'll just look for alternatives, which could lead them to take out more personal loans, making 2026 potentially a big year for lenders like SoFi.",

    "fullText": "After writing a blog post about work-life balance for her employer, Emilie Schario did what many people now do before publishing anything online: She pasted her draft into an AI tool in hopes of getting back a stronger post.\n\nYet rather than take the revision it produced at face value, Schario said she spent close to half as much time reviewing the new version as she did writing the original — and for good reason. The AI added a sentence saying that she had recently blocked time on her calendar to attend her daughter's school play.\n\n\"I don't have a daughter, and there was no school play,\" said Schario, chief operating officer at Kilo Code, a remote AI coding startup, and the mother of three young boys.\n\nAI tools are helping workers complete all sorts of tasks faster than ever before, yet many are discovering a drawback. The output still requires careful review for errors and hallucinations, cutting into the time the technology is meant to save.\n\nNew survey data provides a sense of just how much. Nearly 40% of AI's value is lost to rework and misalignment, and only 14% of employees consistently get clear, positive outcomes from the technology, the survey found.\n\nThe survey was conducted in November by Hanover Research on behalf of HR and finance software provider Workday. Respondents included 1,600 leaders and 1,600 full-time employees from companies worldwide with annual revenues of $100 million or more.\n\nAI still nets out to be a time-saver, and editing the results will likely become less of a chore in the future as the technology advances — and as workers receive more training on how to write prompts and apply critical thinking to AI-generated work, said Workday executive Aashna Kircher.\n\n\"We're seeing a need for organizations to better enable their people to evaluate the output and make the right decisions in terms of how it's used,\" she said.\n\nIn Workday's survey, 66% of leaders cite skills training as a top priority, yet only 37% of employees facing the most AI rework say they're getting it. The findings also show that fewer than half of employee job descriptions have been updated to reflect AI capabilities, leaving workers to balance faster AI-driven output with the same expectations around accuracy, judgment, and risk.\n\nOther studies also suggest that AI outputs routinely require human intervention and cannot be trusted outright. A global survey of 2,000 CEOs found that only a quarter of AI efforts had delivered the returns the leaders had expected. It was conducted between February and April of last year by the IBM Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics.\n\nSimilarly, 95% of organizations reported no measurable ROI from AI, according to an MIT study based on reviews of publicly disclosed AI initiatives and executive interviews between January and June of last year.\n\nSchario, who works for Kilo Code from her home in Columbus, Georgia, isn't giving up on AI. As someone who finds writing as unpleasant as folding laundry, she said the speed at which these tools work outweighs the need to have to carefully check for errors.\n\n\"I think where people get themselves in trouble is that they take that output of the AI agent, they don't review it closely, and they just kind of pass it on,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, you are still responsible for your output, whether it was generated by an AI agent or not.\"",

    "description": "The Gemini AI chatbot can now reason across Google apps including Gmail, Photos and YouTube, offering something OpenAI and Anthropic don't have.",
    "fullText": "Google is escalating the competition in artificial intelligence by leaning into a key advantage its rivals largely lack: an ecosystem of consumer apps used daily by billions of people.\n\nOn Wednesday, Google unveiled Personal Intelligence, a new beta capability in the Gemini app that allows the assistant to tailor responses by reasoning across a user's connected Google services, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.\n\nThe feature rolls out in the US on Wednesday to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers. The company said it will also bring the technology to the free Gemini app and AI Mode in Search.\n\nWhile Gemini could previously pull information from individual apps, Personal Intelligence represents a significant change forward. Powered by Gemini 3, the system can now analyze and reason across multiple apps simultaneously, surfacing insights without users having to specify where to look. For example, Gemini might connect a Gmail confirmation with photos from a past trip and videos a user watched on YouTube to provide more relevant recommendations or answers.\n\nThat contextual depth highlights Google's strategic positioning in the AI race. Rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic offer powerful standalone models, but they do not control consumer platforms on the scale of Gmail, YouTube, Photos, or Search. Google does, and Personal Intelligence is designed to turn that reach into differentiated value.\n\n\"The best assistants don't just know the world; they know you and help you navigate it,\" said Google VP Josh Woodward, who oversees the Gemini app, Google Labs, and AI Studio. \"This marks our next step toward making Gemini more personal, proactive, and powerful.\"\n\nThe company described the feature as a way for Gemini to move beyond reactive answers toward proactive assistance. The company argues this will make Gemini more useful in everyday tasks, from shopping and travel planning to content recommendations.\n\nThe rollout begins on the web, Android, and iOS. For now, Personal Intelligence is limited to personal Google accounts and is not available for Workspace users, including business, enterprise, and education accounts.\n\nPrivacy and control are central to the launch, Google said. The feature is off by default, and users must explicitly choose which apps to connect. Even when enabled, Gemini will not personalize every response, instead applying Personal Intelligence only when it determines it will be helpful. Users can opt out of personalization for specific responses, disconnect apps at any time, and manage or delete past chats.\n\nIn a sign of how Google is shipping fast these days, Woodward warned about potential \"over-personalization,\" where the model makes connections between unrelated topics.\n\n\"When you see this, please provide feedback by giving the response a 'thumbs down,'\" he wrote in a blog announcing the feature.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "OpenAI broke new ground when it enabled shopping within ChatGPT, but Walmart's head of AI said the retailer's new Google Gemini deal goes further.",
    "fullText": "The AI shopping war is heating up, and Walmart is positioning itself to come out on top.\n\nThe concept of letting a chatbot buy things on your behalf leapt from the hypothetical realm into reality when ChatGPT rolled out a batch of shopping experiences with major retailers in November.\n\nThen, on Sunday, Google's AI platform Gemini announced its own commerce approach, which it developed in partnership with many of the same retailers, including the world's largest, Walmart.\n\nWhile both services promise to allow customers to find products and complete transactions in a more conversational and automated way, Walmart's new head of AI, Daniel Danker, said Tuesday that the way Gemini handles transactions is more seamless than ChatGPT does.\n\n\"We're essentially having their AI agent, Gemini, partner with our AI agent to create a unified shopping journey,\" he said at the ICR Conference in Orlando. \"Imagine it like a window inside of Gemini where our shopping agent kicks in and helps you complete that purchase.\"\n\nGoogle said its new standards create a common language for different companies' AI agents to interact with.\n\nWith Gemini, Danker said, Walmart is able to link a customer's chat session with their existing Walmart profile and shopping sessions where Gemini wasn't involved.\n\n\"For the most part, our customers aren't just customers; they're often members. And so, they're getting great delivery fees and a great experience that's really attuned to them,\" he said, referring to the subscription service Walmart+. \"That member experience shows up directly within Gemini.\"\n\nDanker said he expects agentic shopping to help Walmart capture more sales from people who didn't set out intending to make a purchase. He said this new approach could enable an almost seamless transaction when a person enlists a chatbot to help solve a problem.\n\nFor example, if someone turned to Gemini for tips on how to remove a wine stain from a particular brand of carpet, a cleaning product could be added to their existing shopping cart for delivery in one combined shipment, he said.\n\nDanker said working with both ChatGPT and Gemini sets Walmart up to win in AI.\n\nIt appears that chatbot-powered shopping is here to stay, with Morgan Stanley analysts estimating that agentic sales could add $115 billion to US e-commerce spending by 2030.\n\nDanker is betting that Walmart's long-standing reputation for low prices and its growing strength in delivery will give the company a significant edge with customers in AI.\n\n\"The most important currency in an agentic shopping world is actually trust and affordability,\" Danker said. \"Without trust and affordability, it's very difficult for customers to hand the wheel to someone else and expect that the right thing will happen.\"\n\nDanker said Walmart's broad selection, low prices, and fast fulfillment help it appear more frequently in Gemini and ChatGPT's shopping recommendations.\n\n\"That doesn't just serve one need, but serves a whole bunch of needs,\" he said.",

Ives suggested that impeding the industry's progress now could compromise the broader US AI agenda.\n\n\"We believe this will be a continuous back and forth battle between Big Tech players and the Trump administration with data center buildouts an important aspect of fueling the AI Revolution over the coming years,\" Ives added.",

    "description": "Use AI to connect and reason across your Google apps in just a few clicks.",
    "fullText": "Since the days when Google Gemini was still called Bard, it's been able to connect with the company's other productivity apps to help pull context from them to answer your questions—but you still had to connect those apps to the AI manually using extensions. And even after bringing your apps together, you usually had to tell Gemini where to look for your data to get much use out of its abilities. For Instance, if you wanted it to pull information from your emails, you might have started a prompt with \"Search my email.\"\n\nNow, Google is making it easier to connect Gemini to its various services, and adding \"reasoning\" when pulling context from across your Google Workspace. It's calling the feature \"Personal Intelligence.\"\n\nRolling out in beta for paid subscribers in the U.S. today (and coming to other countries and free users \"soon\"), Personal Intelligence is an opt-in feature that currently works with Gmail, Photos, YouTube, and Search, all of which you can connect in one tap while setting up the feature.\n\nThat alone makes it more convenient than a collection of extensions, but there are supposedly a few upgrades to general usability as well. The biggest is that Gemini will apparently be able to \"learn\" about you from a grab bag of sources all at once, without you having to specify where to look, and use that information to answer your questions.\n\nIn an example, Google has a user say \"I need to replace the tires for my car. Which ones would you suggest for me?\" The bot then runs through multiple reasoning steps, pulling from all the data available to it, to find out what car the prompter drives and which tires would be best for it in the conditions the prompter tends to drive in. Specifically, in the example, it references actual vacations the prompter had taken in the past, using Google Photos data, while also using Gmail data to help the prompter find their car's specific trim. This can take a while, which is why there's an \"Answer now\" button next to the reasoning progress bar to stop the bot from getting stuck. In the example, it took about 10 seconds for the AI to generate a response.\n\nGoogle is promising its typical Workspace privacy guarantees with Personal Intelligence, saying \"because this data already lives at Google securely, you don't have to send sensitive data elsewhere to start personalizing your experience.\" In other words, it's not going to move the needle on how much data about you Google can access, but at least it'll prevent you from having to connect your Workspace to third parties. The company also promises that data Personal Intelligence pulls from sources like Gmail won't be used to train Gemini, but that \"specific prompts and responses\" might be, at least after personal data has been filtered out.\n\nGoogle also says, \"Gemini will try to reference or explain the information it used from your connected sources so you can verify it,\" although we don't have any examples of that in action yet. It's worth keeping an eye out, though, if you're worried about hallucinations. To that end, the company does suggest asking Gemini \n\nGoogle says that eligible users should see an invitation to try Personal Intelligence on the Gemini home screen as soon as it's rolled out to them, but if you don't, you can turn it on manually by following these steps:\n\nOpen Gemini and click or tap Settings.\n\nClick or Tap Personal Intelligence.\n\nUnder Connected Apps, select which apps you would like Personal Intelligence to take information from.\n\nAnd that's it! Remember, Personal Intelligence is off by default and is only available for paid subscribers for now, so it may be some time until you can actually use it. Google also stresses the Gemini might not personalize every response, as that will save time on more simple requests. The company also said Personal Intelligence for AI Mode in Google Search is currently planned, but does not have a set release date.",

    "fullText": "We appreciate comments from Christopher Henson, Zeke Medley, Ankit Kumar, and Pete Manolios. This post was initialized by Max’s twitter thread.\n\nThere's been a lot of chatter recently on HN and elsewhere about how formal verification is the obvious use-case for AI. While we broadly agree, we think much of the discourse is kinda wrong because it incorrectly presumes formal = slopless.[1]Over the years, we have written our fair share of good and bad formal code. In this post, we hope to convince you that formal code can be sloppy, and that this has serious implications for anyone who hopes to bootstrap superintelligence by using formality to reinforce “good” reasoning.\n\nA mainstay on the Lean Zulip named Gas Station Manager has written that hallucination-free program synthesis[2]is achievable by vibing software directly in Lean, with the caveat that the agent also needs to prove the software correct. The AI safety case is basically: wouldn’t it be great if a cheap (i.e. O(laptop)) signal could protect you from sycophantic hubris and other classes of mistake, without you having to manually audit all outputs?\n\nRecently a computer scientist (who we will spare from naming) was convinced he had solved a major mathematics problem. Lean was happy with it, he reasoned, given that his proof mostly worked, with just a few red squigglies. As seasoned proof engineers, we could have told him that in proof engineering, the growth in further needed edits is superlinear in number-of-red-squigglies (unlike in regular programming). The difference between mistakes in a proof and mistakes in a program is that you cannot fix a broken proof in a way that changes its formal goal (the theorem statement). In contrast, many, if not most changes to traditional software impact its formal spec, for example by adding a side-effect or changing the shape of an output. Therefore proof bugs are 1) harder to fix, and 2) more likely to imply that your goal is fundamentally unachievable (the theorem is wrong). This made up chart illustrates the principle, a rough “lore” level consensus in the field without any hard data.\n\nIt is possible he will post a finished proof, but the referee-time of bets he made has lapsed, so we can take away some lessons. Did our protagonist take to heart the promise of formal methods as slopless?\n\nIn much the same way that vibed code might work yet be “sloppy” in the sense that it’s difficult to maintain, vibed formal models can be correct, yet very challenging to prove anything about.\n\nOften when you model a system – or write code in a theorem-prover, with the intention of proving things about it – you actually need to make implementation decisions informed by the limitations and capabilities of the prover. For example, it's pretty common that inducting in one direction (say, car/head) on a list will be easy for a prover but the other direction (say cdr/tail) will be difficult. (This is a necessary evil if you want the prover to not enter infinite rewrite loops.) Thus, as an example, you might implement isort in a particular “direction” in order to make the proofs easier about it. If you want to autoformalize arbitrary code in a way that makes proofs straightforward, you’ll need models that understand how to implement something in a way that’s idiomatic for the given interactive theorem-prover.\n\nThis is a solvable problem but a real one nonetheless. For example, one Aristotle user we spoke to reported: “... in Lean you can put theorems inside mutual blocks to let them use each other. I wrote such a theorem, but then later realized proving it this way would be unnecessarily difficult. [...] The model won't do this, so it spent >24 hours on this almost hopeless proof.” Autoformalization companies like math.inc, Harmonic, Axiom, Logical Intelligence, etc. are actively working on improving their models to have this kind of expert folklore knowledge as we speak, but we’re not quite there yet.\n\nThere are basically two ways to make your software amenable to an interactive theorem prover (ITP). The first is to lift it into an ITP using a formal semantics – somewhat like a compiler or interpreter for the original language but implemented in the ITP itself. In this case, you can define the lifting so that it produces functionally equivalent code (say, Lean code that “does the same thing” as the input Python) but in a shape that the theorem-prover tends to like (incorporating heuristics like the car/cdr one mentioned above). The second approach is to just rewrite the original software directly in the language of the ITP, making those kinds of idiomacy improvements as-you-go. Both approaches, however, produce the same formal problem: ensuring that the software you wanted to study in the first place is semantically equivalent to the thing you introduced in the theorem-prover. IE., either ensuring the lifting is correct, or ensuring the manual translation is equivalent. Let’s dig into some of the ways this can be difficult.\n\nWhen we talk about using formal methods to assure that LLM-generated code is safe, what we want is a short, readable description of what the generated code is intended to do, some proof (which might be far too boring and long to read) that the code does this, and the ability to run the proof through a prover and validate that it indeed proves the aforementioned statement. But this is not necessarily a reasonable ask, regardless of model intelligence.\n\nFirst, it’s very common that you mis-define some concept such that the proof is accidentally trivial. For example, when defining a lifting from Python to Lean you might prove that the lifting preserves the semantics of the original Python code, but your proof could be undermined by the presumption that the code terminates, making it basically useless.\n\nSecond, if you re-implement the original software in your ITP of choice, your re-implementation might not be fully faithful, particularly if it’s LLM-generated. For example, the LLM might say, \"The code you wanted me to verify was too complex, so I rewrote it to be simpler and proved the simpler thing correct.\" Well, yeah, but the bugs I wanted you to find were in the complexity. As a concrete example, we asked an early version of Gemini to write a property based test (PBT) for a (deliberately flawed) isort implementation which we provided; Gemini did so but rewrote the isort code to be correct in the process and then executed the PBT and cheerfully reported that it passed.\n\nThese first two problems are commonly addressed using tests which compare the original software to its representation in the ITP. For example, we (Max) did this with coauthors for GossipSub, connecting the Golang implementation to its ACL2(s) model via both unit tests and property-based tests.[3]To quote Knuth: “Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.”\n\nThird, you need to decide how far “down the stack” you want to go. That is to say, the software you want to verify operates over some kind of more complex system, for instance, maybe it’s C code which gets compiled down to X86 and runs on a particular chip, or maybe it’s a controller for a nuclear reactor and part of the system is the actual physical dynamics of the reactor. Do you really want your proof to involve specifying the semantics of the C compiler and the chip, or the way that the temperature and other variables fluctuate in the reactor? Keeping in mind these semantics might not truly be known – e.g., RowHammer can be viewed as an attack on our understanding of the semantics of the chip. In essence, you can only get more specificity by vastly increasing the length of your proof statement to capture the semantics of the underlying system, which then produces a new (and perhaps equally difficult) code review problem. Typically this problem is handled by leaving the underlying semantics nondeterministic, so your proof is stronger (it holds regardless of how the C compiler handles floating point, or how the temperature fluctuates in the nuclear silo) but often the thing you want to prove really does require some pretty specific guarantees about those underlying semantics, and ensuring those guarantees are “reasonable” can be extraordinarily difficult.\n\nThe AI might introduce axioms that conflict with your own presuppositions or the specific requirements of your domain. In Lean, for example, the Axiom of Choice (Classical.choice) is available but transforms a proof from a constructive one—where you can actually compute a result—into a non-constructive one. An AI tasked with verifying a program might realize that a proof is significantly easier if it assumes AC. It might inform you that the theorem is \"proven,\" and the prover will confirm this, but you may not realize that the resulting proof is now a \"lie\" for your specific use case. If you needed that proof to generate an executable, verified algorithm, the introduction of non-constructive axioms shifts you into an incompatible register.\n\nThe person designing the harness for the AI needs to be an expert who knows how to parse these imports and error messages. Without that oversight, the AI will naturally gravitate toward the path of least resistance—even if that path involves an axiomatic shift that renders the entire exercise useless for the user's true intent.\n\nConsider the proof assistant ACL2, which accepts arbitrary lisp code.[4]You write defttag, the trusted tag to open the “trust me” scope. In other words, defttag offloads the soundness obligations to the user. Observe a proof that 1+1=3 in ACL2 with defttag.\n\n“Well yeah”, perhaps comes a reply. “It only looks like 1+1=3 in the nonsensical sense if you deliberately ignore that the meaning of plus has shifted”. “Besides”, they continue. “When my coworker sends me code with defttag in it, I read it very rigorously”. Our retort is that we don’t assume our coworkers are competent or trustworthy, we assume that they’re AIs with a tendency to reward hack. To recap:\n\nAdditionally, proof tools like Lean pile a bunch of ergonomic and notational niceties on top of their core calculus, in Lean’s case with powerful metaprogramming. But this metaprogramming can lead to backdoors much like the ACL2 example.[6]\n\nFrom nothing arises everything. From a proof of false you can derive literally any proposition.\n\nIn Agda, a calculus of inductive constructions popular with mathematical type theorists, the github issue label “false” tracking proofs of false is standing at 9 open and 74 closed issues at time of this writing. A proof of false is a soundness bug[7], which if you think proof synthesis plays a role in high stakes AI security (like SL5), means you have to be paranoid about a glaring attack surface.\n\nWhile we can’t yet think of a case of sicophancy/hubris that was accelerated by an arcane proof of false, we expect this becomes increasingly likely as insecure program synthesis tools get more capable and accessible in contexts where they are incentivized to reward-hack a proof.\n\nIf someone says \"stats don’t lie\" you say \"well don’t be naive, you can tell misleading stories with technically true statistics\".[8]Formal verification is the same. Don’t be lured into the false sense of security. To paraphrase Twain, “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and proofs.” We already know models lie to us; we should fully expect them to prove falsehoods, too.\n\nIn spite of our warnings, which may seem pessimistic, we’re working on secure program synthesis (or what Mike Dodds calls scalable formal oversight) for AI security. The reason we can work on this anyway is because we see a lit path, principally routing through specification elicitation[9]and validation as well as hardened proof cores and (the cherry on top) superpowered proof synthesis. Spec elicitation and validation, in particular, have not seen the upside from language model assisted transpilation fully harvested just yet.\n\nThis intuition might be in part driven by academic papers that push formality as a cure to sloppiness, e.g., Run Your Research and HACMS. But even formally verified software can be buggy! ↩︎\n\nAs a historical aside, the original citation for program synthesis is: Church, A.: Application of recursive arithmetic to the problem of circuit synthesis (7 1957), presented at IDA, as cited in doi:10.2307/2271310. ↩︎\n\nCedar comes to mind as a similar case-study in Lean. ↩︎\n\nThis feature is useful for proving things about real-world LISP code, or connecting ACL2 code which is proven to be correct to real-world systems via LISP harnesses. ↩︎\n\nSee also Pollack-consistency, a kind of LangSec concept of theorem-prover backdooring. ↩︎\n\nThere are some subtleties here we elide, which Christopher Henson plans to explore in a more technical forthcoming blog post. ↩︎\n\nSee also The Difference Between “Significant” and “Not Significant” is not Itself Statistically Significant. ↩︎\n\nAcademia is certain that specification is hard (see also Formal Methods for Security) and we should fix it, but unsure as to why or how to improve the situation. ↩︎",

    "description": "Learn how to write effective specifications for AI coding agents to improve clarity, focus, and productivity in your AI-driven development workflows.",
    "fullText": "TL;DR: Aim for a clear spec covering just enough nuance (this may include structure, style, testing, boundaries) to guide the AI without overwhelming it. Break large tasks into smaller ones vs. keeping everything in one large prompt. Plan first in read-only mode, then execute and iterate continuously.\n\n“I’ve heard a lot about writing good specs for AI agents, but haven’t found a solid framework yet. I could write a spec that rivals an RFC, but at some point the context is too large and the model breaks down.”\n\nMany developers share this frustration. Simply throwing a massive spec at an AI agent doesn’t work - context window limits and the model’s “attention budget” get in the way. The key is to write smart specs: documents that guide the agent clearly, stay within practical context sizes, and evolve with the project. This guide distills best practices from my use of coding agents including Claude Code and Gemini CLI into a framework for spec-writing that keeps your AI agents focused and productive.\n\nWe’ll cover five principles for great AI agent specs, each starting with a bolded takeaway.\n\nKick off your project with a concise high-level spec, then have the AI expand it into a detailed plan.\n\nInstead of over-engineering upfront, begin with a clear goal statement and a few core requirements. Treat this as a “product brief” and let the agent generate a more elaborate spec from it. This leverages the AI’s strength in elaboration while you maintain control of the direction. This works well unless you already feel you have very specific technical requirements that must be met from the start.\n\nWhy this works: LLM-based agents excel at fleshing out details when given a solid high-level directive, but they need a clear mission to avoid drifting off course. By providing a short outline or objective description and asking the AI to produce a full specification (e.g. a spec.md), you create a persistent reference for the agent. Planning in advance matters even more with an agent - you can iterate on the plan first, then hand it off to the agent to write the code. The spec becomes the first artifact you and the AI build together.\n\nPractical approach: Start a new coding session by prompting, “You are an AI software engineer. Draft a detailed specification for [project X] covering objectives, features, constraints, and a step-by-step plan.” Keep your initial prompt high-level - e.g. “Build a web app where users can track tasks (to-do list), with user accounts, a database, and a simple UI”. The agent might respond with a structured draft spec: an overview, feature list, tech stack suggestions, data model, and so on. This spec then becomes the “source of truth” that both you and the agent can refer back to. GitHub’s AI team promotes spec-driven development where “specs become the shared source of truth… living, executable artifacts that evolve with the project”. Before writing any code, review and refine the AI’s spec. Make sure it aligns with your vision and correct any hallucinations or off-target details.\n\nUse Plan Mode to enforce planning-first: Tools like Claude Code offer a Plan Mode that restricts the agent to read-only operations - it can analyze your codebase and create detailed plans but won’t write any code until you’re ready. This is ideal for the planning phase: start in Plan Mode (Shift+Tab in Claude Code), describe what you want to build, and let the agent draft a spec while exploring your existing code. Ask it to clarify ambiguities by questioning you about the plan. Have it review the plan for architecture, best practices, security risks, and testing strategy. The goal is to refine the plan until there’s no room for misinterpretation. Only then do you exit Plan Mode and let the agent execute. This workflow prevents the common trap of jumping straight into code generation before the spec is solid.\n\nUse the spec as context: Once approved, save this spec (e.g. as SPEC.md) and feed relevant sections into the agent as needed. Many developers using a strong model do exactly this - the spec file persists between sessions, anchoring the AI whenever work resumes on the project. This mitigates the forgetfulness that can happen when the conversation history gets too long or when you have to restart an agent. It’s akin to how one would use a Product Requirements Document (PRD) in a team: a reference that everyone (human or AI) can consult to stay on track. Experienced folks often “write good documentation first and the model may be able to build the matching implementation from that input alone” as one engineer observed. The spec is that documentation.\n\nKeep it goal-oriented: A high-level spec for an AI agent should focus on what and why, more than the nitty-gritty how (at least initially). Think of it like the user story and acceptance criteria: Who is the user? What do they need? What does success look like? (e.g. “User can add, edit, complete tasks; data is saved persistently; the app is responsive and secure”). This keeps the AI’s detailed spec grounded in user needs and outcome, not just technical to-dos. As the GitHub Spec Kit docs put it, provide a high-level description of what you’re building and why, and let the coding agent generate a detailed specification focusing on user experience and success criteria. Starting with this big-picture vision prevents the agent from losing sight of the forest for the trees when it later gets into coding.\n\nTreat your AI spec as a structured document (PRD) with clear sections, not a loose pile of notes.\n\nMany developers treat specs for agents much like traditional Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) or System Design docs - comprehensive, well-organized, and easy for a “literal-minded” AI to parse. This formal approach gives the agent a blueprint to follow and reduces ambiguity.\n\nThe six core areas: GitHub’s analysis of over 2,500 agent configuration files revealed a clear pattern: the most effective specs cover six areas. Use this as a checklist for completeness:\n\n1. Commands: Put executable commands early - not just tool names, but full commands with flags: npm test, pytest -v, npm run build. The agent will reference these constantly.\n\n2. Testing: How to run tests, what framework you use, where test files live, and what coverage expectations exist.\n\n3. Project structure: Where source code lives, where tests go, where docs belong. Be explicit: “src/ for application code, tests/ for unit tests, docs/ for documentation.”\n\n4. Code style: One real code snippet showing your style beats three paragraphs describing it. Include naming conventions, formatting rules, and examples of good output.\n\n5. Git workflow: Branch naming, commit message format, PR requirements. The agent can follow these if you spell them out.\n\n6. Boundaries: What the agent should never touch - secrets, vendor directories, production configs, specific folders. “Never commit secrets” was the single most common helpful constraint in the GitHub study.\n\nBe specific about your stack: Say “React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS” not “React project.” Include versions and key dependencies. Vague specs produce vague code.\n\nUse a consistent format: Clarity is king. Many devs use Markdown headings or even XML-like tags in the spec to delineate sections, because AI models handle well-structured text better than free-form prose. For example, you might structure the spec as:\n\nThis level of organization not only helps you think clearly, it helps the AI find information. Anthropic engineers recommend organizing prompts into distinct sections (like <background>, <instructions>, <tools>, <output_format> etc.) for exactly this reason - it gives the model strong cues about which info is which. And remember, “minimal does not necessarily mean short” - don’t shy away from detail in the spec if it matters, but keep it focused.\n\nIntegrate specs into your toolchain: Treat specs as “executable artifacts” tied to version control and CI/CD. The GitHub Spec Kit uses a four-phase, gated workflow that makes your specification the center of your engineering process. Instead of writing a spec and setting it aside, the spec drives the implementation, checklists, and task breakdowns. Your primary role is to steer; the coding agent does the bulk of the writing. Each phase has a specific job, and you don’t move to the next one until the current task is fully validated:\n\n1. Specify: You provide a high-level description of what you’re building and why, and the coding agent generates a detailed specification. This isn’t about technical stacks or app design - it’s about user journeys, experiences, and what success looks like. Who will use this? What problem does it solve? How will they interact with it? Think of it as mapping the user experience you want to create, and letting the coding agent flesh out the details. This becomes a living artifact that evolves as you learn more.\n\n2. Plan: Now you get technical. You provide your desired stack, architecture, and constraints, and the coding agent generates a comprehensive technical plan. If your company standardizes on certain technologies, this is where you say so. If you’re integrating with legacy systems or have compliance requirements, all of that goes here. You can ask for multiple plan variations to compare approaches. If you make internal docs available, the agent can integrate your architectural patterns directly into the plan.\n\n3. Tasks: The coding agent takes the spec and plan and breaks them into actual work - small, reviewable chunks that each solve a specific piece of the puzzle. Each task should be something you can implement and test in isolation, almost like test-driven development for your AI agent. Instead of “build authentication,” you get concrete tasks like “create a user registration endpoint that validates email format.”\n\n4. Implement: Your coding agent tackles tasks one by one (or in parallel). Instead of reviewing thousand-line code dumps, you review focused changes that solve specific problems. The agent knows what to build (specification), how to build it (plan), and what to work on (task). Crucially, your role is to verify at each phase: Does the spec capture what you want? Does the plan account for constraints? Are there edge cases the AI missed? The process builds in checkpoints for you to critique, spot gaps, and course-correct before moving forward.\n\nThis gated workflow prevents what Willison calls “house of cards code” - fragile AI outputs that collapse under scrutiny. Anthropic’s Skills system offers a similar pattern, letting you define reusable Markdown-based behaviors that agents invoke. By embedding your spec in these workflows, you ensure the agent can’t proceed until the spec is validated, and changes propagate automatically to task breakdowns and tests.\n\nConsider agents.md for specialized personas: For tools like GitHub Copilot, you can create agents.md files that define specialized agent personas - a @docs-agent for technical writing, a @test-agent for QA, a @security-agent for code review. Each file acts as a focused spec for that persona’s behavior, commands, and boundaries. This is particularly useful when you want different agents for different tasks rather than one general-purpose assistant.\n\nDesign for Agent Experience (AX): Just as we design APIs for developer experience (DX), consider designing specs for “Agent Experience.” This means clean, parseable formats: OpenAPI schemas for any APIs the agent will consume, llms.txt files that summarize documentation for LLM consumption, and explicit type definitions. The Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) is standardizing protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tool integration - specs that follow these patterns are easier for agents to consume and act on reliably.\n\nPRD vs SRS mindset: It helps to borrow from established documentation practices. For AI agent specs, you’ll often blend these into one document (as illustrated above), but covering both angles serves you well. Writing it like a PRD ensures you include user-centric context (“the why behind each feature”) so the AI doesn’t optimize for the wrong thing. Expanding it like an SRS ensures you nail down the specifics the AI will need to actually generate correct code (like what database or API to use). Developers have found that this extra upfront effort pays off by drastically reducing miscommunications with the agent later.\n\nMake the spec a “living document”: Don’t write it and forget it. Update the spec as you and the agent make decisions or discover new info. If the AI had to change the data model or you decided to cut a feature, reflect that in the spec so it remains the ground truth. Think of it as version-controlled documentation. In spec-driven workflows, the spec drives implementation, tests, and task breakdowns, and you don’t move to coding until the spec is validated. This habit keeps the project coherent, especially if you or the agent step away and come back later. Remember, the spec isn’t just for the AI - it helps you as the developer maintain oversight and ensure the AI’s work meets the real requirements.\n\nDivide and conquer: give the AI one focused task at a time rather than a monolithic prompt with everything at once.\n\nExperienced AI engineers have learned that trying to stuff the entire project (all requirements, all code, all instructions) into a single prompt or agent message is a recipe for confusion. Not only do you risk hitting token limits, you also risk the model losing focus due to the “curse of instructions” - too many directives causing it to follow none of them well. The solution is to design your spec and workflow in a modular way, tackling one piece at a time and pulling in only the context needed for that piece.\n\nThe curse of too much context/instructions: Research has confirmed what many devs anecdotally saw: as you pile on more instructions or data into the prompt, the model’s performance in adhering to each one drops significantly. One study dubbed this the “curse of instructions”, showing that even GPT-4 and Claude struggle when asked to satisfy many requirements simultaneously. In practical terms, if you present 10 bullet points of detailed rules, the AI might obey the first few and start overlooking others. The better strategy is iterative focus. Guidelines from industry suggest decomposing complex requirements into sequential, simple instructions as a best practice. Focus the AI on one sub-problem at a time, get that done, then move on. This keeps the quality high and errors manageable.\n\nDivide the spec into phases or components: If your spec document is very long or covers a lot of ground, consider splitting it into parts (either physically separate files or clearly separate sections). For example, you might have a section for “Backend API Spec” and another for “Frontend UI Spec.” You don’t need to always feed the frontend spec to the AI when it’s working on the backend, and vice versa. Many devs using multi-agent setups even create separate agents or sub-processes for each part - e.g. one agent works on database/schema, another on API logic, another on frontend - each with the relevant slice of the spec. Even if you use a single agent, you can emulate this by copying only the relevant spec section into the prompt for that task. Avoid context overload: Don’t mix authentication tasks with database schema changes in one go, as the DigitalOcean AI guide warns. Keep each prompt tightly scoped to the current goal.\n\nExtended TOC / Summaries for large specs: One clever technique is to have the agent build an extended Table of Contents with summaries for the spec. This is essentially a “spec summary” that condenses each section into a few key points or keywords, and references where details can be found. For example, if your full spec has a section on “Security Requirements” spanning 500 words, you might have the agent summarize it to: “Security: use HTTPS, protect API keys, implement input validation (see full spec §4.2)”. By creating a hierarchical summary in the planning phase, you get a bird’s-eye view that can stay in the prompt, while the fine details remain offloaded unless needed. This extended TOC acts as an index: the agent can consult it and say “aha, there’s a security section I should look at”, and you can then provide that section on demand. It’s similar to how a human developer skims an outline and then flips to the relevant page of a spec document when working on a specific part.\n\nTo implement this, you can prompt the agent after writing the spec: “Summarize the spec above into a very concise outline with each section’s key points and a reference tag.” The result might be a list of sections with one or two sentence summaries. That summary can be kept in the system or assistant message to guide the agent’s focus without eating up too many tokens. This hierarchical summarization approach is known to help LLMs maintain long-term context by focusing on the high-level structure. The agent carries a “mental map” of the spec.\n\nUtilize sub-agents or “skills” for different spec parts: Another advanced approach is using multiple specialized agents (what Anthropic calls subagents or what you might call “skills”). Each subagent is configured for a specific area of expertise and given the portion of the spec relevant to that area. For instance, you might have a Database Designer subagent that only knows about the data model section of the spec, and an API Coder subagent that knows the API endpoints spec. The main agent (or an orchestrator) can route tasks to the appropriate subagent automatically. The benefit is each agent has a smaller context window to deal with and a more focused role, which can boost accuracy and allow parallel work on independent tasks. Anthropic’s Claude Code supports this by letting you define subagents with their own system prompts and tools. “Each subagent has a specific purpose and expertise area, uses its own context window separate from the main conversation, and has a custom system prompt guiding its behavior,” as their docs describe. When a task comes up that matches a subagent’s domain, Claude can delegate that task to it, with the subagent returning results independently.\n\nParallel agents for throughput: Running multiple agents simultaneously is emerging as “the next big thing” for developer productivity. Rather than waiting for one agent to finish before starting another task, you can spin up parallel agents for non-overlapping work. Willison describes this as “embracing parallel coding agents” and notes it’s “surprisingly effective, if mentally exhausting”. The key is scoping tasks so agents don’t step on each other - one agent codes a feature while another writes tests, or separate components get built concurrently. Orchestration frameworks like LangGraph or OpenAI Swarm can help coordinate these agents, and shared memory via vector databases (like Chroma) lets them access common context without redundant prompting.\n\nSingle vs. multi-agent: when to use each\n\nIn practice, using subagents or skill-specific prompts might look like: you maintain multiple spec files (or prompt templates) - e.g. SPEC_backend.md, SPEC_frontend.md - and you tell the AI, “For backend tasks, refer to SPEC_backend; for frontend tasks refer to SPEC_frontend.” Or in a tool like Cursor/Claude, you actually spin up a subagent for each. This is certainly more complex to set up than a single-agent loop, but it mimics what human developers do - we mentally compartmentalize a large spec into relevant chunks (you don’t keep the whole 50-page spec in your head at once; you recall the part you need for the task at hand, and have a general sense of the overall architecture). The challenge, as noted, is managing interdependencies: the subagents must still coordinate (the frontend needs to know the API contract from the backend spec, etc.). A central overview (or an “architect” agent) can help by referencing the sub-specs and ensuring consistency.\n\nFocus each prompt on one task/section: Even without fancy multi-agent setups, you can manually enforce modularity. For example, after the spec is written, your next move might be: “Step 1: Implement the database schema.” You feed the agent the Database section of the spec only, plus any global constraints from the spec (like tech stack). The agent works on that. Then for Step 2, “Now implement the authentication feature”, you provide the Auth section of the spec and maybe the relevant parts of the schema if needed. By refreshing the context for each major task, you ensure the model isn’t carrying a lot of stale or irrelevant information that could distract it. As one guide suggests: “Start fresh: begin new sessions to clear context when switching between major features”. You can always remind the agent of critical global rules (from the spec’s Constraints section) each time, but don’t shove the entire spec in if it’s not all needed.\n\nUse in-line directives and code TODOs: Another modularity trick is to use your code or spec as an active part of the conversation. For instance, scaffold your code with // TODO comments that describe what needs to be done, and have the agent fill them one by one. Each TODO essentially acts as a mini-spec for a small task. This keeps the AI laser-focused (“implement this specific function according to this spec snippet”) and you can iterate in a tight loop. It’s similar to giving the AI a checklist item to complete rather than the whole checklist at once.\n\nThe bottom line: small, focused context beats one giant prompt. This improves quality and keeps the AI from getting “overwhelmed” by too much at once. As one set of best practices sums up, provide “One Task Focus” and “Relevant info only” to the model, and avoid dumping everything everywhere. By structuring the work into modules - and using strategies like spec summaries or sub-spec agents - you’ll navigate around context size limits and the AI’s short-term memory cap. Remember, a well-fed AI is like a well-fed function: give it only the inputs it needs for the job at hand.\n\nMake your spec not just a to-do list for the agent, but also a guide for quality control - and don’t be afraid to inject your own expertise.\n\nA good spec for an AI agent anticipates where the AI might go wrong and sets up guardrails. It also takes advantage of what you know (domain knowledge, edge cases, “gotchas”) so the AI doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Think of the spec as both coach and referee for the AI: it should encourage the right approach and call out fouls.\n\nUse three-tier boundaries: The GitHub analysis of 2,500+ agent files found that the most effective specs use a three-tier boundary system rather than a simple list of don’ts. This gives the agent clearer guidance on when to proceed, when to pause, and when to stop:\n\n✅ Always do: Actions the agent should take without asking. “Always run tests before commits.” “Always follow the naming conventions in the style guide.” “Always log errors to the monitoring service.”\n\n⚠️ Ask first: Actions that require human approval. “Ask before modifying database schemas.” “Ask before adding new dependencies.” “Ask before changing CI/CD configuration.” This tier catches high-impact changes that might be fine but warrant a human check.\n\n🚫 Never do: Hard stops. “Never commit secrets or API keys.” “Never edit node_modules/ or vendor/.” “Never remove a failing test without explicit approval.” “Never commit secrets” was the single most common helpful constraint in the study.\n\nThis three-tier approach is more nuanced than a flat list of rules. It acknowledges that some actions are always safe, some need oversight, and some are categorically off-limits. The agent can proceed confidently on “Always” items, flag “Ask first” items for review, and hard-stop on “Never” items.\n\nEncourage self-verification: One powerful pattern is to have the agent verify its work against the spec automatically. If your tooling allows, you can integrate checks like unit tests or linting that the AI can run after generating code. But even at the spec/prompt level, you can instruct the AI to double-check: e.g. “After implementing, compare the result with the spec and confirm all requirements are met. List any spec items that are not addressed.” This pushes the LLM to reflect on its output relative to the spec, catching omissions. It’s a form of self-audit built into the process.\n\nFor instance, you might append to a prompt: “(After writing the function, review the above requirements list and ensure each is satisfied, marking any missing ones).” The model will then (ideally) output the code followed by a short checklist indicating if it met each requirement. This reduces the chance it forgets something before you even run tests. It’s not foolproof, but it helps.\n\nLLM-as-a-Judge for subjective checks: For criteria that are hard to test automatically - code style, readability, adherence to architectural patterns - consider using “LLM-as-a-Judge.” This means having a second agent (or a separate prompt) review the first agent’s output against your spec’s quality guidelines. Anthropic and others have found this effective for subjective evaluation. You might prompt: “Review this code for adherence to our style guide. Flag any violations.” The judge agent returns feedback that either gets incorporated or triggers a revision. This adds a layer of semantic evaluation beyond syntax checks.\n\nConformance testing: Willison advocates building conformance suites - language-independent tests (often YAML-based) that any implementation must pass. These act as a contract: if you’re building an API, the conformance suite specifies expected inputs/outputs, and the agent’s code must satisfy all cases. This is more rigorous than ad-hoc unit tests because it’s derived directly from the spec and can be reused across implementations. Include conformance criteria in your spec’s Success section (e.g., “Must pass all cases in conformance/api-tests.yaml”).\n\nLeverage testing in the spec: If possible, incorporate a test plan or even actual tests in your spec and prompt flow. In traditional development, we use TDD or write test cases to clarify requirements - you can do the same with AI. For example, in the spec’s Success Criteria, you might say “These sample inputs should produce these outputs…” or “the following unit tests should pass.” The agent can be prompted to run through those cases in its head or actually execute them if it has that capability. Simon Willison noted that having a robust test suite is like giving the agents superpowers - they can validate and iterate quickly when tests fail. In an AI coding context, writing a bit of pseudocode for tests or expected outcomes in the spec can guide the agent’s implementation. Additionally, you can use a dedicated “test agent” in a subagent setup that takes the spec’s criteria and continuously verifies the “code agent’s” output.\n\nBring your domain knowledge: Your spec should reflect insights that only an experienced developer or someone with context would know. For example, if you’re building an e-commerce agent and you know that “products” and “categories” have a many-to-many relationship, state that clearly (don’t assume the AI will infer it - it might not). If a certain library is notoriously tricky, mention pitfalls to avoid. Essentially, pour your mentorship into the spec. The spec can contain advice like “If using library X, watch out for memory leak issue in version Y (apply workaround Z).” This level of detail is what turns an average AI output into a truly robust solution, because you’ve steered the AI away from common traps.\n\nAlso, if you have preferences or style guidelines (say, “use functional components over class components in React”), encode that in the spec. The AI will then emulate your style. Many engineers even include small examples in the spec, e.g., “All API responses should be JSON. E.g. {“error”: “message”} for errors.” By giving a quick example, you anchor the AI to the exact format you want.\n\nMinimalism for simple tasks: While we advocate thorough specs, part of expertise is knowing when to keep it simple. For relatively simple, isolated tasks, an overbearing spec can actually confuse more than help. If you’re asking the agent to do something straightforward (like “center a div on the page”), you might just say, “Make sure to keep the solution concise and do not add extraneous markup or styles.” No need for a full PRD there. Conversely, for complex tasks (like “implement an OAuth flow with token refresh and error handling”), that’s when you break out the detailed spec. A good rule of thumb: adjust spec detail to task complexity. Don’t under-spec a hard problem (the agent will flail or go off-track), but don’t over-spec a trivial one (the agent might get tangled or use up context on unnecessary instructions).\n\nMaintain the AI’s “persona” if needed: Sometimes, part of your spec is defining how the agent should behave or respond, especially if the agent interacts with users. For example, if building a customer support agent, your spec might include guidelines like “Use a friendly and professional tone,” “If you don’t know the answer, ask for clarification or offer to follow up, rather than guessing.” These kind of rules (often included in system prompts) help keep the AI’s outputs aligned with expectations. They are essentially spec items for AI behavior. Keep them consistent and remind the model of them if needed in long sessions (LLMs can “drift” in style over time if not kept on a leash).\n\nYou remain the exec in the loop: The spec empowers the agent, but you remain the ultimate quality filter. If the agent produces something that technically meets the spec but doesn’t feel right, trust your judgement. Either refine the spec or directly adjust the output. The great thing about AI agents is they don’t get offended - if they deliver a design that’s off, you can say, “Actually, that’s not what I intended, let’s clarify the spec and redo it.” The spec is a living artifact in collaboration with the AI, not a one-time contract you can’t change.\n\nSimon Willison humorously likened working with AI agents to “a very weird form of management” and even “getting good results out of a coding agent feels uncomfortably close to managing a human intern”. You need to provide clear instructions (the spec), ensure they have the necessary context (the spec and relevant data), and give actionable feedback. The spec sets the stage, but monitoring and feedback during execution are key. If an AI was a “weird digital intern who will absolutely cheat if you give them a chance”, the spec and constraints you write are how you prevent that cheating and keep them on task.\n\nHere’s the payoff: a good spec doesn’t just tell the AI what to build, it also helps it self-correct and stay within safe boundaries. By baking in verification steps, constraints, and your hard-earned knowledge, you drastically increase the odds that the agent’s output is correct on the first try (or at least much closer to correct). This reduces iterations and those “why on Earth did it do that?” moments.\n\nThink of spec-writing and agent-building as an iterative loop: test early, gather feedback, refine the spec, and leverage tools to automate checks.\n\nThe initial spec is not the end - it’s the beginning of a cycle. The best outcomes come when you continually verify the agent’s work against the spec and adjust accordingly. Also, modern AI devs use various tools to support this process (from CI pipelines to context management utilities).\n\nContinuous testing: Don’t wait until the end to see if the agent met the spec. After each major milestone or even each function, run tests or at least do quick manual checks. If something fails, update the spec or prompt before proceeding. For example, if the spec said “passwords must be hashed with bcrypt” and you see the agent’s code storing plain text - stop and correct it (and remind the spec or prompt about the rule). Automated tests shine here: if you provided tests (or write them as you go), let the agent run them. In many coding agent setups, you can have an agent run npm test or similar after finishing a task. The results (failures) can then feed back into the next prompt, effectively telling the agent “your output didn’t meet spec on X, Y, Z - fix it.” This kind of agentic loop (code -> test -> fix -> repeat) is extremely powerful and is how tools like Claude Code or Copilot Labs are evolving to handle larger tasks. Always define what “done” means (via tests or criteria) and check for it.\n\nIterate on the spec itself: If you discover that the spec was incomplete or unclear (maybe the agent misunderstood something or you realized you missed a requirement), update the spec document. Then explicitly re-sync the agent with the new spec: “I have updated the spec as follows… Given the updated spec, adjust the plan or refactor the code accordingly.” This way the spec remains the single source of truth. It’s similar to how we handle changing requirements in normal dev - but in this case you’re also the product manager for your AI agent. Keep version history if possible (even just via commit messages or notes), so you know what changed and why.\n\nUtilize context-management and memory tools: There’s a growing ecosystem of tools to help manage AI agent context and knowledge. For instance, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a pattern where the agent can pull in relevant chunks of data from a knowledge base (like a vector database) on the fly. If your spec is huge, you could embed sections of it and let the agent retrieve the most relevant parts when needed, instead of always providing the whole thing. There are also frameworks implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which automates feeding the right context to the model based on the current task. One example is Context7 (context7.com), which can auto-fetch relevant context snippets from docs based on what you’re working on. In practice, this might mean the agent notices you’re working on “payment processing” and it pulls the “Payments” section of your spec or documentation into the prompt. Consider leveraging such tools or setting up a rudimentary version (even a simple search in your spec document).\n\nParallelize carefully: Some developers run multiple agent instances in parallel on different tasks (as mentioned earlier with subagents). This can speed up development - e.g., one agent generates code while another simultaneously writes tests, or two features are built concurrently. If you go this route, ensure the tasks are truly independent or clearly separated to avoid conflicts (the spec should note any dependencies). For example, don’t have two agents writing to the same file at once. One workflow is to have an agent generate code and another review it in parallel, or to have separate components built that integrate later. This is advanced usage and can be mentally taxing to manage (as Willison admitted, running multiple agents is surprisingly effective, if mentally exhausting!). Start with at most 2-3 agents to keep things manageable.\n\nVersion control and spec locks: Use Git or your version control of choice to track what the agent does. Good version control habits matter even more with AI assistance. Commit the spec file itself to the repo. This not only preserves history, but the agent can even use git diff or blame to understand changes (LLMs are quite capable of reading diffs). Some advanced agent setups let the agent query the VCS history to see when something was introduced - surprisingly, models can be “fiercely competent at Git”. By keeping your spec in the repo, you allow both you and the AI to track evolution. There are tools (like GitHub Spec Kit mentioned earlier) that integrate spec-driven development into the git workflow - for instance, gating merges on updated specs or generating checklists from spec items. While you don’t need those tools to succeed, the takeaway is to treat the spec like code - maintain it diligently.\n\nCost and speed considerations: Working with large models and long contexts can be slow and expensive. A practical tip is to use model selection and batching smartly. Perhaps use a cheaper/faster model for initial drafts or repetitions, and reserve the most capable (and expensive) model for final outputs or complex reasoning. Some developers use GPT-4 or Claude for planning and critical steps, but offload simpler expansions or refactors to a local model or a smaller API model. If using multiple agents, maybe not all need to be top-tier; a test-running agent or a linter agent could be a smaller model. Also consider throttling context size: don’t feed 20k tokens if 5k will do. As we discussed, more tokens can mean diminishing returns.\n\nMonitor and log everything: In complex agent workflows, logging the agent’s actions and outputs is essential. Check the logs to see if the agent is deviating or encountering errors. Many frameworks provide trace logs or allow printing the agent’s chain-of-thought (especially if you prompt it to think step-by-step). Reviewing these logs can highlight where the spec or instructions might have been misinterpreted. It’s not unlike debugging a program - except the “program” is the conversation/prompt chain. If something weird happens, go back to the spec/instructions to see if there was ambiguity.\n\nLearn and improve: Finally, treat each project as a learning opportunity to refine your spec-writing skill. Maybe you’ll discover that a certain phrasing consistently confuses the AI, or that organizing spec sections in a certain way yields better adherence. Incorporate those lessons into the next spec. The field of AI agents is rapidly evolving, so new best practices (and tools) emerge constantly. Stay updated via blogs (like the ones by Simon Willison, Andrej Karpathy, etc.), and don’t hesitate to experiment.\n\nA spec for an AI agent isn’t “write once, done.” It’s part of a continuous cycle of instructing, verifying, and refining. The payoff for this diligence is substantial: by catching issues early and keeping the agent aligned, you avoid costly rewrites or failures later. As one AI engineer quipped, using these practices can feel like having “an army of interns” working for you, but you have to manage them well. A good spec, continuously maintained, is your management tool.\n\nBefore wrapping up, it’s worth calling out anti-patterns that can derail even well-intentioned spec-driven workflows. The GitHub study of 2,500+ agent files revealed a stark divide: “Most agent files fail because they’re too vague.” Here are the mistakes to avoid:\n\nVague prompts: “Build me something cool” or “Make it work better” gives the agent nothing to anchor on. As Baptiste Studer puts it: “Vague prompts mean wrong results.” Be specific about inputs, outputs, and constraints. “You are a helpful coding assistant” doesn’t work. “You are a test engineer who writes tests for React components, follows these examples, and never modifies source code” does.\n\nOverlong contexts without summarization: Dumping 50 pages of documentation into a prompt and hoping the model figures it out rarely works. Use hierarchical summaries (as discussed in Principle 3) or RAG to surface only what’s relevant. Context length is not a substitute for context quality.\n\nSkipping human review: Willison has a personal rule: “I won’t commit code I couldn’t explain to someone else.” Just because the agent produced something that passes tests doesn’t mean it’s correct, secure, or maintainable. Always review critical code paths. The “house of cards” metaphor applies: AI-generated code can look solid but collapse under edge cases you didn’t test.\n\nConflating vibe coding with production engineering: Rapid prototyping with AI (“vibe coding”) is great for exploration and throwaway projects. But shipping that code to production without rigorous specs, tests, and review is asking for trouble. Osmani distinguishes “vibe coding” from “AI-assisted engineering” - the latter requires the discipline this guide describes. Know which mode you’re in.\n\nIgnoring the “lethal trifecta”: Willison warns of three properties that make AI agents dangerous: speed (they work faster than you can review), non-determinism (same input, different outputs), and cost (encouraging corner-cutting on verification). Your spec and review process must account for all three. Don’t let speed outpace your ability to verify.\n\nMissing the six core areas: If your spec doesn’t cover commands, testing, project structure, code style, git workflow, and boundaries, you’re likely missing something the agent needs. Use the six-area checklist from Section 2 as a sanity check before handing off to the agent.\n\nWriting an effective spec for AI coding agents requires solid software engineering principles combined with adaptation to LLM quirks. Start with clarity of purpose and let the AI help expand the plan. Structure the spec like a serious design document - covering the six core areas and integrating it into your toolchain so it becomes an executable artifact, not just prose. Keep the agent’s focus tight by feeding it one piece of the puzzle at a time (and consider clever tactics like summary TOCs, subagents, or parallel orchestration to handle big specs). Anticipate pitfalls by including three-tier boundaries (Always/Ask first/Never), self-checks, and conformance tests - essentially, teach the AI how to not fail. And treat the whole process as iterative: use tests and feedback to refine both the spec and the code continuously.\n\nFollow these guidelines and your AI agent will be far less likely to “break down” under large contexts or wander off into nonsense.\n\nThis post was formatted using Gemini with images generated using Nano Banana Pro",

    "title": "One thing that might get workers to embrace AI? The 4-day workweek.",
    "description": "Adopting AI has been a struggle at some companies. Embracing a four-day workweek might help get more workers on board, say these authors.",
    "fullText": "Bosses, if you're struggling to get your people excited about AI, here's one idea: Embrace the four-day workweek.\n\nSharing some of AI's promised efficiency gains with employees — by letting them work fewer hours, not just get more done — could help get workers on board with a technology that some fear might ultimately replace them, authors of a new book advocating for a shorter workweek told Business Insider.\n\nLetting workers put in four days' work for five days' pay would be one way to \"share the rewards\" of innovation and technological advancement, said Jared Lindzon, a coauthor of the book \"Do \n\nWhen it comes to AI, giving workers more time away from their jobs could make it more likely they'd get behind the technology \"because they're getting part of that benefit,\" rather than standing in the way of it, he said.\n\nJoe O'Connor, Lindzon's coauthor, said that when it comes to discussions about AI in the workplace, the conversation among workers often turns to fears of job cuts.\n\nAnxiety about AI-induced layoffs might be one reason rolling out the technology has proven difficult for some companies. In an early 2025 survey of business leaders in eight countries from the IT company Kyndryl, 45% of CEOs said their workers were resisting the technology.\n\n\"Cultural resistance and emotional friction\" are the biggest impediments to AI adoption, Boston Consulting Group reported in 2025. That's unwelcome news for C-suite decision-makers eager to ratchet up efficiency. One in three companies is pumping at least $25 million into AI, according to BCG.\n\nBusiness leaders have, at times, publicly expressed their frustration over some workers' foot-dragging.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in 2025 that he'd gone \"rogue\" in firing some workers at the crypto exchange who didn't adopt AI after being told to do so. The head of the software company IgniteTech has, meanwhile, lamented that \"changing minds was harder than adding skills.\" In recent years, the firm cut nearly eight in 10 workers after they failed to quickly embrace AI.\n\nNurturing the productivity gains that many leaders seek will often require people to perform different kinds of work — especially as AI takes over some tasks, O'Connor said. He expects that demand for creativity, judgment, critical thinking, and adaptability will increase and that those \"fundamentally human\" traits won't be fostered by simply moving faster or working longer, he said.\n\n\"It's going to be more about maximizing people's energy, maximizing people's motivation, maximizing people's well-being and recovery,\" O'Connor said. A four-day workweek could promote those things, he said.\n\nThe idea that AI could allow people to work less isn't new. For years, the technology's advocates have said it could free up humans to do more of what they love, while handing off the grunt work to bots. The CEO of startup Mechanize, for example, says the company's aim is to automate every job.\n\nThat notion has led some of the biggest corporate luminaries to predict that working hours could plummet as AI adoption increases. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has said that time on the clock might shrink to two days, while JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon has said workweeks of 3.5 days could become a thing.\n\nEven Nvidia's Jensen Huang — known for regularly putting in 14-hour days at the chipmaker and working on holidays — has said he could see the tech allowing for more time away from the office.\n\nPoliticians have weighed in, too. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, citing efficiency gains from technology such as AI, introduced legislation in 2024 to trim the standard workweek to 32 hours.\n\nThere hasn't yet been widespread adoption of the four-day workweek, likely in part because employers wield more power in many parts of the job market. O'Connor said that while adoption of four-day setups was lower in 2025 than in 2023, when far more workers were job-hopping, more employers are opting for shorter weeks than before the pandemic upended norms about work.\n\nUmesh Ramakrishnan, cofounder of the executive search and leadership advisory firm Kingsley Gate, told Business Insider that many leaders, himself included, would want to harness AI's productivity gains to boost a business's top and bottom lines.\n\n\"If you have a day to spare, get me more revenue, get me more profit,\" he said, adding that while it might sound \"heartless,\" that's simply how business works.\n\nYet, Lindzon said, asking workers to be 20% more effective — the equivalent of a single day in a standard workweek — so that they might benefit from that boost is likely to be more effective than asking them to do it for the good of the company.\n\n\"It completely changes the conversation from a 'You have to do this' to 'We get to do this together,'\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "title": "From humanoid robots to agentic AI, I learned what retail insiders are buzzing about at a major industry conference",
    "description": "AI and innovation — from humanoid robots to agents — dominated the conversation at the National Retail Federation's Big Show 2026.",
    "fullText": "There were two little letters on everyone's lips: AI.\n\nEach year, the National Retail Federation, a leading industry trade group, hosts one of the industry's largest conferences, known as Retail's Big Show. I attended the convention, held in New York City from January 11 to 13, for the first time to hear from industry insiders about the retail trends to watch in 2026.\n\nThis year's event drew speakers such as Walmart's incoming CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who announced a new AI deal this week, as well as Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin. It was clear that artificial intelligence was the big topic on the minds of the attendees from over 5,000 brands at the event.\n\nWalking the expo hall, \"AI\" and \"agentic\" seemed to be mentioned on nearly every other banner or booth I passed. Onstage, retail leaders touted their AI strategies.\n\nLarge retailers, such as Walmart and Lowe's, have introduced their own AI shopping agents or partnered with AI platforms like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT; however, these efforts are still in their early stages.\n\nI also saw firsthand how some companies are experimenting with new technologies. There were humanoid robots walking up to greet attendees and digital drive-thru menu boards with bright colors advertising to retailers what their AI-powered menus could look like.\n\nDespite some of the noise surrounding retail's AI-powered direction, CEOs, including Fran Horowitz of Abercrombie & Fitch, said young founders should keep the fundamentals top of mind while embracing innovation. Improving customer service, for instance, remains at the forefront of retailer decision-making.\n\nIn one session, Ralph Lauren's chief branding and innovation officer, David Lauren, talked about his brand's longtime partnership with Microsoft. It led to the creation of Ask Ralph, a chatbot-style customer assistant. The bot is powered by Microsoft's AI, but it is designed to function like a styling assistant that suggests clothing based on prompts, such as an occasion you're attending.\n\nIt's a taste of the future with the personal touch customers may want from a store associate.\n\n\"It's like having Ralph Lauren in your pocket,\" Lauren said at the conference.\n\nCurrently, AI is most useful for bargain-hunting and basic customer service, according to a panel about Gen Z that included members of The Z Suite, a collective of consultants specializing in the consumer space. Chatbots like Ask Ralph can be convenient in a pinch, but the shopping experience doesn't begin and end there, the Gen Z consultants who ranged in age from 17 to 24 said.\n\nYoung people seem to still crave some of the old-school fundamentals that define retail: quality, customer service, and in-store experiences. There's no replicating trying on the perfect dress in person, one young panelist said.\n\nThey said they see AI as a starting point that they can use to find the unique items they covet. They're willing to put in the work to find the right item for them. This includes scouring Reddit for \"real\" reviews that TikTok influencers may not offer, said Olivia Meyer, a buyer who is part of The Z Suite.\n\nAnd although they're not rushing to get on the phone with a customer service representative, the consultants said they want to talk to a human when their money is at stake.\n\nThese Gen Z retail professionals, who also included a global merchant for Calvin Klein and a marketing associate, said they want their clothes to come from authentic brands that are transparent about their use of AI. They pointed to online speculation about AI models in ads, saying Gen Z doesn't care if the brands use AI models; they just want the truth.\n\nThey want to get their money's worth for the clothes that they're buying, which is why data shows this demographic is straying away from fast fashion and toward shopping secondhand on sites like Vinted and eBay.\n\nTrue Religion's chief marketing officer, Kristen D'Arcy, who moderated the panel, said shoppers are craving authenticity in the world of AI-generated content, and it's making them more discerning. To that end, the denim brand has leveraged partnerships that align with its values, such as collaborations with artists like Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nThe three-day event gave me a glimpse into the retail landscape of 2026.\n\nAI may be the loudest trend, but that doesn't mean brands should forget the basics.",

    "title": "The 3 main storylines investors need to be watching as earnings season picks up steam",
    "description": "The continued adoption of AI, and how much companies are spending to do so, will be top of mind.",
    "fullText": "Earnings season kicked off with a bang on Tuesday with a report from headliner JPMorgan.\n\nThe company's stock ultimately fell 4% due to a mix of two factors unique to the business: (1) a surprise drop in investment banking revenue and (2) uncertainty around President Trump's proposed credit card interest cap, to which JPMorgan is especially exposed as America's largest issuer.\n\nIt was a good primer for the upcoming earnings season, which could make or break the fortunes of major US companies, especially when it comes to AI plans.\n\nThe previous quarter already saw a simmering of the red-hot AI trade for companies planning to continue spending heavily on capex without immediate tangible results. Just ask Meta and Microsoft how it went when they pledged to keep pouring billions into AI (spoiler alert: not well).\n\nWith that in mind, First Trade — with the help of the equity strategy team at Goldman Sachs — has put together a three-part earnings primer for those looking to gain an edge up.\n\n1. Watch for signs of AI-adoption progress\n\nSo far, in the AI trade, it's been the infrastructure stocks that have dominated — the chipmakers and picks-and-shovels companies that make up the physical components of data centers.\n\nGoldman says that gains will broaden out to increasingly include companies showing productivity gains unlocked by AI.\n\nA prime example of this dynamic in action came last quarter, from freight-logistics company CH Robinson, which raised its profit-growth forecast specifically due to new AI efficiencies. The stock spiked 20% during the next trading day, and it's been at record highs pretty much ever since.\n\nThe market is being clear about what it wants. Actually achieving that is the hard part.\n\n2. Monitor how companies are planning to spend their cash\n\nConcerns over AI overspending reached a fever pitch last quarter — a trend Goldman expects to subside throughout 2026 after one last hurrah. The firm predicts that hyperscaler capex will see above-forecast growth for one more quarter, then begin a gradual deceleration, as shown in this chart:\n\nAn additional element to watch is the degree to which that AI capex spending comes at the expense of share repurchases. After all, buybacks are crucial for engineering share-price increases during periods devoid of other positive catalysts.\n\nGoldman predicts that investors will reward companies generating strong free cash flow, which have the flexibility to return cash to shareholders. The firm says that group of stocks already outperformed throughout 2025.\n\n3. Check the sustainability of earnings growth for mega-cap tech\n\nThe number to watch here is 20%. That's the target Goldman has set for Magnificent 7 profit expansion in the quarter. Any downside disappointment here could mean stock declines. After all, earnings growth is the lifeblood of any bull market.",

    "description": "Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz said AI's surge isn't just hype, saying that record demand and adoption explain soaring valuations.",
    "fullText": "Silicon Valley leaders have debated for months whether the AI boom is a bubble. Ben Horowitz says that debate misses what's really happening.\n\nIn a wide-ranging discussion on \"The A16z Show\" on Tuesday, the cofounder of the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz said AI represents something larger than past tech waves — including the internet — and that the eye-popping valuations can't be understood without looking at what's actually happening underneath the surface.\n\n\"AI is a new computing platform,\" Horowitz said. In his view, that puts it in a different category from incremental software shifts.\n\n\"This is a bigger technology market than I've ever seen,\" he added.\n\nSkeptics, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio, often point to how fast valuations have risen to predict a looming bubble.\n\nBut Horowitz said that focusing on prices alone ignores a more important signal: demand.\n\n\"One of the reasons why people are so worried about it being a bubble is, you know, the valuations have gone up so fast,\" he said. \"But if you look at what's going on underneath in terms of the customer adoption, the revenue growth rates — we've never seen demand like this.\"\n\nThat disconnect, he said, explains why AI feels unsettling even to seasoned investors.\n\n\"We've never seen valuations rise like this, but we've never seen demand rise like this either,\" Horowitz said, describing the current moment as \"a bit of a brave new world.\"\n\nHorowitz also pushed back on the idea that AI will produce only a handful of dominant winners, as the internet did — a view promoted by former Shark Tank star Mark Cuban.\n\nHorowitz sees a much larger opportunity set.\n\n\"It's a very big design space — an enormous design space like one we've never seen before in technology,\" he said, predicting more billion- and even $10 billion-plus companies than in prior cycles.\n\nPart of that expansion comes from how AI is being built. Rather than a single, all-powerful model doing everything, Horowitz said real products require complex applications that deeply model human behavior — work that can't simply be absorbed by foundation models.\n\nThe result, he believes, is a technology shift that is both messier and more powerful than past revolutions — and one where fears of a simple bubble may underestimate just how much is changing.",

    "fullText": "The showdown between Elon Musk and Sam Altman is headed to court — and it's set to be a long one.\n\nOakland federal judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Tuesday set a new trial date for Musk's legal dispute with OpenAI — one week after saying the Tesla CEO had enough evidence for the case to be decided by a jury.\n\nJury selection is now scheduled to start on Monday, April 27. The trial will start the next day and could last four weeks, through May 22, the court docket showed. The trial had previously been scheduled for March 30.\n\nIt's the latest development in a clash of the tech titans that kicked off last year when Musk sued Altman over the ChatGPT maker's partnership with Microsoft and shift toward a for-profit model. Musk, a founder and early supporter of OpenAI, claims he contributed $38 million to OpenAI over the years under the premise that it would maintain its original altruistic, nonprofit roots.\n\nOpenAI has countered that Musk knew about its pivot toward a for-profit as early as 2018 and says its nonprofit arm still plays a central role in its governance. The company has blasted the lawsuit as baseless and has characterized it as part of a larger harassment campaign by Musk.\n\nLast week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers rejected arguments by Altman's lawyers to block the case from proceeding to trial, saying Musk had sufficient evidence to justify a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" the judge said at a hearing on January 7. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nHundreds of exhibits were unsealed in the case last week, including a 2023 text that revealed tension in the two tech titans' relationship before Musk filed his suit.\n\n\"I don't think openai would have happened without you — and it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai,\" Altman texted Musk in 2023.\n\nMusk responded: \"I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake.\"",

    "description": "Boris Cherny, head of Claude Code, said that Anthropic's AI coded \"pretty much all\" of Cowork, a new tool that's been well-received among techies.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic's new working agent was largely built by Claude itself — the latest example of AI coding tools speeding up product development.\n\nOn Monday, Anthropic announced the release of Cowork, a \"more approachable\" AI tool accompanying Claude Code that's geared toward fulfilling users' requests that are unrelated to programming. Users grant the agentic AI tool access to specific files on their computer and prompt it to complete tasks.\n\nBoris Cherny, head of Claude Code, said that Anthropic's AI coded \"pretty much all\" of Cowork.\n\n\"@claudeai wrote Cowork,\" Product Manager Felix Rieseberg wrote on X. \"Us humans meet in-person to discuss foundational architectural and product decisions, but all of us devs manage anywhere between 3 to 8 Claude instances implementing features, fixing bugs, or researching potential solutions.\"\n\nAs a result, Rieseberg said the first edition of Cowork came together quickly.\n\n\"This is the product that my team has built here, we sprinted at this for the last week and a half,\" he said during a livestream with Dan Shipper.\n\nOver the holidays, Rieseberg said that Anthropic saw its customers using Claude for an increasing number of non-coding-related tasks.\n\n\"This sort of like the research preview, very early Alpha, a lot of rough edges, as you've already seen, right?\" he said.\n\nCowork is initially available to Claude Max subscribers on the Mac app.\n\nThe launch has made a splash in the tech world, with many online users praising the product and its accessibility.\n\n\"I think that's a really smart product,\" Datasette co-creator Simon Willison wrote in a blog about his experience. \"Claude Code has an enormous amount of value that hasn't yet been unlocked for a general audience, and this seems like a pragmatic approach.\"\n\n\"This is big,\" Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian wrote on X.\n\nBecause granting an AI agent access and the ability to take action on specific computer files comes with risk, Anthropic cautions that Cowork users should be careful.\n\n\"By default, the main thing to know is that Claude can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it's instructed to,\" the company said. \"Since there's always some chance that Claude might misinterpret your instructions, you should give Claude very clear guidance around things like this. \"\n\nAI companies wasted no time in launching new offerings and partnerships to kick off the new year.\n\nOn Sunday, Anthropic announced Claude for Healthcare, a major addition to its healthcare and life sciences offerings. Its release came on the heels of rival OpenAI signaling its investment in the healthcare space with ChatGPT Health.\n\nAmid AI bubble chatter and scrutiny on the increasing AI investments made by tech companies, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has argued that Anthropic has built a more sustainable business model that allowed it to make more educated bets on its future build-out. While he did not name OpenAI or CEO Sam Altman directly, he made some thinly veiled criticisms of his former company throughout the event.\n\n\"I think because we focus on enterprise, I think we have a better business model,\" Amodei said at The New York Times' Dealbook Summit. \"I think we have better margins. I think we're being responsible about it.\"\n\nGoogle, which some experts saw as overtaking OpenAI at the end of 2025, announced a major deal with Apple to have Gemini power Siri's artificial intelligence capabilities.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said Nvidia is \"simply the purest play\" for an investor to bet against the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster.\n\nNvidia is \"simply the purest play,\" Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become \"entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works,\" he continued.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to \"sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases.\"\n\n\"Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,\" Burry wrote. \"So shorting it is cheap.\"\n\nBurry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's \"pet.\"\n\nNvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBurry said that betting against Meta would mean he was \"also shorting its social media/advertising dominance,\" and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was \"shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc.\"\n\nHe added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to \"shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,\" referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel.\n\nThose Big Tech titans aren't \"pure shorts on AI\" and have staying power, Burry wrote.\n\n\"They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings,\" he said. \"But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco.\n\nBurry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months.\n\n\"I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making,\" he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and \"ego\" might be the driver.\n\nBurry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHe wrote on Substack that \"technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less.\"\n\nThat echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns.\n\nBurry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to \"have the exposure on the right side when the music stops.\"\n\nBurry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity.\n\nHe pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required \"massive upfront capital outlays,\" technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and \"cutthroat price warfare\" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals.\n\n\"What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI \"might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability,\" but could ultimately prove \"more dangerous than anything.\"\n\nHe also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly.\n\n\"I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup,\" Burry said.",

    "description": "Geopolitics and economic shifts are some of the \"unsettling\" factors that could hit the AI trade in 2026, Mohamed El-Erian said.",
    "fullText": "AI-driven market mania will hit a roadblock this year, Mohamed El-Erian says.\n\nThe top economist and former co-CIO at PIMCO sees trouble ahead for the AI trade. While artificial intelligence powered the market to fresh records in 2025, that rally is likely to stumble this year thanks to \"unsettling\" structural changes in markets and the economy, he said in a recent op-ed for Project Syndicate.\n\nThe former bond trader advised investors to shift their strategy in the coming year, focusing more on fundamentals and identifying firms able to use AI in \"practical applications.\"\n\n\"As we move further into 2026, the AI narrative is unlikely to prove strong enough to continue overshadowing other lingering uncertainties, many of which reflect deeper structural shifts,\" El-Erian wrote on Monday. \"For investors, the standard playbook will need to change. Riding a broad structural wave is no longer such an obvious and rewarding strategy.\"\n\nHe pointed to a few trends he believed could rattle the AI trade this year:\n\nThe US economy is seeing a \"'K-shaped' divergence,\" El-Erian said, referring to an economic model where the gap between high-income and low-income Americans widens.\n\nThat has a troubling implication for economic growth, El-Erian suggested. Speaking at Yahoo Finance's Invest Conference last year, he said that he believed lower-income consumers were already \"near recession,\" pointing to pressures like elevated inflation, rising layoffs, and high consumer debt levels.\n\n\"If the lower household incomes stop spending, not because they don't want to spend, but they're not able to spend — that will contaminate upwards for the economy as a whole,\" he said at the time.\"\n\nInternational conflict is another issue that could hurt the appetite for AI among investors, El-Erian said. He pointed to rising tensions between the US and Venezuela after the US raided the country and captured its president earlier this month, which sparked fresh market volatility.\n\n\"Wherever you look, the traditional factors underlying economic and commercial activity are likely to be increasingly sidelined by national-security concerns, geopolitics, and domestic political machinations,\" he wrote. If 2025 was about ignoring the market spillovers of domestic and international politics, 2026 will be about navigating them.\"\n\nFears that the market may have run ahead of itself when pricing in the benefits from AI are another limiting factor on the rally, El-Erian suggested.\n\n\"The animal spirits that drove indiscriminate, massive financing last year will increasingly be tamed by bubble fears that force investors to be more selective,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance! last year, El-Erian described AI as a \"rational bubble,\" which he said could result in painful losses for investors down the line.\n\nEl-Erian, who was vocal about the risks of a recession and a potential stock market crash as interest rates were rising, has struck a milder but still-cautious tone more recently. Lately, he's held off on making concrete recession or stock calls, but has warned of a slew of signals that worry him in financial markets.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon defended the bank's significant spending, especially on AI and tech, during its Tuesday morning earnings call, noting that he's not only competing with other banking behemoths, but also fintech companies.\n\n\"We are going to stay out front, so help us God,\" Dimon said about the expenditures, capping off a somewhat fiery response to a question on the bank's spending from Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo. He said that the firm's not only competing against its traditional Wall Street rivals, but also fintechs like Stripe, SoFi, and Revolut, which \"are good players.\"\n\nHe added, \"We're not going to try to meet some expense target, and then 10 years from now, you'd be asking us a question, how did JPMorgan get left behind?\"\n\nIn its fourth-quarter earnings presentation, JPMorgan projected spending around $9.7 billion \n\nDimon didn't give specifics on the upcoming AI spending — he said that he's already \"been quite blunt,\" but wouldn't provide information that risk putting him at \"a competitive disadvantage\" — but said he sees huge opportunities, including in AI. While he acknowledged concerns about big spending, he said that it's the right thing to do to grow the company.\n\n\"Part of it is to trust me, I'm sorry,\" Dimon said on the anticipated returns.\n\nThe CEO said that the bank will be spending more on AI, \"but it is not a big driver\" of increased expenditures. The technology will, however, likely drive future efficiency, he said.\n\nDimon said that the bank is investing across initiatives, but that tech spending can be harder to measure or evaluate.\n\n\"We need to have the best tech in the world,\" he continued. \"That drives investment, it drives margin, it drives competition.\"\n\nLast week, JPMorgan announced plans to discontinue its use of external proxy advisors for shareholder voting in the US. In place of external human advisors, the firm is launching an in-house AI platform, called Proxy IQ, to support shareholder decisions, according to the memo.\n\nJPMorgan has implemented training programs and internal courses to teach tens of thousands of employees how to use AI tools effectively in their day-to-day work, executives have previously said.\n\nThe bank's top officials have said that junior staffers are likely to get their first experiences in management by overseeing the activities of agentic bots.\n\nArtificial intelligence specialists and technologists are among Wall Street's most sought-after minds, pitting banks against hedge funds and Big Tech in a race to claim the top talent in the space.\n\nExperts have told Business Insider in recent days to expect 2026 to be a landmark year for AI in banking, as its adoption becomes more widespread and roles experience material changes.",

Some examples:\n\nRepo context: cubic now automatically reads READMEs, contributing guides, and context files in your repo to understand how things are supposed to work before it comments\n\nLive documentation: cubic smartly reads the correct docs for the lib version you’re using\n\nBetter tooling: improved the tools cubic has access to crawl and fetch the relevant code and files it needs\n\nFiltering: all of this context feeds into filtering out bad flags before they get posted\n\nPRs are iterative. You push, get feedback, fix something, push again. Before, cubic would re-clone and re-analyze everything each time.\n\nNow we cache codebases for a short window. Back-to-back pushes on the same repo skip the clone step entirely. This made reviews a lot faster, especially on bigger repos.\n\nWe compared cubic against other AI code review tools on repos running both.\n\nOn repos running both cubic and CodeRabbit, cubic flags 50% more unique issues that users end up addressing. These are all bugs that users fix that CodeRabbit did not flag at all.\n\nAdditionally, 80% of comments that CodeRabbit posts that cubic doesn't end up not getting addressed by the user.\n\nOn repos running both cubic and Cursor, cubic flags 2x more unique issues that users end up addressing. These are all bugs that users fix that Cursor did not flag at all.\n\nThe data shows cubic catches more of what matters.",

    "description": "KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upgraded Intel to Overweight from Sector Weight.",
    "fullText": "Intel (INTC) stock climbed more than 5% Tuesday as investment firm KeyBanc upgraded shares to Overweight from Sector Weight, citing the chipmaker’s advances in its manufacturing business and demand for its chips from AI data centers.\n\nAnalyst John Vinh said in a note to clients Tuesday that Big Tech’s demand for chips and servers to power AI is leading to higher sales of Intel’s CPUs — central processing units, or more traditional computer chips used alongside AI chips such as Nvidia's (NVDA) GPUs to train and run artificial intelligence models. Vinh said his supply chain checks show Intel is “almost sold out for the year” in data center server CPUs and may raise prices on the chips.\n\nVinh also cited “significant progress\" in Intel's manufacturing business.\n\nIntel has worked to revive its manufacturing arm, Intel Foundry Services (IFS), just as its chips have lost ground to AMD (AMD) and Arm (ARM). The company has fallen into a vicious cycle: Manufacturing stumbles hurt the competitiveness of its chips, and softer chip sales left its factories underutilized, which only made the manufacturing turnaround harder. Early reported tests of Intel's latest manufacturing process, 18A, by Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO) failed to result in major deals for Intel.\n\nBut a new CEO, investments from the US government and Nvidia, and the so-far successful launch of PC chips made with 18A have buoyed investor confidence in Intel’s ability to right the ship.\n\nIn what would be a major boost for IFS, Vinh said his supply chain checks in Asia indicate that Intel has signed Apple (AAPL) as a customer to use its next-generation manufacturing 18A-P process to make low-end PC chips for its Macs and iPads. In semiconductor terms, Intel's recently launched 18A process node represents the latest generation of its chip fabrication technology, and 18A-P is an advanced, upcoming version of that node.\n\nThe potential Apple deal was first predicted by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in late November, sending Intel shares soaring. Vinh called the rumored partnership Intel’s “first big whale design win.”\n\nThe KeyBanc analyst also said he believes the two tech firms are in discussions for Apple to use Intel’s upcoming process, 14A, to make low-end chips for iPhones in 2029.\n\nIntel and Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment on the possible deals.\n\nMeanwhile, Vinh said 18A’s improving yield — the percentage of chips that a manufacturer produces from a silicon wafer that function correctly — is “enough to convince us it could credibly be the #2 foundry supplier in the industry ahead of Samsung.” The chip manufacturing industry has just three large-scale players: the leading, Taiwan-based TSMC (TSM), Korea’s Samsung (005930.KS), and US-based Intel.",

    "description": "The pandemic gave workers increased options as home offices became the norm in some fields. Now, with the EU experiencing industrial slowdown and AI automation, workers are growing increasingly wary of switching jobs.",
    "fullText": "For a short time during the panndemic, workers across Europe enjoyed rare leverage over their employers. Generous furlough and reduced working-hour programs such as Germany's Kurzarbeit helped companies offset staffing costs. Offices became optional thanks to remote work.\n\nHeadlines about the so-called Great Resignation reflected a global labor shortage that sharply increased demand for talent. Workplace burnout gave rise to another new phrase, \"quiet quitting,\" as employees rejected overdelivering in pursuit of a healthier work-life balance.\n\nResearch by McKinsey, a New York-based consulting firm, in 2022 found that a third of European workers were considering quitting their jobs within three to six months, which Angelika Reich, leadership adviser at the executive recruitment firm Spencer Stuart, told DW was a \"striking figure for a region with a traditionally low [staff] turnover.\"\n\nWith the continent's industrial sector now under pressure, wage growth slowing and the threat of artificial intelligence (AI) replacing human work, that moment has quickly passed.\n\nReich noted how Europe's labor market has \"cooled down\" and how \"fewer job vacancies and a tougher economic climate naturally make employees more cautious about switching jobs.\"\n\nDespite remaining resilient, the 21-member eurozone's labor market is projected to grow more slowly this year, at 0.6% compared with 0.7% in 2025, according to the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nAlthough that drop seems tiny, each 0.1 percentage point difference amounts to about 163,000 fewer new jobs being created. Just three years ago, the eurozone created some 2.76 million new jobs while growing at a robust rate of 1.7%.\n\nMigration has also played a major role in shaping Europe's labor supply, helping to ease acute worker shortages and support job growth in many countries. However, net migration is now stabilizing or falling.\n\nIn Germany, more than one in three companies plans to cut jobs this year, according to the Cologne-based IW economic think tank.\n\nThe Bank of France expects French unemployment to climb to 7.8%, while in the UK, two-thirds of economists questioned by The Times newspaper think unemployment could rise to as high as 5.5% from the current 5.1%.\n\nUnemployment in Poland, the European Union's growing economic powerhouse, is edging higher, reaching 5.6% in November compared to 5% a year earlier. Romania and the Czech Republic are also seeing similar upticks in joblessness.\n\nThe softening of the labor market has prompted new terms like the Great Hesitation, where companies think twice about hiring and workers are cautious about quitting stressful jobs, and Career Cushioning, quietly preparing a backup plan in case of layoffs.\n\nAcross Europe, however, the overall picture remains far from bleak. Spain, which is benefitting from a post-COVID tourism boom, is set for another bumper year of jobs growth, along with Luxembourg, Ireland, Croatia, Portugal and Greece, according to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, an official EU agency. Even in countries experiencing weaker growth, pockets of strong worker demand remain.\n\n\"What felt like a widespread scarcity of workers during the Great Resignation has become more sector-specific,\" Julian Stahl, labor market expert for the online recruiter XING, told DW. \"There are still serious shortages in retail, health care, logistics, engineering and other highly specialized roles.\"\n\nGermany's industrial base has borne the brunt of the job losses in recent months, particularly in the automotive, machinery, metals and textiles sectors. High energy costs, weak export demand and fierce competition from China have erased more than 120,000 positions, government data show.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThose same pressures are hitting manufacturers in France, Italy and Poland just as hard, pushing the eurozone's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) down to 48.8 in December, its lowest reading in nine months. Readings above 50.0 indicate growth in activity, while those below point to contraction.\n\n\"Most firms are aiming to hold the line or shrink slightly rather than grow,\" said Stahl, adding that hiring hasn't \"stopped completely.\"\n\nNegative headlines about manufacturing job cuts appear to be causing reputational damage among Europe's most treasured industries, says Bettina Schaller Bossert, president of the World Employment Confederation, a global nonprofit representing the private employment services industry and based in Brussels, Belgium.\n\n\"A lot of young graduates believe there is no future in the automotive sector. They're not interested in pursuing careers [with European carmakers] even though there are fantastic new opportunities,\" Schaller Bossert told DW.\n\nEurope has rolled out AI far more slowly than the United States and China, held back by lower investment, stricter regulation and lagging adoption. But that hasn't eased employee anxiety that automation will quickly replace humans at work, especially after negative predictions of millions of job losses ahead.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nA study by consulting giant EY published in July found that a quarter of Europe's workers fear AI could put their own jobs at risk, while 74% believe firms will need a smaller headcount as a result of the technology.\n\nIn November, the Nuremberg-based Institute for Employment Research (IAB) projected that 1.6 million jobs in Germany alone could be reshaped by or lost to AI by 2040. The agency of the German labor office foresees that high-skilled positions will be disproportionately hit, although the tech sector could create around 110,000 new jobs.\n\nEnzo Webe, head of the IAB's forecasting department, said in the report AI would lead to a \"transformation\" of the labor market, but \"not less work.\"\n\nOther predictions range from the emergence of a so-called AI precariat —  entire populations that are not just jobless or underemployed, but have lost their purpose, identity and social belonging — to more optimistic views that argue AI will redistribute work, not eliminate whole professions.\n\n\"A lot of drudge tasks can be pushed to AI to free up human labor,\" John Springford, a labor market expert at the Centre for European Reform, told DW. \"But there's a good reason to believe that professional, knowledge work won't shrink.\"\n\nAnthony Klotz, the University College London professor who coined the term the Great Resignation, argues in his upcoming book \"Jolted\" that quitting jobs is less about long-term dissatisfaction and more about sudden moments of clarity.\n\nFor many European workers, the rapid advance of AI could become exactly that kind of jolt, a catalyst that prompts them to move preemptively, before automation reshapes their roles for them.",

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

    "title": "Novel AI Method Sharpens 3D X-ray Vision",
    "description": "An AI-powered X-ray tomography breakthrough reveals nanoscale details despite missing data and limited viewing angles.",
    "fullText": "This 3D image of an integrated circuit showing slices through its thickness was reconstructed with a new technique that incorporates artificial intelligence called the \"perception fused iterative tomography reconstruction engine.\" (Brookhaven National Laboratory)\n\nX-ray tomography is a powerful tool that enables scientists and engineers to peer inside of objects in 3D, including computer chips and advanced battery materials, without performing anything invasive. It’s the same basic method behind medical CT scans. Scientists or technicians capture X-ray images as an object is rotated, and then advanced software mathematically reconstructs the object’s 3D internal structure. But imaging fine details on the nanoscale, like features on a microchip, requires a much higher spatial resolution than a typical medical CT scan — about 10,000 times higher.\n\nThe Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science user facility at DOE’s Brookhaven National Laboratory, is able to achieve that kind of resolution with X-rays that are more than a billion times brighter than traditional CT scans.\n\nTomography only works well when these projection images can be taken from all angles. In many real-world cases, however, that’s impossible. For example, scientists can’t spin a flat computer chip around 180 degrees without blocking some of the X-rays. When parallel to the surface at high angles, fewer X-rays can penetrate the chip, limiting the viewing angles of the measurement. The missing data from this angular range produces a “blind spot,” leading the reconstruction software to produce blurry, distorted images.\n\n“We call this the ‘missing wedge’ problem,” said Hanfei Yan, lead beamline scientist at the HXN beamline and corresponding author of this work. “For decades, this problem has limited the applications of X-ray and electron tomography in many areas of science and technology.”\n\nTo solve the problem, researchers at NSLS-II have developed a new method called the perception fused iterative tomography reconstruction engine (PFITRE). This novel approach combines the physics of X-rays with the power of artificial intelligence (AI). The team trained a convolutional neural network, a type of AI model that automatically learns data patterns, with simulated data. Convolutional neural networks use convolutional layers to detect important features, such as edges, textures, or shapes, and combine these features to make predictions, like identifying what’s in an image. The AI component captures perceptual knowledge about the sample, what the team expects the solution should look like, and uses it to improve the reconstructed image based on that knowledge. Meanwhile, the physics-based model checks that the results still make sense scientifically. This process repeats several times until results from the AI and physics components converge, producing a reconstruction that is both accurate and visually clear. Their results were recently published in npj Computational Materials.\n\nThis 3D image of an integrated circuit shows slices through its thickness. The figure compares results from three datasets: one created using the full set of angles, one reconstructed with a new technique called the perception fused iterative tomography reconstruction engine (PFITRE) method, and one using today's \"gold standard\" method, fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA). (Brookhaven National Laboratory)\n\nUnlike image correction in consumer tech, like cell phone cameras, scientific imaging must preserve accuracy, not just appearance. Scientists needed to devise a method to ensure that the corrected image is still consistent with the physical model and data. To do this, NSLS-II scientists embedded the AI into an iterative solving engine, a mathematical tool that tackles complex problems by repeatedly trying improved solutions, step by step, until it gets close enough to the right answer. The embedded AI acts as a “smart” regularizer, a function that limits overcorrection, leveraging physics-based modeling to ensure that the reconstructions stay faithful to the actual X-ray measurements.\n\n“We didn’t want an AI that just makes better images. We wanted an AI that works hand-in-hand with physics, so that the results are both visually clear and scientifically trustworthy,” said Chonghang Zhao, a postdoc at HXN and lead author of this work. “That’s the power of our method — combining the sophistication of AI with the physical model to ensure fidelity.”\n\nThe AI in PFITRE is built on a type of neural network called a U-net architecture, an encoder-decoder design that is popular for general image processing. The encoder stage learns and detects essential features, such as the edges, textures, and shapes of an input image, and the decoder stage rebuilds the image using those features to restore details and correct distortions. The researchers enhanced the ability of U-net with structural modifications called residual dense blocks and dilated convolutions. These help the network capture information across multiple scales from fine textures to larger structures, making the network more suitable for handling the missing wedge problem in tomography. A model like this can’t learn on its own, though. It needs significant amounts of data to train on.\n\nReal scientific microscopy datasets are too limited for effective training in a specific AI model like PFITRE, so the team relied on synthetic data. They generated training datasets by using natural images, simulated patterns, and scanning electron microscope images of circuits as samples being imaged. To make the training as realistic as possible, they introduced a “digital twin” of the experiment and created virtual data that mimics real-world conditions. They intentionally included noise, misalignment, and other imperfections so the AI could handle physical data.\n\nWhile there is still work to be done to perfect this method, the benefits are clear. Samples that were once inaccessible due to their size or geometry can now produce informative data. A larger field of view allows more of a sample to be analyzed without falling victim to the missing wedge. This method could also prove beneficial in experiments where fewer measurements are required, enabling faster in situ studies and reducing radiation dose in sensitive samples.\n\n“This opens the door to detailed imaging of samples that couldn’t be studied before. That’s a very big step forward,” Yan said. “Whether it’s diagnosing defects in microchips or understanding why a battery degrades, PFITRE allows us to see details under conditions that were previously considered infeasible.”\n\nWhile PFITRE is a major advance, the team acknowledges room for improvement. Currently, the method processes 3D objects slice by slice. Expanding it into a full 3D approach would further enhance consistency but require more computation. Another challenge is including more artifacts, like ones from faulty pixels or sample movement, to broaden its application range. Like other AI models, it can’t fix issues that have not been “seen” before. To address this, future work will incorporate building a richer training dataset that includes many types of artifacts and developing ways for the model to learn more effectively with less training.\n\nThis new, powerful 3D image analysis method has the potential to accelerate discoveries across many fields, from developing faster, more efficient microchips to synthesis of new materials and even biomedical applications. As machine learning and synchrotron science continue to evolve together, tools like this will sharpen scientists’ view of the microscopic world to address some of society’s greatest scientific challenges.\n\nBrookhaven National Laboratory is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy.

    "description": "Computer science professor Roman Yampolskiy says investors are pouring billions into AI because they expect it to deliver \"free labor\" at scale.",
    "fullText": "The soaring valuations of AI companies aren't just a bet on better software.\n\nThey're a wager on who will control human labor in the future, according to Roman Yampolskiy, a University of Louisville computer science professor who was one of the first academics to warn about AI's risks.\n\nAs artificial intelligence moves from tools to increasingly autonomous agents, Yampolskiy said markets are pricing in a radical shift: machines providing \"free labor\" at scale.\n\n\"You go from having tools to having agents with humanlike capability that really represents free labor,\" Yampolskiy told the UK's LBC radio station in a recent interview. \"Free labor — cognitive free labor, physical labor.\"\n\nThat dynamic, he said, helps explain why investors are willing to pay lofty valuations for AI companies even before many of them have established clear business models.\n\n\"If a company valuation is a hundred billion today, it's actually a small bet on having access to that free labor,\" he told LBC.\n\nIn comments later to Business Insider, he said that \"once a model is trained and deployed, copying its capabilities across millions of tasks is mostly compute, not salaries.\"\n\nMarkets, he added, tend to underestimate how abruptly change can arrive.\n\n\"When quality crosses a usability threshold, substitution can be abrupt,\" he said. \"Wage value can collapse faster than institutions can adapt.\"\n\nYampolskiy told LBC that any job performed entirely on a computer is vulnerable to automation; he offered up programming, accounting, tax preparation, and web design as examples.\n\nWhile automation may initially remove only the most tedious tasks, entire roles could disappear over time, he said.\n\n\"In five years, we'll have capability to automate all cognitive labor and a lot of physical labor,\" he said during the interview, pointing to rapid advances in robotics.\n\nWhat makes this technological wave different, Yampolskiy told Business Insider, is that AI targets \"the general substrate of cognitive work itself,\" rather than specific tasks.\n\nPast technologies have created new jobs that require uniquely human skills; this time, he said, the frontier keeps moving.\n\n\"The new categories become automatable shortly after they appear,\" he said.\n\nHe expects adoption to be slowed by regulation, liability, and organizational inertia — but ultimately driven by competitive pressure and cost-cutting.\n\n\"Firms adopt whatever lowers costs and increases speed once reliability is good enough,\" he said.\n\nYampolskiy, who has previously said AI could leave 99% of workers jobless by 2030, joins a growing chorus of AI experts and tech leaders predicting that the technology could wipe out vast swaths of work.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist known as \"the godfather of AI,\" has said that AI could replace \"many, many jobs\" as early as 2026, while AI pioneer Stuart Russell has warned that societies may face up to 80% unemployment.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang and former Meta AI chief Yann LeCun have said AI will change jobs rather than eliminate them, while executives like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Zoom's Eric Yuan have predicted the technology could reshape work and shorten the workweek instead of erasing employment.\n\nYampolskiy sees a bigger risk. Once societies become dependent on AI as critical infrastructure, he said, slowing down may no longer be a real option.\n\n\"Dependency creates lock-in,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Once AI becomes critical infrastructure,\" he said, \"risk tolerance increases by necessity rather than choice. In that state, control failures become more likely precisely because the option to pause, audit, or roll back is no longer viable.\"",

    "description": "Our eyes can frequently play tricks on us, but scientists have discovered that some artificial intelligence can fall for the same illusions.",
    "fullText": "Our eyes can frequently play tricks on us, but scientists have discovered that some artificial intelligence can fall for the same illusions. And it is changing what we know about our brains.\n\nWhen we look up at the Moon, it seems larger when it is close to the horizon compared to when it is higher up in the sky even though its size, and the distance between the Earth and the Moon, remains much the same during the course of a night.\n\nOptical illusions such as these show that we don't always perceive reality the way we should. They are often considered to be mistakes made by our visual system. But illusions also reveal the clever shortcuts our brains use to extract the most important details of our surroundings.\n\nIn truth, our brains only accept a sip of the world around us – it would be too much to process every detail of our busy visual environments, so instead they pick out only the details we need.\n\nBut what happens when you give a synthetic mind – a machine vision system powered by artificial intelligence – an optical illusion? These systems excel at detail. They are designed to spot the patterns and the blemishes we do not. It is why they have been so effective at spotting the early signs of diseases in medical scans, for example.\n\nYet, some deep neural networks (DNNs) – the technology that underpins many of today's advanced AI algorithms – are susceptible to some of the same visual tricks  as us humans. And it is providing new insights into how our own brains work.\n\n\"Using DNNs in illusion research allows us to simulate and analyse how the brain processes information and generates illusions,\" says Eiji Watanabe, an associate professor of neurophysiology at the National Institute for Basic Biology in Japan. \"Conducting experimental manipulations on the human brain raises serious ethical concerns but no such restrictions apply to artificial models.\"\n\nAlthough there are many theories about why we perceive different optical illusions, in most cases there still isn't a decisive explanation.\n\nStudying people who don't experience optical illusions has provided some clues. In one case, a person who lost his sight as a young child and had it restored in his 40s was not tricked by illusions involving shapes, such as the famous Kanizsa square, where four strategically positioned circular fragments create illusory contours that evoke a square. He could, however, perceive illusions of motion such as the barber pole, where stripes appear to move upwards even though the pole is simply turning on a vertical axis.\n\nStudies on cases such as this seem to suggest that our ability to perceive motion is more robust to sensory deprivation compared to making sense of shapes. This could be because we learn to process motion earlier on as infants. Alternatively, the way we process shapes could simply be more plastic and primed to recognise shapes we are exposed to the most.\n\nBrain-imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have also provided insight into what parts of the brain are active when we see different illusions and how they interact. Our perception of optical illusions is subjective, however, and can differ between individuals, as illustrated by a photo of a striped dress that went viral online in 2015, where viewers couldn't agree on whether it was blue and black or white and gold. This makes it hard to study them objectively since researchers typically depend on participants describing what they see.\n\nNow, AI is offering a new way of understanding what is going on in our brains when we look at optical illusions.\n\nMany of the AI algorithms in use today – including chatbots such as ChatGPT – are powered by deep neural networks, which are models made up of artificial neurons that attempt to mimic how our brain processes information.\n\nIn recent work, Watanabe and his colleagues wanted to see whether a deep neural network could replicate what happens in our own brains when we look at illusions involving motion, such as the rotating snakes illusion. This uses a trippy pattern of colourful circles in a static image but appears to be rotating when we stare at it.\n\nWatanabe and his team used a deep neural network called PredNet, which was designed based on a leading theory about how our brains deal with visual information called predictive coding. It suggests that our visual system doesn't just passively process features in our surroundings when we look around. Instead, it first predicts what it expects to see by drawing on past experience before it processes discrepancies in the input from our eyes. This allows us to see more quickly.\n\nSimilarly, PredNet predicts future frames in a video based on knowledge it acquires from previous frames it has seen. For his experiment, Watanabe trained the AI using videos of natural landscapes captured by head-mounted cameras which were similar to what humans might see when looking around. The system was never exposed to any optical illusions. By showing it certain frames it hadn't seen, it was designed to make its prediction match the frame as closely as possible.\n\n\"After processing around a million frames, PredNet learns certain rules of the visual world,\" says Watanabe. \"It extracts and remembers the essential rules and among these, it may have also learned characteristics of moving objects.\"\n\nWatanabe then presented the AI model with a few variations of the rotating snakes illusion and an altered version that human brains are not fooled by, and so perceive as static. He found that the AI was tricked by the same images as humans. Watanabe thinks it supports the theory that our brains use predictive coding. In this case there are aspects of the images that are indicative of moving objects that trigger our brain's prediction system into assuming the multicoloured snakes are in motion.\n\n\"I think PredNet's perception is similar to human perception,\" he says.\n\nHowever, Watanabe and his team also found differences between how the AI and humans perceive the illusion. When we fix our gaze on one of the rotating circles, for example, it seems to stop turning whereas the other discs in our peripheral vision continue to spin. PredNet, however, always perceives all the circles moving at the same time.\n\n\"This is likely because PredNet lacks an attention mechanism,\" says Watanabe. This means it is unable to focus on a specific spot on the image, but processes it in its entirety.\n\nAlthough AI systems and robots may be able to mimic certain aspects of our visual system, they are still far off from being able to see the world as we do. So far, there is no deep neural network that can experience all the illusions that humans do, says Watanabe.\n\nIn some ways this shouldn't surprise us.\n\n\"ChatGPT, for example, might seem to converse like a human but its underlying DNN functions very differently from the human brain,\" says Watanabe. \"The key similarity is that both systems use [some type of] neurons but how they are structured and applied can be vastly different.\"\n\n• What puzzles reveal about our own minds\n\n• We built a nasty game to test AI's ability to apologise\n\n• What happens when an AI takes an inkblot test?\n\nSome researchers are trying to combine AI with the weirdness of quantum mechanics to better simulate how humans perceive certain illusions.\n\nPreviously, researchers have used concepts from quantum mechanics to explain our perception of the Necker cube, a famous ambiguous figure illusion where a cube appears to randomly switch between two different orientations.\n\nClassical theories of physics would predict that the cube should be perceived in one way or another. But in quantum mechanics, the cube could be in two states at once until our brain chose to perceive one. Think of the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat trapped in a box with a mechanism that could kill it is both dead and alive until someone looks inside.\n\nInspired by this work, Ivan Maksymov, a research fellow at Charles Sturt University's Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Futures Institute in Bathurst, Australia, developed a model that combined quantum physics with AI to see if it could simulate the way we perceive the Necker cube and a similar illusion called Rubin vase, where we see either a vase or two faces in profile. He designed a deep neural network that processes information using a phenomenon called quantum tunnelling. The system was then trained to recognise the two illusions.\n\nWhen one of the illusions was input into the system, it would generate one of the two interpretations. Maksymov found that the AI would regularly switch between each of them over time – much as humans do. The time intervals of these switches were similar too.\n\n\"It's quite close to what people see in tests,\" he says.\n\nMaksymov doesn't think this suggests that our brain has quantum properties, although it is an active field of research. Instead, he thinks that it shows that certain aspects of human thought, such as how we make decisions, can be better modelled by using quantum theory, the basis of a field called quantum cognition. With the illusions, our brain is choosing one version or the other, for example.\n\nSuch a system could also be used to simulate how our visual perception may change in space under different gravitational conditions. Researchers have previously studied how astronauts who have spent time on the International Space Station (ISS) experience changes in the way they see optical illusions.\n\nThey found that astronauts will see illusions such as the Necker Cube more often in one of its two perspectives when on Earth. But after three months in orbit, they saw each one perspective equally as often. Scientists believe this may occur because some of how we judge depth relies upon gravity. When free-floating in orbit, an astronaut cannot estimate distance based on how high their eyes are from the ground when sitting or standing upright.\n\n\"While it's a narrow field of research, it's quite important because humans want to go to space,\" says Maksymov.\n\nAnd with all the wonders the Universe holds, those space travellers will definitely want to know they can believe their eyes.\n\nFor more technology news and insights, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "fullText": "Saving for retirement is pointless thanks to the impending “supersonic tsunami” of AI and robotics, which will bring about a world of zero scarcity, according to Elon Musk.\n\nWhile the Tesla and SpaceX CEO admitted he’s “more optimistic” than most, he insisted people shouldn’t stress over building a nest egg for the distant future, contrary to the staid advice of nearly all other financial professionals.\n\n“Don’t worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,” said the world’s richest man on the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast last week. “It won’t matter.”\n\nPart of Musk’s controversial take lies in his vision of a world transformed by rapidly improving AI, robotics, and energy technology.\n\n“Anything short of shaping atoms, AI can do probably half or more of those jobs right now,” he said.\n\nThe advances could lead to such big productivity increases, he said, that they will surpass “what people possibly could think of as abundance.”\n\nRather than a universal income, everyone will enjoy a “universal ‘you can have whatever you want’ income” in the future, he claimed. In this world, the link between individual wages, savings, and living standards no longer makes sense.\n\nEven without savings, AI will help people obtain better medical care than currently available within five years, as well as remove any limit on the availability of goods, services, or educational opportunities.\n\n​Musk’s comments build on his earlier claims that AI and humanoid robots will make work “optional” within 10 to 20 years and render money itself irrelevant. Musk previously compared the future of work to leisure activities like playing sports or video games rather than a survival necessity.\n\n“If you want to work, [it’s] the same way you can go to the store and just buy some vegetables, or you can grow vegetables in your backyard. It’s much harder to grow vegetables in your backyard, and some people still do it because they like growing vegetables,” Musk said during the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in November.\n\n​To be sure, Musk’s predictions about the future come at a time where many Americans are struggling to save. In part due to persistent inflation and weak wage growth, only 55% of American adults said they had a “rainy day” fund of three months expenses saved up for an emergency, down from a high of 59% in 2021, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve. Fewer than half of those surveyed said they could cover an expense of $2,000 or more with their savings.",

    "fullText": "Pioneering computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” said artificial intelligence will spark a surge in unemployment and profits.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times last year, the former Google scientist cleared the air about why he left the tech giant, raised alarms on potential threats from AI, and revealed how he uses the technology. But he also predicted who the winners and losers will be.\n\n“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said in September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”\n\nThat echoed comments he gave to Fortune in August 2025, when he said AI companies are more concerned with short-term profits than the long-term consequences of the technology.\n\nLayoffs haven’t spiked, but evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level where recent college graduates start their careers.\n\nA survey from the New York Fed at the time found that companies using AI were much more likely to retrain their employees than fire them, though layoffs are expected to rise in the coming months.\n\nHinton said earlier healthcare is the one industry that will be safe from the potential jobs armageddon.\n\n“If you could make doctors five times as efficient, we could all have five times as much health care for the same price,” he explained on the Diary of a CEO YouTube series in June 2025. “There’s almost no limit to how much health care people can absorb—[patients] always want more health care if there’s no cost to it.”\n\nStill, Hinton believes jobs that perform mundane tasks will be taken over by AI, while sparing some jobs that require a high level of skill.\n\nIn his interview with the FT, he also dismissed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s idea to pay a universal basic income as AI disrupts the economy and reduces demand for workers, saying it “won’t deal with human dignity” and the value people derive from having jobs.\n\nHinton has long warned about the dangers of AI without guardrails, estimating a 10% to 20% chance of the technology wiping out humans after the development of superintelligence.\n\nIn his view, the dangers of AI fall into two categories: the risk the technology itself poses to the future of humanity, and the consequences of AI being manipulated by people with bad intent.",

    "fullText": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Monday that the company is launching a new \"top-level\" initiative called Meta Compute, as it pours more money into the data centers and infrastructure powering its AI push.\n\nZuckerberg said Meta plans to build \"tens of gigawatts\" of capacity this decade and \"hundreds of gigawatts or more\" over time.\n\n\"How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe move signals that Zuckerberg views AI infrastructure as a key competitive advantage and is placing it under a dedicated unit that reports directly to him. Meta has said it plans to invest $600 billion in US infrastructure and jobs, including AI data centers, by 2028.\n\nThe Department of Energy provides a few handy comparisons for the amount of power in one gigawatt: It's roughly half the output of the Hoover Dam, or the power of 2,627 Tesla Model 3s. Famously, the DeLorean, the iconic time machine in \"Back To The Future Part II,\" needed 1.21 gigawatts to travel through time.\n\nSantosh Janardhan, the company's head of infrastructure, and Daniel Gross, who joined Meta last year from AI startup Safe Superintelligence, will lead the new Meta Compute initiative.\n\nThe two executives will work closely with Dina Powell McCormick, Meta's newly appointed president and vice chairperson, who will focus on partnering with governments and sovereign entities to help build and finance infrastructure.

    "description": "Cloudflare data shows the top AI labs are strip-mining the web, and it's getting worse not better.",
    "fullText": "Are AI giants nurturing the web, the most valuable store of human data the world will ever see? Or are they scraping content for free and giving little back? Updated data from Cloudflare sheds new light on this important question.\n\nThis is one of the most under-discussed parts of the AI revolution. While tech companies spend lavishly on data centers, GPUs, and talent, they avoid talking about the other key ingredient of AI success: data.\n\nThat's because they don't want to pay for the high-quality human data that's needed for AI model training, inference, and AI outputs. Instead, they send out bots to crawl websites and scoop up this information, mostly for free.\n\nIn the past, tech companies would send users to the original sources of this information. This formed the grand bargain of the web. Sites would let their data be taken for free on the understanding that they would get referrals in return, and could pay for their efforts through advertising, subscriptions, and other techniques.\n\nIn the new generative AI world, this deal is breaking down. Now, AI answer engines and chatbots give users direct answers, making people less likely to visit the websites that created and verified the data in the first place.\n\nCloudflare, which helps run about 20% of the world's websites, began tracking this behavior in 2025. It measures Big Tech company bots' requests to crawl websites, and the number of referrals the platforms send to sites.\n\nThis crawl-to-refer ratio is a useful guide to how much tech companies are taking from the web and how much they're giving back. For example, a ratio of 100 to 1 would mean a company's bots crawled sites 100 times for every 1 referral they send.\n\nIs this one way to measure how ethical companies are in the AI era? I'll leave you to decide. Here's the data for the first week in January.\n\nAs you can see, Anthropic stands out like a sore thumb. According to Cloudflare data, it crawls sites way more than it sends users out to the web. Anthropic actually crawled even \n\nThe same applies to OpenAI; its crawl-to-refer ratio has worsened. Again, this suggests that OpenAI is taking more value from the web and giving less value back.\n\nThis aligns with Business Insider reporting from late 2024. Back then, we told you that bots from Anthropic and OpenAI, especially, were crawling some websites so much that it was causing their traffic costs to spike dramatically.\n\nOne web developer saw a client's cloud-computing costs double within a few months due to this AI bot swarm, according to BI reporting.\n\nSo, not only are AI companies taking from the web and giving less back — they are also leaving some site owners with bigger bills to pay.\n\nLike last quarter, I asked Anthropic why it crawls so much and gives so little back to the web. The startup did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nBack in September, Anthropic said it couldn't confirm the crawl-to-refer ratios calculated by Cloudflare and said there may be \"issues\" with the methodology. At that time, Anthropic also noted that it launched a web search feature for its popular Claude AI chatbot earlier this year. This was generating more referral traffic for websites now, and this is growing quickly, the startup said back then.\n\nOpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nA caveat: The numbers that go into the crawl-to-refer ratio focus on the web and exclude native app activity. If app activity were included, the ratios might be lower. However, this methodology applies to all the companies included in this ranking.\n\nGoogle's relatively low ratio is likely due to its traditional search engine, which still shows clear website links in many results. However, the company is increasingly weaving in AI chatbot-style answers into its search service, via AI Overviews and AI mode.\n\nGoogle has been saying lately that it still sends traffic to the web, and it cares about the health of this ecosystem.\n\nBusiness Insider will keep tracking this Cloudflare data in the coming months and quarters to see how this behavior evolves.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Apple’s AI Siri is planned for this year, and it'll use Google Gemini.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly two years since Apple announced a more intelligent Siri, and yet, we're still waiting to get our hands on it. Aside from being able to answer a few questions about Apple products or shunt your questions off to ChatGPT for you, the voice assistant is essentially still the same it was before Apple Intelligence launched for other Apple features in iOS 18.1. Now, the iPhone maker seems to be throwing in the towel on developing an AI-enabled Siri entirely on its own, and is asking Google for help. I can't imagine Tim Cook is too happy about that, but on the flip side, that does mean an AI Siri might finally come out, and soon.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple admitted that it is now planning to use Google Gemini to power its AI-infused Siri, rather than purely in-house models. The company said that, \"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we're excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users.\"\n\nPreviously, Apple had promised that its AI Siri would be able to do tasks on your behalf, like send a drafted email, or would be able to answer questions using context pulled from your phone, like surfacing a friend's address using information pulled from a text thread. Reportedly, however, implementing these features during testing kept breaking more traditional Siri features, like setting alarms and reminders, which has kept sending Apple back to the drawing board. The new, Gemini-powered voice assistant for Android faced similar issues at first, but based on my hands-on time with the company's latest phones, those growing pains seem to have subsided, so it makes sense that Google would be the first company Apple would turn to while looking for outside help.\n\nApple hasn't said too much more about the deal for now, but Google itself did step in to offer Apple users a bit more clarity, plus some reassurance about their data.\n\nIn a statement on X, the company assured Apple users that \"Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\" That's the same deal Apple has with OpenAI right now, which allows its users to ask ChatGPT questions without the AI being able to train on them or keep a log of their requests. It essentially means Google won't get any data from your AI-powered Siri. Google's statement also confirmed a detail from CNBC's initial article, stating that its agreement with Apple will be a multi-year deal.\n\nPerhaps most exciting is that Google said the AI-powered Siri will come out \"this year,\" mirroring a statement an Apple spokesperson gave to Daring Fireball last March, admitting that an AI-enabled Siri was taking longer than anticipated and saying the company hoped to launch it in 2026. That's welcome relief to anyone who thought Apple had given up on the project.\n\nA more concrete timeline is still unknown, although Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a reputable reporter with inside sources at Apple, has previously said to expect the AI Siri upgrade to launch in the spring. Personally, I could also see the company holding the launch until its annual WWDC event, which tends to happen in June.\n\nDespite Apple and Google's public feud as the makers of iOS and Android, respectively, this wouldn't mark the two companies' first time working together, especially in the mobile space. Previously, it was uncovered that Google and Apple have a lucrative deal to make Google the default search engine in Safari, which caused a lengthy legal battle that ultimately allowed the companies to maintain their deal, but barred exclusivity contracts. Part of the reasoning behind the AI Siri delay might be that the companies wanted to work together on AI before, but were holding off on it out of an abundance of caution. However, according to the courts, Google will also be able to make deals with outside distributors for \"preloading and placement\" of its GenAI products going forward, which seemingly puts both companies in the clear.",

    "fullText": "The “more intelligent” version of Siri that Apple plans to release later this year will be backed by Google’s Gemini language models, the company announced today. CNBC reports that the deal is part of a “multi-year partnership” between Apple and Google that will allow Apple to use Google’s AI models in its own software.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” reads an Apple statement given to CNBC.\n\nToday’s announcement confirms Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting late last year that Apple and Google were nearing a deal. Apple didn’t disclose terms, but Gurman said that Apple would be paying Google “about $1 billion a year” for access to its AI models “following an extensive evaluation period.”\n\nBloomberg has also reported that the Gemini model would be run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, “ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s infrastructure,” and that Apple still hopes to improve its own in-house language models to the point that they can eventually be used instead of relying on third-party models.\n\nAlthough Apple’s iPhones and iOS compete with Google’s Android operating system and the many smartphones that use it, the companies still cooperate in plenty of other areas. Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (though that deal has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years).\n\nApple’s announcement is a blow to OpenAI and the many versions of its ChatGPT model, which Apple has used elsewhere in iOS and macOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple also tested OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude models before deciding to go with Gemini. ChatGPT came out ahead of Gemini in tests that Ars ran using earlier versions of the models, but Google’s models have apparently improved enough (and amassed enough users) to worry OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” last month and pushed back several planned ChatGPT features so that the company could better respond to Google’s Gemini 3 release.\n\nApple originally promised the improved, AI-powered Siri for 2024’s iOS 18 release, but ultimately delayed the feature because it didn’t work reliably enough. The new version of Siri should arrive in an update to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe later this year.",

Nvidia's engineers will work alongside Lilly's experts in biology, science, and medicine to generate large-scale data and build AI models to advance medicine development. The lab's work will begin early this year, the companies said.\n\nThe investment builds on Nvidia and Lilly's existing partnership. Lilly in October said it was building an AI factory with Nvidia's AI systems to speed up drug discovery timelines.\n\nLilly shares rose fractionally Monday and are up nearly 34% over the past year, surpassing the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 19% gain. The company became the first healthcare name to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization in November.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, is the most valuable company in the world, becoming the first to cross $5 trillion in 2025. The AI chipmaker's project with Lilly is the latest in a string of investments and deals spanning the AI ecosystem — some of which have raised eyebrows on Wall Street and spurred fears of an AI bubble.\n\nIn the healthcare space, Nvidia has also invested in biotech firm Recursion and has inked partnerships with other industry leaders, including Lilly rival Novo Nordisk (NVO), the Mayo Clinic, Illumina, and IQVIA, to use AI in medical research and development.\n\n“AI is transforming every industry, and its most profound impact will be in life sciences,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement Monday.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

    "description": "Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo, said rates could move higher as a surge in bond issuance pulls investors from the Treasury market.",
    "fullText": "A top economist has a fresh warning about debt-fueled capex spending in 2026.\n\nTorsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, flagged expectations that AI hyperscalers will be significant drivers of investment-grade bond issuance this year. In his view, the flood of new bonds into the market as tech companies look to fund their data centers and other infrastructure is bound to put upward pressure on interest rates.\n\nThe issue is that more corporate debt issuance could drag buyers away from other bond markets.\n\n\"The significant increase in hyperscaler issuance raises questions about who will be the marginal buyer of IG paper,\" he wrote. \"Will it come from Treasury purchases and hence put upward pressure on the level of rates? Or might it come from mortgage purchases, putting upward pressure on mortgage spreads?\"\n\nThe economist noted that Wall Street banks can't agree on just how high the borrowing wave will go in 2026, but they all forecast issuance to be high, with analysts eyeing $1.6 trillion to $2.25 trillion of investment-grade bond sales this year.\n\nHowever, for Sløk, the main takeaway is that heavy corporate borrowing could ultimately drive interest rates higher more broadly.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the volume of fixed-income products coming to market this year is significant and is likely to put upward pressure on rates and credit spreads as we go through 2026.\"\n\nSløk said investors should be assessing how the AI buildout, specifically the construction of more data centers and other infrastructure, will be paid for.\n\nCompanies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle collectively issued $100 billion of bonds in 2025. According to Bank of America, that's more than double the amount they raised in the previous year.\n\nSlok isn't the only economist to raise concerns about the broader economic impact of high AI spending. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, recently said that tech borrowing eclipsed levels seen during the dot-com era, adding that if the tech sector's growth stalls, the results could be dire.",

Last week, the company overtook Apple as the second most valuable company behind Nvidia.\n\nSpeculation of a potential deal has been circulating since last year. Bloomberg reported in November that Apple was considering paying $1 billion a year to use the Gemini model.\n\n\"This is what the Street has been waiting for with the elephant in the room for Cupertino revolving around its invisible AI strategy,\" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note on Monday morning, referring to Apple's Cupertino headquarters, \"but we believe this is an incremental positive to both AAPL and GOOGL as a major validation moment for Google as a premier foundation model and for Apple as a stepping stone to accelerate its AI strategy into 2026 and beyond.\"\n\nApple had a head start in the AI assistant race when it launched Siri on its iOS devices in 2011.\n\nHowever, the iPhone maker has lagged behind the competition following the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Apple has delayed several upgrades to Siri, and Apple shook up its AI division late last year.\n\nFor Google, integration with the leading mobile phone platform in the US is yet another distribution advantage. In addition to being available via a stand-alone app, Gemini powers some Google search features, and it's also the default AI assistant on the company's Pixel smartphones.\n\nThomas Hudson, a VP principal analyst at the research firm Forrester, told Business Insider that the deal could \"look counterintuitive\" given Apple and Google compete in the smartphone market.\n\nHowever, he pointed to Google's long-running deal to make it the default search engine on Apple's iPhones as an example of how the pair have partnered before. In December, a federal judge ordered Google to limit search and AI app contracts to a one-year term.",

    "fullText": "Media bosses expect web referrals to plunge and want journalists to emulate content creators, report finds\n\nMedia companies expect web traffic to their sites from online searches to plummet over the next three years, as AI summaries and chatbots change the way consumers use the internet.\n\nAn overwhelming majority are also planning to encourage their journalists to behave more like YouTube and TikTok content creators this year, as short-form video and audio content continues to boom.\n\nThe findings are drawn from a new report from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which included the views of 280 media leaders from 51 countries. It found media executives around the world fear search engine referrals will fall by 43% over three years.\n\nSearch traffic to news sites has already plunged by a third in a single year globally, with the rise of AI overviews and chatbots, as well as changes to the search algorithms that have been the lifeblood of some media companies since the rise of the internet.\n\nGoogle search is down 33% globally, according to new data for more than 2,500 news sites sourced by Chartbeat. The figure is even higher for the US.\n\nLifestyle, celebrity and travel content is being much more heavily affected than current affairs and news outlets so far. Publications carrying out live reporting and current affairs are more protected from AI summaries.\n\nGoogle’s AI Overviews already appear at the top of about 10% of search results in the US, according to the report, and are rapidly rolling out elsewhere. Referrals to media sites from ChatGPT are growing, but the report still described these referrals as “little more than a rounding error”.\n\nNic Newman, senior research associate at the institute, said the “traffic era” for online publishers, which had sustained them since the advent of the internet, was coming to an end.\n\n“It is not clear what comes next,” he said. “Publishers fear that AI chatbots are creating a new convenient way of accessing information that could leave news brands – and journalists – out in the cold.\n\n“But tech platforms do not hold all the cards. Reliable news, expert analysis and points of view remain important both to individuals and to society, particularly in uncertain times. Great storytelling – and a human touch – is going to be hard for AI to replicate.”\n\nThere has already been a swing away from simply trying to score big hits through web traffic – with fewer people clicking on a link to a story. Instead, more companies have moved towards a subscription model that gives them a direct relationship with their audience.\n\nThe Reuters Institute report also revealed a scramble among media companies to invest in digital platforms like YouTube and TikTok as short-form video use continues to grow. Many also want to encourage their journalists to embrace the content creator culture that the platforms have popularised.\n\nThree-quarters of media managers surveyed said they will be trying to get their staff to behave more like creators in 2026. Half are planning to partner with creators to help distribute their content.\n\nDowning Street is also trying to tap into social media as Keir Starmer attempts to find ways of reaching Gen Z and bypass the traditional media.\n\nThe campaigner Anna Whitehouse, who goes by Mother Pukka, and the personal finance influencers Cameron Smith and Abi Foster have all been given access to senior ministers in recent months.",

We introduce a novel cold-start probability analysis method that provides insights into model behavior without requiring explicit prompts. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of how different model optimization techniques - including quantization, distillation, model scaling, and task-specific fine-tuning - affect token-level representations and code generation quality.

    "fullText": "Michael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short,\" says the era of Big Tech turning relatively small investments into huge profits is ending.\n\nIn a recent Substack exchange with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Burry said the most important metric AI industry investors should be watching isn't revenue growth, hiring, or even market size, but return on invested capital, or ROIC.\n\nROIC is a measure of how efficiently a company turns the money it puts into its business into profit.\n\n\"The measure to beat all measures is return on invested capital (ROIC), and ROIC was very high at these software companies. Now that they are becoming capital-intensive hardware companies, ROIC is sure to fall, and this will pressure shares in the long run,\" Burry wrote.\n\nAI, Burry said, is pushing companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta away from their historically asset-light software models and toward a far more capital-intensive future defined by data centers, chips, and energy.\n\nEven if AI expands Big Tech's addressable market, he said, falling ROIC could pressure stock prices for years to come.\n\nBurry rose to fame after his bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled in \"The Big Short.\" Outside the occasional cryptic social media post, Burry, for a long time, spoke publicly only rarely.\n\nThat changed late last year when he closed his hedge fund to outside cash and began writing financial analysis on Substack.\n\nPerhaps most notably, he has recently compared the AI boom to the late-1990s dot-com bubble, calling OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time.\" Netscape's IPO marked the beginning of dot-com hype in 1995. Five years later, the bubble burst.\n\nBurry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, has made large bets against Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, two darlings of the AI era, according to a regulatory filing released in September last year.\n\nLeading AI companies, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta, are spending big to build out the infrastructure they need to support their energy- and data-intensive chatbots and other AI applications. Debt and equity investors have lined up to back these projects.\n\nSo far, however, those companies have not shown significant profit returns on their AI products, leading investors like Burry to sound the alarm that AI is a bubble on the verge of bursting.\n\nAgreed. And still, return on investment will continue to fall, almost all AI companies will go bankrupt, and much of the AI spending will be written off. Will it be the Panic of 2026? 2027? Does not have to be. https://t.co/VBWjh26vnc\n\n\"At some point, this spending on the AI buildout has to have a return on investment higher than the cost of that investment, or there is just no economic value added,\" Burry wrote in the Substack post.",

The term has since gained traction among developers worldwide and was named Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025.\n\nLess than a year after his post, Karpathy wrote that he had \"never felt this much behind as a programmer.\"\n\nWe asked developers: When it comes to vibe-coding, do you feel ahead, behind, or like you're keeping pace?\n\n167 software engineers responded to our survey. The biggest cohort — 75 engineers, or 46.9% — said that they were \"keeping up.\" 30 engineers said they felt ahead of the curve, while 27 felt behind.\n\n28 engineers (or 17.5% of respondents) said that they were opting out of using AI code editing tools entirely. These engineers wrote that the tools weren't advanced enough, or that they took too long to learn how to use. None of the 28 agreed to speak on the record after Business Insider reached out.\n\nWhile the survey isn't scientific, the results offer insight into how software engineers are feeling about their rapidly changing industry.\n\nIn follow-up conversations, eight engineers told Business Insider how they feel about AI code editors. All found them helpful in some form, though their usages ranged from one-off tools to lifesavers.\n\nRyan Shah sometimes wonders: \"Did I really need to learn how to write code?\"\n\nThe 23-year-old AI consultant from Atlanta recently graduated with a degree in computer information technology. Now he uses Cursor and Google's Antigravity, paired with Claude Opus 4.5, which he said was at \"midlevel engineer status.\"\n\nShah said he doesn't regret his software engineering courses, though. They taught him to \"read\" code, he said, a skill that, coupled with his vibe-coding proficiencies, keeps him from being \"the first one laid off.\"\n\nJavanie Campbell swung the other way: He warned that over-reliance on vibe-coding tools will put your career in danger.\n\n\"For people who turn to the LLM as the God or the expert, they will be replaced,\" said the 35-year-old CEO of DevDaysAtWork, who is based in Jamaica.\n\nAmong software engineers, there's a debate brewing: Just how bad will the effects of AI code editors be on jobs? Some say they will shrink the industry's workforce; others call them tools, not replacements for engineers.\n\nThe first time Ryan Clinton tried vibe-coding, he got scared for his job. He's not fearful anymore, he said.\n\nClinton's engineering level won't be affected, said the 46-year-old software developer from Nashville. More experienced engineers work on \"architecture and design,\" he said, while more junior staffers code. At this point of AI coding, human intervention is also still routinely necessary.\n\n\"You want to make sure it makes sense,\" he said. \"Only an idiot would randomly click 'yes' and commit it.\"\n\nBarry Fruitman is more worried — but not for himself. At 56, the Android developer from Toronto doesn't think the job market will feel the effect until five to 10 years out.\n\n\"Today, I think the threat is overstated, and hopefully it will stay that way until I retire,\" he said.\n\nEd Gaile said AI tools have doubled, if not tripled, his productivity.\n\nThe 55-year-old Appfire principal solutions architect from Atlanta was impressed by the decrease in context switching that vibe-coding tools brought.\n\n\"I wish I had this 15 years ago,\" he said.\n\nFor AI code editors, the word \"productivity\" still looms large. Many people feel that they're saving time by using these tools. Others cite the additional time spent reviewing and correcting lines of code.\n\nA July METR study added fuel to the fire.\n\nThe study asked experienced developers to complete a series of tasks. Study participants working without AI's help spent 10% more time coding — but those with AI assistance spent 20% more time reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI, waiting on AI, or being idle. Ultimately, the study found that the AI-assisted developers were less productive.\n\nShawn Gay, a 54-year-old R&D manager from El Paso, Texas, spends time keeping up with the industry's changes. He said he felt behind the curve.\n\n\"I have decades of experience, so I feel like it's a huge effort to try to change the way my brain thinks about software,\" Gay told Business Insider.\n\nGus De Souza said that he saved time on coding, but spent more time reviewing the AI-generated code. The real productivity gains were in troubleshooting, said the 48-year-old software architect from Kitchener, Ontario.\n\nWhat even is a vibe-coder? While the term has grown to encompass most forms of AI-assisted coding, Karpathy's X post first defined it as when developers \"fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.\"\n\nLara Fraser, a data analyst and epidemiologist from Sarasota, Florida, doesn't consider herself a vibe-coder.\n\nFraser codes in R and uses tools like ChatGPT and Claude to assist. She's tried other tools, but found high rates of hallucination. The model generation also matters, Fraser said: GPT 5.1 was great, but 5.2 was a \"disaster.\"\n\nFor Fraser, vibe-coding depends on the programmer's skill. Anyone can create an app, but not everyone can maintain it.\n\n\"Inevitably, something's going to break,\" she said. \"Can you fix it? If you can't, you're a vibe-coder.\"",

    "description": "A tech CEO put together a dream board of directors with AI representing famous leaders. Here's how he uses it.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Matt Blumberg, a four-time technology CEO who now leads Markup AI, maker of an AI platform designed to help brands safely scale AI-generated content. He is based in New York City. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSince I run an AI company, I try to build AI agents and use AI as much as I can. In October, I got an idea to build what I call a fantasy board of directors from another CEO, and with his permission, I made a version of my own to use as a personal thought partner.\n\nWe have an actual human board, and it's fantastic. I get really good advice from them. But I wanted to use AI to create a fantasy board because mine is limited by the five people who are on it and the experiences that they have in life.\n\nSo the first thing my executive team and I did was create a fantasy draft. It's a bit of a play on fantasy football and fantasy basketball. But instead of it being a competitive thing, where each of us would draft our own teams, we drafted just one together.\n\nWe started by making a spreadsheet of essentially famous people, largely but not entirely, from the business world. We divided them into categories, including iconic business leaders, tech CEOs, VCs, authors, and thought leaders. We also had a category for different voices, such as Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.\n\nNext, we had something like a draft where we picked a couple of people from each category that we wanted on the board. We settled on about 15 names, including Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThere are also two people on it that I know. One is me. The other is Fred Wilson, a VC I've worked with for the past 25 years at other companies.\n\nFrom here, we had AI build 5,000-word profiles for each person, and we gave the AI a certain template to follow. We wanted the fantasy board members to be able to react to things as real board members would, with actual things they've said about how companies and boards perform.\n\nNext, we built the agent. We loaded all these profiles in and then wrote a really long instruction set about what we were trying to accomplish and what our company does. We also loaded materials from past board meetings, our quarterly business review decks, and other things that real board members would have at their disposal or in their heads.\n\nAll of this took maybe an hour or two.\n\nSo now the fantasy board exists, and I use it as a thought partner. For example, I will provide a draft of a board book before sending it to my actual board, and I'll say: These are materials for an upcoming meeting. What do you think of them? Are there topics you would have expected me to cover that I didn't? What questions am I likely to get back from our board? In return, I'll get really useful commentary.\n\nOne thing we put in the instruction set is that when I ask the board for its opinion, very generically, I want it to tell me the consensus opinion and notable outlying dissent with quotes of things that the fantasy board members have actually said.\n\nI'll also ask it for help with internal projects. I'll say things like: Hey, I'm doing a presentation for our kickoff meeting next week. What do you think are the top three themes I should hit?\n\nRecently, I asked my fantasy board to give me a performance review for 2025. It nailed it. The board called out the things that I would have said are my strengths and things that I would have said are problems. I sent the review to my executive team just as an FYI, and they all came back to me and said it was pretty impressive.\n\nI don't use the fantasy board every day, but I'm probably using it at least every other week for something. There are two big limitations. \n\nOne is that anything agentic is only as good as its inputs. My fantasy board only knows what I've told it about my business, or what's publicly available. It doesn't actually know what happens every day in the company. Even though I'm pretty good about feeding it information, it just doesn't have all the context.\n\nThe other limitation is that they're not real people. When you have a real board of directors, you have a real thought partner as a strategic advisor. If you have a board meeting, people are in a room together. They have body language. They have facial expressions. You can tell when they lean in, when they lean back. You can tell when they roll their eyes because they don't believe something you said. You can call them out on that.\n\nWith any AI agents, you need to be really careful not to believe the bullshit. They're predictive, and they're good, but not perfect. They're not human, and they miss a lot of cues.\n\nI told my real board about my fantasy board at our last meeting, which was in November, right after we built it. I explained what it was and how I've been using it. They thought it was great. A couple of them asked me afterward how I built it. They asked for a road map and said that they'd like to do something like it.\n\nThey viewed the fantasy board the same way I do, which is that it's a nice add-on, a sort of augmentation of thought partnership, but that it's never going to be a substitute for a real board.",

    "description": "McKinsey & Company CEO Bob Sternfels says he wants every employee working alongside an AI agent within a year and a half.",
    "fullText": "Here's a case interview question for you: If a 40,000-person consulting firm added 25,000 AI agents to its workforce in under two years, how would that change its competitive advantage?\n\nIt may not be long before McKinsey & Company is asking job candidates such a case question — but first, the firm is answering it for itself.\n\nThe firm's CEO, Bob Sternfels, said on an episode of Harvard Business Review's IdeaCast recently that the company is rapidly remaking itself around artificial intelligence.\n\nHe said that, according to his latest tally, the firm now has a workforce of 60,000, which he said is made up of 40,000 humans and 20,000 agents.\n\nSpeaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, he said the number of AI agents McKinsey uses is actually closer to 25,000. A McKinsey spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that this figure is the most accurate.\n\nSternfels said on the podcast that just a year and a half ago, the company only used a few thousand agents and hopes that in the next year and a half, every employee will be \"enabled by at least one or more agents.\"\n\nAI agents are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.\n\nThe rapid agent rollout at McKinsey reflects a broader industry push to embed generative AI into several facets of a consultant's daily work.\n\nFirms from Boston Consulting Group to PwC are shifting from slide decks and advisory work to multi-year AI-driven transformation projects, and adding a slate of new tools to turbocharge their efficiency.\n\nQuantumBlack, with its 1,700-person team, drives all of McKinsey's AI initiatives, which now account for 40% of the firm's work, Alex Singla, a senior partner at McKinsey who co-leads QuantumBlack, told Business Insider.\n\nAs part of that effort, Singla said the firm is seeking a more dynamic set of candidates who can move between traditional consulting work and an engineering mindset — and can work alongside AI.\n\n\"What we want to be able to do is find those people that actually have a propensity to either be this great McKinsey consultant, and/or a great technologist, and then groom them to be both,\" he said.\n\nThe same is true at Boston Consulting Group, which now has a team of \"forward-deployed consultants\" who are vibe-coding and building AI tools for client projects.\n\nSternfels said AI is reshaping more than its workforce — it is also changing McKinsey's business model.\n\nThe firm is transitioning from its traditional advisory work and classic fee-for-service approach. Instead, McKinsey is moving toward a model where it works with clients to identify joint business cases and then helps them underwrite the outcomes of that business case.",

    "title": "Competition is heating up on Wall Street. Here are 4 things to watch as they report earnings.",
    "description": "From credit risks to AI, here's what experts are watching as banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, prepare to report fourth-quarter earnings.",
    "fullText": "As Wall Street's biggest banks prepare to report fourth-quarter earnings next week, competition is intensifying across nearly every part of the business — from dealmaking and talent to technology. JPMorgan Chase kicks things off Tuesday, followed by Bank of America and Citi reporting on Wednesday, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.\n\nThat competitive pressure is shaping how investors, analysts, and executives are thinking about the coming year. In an interview, Mike Mayo, a longtime Wells Fargo analyst known for his pointed questions on earnings calls, said banks are waging the toughest fight they've faced against rivals in years to capture new business.\n\n\"The animal spirits have been unleashed,\" Mayo said, adding that competition is now \"at its most intense level since before the global financial crisis,\" with banks across the industry playing offense across sectors ranging from financial advisory to investment management to consumer banking. Even before earnings get underway, some hopeful signals are already emerging — particularly around pay.\n\nAlan Johnson, the founder of compensation consultancy Johnson Associates, said initial readouts from industry insiders at firms that have already communicated compensation are pointing to a strong year. \"Banking and trading, the big winners for bonuses this year is sort of what I'm detecting,\" Johnson said. Investment banking advisory bonuses, he added, are tracking higher than he predicted, up as much as 20% from the year prior.\n\nAs earnings season gets underway, experts say there are four key things to watch.\n\nAfter a rocky start marked by tariff worries and market volatility, dealmakers finished 2025 in the green. Worldwide M&A value rose about 45% year over year, according to LSEG data, even as the total number of deals declined slightly.\n\nIn a 2026 forecast, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expect that momentum to carry forward, projecting growth in investment banking fees and a pickup in spending by financial sponsors.\n\nMatthew Toole, LSEG's director of deals intelligence, said some private equity firms are approaching a traditional exit window for companies they bought during the pandemic, setting the stage for more sponsor-driven sales.\n\n\"Coming off of the year that we've had from an investment banking perspective — the second-largest year on record for announced M&A, the largest year on record for global debt, and also a record year for syndicated lending — I think you're going to see pretty significant growth in the investment banking fee pool,\" Toole said.\n\nThat resurgence is intensifying hiring competition. Speaking at a financials conference Goldman hosted in December, Denis Coleman, the firm's chief financial officer, acknowledged the pretty penny that it was spending to hang onto its top performers.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we're in a position to pay very competitively, particularly for our very best people,\" he said.\n\nJeanne Branthover, vice chairman of DHR International and global head of the firm's financial services and fintech practice, told Business Insider that deal momentum is translating directly into hiring pressures. \"What happens is the best talent is always going to be recruited,\" she said. \"That is always the case when a market is good.\"\n\n\"Credit is still fine, certainly we're on a cockroach alert,\" Mayo said, referencing a comment made by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in October. The collapse of subprime auto-lenders Tricolor Holdings and auto-parts company First Brands last fall raised questions about the health of the credit market, and during his firm's third-quarter earnings call, Dimon said, \"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more.\"\n\nMayo added that a major surprise at large banks would be unlikely, but cautioned that credit cycles often begin with isolated problems, particularly at midsize firms. Leaders in the private credit industry have pushed back on claims that private lending is behind rising credit stress, saying some recent high-profile bankruptcies reflect risks tied to loans originated and syndicated by banks rather than held by private lenders.\n\nStill, Mayo offered a note of caution: \"When you're bullish, this is the time when bad loans are made.\"\n\nAt Goldman Sachs, attention is trained on OneGS 3.0, the latest iteration of the company's cross-bank initiative to maximize returns across business lines.\n\nMayo pointed to Goldman Sachs 3.0 as one of the most interesting new data points this earnings season.\n\nThe program, announced last fall, is designed as a multi-year effort to boost profitability and productivity by leveraging AI. Goldman has said the initiative includes head count discipline and limited role reductions.\n\nIf the past few years represented AI's Wild West — marked by widespread experimentation and spending — this year is about formalizing what works.\n\nSumeet Chabria, CEO of advisory firm ThoughtLinks and a former senior Wall Street technology executive, said AI has moved from isolated pilots to a core priority. He anticipates more detail from banking chiefs on how their firms are deploying AI to enhance results.\n\n\"Every line of business' strategic plan will have clarity on how they're using AI and how they're going to drive value, for sure,\" he said. \"The focus has moved from projects and programs or pilots to enterprise — to AI being a strategic priority for all the top banks.\"",

    "description": "Discover some of ChatGPT's recommendations for alternatives to gold -- like silver, defensive stocks and bonds -- for safety during economic uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "Gold saw great growth in 2025. It’s not surprising, as investors often turn to gold during times of economic uncertainty. With the expectations of the U.S. dollar weakening and slower growth, more people turn to a safe-haven investment like gold, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nGold prices may be too steep for some investors, leaving them looking for other suitable investments for relative safety. For investors concerned about inflation or market volatility, stability and inflation hedges can be found elsewhere. GOBankingRates asked ChatGPT for the best alternatives to investing in gold. Here’s what the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot recommended as some gold alternatives.\n\nAlso see four reasons for gold’s popularity in 2025 and how to protect your portfolio.\n\nGold isn’t the only precious metal retail investors can purchase. Silver, platinum and palladium are all legitimate alternative investments to buy. Think of these precious metals as cousins to gold but with their unique profiles.\n\n“These metals can benefit from both investment demand and industrial use, which gives them a different performance profile than gold,” ChatGPT said. “All three metals tend to be riskier than investing in gold, but they do provide some upside. Silver tends to be more volatile, but it can outperform gold during strong economic periods due to industrial demand. Platinum and palladium are rarer and more heavily tied to automotive production, which adds risk but also potential upside.”\n\nHaving a small portion of your portfolio in these metals can add helpful diversification.\n\nRead Next: 3 Safest Investments To Hold In The Current Trump Economy\n\nCheck Out: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n\nOwning stocks can still be a wise choice for cautious investors, given the right circumstances. Growth stocks may be too risky, but defensive stocks can provide some protection. Defensive stocks typically have a strong history of dividend growth, minimal debt and an inexpensive valuation, according to Kiplinger.\n\nIn short, companies that sell items people always use are often defensive. “Firms in defensive sectors like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples sell products people need regardless of economic conditions,” ChatGPT explained.\n\nDefensive means dependable, not boring, and that dependability can create generous dividend growth.\n\nGold investors often value tangible assets they can see. Land, such as farmland or real estate, could be an alternative to gold for the right investor. “These assets are less liquid and can require more management, but they often move independently of traditional financial markets,” the AI said.",

    "description": "Julius Bruch spent seven years at McKinsey before founding an AI dementia startup. He shares what made the leap hard — and why consulting helped.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Julius Bruch, the 39-year-old cofounder and CEO of AI healthtech startup Isaac Health. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.\n\nI started training in general medicine and neurology, and I've always been passionate about this area, partially because my grandmother had an atypical form of dementia. I completed my Ph.D. in dementia, focusing on the molecular aspects and drug discovery.\n\nComing out of the research world, I went into McKinsey because I was interested in how the healthcare system works more broadly and how the different parts fit together. During my seven-and-a-half years at McKinsey, I worked with payers, health systems, and state governments on value-based care, chronic condition management, and digital health.\n\nI left in 2021 because I wanted to move on and put things into practice. I felt like I had seen and learned it, and it became a decision between becoming a career consultant or seeing myself as someone who wanted to build something innovative.\n\nConsulting was a fantastic training opportunity. I learned a lot about how the healthcare system works, how different parts work together, and how to structure a problem. I would say it was the best possible preparation for being a founder that you can think of.\n\nThe relationships I built — both inside the firm and with clients — have been a key success driver for the business. It means you know who to reach out to, people at payers you can problem-solve with, and some initial contact points for fundraising. The alumni network is strong.\n\nYou also train your analytical thinking and problem-solving approach. Starting a company feels like a consulting engagement — you're interviewing a lot of people, trying to solve a problem, and building a solution. Eventually, it outgrows that, but the thinking that there's always a way to solve something comes from that analytical training.\n\nThe main thing to unlearn from consulting was the pursuit of perfection. A startup needs to be able to move fast with scrappy pragmatism. The other thing I had to unlearn was always giving in to clients. As a startup founder, you learn quickly where boundaries need to be set.\n\nInitially, it felt a bit like: What am I doing? Am I just playing around?\n\nStarting a business was a bit of a dream, but not something I was going to do at any cost.\n\nI definitely lost some sweat over making the decision. I told myself I would give it three months. After those three months, there was enough traction to make it work and continue moving forward.\n\nStartup life is a lot less structured, and you have to be comfortable with that.\n\nEvery major milestone feels like a massive reward because you're fighting for it. It's not like things just run smoothly and that's it. Every client you get, every revenue milestone, and any external recognition is hard-fought for.\n\nIn August, our startup raised $10.5 million in Series A funding, bringing the company's total funding to $16.3 million. It feels great for a day — you realize that more investment also means higher expectations and that the goal posts have moved.\n\nEvery startup faces challenges, like scaling. We have a service component, so there are always people involved as we grow, and that comes with difficulties. You have to hire, find the right talent, and keep changing the processes, because the way things work for a team of four people doesn't work for a team of 60 or 70.\n\nJumping into a startup also means being open to flexibility. You have to be able to wear multiple hats and jump in where needed.\n\nMany people come in quite timidly. They want to work within their scope and be trained on the job. But you really have to create everything from scratch, like workflows. It requires a lot of creativity and problem-solving. Sometimes, I could have acted faster on certain things or signals.\n\nGo with the science and find a cofounder who is deeply rooted in the subject matter. I see a lot of startups that are a little bit obvious or built on very standard, replaceable models without a major moat. It's important to make sure you are cutting-edge.\n\nDo you have a story to share about becoming an AI startup founder? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "fullText": "A Google AI product manager's career advice is unexpectedly crustacean.\n\nMarily Nika, who has worked in AI product roles for over a decade, said in an episode of \"The Growth Podcast\" by Aakash Gupta published Sunday that aspiring product managers should \"be like crabs.\"\n\n\"That means that you need to move adjacent to what you've been doing,\" Nika said, adding that one's past experience is a competitive advantage.\n\nNika shared the example of a student in her AI product management boot camp who worked in the hearing aid industry and felt stuck and closed off from the tech industry. The student believed he was in a \"completely different domain\" and didn't see a clear path into product management, she said.\n\nNika encouraged him to look more closely at how his experience could translate. When they checked Apple's careers site, they found an opening for a product manager working on AirPods — a role where expertise in hearing could be relevant.\n\n\"We need to be open-minded. We really need to bring in the previous experience we have because that's gonna set us apart,\" Nika said.\n\nNika also provided another example involving a sports journalist who sought to transition into an AI product manager role in sports. Rather than being afraid of lacking a traditional product résumé, Nika advised him to lean into his domain expertise. Product skills can be learned, but a deep understanding of users and industries is harder to replace, she said.\n\nNika said becoming \"AI literate\" is now essential for product managers.\n\n\"Understand the unique intricacies that AI brings, understand how dependent we are on data,\" she said, describing how AI has become an expectation for the role.\n\nAspiring product managers should also understand \"what goes behind coding,\" like knowing what APIs are and how products are shipped.\n\nOther tech leaders and workers echo the same message.\n\nA vice president of product and growth for AI products at Dropbox told Business Insider last year that product managers should familiarize themselves with new AI tools, including vibe coding tools that enable non-coders to quickly prototype ideas.\n\nInstead of spending time writing documents, product managers can use AI tools to build lightweight prototypes to test ideas early, he said. This can help \"accelerate how they think about developing their taste, developing their craft, and understanding what makes sense in physical products,\" he added.\n\nA senior product manager at Microsoft told Business Insider in December that product managers will increasingly be expected to use AI to work faster. He said AI tools helped him draft work documents, summarize information, and generate suggestions for approaching product management problems.",

    "title": "Elon Musk asked people to upload their medical data to X so his AI company could learn to interpret MRIs and CT scans",
    "description": "Health care experts are worried about Grok’s potential to breach patient privacy.",
    "fullText": "In Elon Musk’s world, AI is the new MD. The X owner is encouraging users to upload their medical test results—such as CT and bone scans—to the platform so that Grok, X’s artificial intelligence chatbot, can learn how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nHe’s previously said this information will be used to train X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok on how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nEarlier this month, Elon Musk reposted a video on X of himself talking about uploading medical data to Grok, saying: “Try it!”\n\n“You can upload your X-rays or MRI images to Grok and it will give you a medical diagnosis,” Musk said in the video, which was uploaded in June. “I have seen cases where it’s actually better than what doctors tell you.\n\nIn 2024, Musk said medical images uploaded to Grok would be used to train the bot.\n\n“This is still early stage, but it is already quite accurate and will become extremely good,” Musk wrote on X. “Let us know where Grok gets it right or needs work.”\n\nMusk also claimed in his response Grok saved a man in Norway by diagnosing a problem his doctors failed to notice. The X owner was willing to upload his own medical information to his bot.\n\n“I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,” Musk said in an episode of the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast released on Tuesday. “None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.”\n\nMusk did not disclose in the podcast why he received an MRI. XAI, which owns X, told Fortune in a statement: “Legacy Media Lies.”\n\nGrok is facing some competition in the AI health space. This week OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, an experience within the bot feature that allows users to securely connect medical records and wellness apps like MyFitnessPal and Apple Health. The company said it would not train the models using personal medical information.\n\nAI chatbots have become a ubiquitous source of medical information for people. OpenAI reported this week 40 million people seek health information from the model, 55% of which used to bot to look up or better understand symptoms.\n\nSo far, Grok’s ability to detect medical abnormalities have been mixed. The AI successfully analyzed blood test results and identified breast cancer, some users claimed. But it also grossly misinterpreted other pieces of information, according to physicians who responded to some of Musk’s about Grok’s ability to interpret medical information. In one instance, Grok mistook a “textbook case” of tuberculosis for a herniated disk or spinal stenosis. In another, the bot mistook a mammogram of a benign breast cyst for an image of testicles.\n\nA May 2025 study found that while all AI models have limitations in processing and predicting medical outcomes, Grok was the most effectively compared to Google’s Gemini and ChatGPT-4o when determining the presence of pathologies in 35,711 slices of brain MRI.\n\n“We know they have the technical capability,” Dr. Laura Heacock, associate professor at the New York University Langone Health Department of Radiology, wrote on X. “Whether or not they want to put in the time, data and [graphics processing units] to include medical imaging is up to them. For now, non-generative AI methods continue to outperform in medical imaging.”\n\nMusk’s lofty goal of training his AI to make medical diagnoses is also a risky one, experts said. While AI has increasingly been used as a means to make complicated science more accessible and create assistive technologies, teaching Grok to use data from a social media platform presents concerns about both Grok’s accuracy and user privacy.\n\nRyan Tarzy, CEO of health technology firm Avandra Imaging, said in an interview with Fast Company asking users to directly input data, rather than source it from secure databases with de-identified patient data, is Musk’s way of trying to accelerate Grok’s development. Also, the information comes from a limited sample of whoever is willing to upload their images and tests—meaning the AI is not gathering data from sources representative of the broader and more diverse medical landscape.\n\nMedical information shared on social media isn’t bound by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the federal law that protects patients’ private information from being shared without their consent. That means there’s less control over where the information goes after a user chooses to share it.\n\n“This approach has myriad risks, including the accidental sharing of patient identities,” Tarzy said. “Personal health information is ‘burned in’ too many images, such as CT scans, and would inevitably be released in this plan.”\n\nThe privacy dangers Grok may present aren’t fully known because X may have privacy protections not known by the public, according to Matthew McCoy, assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He said users share medical information at their own risk.\n\n“As an individual user, would I feel comfortable contributing health data?” he previously told the New York Times. “Absolutely not.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on Nov. 20, 2024.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Health in a push to become a hub for personal health data\n\nOpenAI suggests ChatGPT play doctor as millions of Americans face spiking insurance costs: ‘In the U.S., ChatGPT has become an important ally’\n\nAs Utah gives the AI power to prescribe some drugs, physicians warn of patient risks\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "Anthropic is rolling out a major expansion of its healthcare and life-sciences offerings, as AI companies race to embed large language models more deeply into regulated medical workflows.\n\nThe company on Sunday announced Claude for Healthcare, a product that allows healthcare providers, insurers, and consumers to use Claude for medical purposes through HIPAA-ready infrastructure.\n\nThe launch builds on Anthropic's earlier release of Claude for Life Sciences, which focused on research and drug discovery, and reflects the company's broader effort to position its AI models as practical tools for regulated industries.\n\nThe move also underscores intensifying competition in healthcare AI. OpenAI recently unveiled a rival product, and startups including Abridge and Sword Health have attracted multibillion-dollar valuations as investors pour money into AI tools for medicine.\n\nAnthropic said Claude for Healthcare is designed to reduce administrative work and help both clinicians and patients better understand medical information. The tools are powered by recent improvements to the company's flagship model, Claude Opus 4.5, which Anthropic says performs significantly better than earlier versions on simulated medical and scientific tasks while showing fewer factual errors.\n\nAs part of the healthcare expansion, Claude can now connect directly to several industry-standard databases. These include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Coverage Database, ICD-10 medical coding data, the National Provider Identifier Registry, and PubMed's biomedical research library. Anthropic said these connectors allow Claude to quickly surface relevant information, support prior authorization workflows, and help clinicians and administrators generate reports more efficiently.\n\nThe company is also introducing customizable \"Agent Skills,\" including sample tools for streamlining prior authorization requests and assisting developers in building applications using FHIR, the modern standard for exchanging healthcare data between systems.\n\nOn the consumer side, Anthropic is rolling out integrations that let US subscribers on its Pro and Max plans give Claude secure access to their personal health records. New connectors include HealthEx and Function Health, with Apple HealthKit and Android Health Connect integrations launching in beta via Claude's mobile apps. Anthropic said data accessed through these integrations isn't stored in Claude's memory or used to train its models.\n\nAnthropic is also expanding Claude's capabilities for life sciences customers, adding connectors to platforms such as Medidata, ClinicalTrials.gov, and bioRxiv. New agent skills support tasks like drafting FDA- and NIH-compliant clinical trial protocols or monitoring trial performance.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "“It was extremely difficult,” IgniteTech CEO Eric Vaughan tells Fortune. “But changing minds was harder than adding skills.”",
    "fullText": "Eric Vaughan, CEO of enterprise-software powerhouse IgniteTech, was unwavering as he reflected on the most radical decision of his decades-long career. In early 2023, convinced generative AI was an “existential” transformation, Vaughan looked at his team and saw a workforce not fully on board. His ultimate response: He ripped the company down to the studs, replacing nearly 80% of staff within a year, according to headcount figures reviewed by Fortune.\n\nOver the course of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024, Vaughan told Fortune, IgniteTech replaced hundreds of employees, declining to disclose a specific number. “That was not our goal,” he told Fortune. “It was extremely difficult … But changing minds was harder than adding skills.” It was, by any measure, a brutal reckoning—but Vaughan insists it was necessary, and said he’d do it again.\n\nFor Vaughan, the writing on the wall was clear and dramatic.\n\n“In early 2023, we saw the light,” he told Fortune in an August 2025 interview, adding he believed every tech company was facing a crucial inflection point around adoption of artificial intelligence. “Now I’ve certainly morphed to believe that this is every company, and I mean that literally every company, is facing an existential threat by this transformation.”\n\nWhere others saw promise, Vaughan saw urgency—believing failing to get ahead on AI could doom even the most robust business. He called an all-hands meeting with his global remote team. Gone were the comfortable routines and quarterly goals. Instead, his message was direct: Everything would now revolve around AI. “We’re going to give a gift to each of you. And that gift is tremendous investment of time, tools, education, projects … to give you a new skill,” he explained. The company began reimbursing for AI tools and prompt-engineering classes, and even brought in outside experts to evangelize.\n\n“Every single Monday was called ‘AI Monday,’” Vaughan said, with his mandate for staff that they could work only on AI. “You couldn’t have customer calls; you couldn’t work on budgets; you had to only work on AI projects.” He said this happened across the board, not just for tech workers, but also for sales, marketing, and everybody else at IgniteTech. “That culture needed to be built. That was the key.”\n\nThis was a major investment, he added: 20% of payroll was dedicated to a mass-learning initiative, and it failed because of mass resistance, even sabotage. Belief, Vaughan discovered, is a hard thing to manufacture.",

    "fullText": "HEBER CITY, Utah — An artificial intelligence that writes police reports had some explaining to do earlier this month after it claimed a Heber City officer had shape-shifted into a frog.\n\nHowever, the truth behind that so-called magical transformation is simple.\n\n\"The body cam software and the AI report writing software picked up on the movie that was playing in the background, which happened to be 'The Princess and the Frog,'\" Sgt. Keel told FOX 13 News. “That’s when we learned the importance of correcting these AI-generated reports.”\n\nEarlier this month, the department began testing two pieces of AI software, Draft One and Code Four. Code Four was created by George Cheng and Dylan Nguyen, both 19 years old and MIT dropouts, kicked off earlier this year. The software generates police reports from body camera footage in hopes of reducing paperwork and allowing officers to be out in the field more.\n\nDraft One was the software used to create the Disney-inspired police report.\n\nTo see how Code Four works, FOX 13 News rode along with Keel for a demonstration as the department staged a mock traffic stop.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Rick with the Heber PD. The reason I'm stopping you today is for...\" Keel said during the demonstration.\n\nBack at the police department, the AI generated a report with timestamps from the mock traffic stop. The software works in both English and Spanish and can track tone and sentiment as people are talking.\n\nKeel says one of the major draws is that the software saves them time, as writing reports typically takes 1-2 hours.\n\n\"I'm saving myself about 6-8 hours weekly now,\" Keel said. \"I'm not the most tech-savvy person, so it's very user-friendly.\"\n\nCode Four costs about $30 per officer each month. Keel said the trial run for Code Four wraps up next month, but department officials say they plan to continue using the AI technology; it's just a matter of which system.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Guardian investigation finds AI Overviews provided inaccurate and false information when queried over blood tests\n\nGoogle has removed some of its artificial intelligence health summaries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading information.\n\nThe company has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut some of the summaries, which appear at the top of search results, served up inaccurate health information, putting users at risk of harm.\n\nIn one case that experts described as “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy.\n\nTyping “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” served up masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients, the Guardian found.\n\nWhat Google’s AI Overviews said was normal may vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result, and not bother to attend follow-up healthcare meetings.\n\nAfter the investigation, the company has removed AI Overviews for the search terms “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests”.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We do not comment on individual removals within Search. In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nVanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity, said: “This is excellent news, and we’re pleased to see the removal of the Google AI Overviews in these instances.\n\n“However, if the question is asked in a different way, a potentially misleading AI Overview may still be given and we remain concerned other AI‑produced health information can be inaccurate and confusing.”\n\nThe Guardian found that typing slight variations of the original queries into Google, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range”, prompted AI Overviews. That was a big worry, Hebditch said.\n\n“A liver function test or LFT is a collection of different blood tests. Understanding the results and what to do next is complex and involves a lot more than comparing a set of numbers.\n\n“But the AI Overviews present a list of tests in bold, making it very easy for readers to miss that these numbers might not even be the right ones for their test.\n\n“In addition, the AI Overviews fail to warn that someone can get normal results for these tests when they have serious liver disease and need further medical care. This false reassurance could be very harmful.”\n\nGoogle, which has a 91% share of the global search engine market, said it was reviewing the new examples provided to it by the Guardian.\n\nHebditch said: “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health.”\n\nSue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, welcomed the removal of the summaries but said she still had concerns.\n\n“This is a good result but it is only the very first step in what is needed to maintain trust in Google’s health-related search results. There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information.”\n\nMillions of adults worldwide already struggle to access trusted health information, Farrington said. “That’s why it is so important that Google signposts people to robust, researched health information and offers of care from trusted health organisations.”\n\nAI Overviews still pop up for other examples the Guardian originally highlighted to Google. They include summaries of information about cancer and mental health that experts described as “completely wrong” and “really dangerous”.\n\nAsked why these AI Overviews had not also been removed, Google said they linked to well-known and reputable sources, and informed people when it was important to seek out expert advice.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Our internal team of clinicians reviewed what’s been shared with us and found that in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.”\n\nVictor Tangermann, a senior editor at the technology website Futurism, said the results of the Guardian’s investigation showed Google had work to do “to ensure that its AI tool isn’t dispensing dangerous health misinformation”.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Andrew using one of the following methods.\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email andrew.gregory@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nGoogle said AI Overviews only show up on queries where it has high confidence in the quality of the responses. The company constantly measures and reviews the quality of its summaries across many different categories of information, it added.\n\nIn an article for Search Engine Journal, senior writer Matt Southern said: “AI Overviews appear above ranked results. When the topic is health, errors carry more weight.”",

    "description": "Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy says that people either overhype the impact of AI, or assume doomsday scenarios.",
    "fullText": "AI often sparks strong reactions, with people predicting either a near-term utopia — or the end of the world as we know it.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy told Business Insider that individuals on the hype end of the spectrum tend to jump quickly to promises of unlimited prosperity. The CEO said that the other extreme includes those who believe AI will lead to a doomsday scenario.\n\nRamaswamy said that this sort of thinking is \"very human,\" but that neither of those scenarios is \"all that likely.\"\n\n\"The biggest misconception would be that of thinking about AI as an all or nothing,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nThe real value of AI, he said, is likely to be nuanced and show up in specific use cases. Ramaswamy added that his advice to customers is to \"be very incremental\" with AI adoption.\n\nWhile he's still focused on long-term thinking, he added that he no longer accepts multi-year, fixed roadmaps for plans for the company because the technology is changing so quickly.\n\n\"I want them to tell me which direction they are headed, but very much be in this mode of iterating, because this is a world of rapid change,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nRather than view AI as a tool that will bring sweeping changes overnight, the CEO said it needs to be embraced as a shift in how people work, and one that requires progress \"bit by bit.\" He added that clear frameworks are necessary to determine where AI efforts matter the most.\n\nFor example, a cloud data platform company like Snowflake focuses on building and running software, and Ramaswamy said it needs to \"nail\" how it creates, deploys, sells, and installs that software. That means it needs to deeply integrate AI in software development to stay competitive.\n\nWhile Ramaswamy said he wants his employees to utilize AI tools daily, his end goal is for the company to write software more efficiently than the rest of the industry. That requires adapting business models in specific areas, rather than treating AI as a blanket rewrite of everything, he said.\n\nHe said that when dealing with technology like AI, which \"ostensibly claims to change everything,\" it's essential to have a clear view on where change needs to be implemented and where the impact will be \"existential.\"\n\n\"I worry a lot about making sure that we are state-of-the-art, especially in the critical areas with regards to how we utilize AI,\" Ramaswamy said.",

    "description": "We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.",
    "fullText": "A natural way to display multi-step code execution together with reasoning is within a Jupyter Notebook, which consists of code and markdown cells. So we built Jupyter Agent to act as an agent that can execute code directly inside a Jupyter notebook and use this environment to solve data analysis and data science tasks. Think of it like Cursor, but living natively inside your data science workflow.\nWe built a demo of this vision with Qwen-3 Coder, currently one of the strongest coding models. This is a follow-up to our earlier work on jupyter-agent (v1).\n\nWhile large models are starting to show useful behavior, the key question is how we can continue improving them. To this end, we focus on strengthening smaller models to perform well on agentic data science tasks as they currently struggle to compete with the large models.\n\nThe goal of this project is to build a pipeline to first generate high-quality training data, then fine-tune an existing small model, and finally evaluate whether the model's performance improves on relevant benchmarks.\n\nLet’s begin with the last step: selecting a strong benchmark for evaluating models on data science tasks.\n\nIn order to understand if we are making progress towards better data science agents we need a benchmark to measure such capabilities. Last year, in partnership with Adyen, we introduced the DABStep benchmark: a way to evaluate data science agents on realistic tasks. The setup is simple: provide the LLM with datasets and ask it to answer non-trivial data questions.\n\nThis benchmark remains challenging for today’s LLMs — e.g. the best out-of-the-box model is Claude 4 Sonnet which reaches not even 20% accuracy on the hard tasks.\nYou can explore the live leaderboard here.\n\nNow that we identified a good benchmark we can try to climb it! We set out to build a dataset for fine-tuning such that even a small data agent model could perform well on DABStep.\n\nOur first choice was Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507: extremely small (fast to iterate with, easy to run), yet strong enough to act in agentic scenarios.\n\nNot great — but a promising starting point, since it left a lot of room for improvement. Let's see how we can improve it!\n\nA core aspect of agents that sets it apart from a pure chat model is the scaffolding built around the model to steer its behaviour. The evaluation script in DABStep for example uses smolagents to execute code. Smolagents comes with predefined behaviors, prompting structures, and expected formats.\n\nWe also studied the Qwen-Agent codebase, where the authors tailoring scaffolding to the model. This makes sense: Claude Code, for example, works shockingly well with Claude Sonnet because their scaffolding is aligned.\n\nSo, we restructured our scaffolding:\n\n👉 Check it out here: utils.py.\n\nResults: accuracy jumped from 44.4% → 59.7% (easy split). 🚀\n\nWith simplified scaffolding in place, we focused on fine-tuning Qwen3-4B for data science agentic tasks.\n\nThe recipe to improve a model on a certain task or behaviour is to train it on data that reflects the tasks as closely as possible. A natural starting point is to look at real Jupyter Notebooks and find notebooks that align closely with the task that we plan to tackle, namely data analysis.\n\nKaggle notebooks offer a wealth of high quality data analysis notebooks and are made available by Kaggle:\n\nNow that we have good results with a base model it's time to build a dataset that will help us improve it even further. We designed a multi-stage pipeline using Datatrove to clean and prepare Kaggle notebooks at scale.\n\nWe started with ~2TB of Kaggle notebooks and reduced it to ~250GB reusing our work from the BigCode project. As part of the StarCoder2 training data processing the notebooks (without output cells) were already deduplicated.\nMost Kaggle notebooks are small variations or near-identical copies, so this step was essential.\nKey insight: ~90% of raw notebooks are duplicates, which would have skewed training if left unfiltered.\n\nMost Kaggle notebooks reference external datasets via Kaggle metadata. To make sure the code inside notebooks could actually run, we built a pipeline that automatically fetched these linked datasets. This step was crucial, since many notebooks would otherwise be incomplete or non-executable.\n\nUsing the kagglehub package, we downloaded thousands of datasets — about 5TB in total. To keep things manageable and relevant:\n\nWe scored notebooks based on educational quality using Qwen3-32B. We saw that using the whole notebook was not optimal, as many contained trivial or broken code. Our educational scoring approach is detailed in edu_scoring.py.\n\nTL;DR: We assigned each notebook a score from 1–5 based on clarity, completeness, and educational value, and kept only those above a chosen threshold. This filtering removed about 70% of the notebooks.\n\nThis is similar to the insight from the BeyondWeb paper, which showed that using high-quality data is better for synthetic data generation — a step we relied on for QA (Question-Answer) generation.\nThis helped the model learn from “high quality” notebooks instead of noisy ones.\n\nWe excluded notebooks about training LLMs or unrelated to data analysis.\nWe also removed notebooks that didn’t actually use datasets through an automated LLM-based filtering process using Qwen3-32B. The implementation of filtering can be found in extract_packages_and_files.py.\n\nTL;DR: We prompted Qwen3-32B to identify and remove notebooks that either (1) had nothing to do with data analysis, or (2) didn’t actually use datasets. This step removed about 20% of the notebooks.\n\nThis ensured we trained only on relevant data science tasks.\n\nUsing the cleaned notebooks, we generated question–answer pairs using Qwen3-32B. The questions and answer are grounded in the real notebook traces so the QA pairs are based on real code execution results.\nPrompt design: we asked the LLM to produce natural questions that could realistically be asked of the dataset, then validated whether the notebook provided a correct answer.\n\nChallenge: We had to try many prompts to get higher-difficulty questions because LLMs tended to generate trivial ones like \"what is the size of the dataset\".\nInsight: We broke this into two steps because LLMs tended to hallucinate answers:\n\nThe complete prompting strategy and implementation is available in generate_qa.py.\n\nFinally we want to generate clean code execution traces since even the original notebooks after processing are often open ended and verbose with lots of irrelevant parts. However, we want our Jupyter Agent to get to the result efficiently. To generate cleaner notebook traces for training we generated traces synthetically based on the original notebooks.\nWe have prompted Qwen-3-Coder-480B model to generate a jupyter notebook code to answer the question from the previously generated synthetic QA pair. \nTraces captured step-by-step code execution, including intermediate outputs, which are crucial for agent training.\n\nWe used E2B for our agent to solve the synthetic QA pairs, which required fetching Kaggle datasets so the code could actually run via E2B.\n\nChallenge 1: Many datasets were unavailable.\nTrick: Since LLMs are strong at code and have a decent world model, we prompted them to act as a code interpreter when the dataset was missing.\n\nChallenge 2: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B model does not support thinking mode - how can we extract code commentary? By default it often outputs just a brief comment followed by several steps of code execution. However, we'd like some reasoning or comments between every cell. \nTrick: When switching from Qwen3-32B to Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B we noticed that often output message content was empty. This turns out to be a previously known quirk of Qwen3-Coder models in which when using tool calling the model would not return an empty assistant response. We enforce some text commentary through tooling by passing 'comment' as a required field in the code execution tool call. This way when non-reasoning model is used for code cell generation it will by default output some description of its actions from 1st POV, emulating the thinking traces structure.\n\nNote: the generated final answer in the notebook may vary from the answer specified in the QA pair. This is caused by the fact that the agent model could use data preprocessing methods and steps different from the original Kaggle notebook and the synthetic question would not usually specify them. This discrepancy is normal and lays the foundation for a new exciting research direction of how language models tend to treat data analysis and whether they do it differently from humans. For full transparency we keep both LLM-generated final answer and original answer from the real Kaggle notebook as a signal of model's performance. We encourage the community to try different dataset mixes to see how they can push performance even further.\n\nWe truncated overly long outputs and filtered out trivial traces to prevent content length issues and keep only high-quality traces.\nWe kept non-trivial, multi-turn traces aligned with DABStep-style tasks.\nThe resulting Jupyter Agent Dataset became the foundation for SFT on Qwen3-4B models with 51k synthetic notebooks and almost 0.2B tokens.\n\nWith this dataset in hand, the natural next step is to see whether it actually helps our model become a stronger data science agent. Let’s move on to the training pipeline and evaluate the impact!\n\nWith the curated dataset ready, we turned to the key question: does this data actually help the model get better at solving data analysis tasks?\nTo find out, we set up a simple fine-tuning pipeline and ran experiments to measure the impact of training on our synthetic notebooks.\n\nSome training steps turned out to be particularly interesting and gave us useful insights:\n\nOur complete training implementation, including hyperparameter configurations and template adaptations, is available in our finetuning directory in our repo.\n\nFirst, we generated our final dataset using Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B which contains high quality code and short reasoning-like traces. Afterwards, we started our training and we have experimented with various configurations like PEFT/adapters vs. full-parameter tuning, learning rate, number of epochs, adding noise and others. We found out, that full-parameter fine-tuning allows the model to learn and replicate the Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B behavior response quality better with shorter supporting commentary fitting more to the data analysis task without unnecessary long reasoning.\n\nWe have done a small ablation study on the impact of no. training epochs:\n\nWe observe that it is beneficial to have a bit more epochs than usual for SFT with lower learning rate and higher neftune noise (7). Finally, we compare our trained models with implemented scaffolding to define the pure impact of our training dataset. In summary, we can see up to 36%/22% boost on DABStep easy score compared with base/scaffolded model:\n\nWe can also see, that the hard score can increase too even though our dataset is focused on easier questions:\n\nFrom figures above one can notice a noticeable impact of both new scaffolding and tuning on our synthetic notebooks. This makes Qwen-4B (with our pipeline + scaffolding) a state-of-the-art small-model agent on DABStep.\n\nIn practice, the model can now solve a wide range of realistic Kaggle-style data analysis tasks with consistent execution.\nIt’s not yet strong enough for the hardest queries, but we’ve shown that even small models can become powerful agents when paired with the right data and scaffolding.\n\nThese results demonstrate that even small models can become powerful data science agents with the right training approach. Ready to try it yourself? We've made everything openly available so you can experiment with our fine-tuned models and dataset.\n\nWe openly release best-performing checkpoints of tuned Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 together with the training dataset, which you can try out and experiment with:\n\nYou can load Jupyter Agent Dataset in just a couple of lines using the following code:\n\nYou can also use sourced Kaggle datasets directly with E2B code execution using the following code:\n\nYou use tuned Jupyter Agent Qwen-based models following the Qwen documentation code:\n\nFor Thinking model you can decode both thinking response and content using the next code:\n\nMaybe this will lead to… Jupyter-Agent 3. 😉\n\nWe hope that our findings will inspire others to continue progress in developing more powerful notebook coding agents and we're excited to see what the community builds next.

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Jan 10 (Reuters) - China can narrow its technological gap with the U.S. driven by growing risk-taking and innovation, though the lack of advanced chipmaking tools is hobbling the ​sector, the country's leading artificial intelligence researchers said on Saturday.\n\nChina's so-called 'AI tiger' startups MiniMax and Zhipu ‌AI had strong debuts on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week, reflecting growing confidence in the sector as Beijing fast-tracks AI and ‌chip listings to bolster domestic alternatives to advanced U.S. technology.\n\nYao Shunyu, a former senior researcher at ChatGPT maker OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) who was named technology giant Tencent's chief AI scientist in December, said there was a high likelihood of a Chinese firm becoming the world's leading AI company in the next three to five years but said the lack of ⁠advanced chipmaking machines was the main ‌technical hurdle.\n\n\"Currently, we have a significant advantage in electricity and infrastructure. The main bottlenecks are production capacity, including lithography machines, and the software ecosystem,\" Yao said at an AI ‍conference in Beijing.\n\nChina has completed a working prototype of an extreme-ultraviolet lithography machine potentially capable of producing cutting-edge semiconductor chips that rival the West's, Reuters reported last month. However, the machine has not yet produced working chips and may not do ​so until 2030, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nYao and other Chinese industry ‌leaders at the Beijing conference on Saturday also acknowledged that the U.S. maintains an advantage in computing power due to its hefty investments in infrastructure.\n\n\"The U.S. computer infrastructure is likely one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours. But I see that whether it's OpenAI or other platforms, they're investing heavily in next-generation research,\" said Lin Junyang, technical lead for Alibaba's flagship Qwen large language model.\n\n\"We, on the other hand, are relatively strapped for ⁠cash; delivery alone likely consumes the majority of our computer infrastructure,\" ​Lin said during a panel discussion at the AGI-Next Frontier Summit ​held by the Beijing Key Laboratory of Foundational Models at Tsinghua University.\n\nLin said China's limited resources have spurred its researchers to be innovative, particularly through algorithm-hardware co-design, which enables AI ‍firms to run large models ⁠on smaller, inexpensive hardware.",

    "description": "Why the doomsayers are wrong: npm, PyPI, and NuGet downloads are exploding",
    "fullText": "Earlier this week, Adam Wathan, the creator of Tailwind CSS, dropped a bombshell about how AI has impacted his company and its employees:\n\nthe reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business. And every second I spend trying to do fun free things for the community like this is a second I’m not spending trying to turn the business around and make sure the people who are still here are getting their paychecks every month.\n\nThe reaction was swift and predictable. Hot takes flooded in declaring the death of open source, the end of OSS sustainability, and the AI apocalypse that would render libraries and frameworks obsolete. Geoffrey Huntley captured the prevailing narrative perfectly1:\n\n“AI can generate code, bypassing the need to deal with open-source woes… I’ve found myself using less open source these days… This shift challenges the role of open-source ecosystems.”\n\nI had a tweet about the Tailwind situation go viral and there were dozens of quote tweets and comments echoing the very same. “AI eats open source” is easy to find in abundance online.\n\nHere’s the problem: everyone is getting this perfectly backwards.\n\nAI isn’t killing open source. It’s amplifying it to unprecedented levels. The Tailwind situation isn’t about declining OSS adoption - it’s about a business model that was working great in a world where learning curves were high and documentation was the bottleneck. That world is gone, and the revenue model built on top of it is collapsing. But the underlying Tailwind library? It’s thriving.\n\nLet me show you why the doomsayers are wrong, backed by actual data from our own experience with Akka.NET and broader ecosystem trends that tell a very different story.\n\nThis is Part 1 of a two-part series. This post covers why AI is accelerating open source adoption, not killing it. Part 2 examines which business models thrive and which collapse in the AI era - and what Tailwind’s situation teaches us about adapting. \n\nI’ve been maintaining Akka.NET, a complex distributed systems framework, for over a decade. If AI was going to kill any open source project, it should have be ours. Actor model? Message-passing? Concurrency? Distributed systems? This is exactly the kind of “complex stuff” that AI should supposedly generate on the fly, right?\n\nWe’re not an outlier. Let me show you three very different frameworks - all thriving:\n\nTailwind CSS - The framework at the center of this controversy:\n\nTailwind more than doubled its downloads in 2025. The framework that supposedly proves AI is killing open source had its best year ever - by a massive margin.\n\nNServiceBus - Enterprise messaging framework (15+ years old, commercial licensing):\n\nNServiceBus is exactly the kind of enterprise infrastructure Geoffrey Huntley expects AI to replace. And it’s growing at 35%+ annually - the same rate as before AI coding tools existed. And it’s been commercially licensed for years - surely someone who wanted this type of functionality would just fire up Claude Code to eliminate it, right?\n\nAccording to Sonatype’s State of the Software Supply Chain 20242 report:\n\nIf AI was replacing open source libraries, why are package downloads exploding at unprecedented rates? Why are dependency counts climbing? Why is every major package registry showing record growth?\n\nThe answer is simple: AI is discovering and adopting open source libraries faster than humans ever could.\n\nHere’s what the AI doomsayers fundamentally misunderstand about how Large Language Models work: they’re trained to find the shortest path to a working solution.\n\nWhen you ask Claude or GPT-5 to build a distributed system, what do you think is the shorter path?\n\nOption A: Generate thousands of lines of custom actor model implementation, cluster management, network protocols, failure detectors, and state replication logic - all from scratch, all needing testing, all potentially buggy.\n\nOption B: dotnet add package Akka and configure the proven, tested, battle-hardened framework that’s in the training data with millions of examples.\n\nThe LLM isn’t stupid. It’s going to pick Option B every single time, unless you explicitly tell it not to - and even then it might fight you3.\n\nThis is why the “AI will generate everything custom” narrative falls apart on contact with reality. Yes, AI can generate custom components. But developers don’t want custom CSS frameworks - they want to ship. They want the thing that makes them money shipped yesterday. Using established libraries is how you get there expeditiously.\n\nHere’s where it gets really interesting. Established open source projects have a massive, compounding advantage in the AI era: years of training data.\n\nThink about what’s in those training sets:\n\nEvery time someone asks “how do I build a distributed system in .NET?” the training data screams “AKKA.NET” across thousands of documents. The LLM doesn’t need to think creatively. It’s pattern matching against an enormous corpus of successful implementations.\nThis creates a virtuous cycle:\n\nPopular projects have more training data → LLMs recommend them more → More people use them → More training data gets created → The cycle continues.\n\nThe rich get richer, and in this case, that’s actually a good thing for software quality.\n\nNow compare that to generating a custom solution. The LLM has… what? Generic distributed systems theory? Sure. But where are the battle-tested examples? Where are the debugging sessions? Where are the “here’s what went wrong in production and how we fixed it” stories?\n\nThey don’t exist. Because you’re asking the AI to invent something new.\n\nRemember when adopting a new library meant:\n\nFor a human developer, that’s a full day or two of investment before you’re productive. The mental math was always: “Is learning this library worth the time investment vs. building something custom that I already understand?”\n\nAI just arbitraged that entire calculation out of existence.\n\nWhen I ask Claude to “implement an Akka.NET cluster with cluster sharding and split-brain resolution,” it doesn’t need to read the docs. It doesn’t need the tutorial. It usually outputs working code with proper configuration in seconds. The learning curve is effectively zero.\n\nThis fundamentally changes the adoption math. The barrier to using any established library is now “can the AI generate correct code for it?” If yes, adoption becomes frictionless.\n\nGuess which libraries have the most examples for AI to learn from? The established ones. The popular ones. The ones with network effects and community momentum.\n\nAI can generate impressive things from scratch. People have used agentic loops to build entire programming languages, compilers, and complex systems - all generated by AI with minimal human intervention. These are genuine technical achievements that prove AI can build sophisticated software.\n\nBut here’s the question nobody’s asking: would you run your production systems on them?\n\nThe answer depends entirely on blast radius - what happens when things go wrong4.\n\nThe libraries that AI can safely replace are the ones with low blast radius. If your AI-generated UI component looks a little funny or renders slightly different than expected, nobody dies. You fix it and move on. The cost of failure is measured in minutes of debugging.\n\nBut if your AI-generated embedded operating system core dumps constantly? Someone might actually die. If your AI-generated authentication library has a subtle flaw? You get breached. If your AI-generated distributed consensus algorithm has an edge case bug? You lose data across your entire cluster.\n\nProduction systems don’t run on “technically works” - they run on battle-hardened, community-tested, security-audited infrastructure that’s been proven across thousands of deployments over years. That’s React. Linux. PostgreSQL. Akka.NET. NServiceBus. The boring, reliable stuff that’s growing 35-126% annually.\n\nThere’s another dimension here: institutionalized experience.\n\nA venerable codebase like Akka.NET doesn’t just contain code - it contains decades of accumulated wisdom across millions of deployments and tens of thousands of applications. All running on different hardware, serving different use cases, developed by different people. Every bug fix is a production war story. Every edge case handler is a lesson learned the hard way. Every configuration option exists because someone, somewhere, needed it in production.\n\nLLMs can synthesize code. They can pattern-match against training data. But they are no substitute for thousands of person-years of lived experience encoded into a codebase. That wisdom doesn’t exist in the training data - it exists in the accumulated decisions of maintainers who’ve seen every way a distributed system can fail.\n\nWhen you dotnet add package Akka, you’re not just getting code. You’re getting the institutional memory of a decade of production deployments. AI can’t generate that. It can only recommend the libraries that already have it.\n\nThe libraries actually at risk from AI generation are the ones with low blast radius - simple utilities, UI components, basic tooling where failure is cheap and recoverable. The critical infrastructure where failure is catastrophic? That’s not going anywhere. It’s accelerating.\n\n“Sure,” I hear you saying, “AI won’t replace frameworks, but what about all the smaller libraries? What about utilities and helpers?”\n\nFair question. Let’s think through the actual use cases.\n\nDeveloper needs a date formatting function. AI can generate it. But… so could a library. And the library version is tested. And documented. And handles edge cases. And gets security updates.\n\nWhat’s actually happening in practice? AI is finding and using existing utility libraries faster than humans would have. date-fns, lodash, NodaTime - these libraries aren’t declining, they’re exploding in adoption.5\n\nScenario 2: Custom Business Logic\n\nDeveloper needs a specific component for their application. AI generates it custom. Perfect! This is exactly what should be custom. This was never the domain of reusable open source anyway.\n\nScenario 3: Complex, Critical Systems\n\nDeveloper needs authentication, database access, distributed coordination, payment processing. AI could generate custom implementations. But would you ship them to production? Would you stake your business on AI-generated cryptography? On custom distributed consensus?\n\nOf course not. You use Postgres, Entity Framework, Akka.NET, OpenSSL - the proven solutions with years of production hardening.\n\nHere’s what the Tailwind situation actually tells us: AI is devastating businesses that sell what LLMs can generate.\n\nThe numbers tell the whole story:\n\nThe most successful year in the framework’s history coincided with the business collapse. This isn’t a contradiction - it’s the clearest illustration of what AI actually disrupts.\n\nTailwind’s commercial business is Tailwind Plus - premium UI components, templates, and blocks. The free documentation served as the primary sales funnel: developers would visit the docs to learn Tailwind, discover the premium components, and purchase them.\n\nAI broke this model in two devastating ways.\n\nFirst: The sales funnel dried up.\n\nRemember learning curve arbitrage? When developers use AI to generate Tailwind code, they don’t need to visit the documentation. Adam noted that docs traffic is down about 40% from early 2023 - despite Tailwind being more popular than ever. Fewer eyeballs on the docs means fewer people discovering the premium products exist.\n\nSecond: The product itself became AI-generatable.\n\nAI undercut Tailwind’s business model. Selling those components was about eliminating friction for users - buy a pre-made pricing table instead of building one yourself. But AI found an even cheaper way to eliminate that friction: generate the component on demand, for free.\n\nWhen a developer asks an AI for a “responsive pricing table with Tailwind,” the LLM isn’t going to say “log into your Tailwind Plus account and download the pricing component.” It’s going to generate one from scratch. That’s the shortest path.\n\nUI components and templates are exactly the kind of low-blast-radius output that AI handles well. If the generated component looks slightly different than a premium template, nobody cares. You tweak it and move on.\n\nTailwind’s business model put them directly in competition with their own framework’s AI-assisted usage. The better AI gets at generating Tailwind code, the less reason anyone has to buy pre-built components.\n\nThe framework thrives. The component business struggles. Same company, opposite trajectories - because one benefits from AI adoption and the other is displaced by it.\n\nAI isn’t killing open source. It’s creating the golden age of open source consumption.\n\nMore developers can adopt more libraries faster than ever before. The friction that kept people building custom solutions has evaporated. The learning curves that protected mediocre alternatives have disappeared.\n\nWhat we’re seeing is consolidation around quality, acceleration of adoption, and the destruction of business models that were built on selling what AI can now generate.\n\nTailwind CSS isn’t dying. Tailwind Plus might be dying - time will tell to see how they pivot. But the CSS framework itself is more popular than ever. The component products built on top of it? Those are being outcompeted by the LLMs recommending the framework.\n\nIf you’re an open source maintainer, this is your moment. If you’ve built something genuinely valuable - critical infrastructure with high blast radius, strong community, clear use cases - you’re about to see adoption curves that would have taken a decade compress into a few years.\n\nThe future of open source isn’t bleak. It’s brighter than it’s ever been. But the businesses built on top of them? That’s a different story - and it’s what we’ll dig into in Part 2.\n\nThis is Part 1 of a two-part series. Part 2 examines which open source business models thrive and which collapse in the AI era. The same AI wave that disrupted Tailwind’s business certainly didn’t hurt ours - our support subscriptions grew 19% in 2025, and AI-driven adoption likely contributed. Part 2 examines what makes some OSS business models resilient while others struggle. \n\nWhat’s your experience been? Are you seeing AI tools increase or decrease your open source usage? Hit me up on Twitter/X - I’m curious to hear how this is playing out across different ecosystems.\n\nGeoff wrote this all the way back in June 2025, well before this Tailwind situation. Ahead of his time. ↩\n\nA 2025 report would be preferable, but alas there isn’t one yet. ↩\n\nReward hacking is a property of frontier models you’ll encounter in all sorts of interesting ways. My personal favorite is when Claude disables failing tests in order to turn the status checks green. ↩\n\nI also suspect this is why the “learn AI now or you’re going to fall behind crew” ship way more “build with AI” courses than they do polished software products. ↩\n\n2024→2025 YoY growth: date-fns +52.6% (1.05B→1.60B), NodaTime +42.6% (171M→244M), lodash +36.2% (2.67B→3.64B). ↩\n\nDid you know that Phobos can automatically instrument your Akka.NET applications with OpenTelemetry?",

    "fullText": "Sakana AI’s “ALE-Agent” achieved a historic milestone by securing 1st place in the AtCoder Heuristic Contest 058, outperforming 804 human participants. To contextualize the difficulty of these optimization challenges, an OpenAI agent previously secured 2nd place in the AHC world tournament last August. This victory marks the first known instance of an AI agent winning a major optimization programming contest in real-time. The result demonstrates that by utilizing inference-time scaling with multiple frontier models, AI agents can now match or exceed the performance of top human experts in complex tasks requiring extended reasoning.\n\nDuring the 4-hour contest, our agent autonomously discovered a novel algorithm that outperformed the problem setters’ intended solution. While the problem setters’ anticipated a standard approach combining constructive heuristics and simulated annealing (SA), our ALE-Agent independently derived a “virtual power” heuristic and a sophisticated SA strategy with diverse neighborhood search operations, allowing it to escape local optima more effectively than human competitors.\n\nOperating at a total cost of approximately $1,300, the agent engaged in parallel code generation and iterative analysis, proving that AI is now capable of the original scientific discovery and trial-and-error required for high-level problem solving.\n\nFor the detailed information, including the logs and analysis output by ALE-Agent during the contest, see: https://sakanaai.github.io/fishylene-ahc058/ and our earlier NeurIPS’25 paper.\n\nThe AtCoder Heuristic Contest (AHC) is a series of programming competitions focused on optimization problems related to real-world industrial challenges, such as logistics optimization and factory production scheduling. These contests are characterized by approximately 1,000 programmers including experts active in various industrial sectors. Participants tackle a single, complex coding challenge, with contest durations ranging from four hours to two weeks.\n\nAHC has garnered significant global attention. In August 2025, a world championship featuring top-tier players was held, where an AI agent from OpenAI participated and won 2nd place. Sakana AI has also co-developed ALE-Bench, a benchmark platform based on AHC, in collaboration with AtCoder Inc. Furthermore, under special permission, our AI agent called ALE-Agent has been continuously participating in AHCs in real-time.\n\nAHC058, held on December 14, 2025, was conducted over a 4-hour competition window. The problem involved a setting where participants could produce machines with hierarchical relationships, such as multiple types of “apple-producing machines” and “machines that build those machines.” The objective was to construct an efficient production planning algorithm by determining which types and hierarchies of machines to upgrade and in what specific order.\n\nWhile the setting may seem humorous at first glance, these hierarchical production dependencies mirror real-world supply chains, food webs, and manufacturing processes, making it a scientifically interesting problem setup. For further details on the problem, please refer to the contest’s problem statement.\n\nALE-Agent began making submissions two hours after the contest started and immediately leapt to 1st place in the provisional standings.\n\nIn the middle of the contest, ALE-Agent was in a fierce dead heat with yosupo, the eventual 2nd-place finisher. ALE-Agent regained 1st place approximately two and a half hours into the contest and maintained the lead until the end to secure the victory.\n\nIn AHC058, the solution expected by the problem author was an approach that used algorithms like Greedy methods or Beam Search to determine a global strategic plan, followed by Simulated Annealing (SA) to refine the plan’s finer details.\n\nALE-Agent’s answer followed the same basic flow as a human: “construction by Greedy → refinement by SA.” However, it was a quintessential “AI-style” solution that maximized the AI’s strengths: numerous implementations and exhaustive trial and error. Analysis of the final program revealed the following characteristics:\n\nAnalyzing the process through which ALE-Agent generated its response revealed that it implemented the solution while deepening its understanding of the problem’s characteristics. (Logs can be viewed on this page).\n\nThe latest version of ALE-Agent is equipped with a mechanism to repeat trial and error by generating multiple programs simultaneously, summarizing those results to generate insights, and utilizing them for subsequent code generation. Looking at the insights generated by ALE-Agent, we can see it examining the problem based on experience; it mentioned the compound interest effect in connection with investment knowledge, devised high-speed algorithms using mathematics from an early stage, and discussed the nature of the search space, noting that initial strategies cause significant differences.\n\nWe received comments regarding ALE-Agent’s performance and approach from two experts familiar with the optimization field and AHC.\n\nFrom Hiroomi Nochide (AtCoder handle: itigo):\n\nActually, before the contest started, I thought this problem would be difficult for LLMs. This is because solving this problem with a Greedy method requires experimental insight that LLMs typically struggle with, and I thought a high score would be impossible without this human-centric consideration. However, when the results came out, I was stunned to see fishylene win.\n\nChecking the logs, it tried a vast number of patterns with promising directions and discovered a clever simulated annealing method that was not anticipated at the time the problem was created. I am impressed, thinking, ‘How did it find such a method?’ (In the logs, the parts requiring the experimental insight I initially expected did not appear, and given that humans still excelled in the Greedy portion, I believe human accuracy in consideration is still superior. However,) the overwhelming number of trial-and-error steps combined with LLM reasoning is an advantage humans do not have. While I feel fishylene is a formidable rival, I believe this technology will be a tremendous weapon for humanity.\n\n(Note: fishylene is ALE-Agent’s AtCoder account name)\n\nHiroomi Nochide authored the problem for AHC058. He is one of the world’s top players (24th in AHC world rankings) and a professional in this field at ALGO ARTIS CORPORATION.\n\nFrom Yoichi Iwata (AtCoder handle: wata):\n\nThis problem required optimizing investment plans for multiple series of production machines, where the high-level choice of which series to select as ‘final investment targets’ and ‘intermediate investment targets’ was essentially the core issue. With simple local improvement methods that only slightly change the investment target at each turn, it is difficult to switch this global strategy midway, often leading to poor local optima.\n\nThe expected solution from the author’s side was a two-stage approach: first explore a wide range of global investment plan candidates using a lightweight solver, and then spend time optimizing the promising ones. In contrast, the solutions from ALE-Agent and the runner-up, yosupo, were based on local search but introduced ‘Large Neighborhoods’ that change a huge portion of the investment plan at once to escape local optima. In particular, ALE-Agent utilized a diversified Greedy method to reconstruct large parts of the plan, which seems to have led to its performance advantage.\n\nHistorically, ALE-Agent has tended to choose solutions within the author’s expected range, yet its high implementation and optimization power allowed it to reach the top ranks among many participants using similar methods, especially in short-duration contests. This time, it was very impressive to see it go one step further and reach a solution that exceeded the author’s expectations.\n\nYoichi Iwata oversees AHC at AtCoder. He has an outstanding track record in this field, including winning the 2010 TopCoder Open. His scores in pre-contest test plays sometimes exceed the top participant scores, and he ensures the high quality of AHC problems.\n\nALE-Agent is an agent that performs algorithm discovery by utilizing multiple LLMs to create solutions in parallel, selecting the best ones, and reasoning further based on the results of trial and error. As such, it requires a high volume of LLM calls. The resources utilized during the 4-hour contest were as follows:\n\nThis result is significant as it demonstrates that even for multi-hour tasks, by scaling inference costs and running a properly designed AI agent, AI can reach or surpass the performance of top human experts.\n\nIdentifying which specific elements of ALE-Agent’s design contributed most to this dramatic result remains an important research task for the future. Our current analysis suggests that in addition to scaling LLM calls and injecting domain knowledge, a “self-learning mechanism,” which extracts insights from trial-and-error trajectory and reflects them in the next improvement cycle, played an important role.\n\nAs highlighted in evaluation reports such as those from METR (Model Evaluation and Threat Research), the latest AI models are beginning to show high proficiency in tasks requiring several hours of human effort. Our result follows this trend but is unique in showing that an AI agent with appropriate mechanisms and inference scaling can rival top human experts.\n\nHowever, at this point, AI does not always rival or surpass top humans. The table below shows ALE-Agent’s past performance. While ALE-Agent has often ranked highly in previous AHCs, AHC058 marks its first victory. Additionally, its calculated virtual rating is 2592, which corresponds to 66th place among active users.\n\nAVisualization of ALE-Agent’s past AHC performance and Rating. The graph shows the contribution of performance values from each contest to the overall rating. https://atcoder-graphs.vercel.app/#contributorGraph\n\nLooking ahead, we aim to increase stability to ensure consistently high performance across similar tasks and to evolve our agents to rival top experts in longer-term tasks lasting several days or more. To achieve this, we will focus on balancing efficient human-like thinking with trial and error (moving away from purely heavy LLM call reliance) and acquiring more advanced autonomous management capabilities.\n\nIn real-world problem-solving, the process where humans interpret, generalize, and refine the unexpected discoveries presented by AI is highly effective. As noted in our report on the ICFP Programming Contest 2025, Sakana AI positions AI not as a replacement for humans, but as a partner that expands human exploration capabilities. Measuring achievements by AI alone, as we did here, is vital for understanding the current strengths and weaknesses of AI as a partner, and we believe this result represents a significant milestone in that journey.\n\nFinally, we would like to express our deep gratitude to AtCoder Inc. for their continuous cooperation and to ALGO ARTIS CORPORATION for hosting this contest.\n\nSakana AI will continue to explore new possibilities for intelligence and the practical application of AI agents in the real world.\n\nSakana AI is looking for experienced software engineers to lead the productization of platforms that solve complex real-world problems and accelerate AI-driven discovery, including projects like ALE-Agent. We are also looking for interns interested in the further development and industrial application of AI agents. Join our team and help us turn cutting-edge AI agent technology into practical value.\n\nDetails and Application: https://sakana.ai/careers/",
