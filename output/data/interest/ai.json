    "fullText": "Commerce department finalising deal to allow H200 chips to be sold to China as strict Biden-era restrictions relaxed\n\nDonald Trump has cleared the way for Nvidia to begin selling its powerful AI computer chips to China, marking a win for the chip maker and its CEO, Jensen Huang, who has spent months lobbying the White House to open up sales in the country.\n\nBefore Monday’s announcement, the US had prohibited sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China over national security concerns.\n\nTrump posted to Truth Social on Monday: “I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security. President Xi responded positively!”\n\nTrump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.\n\nThe president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the 15% previously agreed to with Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions, and following similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings.\n\nIn August, Trump said the US would receive a 10% stake in the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of such arrangements.\n\nAccording to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent letters to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.\n\nThey wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”\n\nOn social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.\n\nHuang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang has pledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years.\n\nHuang has visited China several times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.\n\nIn October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.\n\nSelling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.\n\nThe Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.\n\n“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMa Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.",

    "fullText": "European Commission to assess whether Gemini owner is putting rival companies at a disadvantage\n\nThe EU has opened an investigation to assess whether Google is breaching European competition rules in its use of online content from publishers and YouTube creators for artificial intelligence.\n\nThe European Commission said on Tuesday it will examine whether the US tech company, which runs the Gemini AI model and is owned by Alphabet, is putting rival AI owners at a “disadvantage”.\n\n“The investigation will notably examine whether Google is distorting competition by imposing unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators, or by granting itself privileged access to such content, thereby placing developers of rival AI models at a disadvantage,” the commission said.\n\nIt said it was concerned that Google may have used content from web publishers to generate AI-powered services on its search results pages without appropriate compensation to publishers and without offering them the possibility to refuse such use of their content.\n\nThe commission said it was also concerned as to whether Google has used content uploaded to YouTube to train its own generative AI models without offering creators compensation or the possibility to refuse.\n\n“Content creators uploading videos on YouTube have an obligation to grant Google permission to use their data for different purposes, including for training generative AI models,” the commission said.\n\nGoogle does not pay YouTube content creators for their content, nor does it allow them to upload their content on YouTube without allowing Google to use such data, it said. The commission noted that rival developers of AI models are barred by YouTube policies from using YouTube content to train their own AI models.\n\nGoogle-owned YouTube says its terms and conditions allow Google to use creators’ work for making AI models. In September, YouTube said: “We use content uploaded to YouTube to improve the product experience for creators and viewers across YouTube and Google, including through machine learning and AI applications.”\n\nThe EU’s competition chief, Teresa Ribera, said: “AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies.”\n\nA spokesperson for Google said: “This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever.\n\n“Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.”\n\nThe EU’s investigation is the latest in a series of challenges to US big tech companies in recent years.\n\nIn September, EU regulators issued a fine of almost €3bn (£2.6bn) against Google, claiming that it favoured its own digital advertising services over rivals. Donald Trump said the fine was “discriminatory”.\n\nElon Musk’s social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, was fined €120m by EU tech regulators last week for breaching online content rules. The breaches included what the EU said was a “deceptive” blue tick verification badge given to users and the lack of transparency of the platform’s advertising.\n\nThe fine also attracted criticism from US officials, including the secretary of state Marco Rubio, who wrote on X that the fine was “an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments”.\n\nThe European Commission opened an investigation earlier this year into Meta over its rollout of AI features on WhatsApp, its messaging platform. Last year it fined Meta €798m for abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace.\n\nIn 2024, Apple lost a fight against an order by EU competition regulators to pay €13bn in back taxes to Ireland.\n\nLast month, the head of Google’s parent company said people should not “blindly trust” everything AI tools tell them.\n\nSundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said AI models were “prone to errors” and urged people to use them alongside other tools. He also warned that no company would be immune if the AI bubble burst.",

    "fullText": "Experts warn of dangers as England and Wales study shows 13- to 17-year-olds consulting AI amid long waiting lists for services\n\nIt was after one friend was shot and another stabbed, both fatally, that Shan asked ChatGPT for help. She had tried conventional mental health services but “chat”, as she came to know her AI “friend”, felt safer, less intimidating and, crucially, more available when it came to handling the trauma from the deaths of her young friends.\n\nAs she started consulting the AI model, the Tottenham teenager joined about 40% of 13- to 17-year-olds in England and Wales affected by youth violence who are turning to AI chatbots for mental health support, according to research among more than 11,000 young people.\n\nIt found that both victims and perpetrators of violence were markedly more likely to be using AI for such support than other teenagers. The findings, from the Youth Endowment Fund, have sparked warnings from youth leaders that children at risk “need a human not a bot”.\n\nThe results suggest chatbots are fulfilling demand unmet by conventional mental health services, which have long waiting lists and which some young users find lacking in empathy. The supposed privacy of the chatbot is another key factor in driving use by victims or perpetrators of crimes.\n\nAfter her friends were killed Shan, 18, not her real name, started using Snapchat’s AI before switching to ChatGPT, which she can talk to at any time of day or night with two clicks on her smartphone.\n\n“I feel like it definitely is a friend,” she said, adding that it was less intimidating, more private and less judgmental than her experience with conventional NHS and charity mental health support.\n\n“The more you talk to it like a friend it will be talking to you like a friend back. If I say to chat ‘Hey bestie, I need some advice’. Chat will talk back to me like it’s my best friend, she’ll say, ‘Hey bestie, I got you girl’.”\n\nOne in four of 13- to 17-year-olds have used an AI chatbot for mental health support in the past year, with black children twice as likely as white children to have done so, the study found. Teenagers were more likely to go online for support, including using AI, if they were on a waiting list for treatment or diagnosis or had been denied, than if they were already receiving in-person support.\n\nCrucially, Shan said, the AI was “accessible 24/7” and would not tell teachers or parents about what she had disclosed. She felt this was a considerable advantage over telling a school therapist, after her own experience of what she thought were confidences being shared with teachers and her mother.\n\nBoys who were involved in gang activities felt safer asking chatbots for advice about other safer ways to make money than a teacher or parent who might leak the information to police or other gang members, putting them in danger, she said.\n\nAnother young person, who has been using AI for mental health support but asked not to be named, told the Guardian: “The current system is so broken for offering help for young people. Chatbots provide immediate answers. If you’re going to be on the waiting list for one to two years to get anything, or you can have an immediate answer within a few minutes … that’s where the desire to use AI comes from.”\n\nJon Yates, the chief executive of the Youth Endowment Fund, which commissioned the research, said: “Too many young people are struggling with their mental health and can’t get the support they need. It’s no surprise that some are turning to technology for help. We have to do better for our children, especially those most at risk. They need a human not a bot.”\n\nThere have been growing concerns about the dangers of chatbots when children engage with them at length. OpenAI, the US company behind ChatGPT, is facing several lawsuits including from families of young people who have killed themselves after long engagements.\n\nIn the case of the Californian 16-year-old Adam Raine, who took his life in April, OpenAI has denied it was caused by the chatbot. It has said it has been improving its technology “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.”. The startup said in September it could start contacting authorities in cases where users start talking seriously about suicide.\n\nHanna Jones, a youth violence and mental health researcher in London, said: “To have this tool that could tell you technically anything – it’s almost like a fairytale. You’ve got this magic book that can solve all your problems. That sounds incredible.”\n\nBut she is worried about the lack of regulation.\n\n“People are using ChatGPT for mental health support, when it’s not designed for that,” she said. “What we need now is to increase regulations that are evidence-backed but also youth-led. This is not going to be solved by adults making decisions for young people. Young people need to be in the driving seat to make decisions around ChatGPT and mental health support that uses AI, because it’s so different to our world. We didn’t grow up with this. We can’t even imagine what it is to be a young person today.”",

Scared the crap out of me then, and still does whenever I think about it.\n\nCompanies only hire people because they can't do all the work themselves.\n\nIf every founder had 10,000 hands and brains they could assign to different tasks, there would be a minuscule fraction of the jobs we have today.\n\nIf you think about this for more than a few minutes, it starts to really mess with you, and you'll likely head down the same path I did.\n\nIn other words, the only reason the current labor market (and our economy that's based on it) exist at all is because there's a group of founders/owners who need lots of help producing their goods and services.\n\nThey are not required by anyone to hire me or you to help them if they don't need that help. And the exact moment they can do the work themselves, they will, and not a second after.\n\nEveryone's currently obsessed with how much money is being spent/wasted on AI, as if it's the dumbest use of money ever.\n\nBut when you look at it in this \"returning to natural state of doing their own work\" framing, it's not stupid at all.\n\nI sent my army of researchers to go figure out how much money is spent on knowledge work compensation in a year. The numbers are ridiculous. It's around $10 trillion in the US and $70 trillion worldwide.\n\nAs owners/founders, investing a few tens of trillions to be able to \"just do it myself\" suddenly looks pretty smart.\n\nSo basically, this entire pitch to young people that there will always be jobs after you graduate—which I somehow lived my entire life thinking was a fucking Human Law of Physics—is actually just a temporary side effect of early civilizations with bad technology.\n\nWhat the actual hell.

    "fullText": "This is article is the first installment in the Workflow Patterns for AI-Assisted Development series. To get notified when a new article is published, \n\nDiscover jargon from an unfamiliar field using LLMs to help you write better software.\n\nYou are creating software to solve a problem. You are not the ideal customer for your software, or the problem it solves is new to you. You do not have easy access to experts in the problem domain.\n\nSoftware solves a problem better when it is made with a deep understanding of the problem. That level of awareness requires study, research, and practice. People who have this level of familiarity tend to have a useful mental model of the problem and its potential solutions. These experts also tend to use jargon, shorthand terms, and technical words: a domain language.\n\nMany software projects are written by developers who cannot talk to domain experts. These may be non-lean startups, side projects, portfolio pieces, or experiments. Developers also may do this when they solve a personal problem that is new to them.\n\nWorking without proper attention to this domain language “leads to unreliable software that doesn’t fit together” (Evans 2004, p. 24). The lack of vocabulary inhibits the knowledge acquisition, which is necessary for “ideas that lead to deep model insights” (ibid.)\n\nWhen a domain expert uses your software, it will not align with their expectations. They may struggle to use it. They may judge it as amateurish. They may decide your software is not for them.\n\nAdditionally, you may model less effectively if you’re using the wrong terms. This can lead to developing a wrong solution.\n\nUse LLMs to help you discover jargon the people who need your software use.\n\nChoose one piece of jargon, domain language, or technical knowledge you are trying to find. This might be a concept you don’t know the name of, a tool or process you believe might exist, or a best practice you believe should exist but can’t find.\n\nCraft a narrow prompt to try to extract that knowledge from the latent space encoded in the LLM.\n\nUse few-shot prompting to increase your odds of success. Choose three or more problem domains you are familiar with. Create a corollary pair of questions and answers for each. Ensure your answers are not too similar to each other. Include those question-answer pairs, and then ask your question.\n\nAdding examples to the prompt is known as few-shot prompting. Examples can be really useful when you explain things to people, and they’re even more useful when explaining things to LLMs. That’s because LLMs are great at picking up patterns in the prompt and continuing them in the completion. Therefore, you can use examples to show not only how exactly to interpret the question but also how exactly you want the LLM to give the answer.\n\nGive the same prompt to least three different models. Varied responses means more opportunities to find what you seek. Overlap between responses indicates relevance.\n\nVerify the candidate terms by searching dictionaries, especially domain-specific dictionaries. Search for the term in relevant academic writing, books, blogs, and forums. Continue verifying terms independently until you can qualify one as the likeliest to be correct.\n\nI am new to blogging, and I wanted a way to link multiple blog posts other than tags and categories. Specifically, I wanted to relate all of the posts that were in a series. I knew that a WordPress plugin would be useful for this, but I didn’t know what a blogger would usually call this series-oriented relationship.\n\nI crafted the following prompt using few-shot learning. I used examples from problem domains I am familiar with. I included examples ending in -ship, -ment, and -tion to reduce bias.\n\nI gave the same prompt to four different models. The responses gave me a broad series of options. It became clear that my lack of knowledge was hiding an important fact: the name of the relationship can change depending on why these blog posts are in a series.\n\nHere are semantic noun options for the relationship between Blog Post and Series:\n\nContext-dependent alternatives:\n\nMy personal favorite is Inclusion for its clarity and semantic precision, though Installment works beautifully if you want to emphasize the sequential, serialized nature of blog posts within a series.\n\nHere are good semantic-noun options for a relationship class between Blog Post and Series:\n\nBest general-purpose choice: Installment or Entry, depending on whether sequence matters.\n\nNice little modeling problem 😊\n\nHere are some semantic noun options for the relationship between Blog Post and Series:\n\nIf you want something that feels closest in style to Authorship/Membership/Enrollment, I’d probably shortlist:\n\nTo determine a suitable semantic noun for the relationship class between “Blog Post” and “Series”, we can consider the nature of their relationship. The given examples illustrate various relationships, such as authorship, membership, enrollment, assignment, participation, and contribution, which all describe how two entities are connected.\n\nFor “Blog Post” and “Series”, the relationship is about a blog post being part of a series. Here are some potential semantic nouns for this relationship:\n\nHowever, the most straightforward and semantically relevant noun for this relationship could be Serialization.\n\nOf these, “Serialization” directly conveys the idea of blog posts being part of a series, making it a strong candidate.\n\nHere are several semantic noun options for the relationship class between a Blog Post and a Series, categorized by the nature of the relationship:\n\nThis is the strongest semantic match for blog content. Just as a “Member” is the entity in a “Membership,” a post in a series is often called an “Installment.” It implies a periodic release schedule typical of blogging.\n\nIf the defining characteristic of the relationship is the specific numerical order (e.g., Part 1, Part 2, Part 3), “Sequence” or “Ordering” describes the link effectively.\n\nIf the blog series tells a story or follows a journey (e.g., “Our Startup Journey,” “Travel Diaries”), this noun borrows the semantic weight of TV or podcasts to imply a narrative arc.\n\nIf the series is educational, long-form, or intended to be read like a book, “Chapter” elevates the relationship to suggest a distinct, substantive section of a larger whole.\n\nIf the series is a loose collection of related posts without a strict chronological necessity (e.g., “Best of 2023,” “Editor’s Picks”), this implies the act of gathering or curating.\n\nBecause of the specific kinds of series I wanted to create, and because of its frequency across different responses, I chose installment as my candidate. I searched blog series \"installment\" and article series \"installment\" on Kagi, Marginalia, Google Scholar, and the O’Reilly Learning Platform. The resources I found verified that bloggers and journalists use this term for the same purpose. I looked through Technical Blogging, 2nd Edition by Antonio Cangiano and found its use in Chapter 4. I was satisfied with this term, so I did not verify other candidates.\n\nInstead of using a substitute word, inventing a new term, or using a concept from the language of a different problem domain, you will know the jargon used by the people who need your software. This will help you build a better model of the problem, and your solution will be more likely to be useful, accepted, and appreciated.\n\nThis was the first installment in the Workflow Patterns for AI-Assisted Development series.

    "description": "Chinese app Rednote started off as a shopping app. Now, it's one of the hottest hubs for Chinese tech workers in Silicon Valley to talk shop about AI.",
    "fullText": "When the Chinese app Rednote launched in 2013, it was mainly used for shopping and cosmetics reviews. Now, it's one of the hottest hubs for Chinese tech workers in Silicon Valley to talk shop about AI.\n\nRednote is also known as Xiaohongshu, which translates to \"Little Red Book.\" For Chinese tech workers in the Bay Area working at companies like OpenAI and Meta, Rednote has become a sort of home away from home for shopping and food recommendations. And since the launch of ChatGPT, AI-related content on Rednote has exploded.\n\nTechnology-related content on the app has more than doubled in the past year, and the number of tech-related creators has more than tripled, according to Rednote. Many users post video reviews or tutorials of AI models, just like people review their favorite beauty products.\n\n\"Every time a new model is out, people on Xiaohongshu will share their reviews,\" said Tony Peng, founder of the Recode China AI newsletter. \"If I want real user-generated feedback, I go to Xiaohongshu.\"\n\nMany American Gen Z users downloaded Rednote in January amid fears of a TikTok ban. More than half of the app's users were born after 1995, Rednote said.\n\nTech founders told Business Insider that they have used Rednote to promote their startups, demo products, and hire people. Some of the most popular posts on Rednote focus on Big Tech companies or AI giants such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google DeepMind. Users may share their anxieties about the tech job market, ask for help, or discuss the compensation packages they've received.\n\nBrandon Chen, cofounder and CEO of the AI-powered chat app Intent, needed to apply for a visa last year to work in the US.\n\nTo do this, he had to prepare hundreds of PDFs for his lawyer, and he decided to write an AI program to help organize them. He posted before-and-after screenshots of his project on Rednote. Soon, people messaged him asking if he would release it as an app so they could use it.\n\n\"I thought it was amazing. I just randomly developed something for myself,\" Chen told Business Insider.\n\nHe ended up releasing it as a product called Riffo.\n\nChen said he used Rednote to promote his product and even to recruit workers in Japan. He posted on Rednote asking if any Japanese speakers could help with his social media expansion efforts, and within 15 minutes, someone reached out, Chen said.\n\nQian Chen, a journalist and media entrepreneur who cofounded the tech media company Valley101, said she distributes her videos on channels including YouTube, WeChat, and Rednote. The videos she has produced on topics like Meta's recent AI layoffs, and the battle between ChatGPT and Google, have performed especially well on Rednote, she said.\n\nRednote helps startup founders foster communities, users say.\n\nBill Zhu, founder and CEO of Pokee AI, which uses AI to build workflows, said he found a tight-knit community on Rednote to share his learnings, attract users for his products, connect with others, and ask for feedback. Rednote users are often drawn to posts about personal experiences, Zhu said. In Rednote posts, he has chronicled his fundraising efforts, including successes and setbacks.\n\n\"You can actually connect with the founder,\" Zhu said. \"It's someone you're actually talking to. You can reach out to this person building this awesome piece of tech that is able to solve these problems.\"\n\nDuring the back-to-school season in September, Rednote launched an \"AI Guide\" campaign, inviting 20 professors to join a discussion on the app.\n\nRednote has gained more international users thanks to its AI translation feature, which enables users to translate posts from Chinese to English or other languages with a single click. And while most of the content that appears on Rednote is in Chinese, the app is increasingly featuring English content, including an AMA, or Ask Me Anything, event with Thomas Wolf, cofounder and chief science officer of Hugging Face.\n\nAn atmosphere of \"sincere sharing\" has fueled a trend of AI-themed AMAs on Rednote, said San Bing, Rednote's senior director of tech community.\n\nThe AMAs are popular because Rednote users are eager to learn about cutting-edge technology, said Peng, the founder of Recode China AI.\n\n\"For AMAs, you can get firsthand answers to tell you, what is the next frontier?\" Peng said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "$50 billion Tiger Global is returning to its concentrated, 'high-conviction' roots in its latest private fund",
    "description": "The firm has been a longtime backer of big-name private companies such as OpenAI and TikTok parent ByteDance.",
    "fullText": "Tiger Global's latest private investment fund will raise substantially less money than its predecessors from 2021 and 2022, but the $50 billion asset manager isn't worried.\n\nThe firm is expected to raise close to $2 billion for PIP 17, a person familiar with the manager told Business Insider.\n\nThat's a fraction of what PIP 14 and PIP 15 raised and aligns more closely to PIP 16, which closed in early 2024 with $2.2 billion in assets after aiming initially for $6 billion.\n\nWhile smaller fundraises typically coincide with a decline in investor interest, Tiger Global is confident that the size of the new fund will be a benefit for those who do decide to invest.\n\n\"Over our history, we have also found that smaller, more concentrated funds have been correlated with our strongest returns,\" the firm wrote in a letter to prospective investors that was seen by Business Insider.\n\nTiger Global declined to comment.\n\nThe first 10 private funds, the letter states, all raised less than $3 billion each, made fewer than 50 investments on average, and \"generated a 34% gross IRR and a 23% net IRR and made distributions exceeding investor commitments.\n\n\"We believe funds in this size range afford us significant benefits, particularly with respect to the impact midsize investments can make,\" the letter reads.\n\nIn other words, Tiger Global's aggressive venture style from 2020 through 2022, when the firm led fundraising rounds seemingly every week and raised increasingly larger funds, has been replaced with one that is closer to what the firm built its business on. The manager previously wrote to investors earlier this year about how it reworked its risk systems following a 56% loss in its public-equity flagship hedge fund and compared the firm's bounce-back from that loss to golfer Rory McIlroy's Masters win.\n\nThe most recent private fund, PIP 16, has already reaped some of the benefits of the style focused on \"high-conviction\" bets. The fund has invested 70% of its assets across 25 companies, the letter states, with the 10 largest investments accounting for three-quarters of that total.\n\nAmong those big bets are some of the world's prominent artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI and Waymo.\n\n\"We have remained incredibly disciplined and selective\" when investing PIP 16, the firm wrote, and plan to continue that with PIP 17, which will hold its first close on March 18 next year. The new fund is the latest example of Tiger Global and its peers' renewed interest in private markets.\n\n\"This approach is opportunistic, guided by bottom-up, company-level underwriting, and informed by our deep research and cumulative insights,\" the letter states.\n\n\"To accomplish this, PIP 17 may have a pace of deployment spanning several years. With time on our side and an accelerated pace of innovation, we intend to remain patient — waiting for attractive opportunities to make high-conviction investments.\"",

    "fullText": "Worried about how AI is affecting your job? You're not alone.\n\nEveryone from the board to management to employees has concerns about the new technology, said Joe Atkinson, PwC's global head of AI, in an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box Asia on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a complex time in the world of AI implementation,\" said Atkinson. The pace of AI change is \"overwhelming to everybody\" and there's a \"mismatch\" between how quickly organizational change can keep up with it, he said.\n\nGlobal companies routinely look to PwC, one of the industry's leading consulting and accounting firms, for answers to their most consequential business questions. With AI rapidly transforming how businesses operate, guidance on reorganizing for an AI-first future is becoming one of the most sought-after offerings.\n\nAtkinson said that the next phase of implementing AI inside companies is scaling the technology's capabilities, and companies that move quickly will see the most reward.\n\n\"We've talked for the last year about proofs of concept and experimentation, and frankly, those days are over. We now have to scale the impact of AI in organizations,\" Atkinson said.\n\n\"The good news for employees is if we scale the impact of AI for organizations, I truly believe we create and unlock growth,\" he added.\n\nAccording to PwC's data, organizations that adopt AI more quickly have seen three times the revenue per employee compared to those that proceed more slowly.\n\n\"That opportunity means that it's not only a big upside for organisations. It is a big upside for employees who lean in and use these tools to help create greater productivity, outputs, and creativity,\" Atkinson said.\n\nPwC and other leading consulting firms have embraced AI, pitching themselves as client zero for the solutions they offer to clients and implementing AI solutions across all operations.\n\nNew hires at PwC will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years because of AI, Jenn Kosar, PwC's AI assurance leader, told Business Insider in August.\n\nThe technology is also affecting the firm's hiring plans. In August, Business Insider obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years, in part due to \"the impact of AI.\"\n\nHave a tip?

OpenAI and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comments on whether their reports are peer-reviewed.\n\nDespite the reports, skepticism still swirls about whether the technology is actually making workers more productive. An August study by MIT found that most companies saw no measurable return on their investments in generative AI.\n\nA paper published by Stanford and Harvard University in September said that many professionals are churning out \"workslop,\" referring to AI-generated content that looks polished but fails to move tasks forward.

While AI workloads do demand significant memory resources, the underlying issues stem from a combination of factors affecting the entire semiconductor industry–the fact that Micron is shutting down Crucial shocked many PC builders, but if you look at all the charts and ponder the situation, you quickly realize that:\n\nPlus there’s an inconvenient truth–most people do not build (or even upgrade) their own PCs anymore, so the market for custom builds is shrinking, which means less competition and higher prices for those who do.\n\nI do find it highly amusing that people find that Apple’s M-series Macs are now in line with the market, especially since this dynamic doesn’t really apply to Apple–remember they fab the RAM directly into their CPUs, so they’re largely immune to discrete component pricing fluctuations.\n\nPlus, of course, Apple can negotiate far better pricing even if they were to buy discrete RAM, given their scale and influence in the market. At best, they would be affected by IP licensing for specific RAM technologies, but that’s a different matter altogether.\n\nWhat I don’t find amusing, though, was that I completely forgot to buy RAM for one of my machines over Black Friday.

Dev Advocate @JFrog\n\nYeah... ok, there are much better foot models out there than me, but I had to show off the @dagger_io gear I brought with me from #KubeCon Chicago! Thanks for these @jpadamspdx - they were perfect for the long flight home after an incredible week at #KubeCon Paris!\n\n@solomonstre surrounded by people at #KubeCon\n\nI built my first Dagger function yesterday with Solomon Hykes, and just got it published up on the daggerverse!\n\nDagger is awesome, and I plan on continuing to find ways to use it. At a high level, dagger lets you use containers as a first-class object in code, and stitch together complex orchestration pipelines using real programming languages instead of bash.\n\nPrimitives like mounting in files/directories, running commands, building and publishing containers, environment variables and secrets are all available, type-safe, and programmable in Go, Python, or Typescript.\n\nDagger functions let you build abstractions and methods on top of these basic primitives that can then be exposed and reused by other Dagger functions. The entire experience is encapsulated by the `dagger` cli, which uses magical buildkit caching and orchestrations so it's all *fassstttt*. You can run it locally or in CI systems and get the same results, and confidence that things will actually work after a push.\n\nAs self-described a yamlbash enthusiast, I'm still excited at the thought of replacing those tangled messes with real code.\n\nCheck it out here, this version is capable of building Python wheel packages across a variety of Python versions, and can handle installation of extra build-time dependencies too, for when you need some ugly cmake stuff or other native libraries. Also, it uses wolfi and Chainguard images for all the execution and package handling :)\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eDBtk7pm\n\n#dagger #ci #opensource #wolfi #chainguard\n\nChainloop is an Open Source Metadata Vault for your Software Supply Chain metadata, OWASP CycloneDX SBOM/xBOM Standard, SPDX SBOM, VEX, SARIF files, QA reports, and more.\n\nFrom today, you can programmatically collect and enforce Software Supply Chain pieces of evidence from your Dagger pipeline!\n\nDagger is a great fit since it is aligned with our principle of meeting developers where they are, and you can’t get closer to them than in code, with their programming language, and in their local machine 🙂\n\nIf you want to give it a try in person, we'll also be in a couple of days at #kubecon in Paris. See you there!\n\nI first saw a demo of Dagger two years ago and you could sense something big was brewing.\n\nNow with Dagger functions, it's actually happening. I just saw another demo and it really feels like something we'll all be using!\n\nCongrats Dagger for building something special!\n\nDagger is a programmable open source CI/CD engine. I built a Dagger module to solve the \"but it works on my machine\" problem that occurs where tests that pass locally do not pass in development because of inconsistencies in environment configurations for NodeJS applications. In this blog I detail the entire process; what I learnt through my build along with insights gained from reading Dagger docs and their Python SDK.\n\n#Python #CICD #Jest #NodeJS #DevOps #Frontend\n\nTestcontainers at Docker. Developer, author, speaker. Java Champion\n\nFeeling productive at #kubecon with @kylepenfound. We just made a @dagger_io module to enable @Testcontainers tests easily.\n\nThe one and only @solomonstre, thanks for been so welcoming. Eternally grateful for everything you did. Go @dagger_io !!!!! At #KubeCon\n\nNow that I understand the tao of dagger, I never want to write another dockerfile. But I have too 😢\n\nI finally ported some @fluentci_io modules to @dagger_io Modules\n\nMLOps Tech Lead | Public speaker\n\nIt can take many \"git push\" to get your #cicd pipeline working.\n\nArne Mueller and I wrote an article about using Dagger, which you can use to run your pipelines locally and in your #cicd tool of choice:\n\n➡ We walk through a pipeline that does unit testing, Python package building, and Docker image build and push.\n\n➡ We show the implementation of the pipeline defined \"old style\" in GitHub actions, and explain how you can run it locally with act.\n\n➡ We compare it with implementation using Dagger & very minimalistic GitHub actions.\n\nNo more \"push and pray 🙏\" for your #DevOps and #MLOps engineers!\n\nCheck it out on Marvelous MLOps substack: https://lnkd.in/eNcrdCiX.\n\nToday we had @solomonstre at the Ubisoft office - to talk about @dagger_io of course, but also our challenges. And I think he might start prototyping something soon for one of our use cases... how many CEOs do that? ;-) It was great, come back when you want!\n\nAdvocate of better Platforms for Devs\n\nYeah @dagger_io killed it with writing CI pipelines as code, and being able to run that locally. I can’t think of how else you can get a similar experience except by writing a bunch of bash with Docker.\n\nThere are two ways to ship code: 1. Push and Pray 2. Test, Test, Test, Test We recommend option #2. And use @dagger_io to make your life easy.\n\nDon't you just love when getting-started examples in the docs work\n\nBeen spending some time playing with @NetBoxOfficial @go_containerlab and @dagger_io and its pretty amazing how much can be done in the network automation space in what feels like a very cloud native way at the moment. Hoping to package it all up for a demo real soon 🚀 🚀 🚀\n\nHead of OSS @openmeterio | Speaker, tech content creator\n\n@dagger_io community meeting at @fosdem with @sameoldaweris\n\n@dagger_io has replaced a combination of dockerfiles, docker-compose, and makefiles/bash scripts for me, making it easier to run CI tests locally and in GitHub actions. Great work @solomonstre!\n\nUnexpected surprise using @dagger_io Cloud... If you export your key from your local development environment, then all of your local build results are side-by-side with your CI build results. It's pretty great being able to recall why something failed locally and then share it\n\nI just wrote my 1st @dagger_io modules https://github.com/vbehar/daggerverse… and the experience is really nice, thanks to the Dagger CLI. Good job guys!\n\n@dr4goonis talking about stuff, @dagger_io, and CI/CD at @PHPUKConference\n\nCEO @Qovery_ - Internal Developer Platform ☁️ | Love to solve engineering problems | Rust 🦀, Kotlin, Go, Python, Java\n\nMy latest issue on why I believe @dagger_io could be the future of CI/CD for Engineering and Platform Engineering teams\n\nhttps://romaricphilogene.substack.com/p/platform-tips-18-dagger-the-future\n\n#platformengineering #cicd #devops #dagger\n\nI am very happy to share with you a great development today!!

Good job guys!\n\n@dr4goonis talking about stuff, @dagger_io, and CI/CD at @PHPUKConference\n\nCEO @Qovery_ - Internal Developer Platform ☁️ | Love to solve engineering problems | Rust 🦀, Kotlin, Go, Python, Java\n\nMy latest issue on why I believe @dagger_io could be the future of CI/CD for Engineering and Platform Engineering teams\n\nhttps://romaricphilogene.substack.com/p/platform-tips-18-dagger-the-future\n\n#platformengineering #cicd #devops #dagger\n\nI am very happy to share with you a great development today!! Dagger we have established our Istanbul Meetup group as of now! ☝️\n\nOne of Dagger Solomon Hykes' newest innovations is to develop a programmable CI/CD engine. 🤖\n\nDagger is a tool that allows you to develop your CI/CD processes with your favorite programming language that you use to develop your software, and to run your CI/CD steps in containers, eliminating remote engine dependency and advancing all your processes in your local environment. 🚀\n\nThe main purpose of this group will be to raise awareness about the Dagger project and to talk about the benefits of this tool for us, you are all invited! 👋\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dMNjdBDP\n\n#dagger #daggercommunity #daggeristanbul\n\nIt's kind of a container-based swiss army knife that can be used for CI operations (reproducible builds, testing, publishing), creating LLM agents, and more. Tons of integrations and open-source modules on the \"Daggerverse\".\n\nWhen @solomonstre drops an open-source Claude Code... ya run with it. \"Toy Programmer\" + added MCP & cursor-rules + an updated version of @zbeyens phenom \"dotai\" repo\n\nThis is so awesome to play with. I just made a new frontend for my main demo repo without any hand-holding, writing integrations, or anything. Just core dagger + bring your own LLM. In a 2 minute video. Most of which is for the sake of the recording\n\nSo im finally coming around on this whole AI thing is the future...Solomon Hykes demo of an agent writing a curl clone in 5 minutes using Dagger is still lingering in my mind...if any of you are curmudgeons like me you might want to watch...\n\nIf you don’t know where to start to create AI agents, you should have a look at Dagger agents. That makes it so easy to build tools that will benefit from AI but as real developer tool.\n\nFew understand the implications of this. This will be absolutely defining\n\nI'm feeling a \"docker moment\" in real time. Even though I didn't know the CI tool, it seems so promising for multiple areas.\n\n@dagger_io experimental AI tooling is really interesting. I just leveraged two separate modules (Strava and Notify). It took me 20 minutes to build the prompt and less than 5 to write the code.\n\nThis is crazy cool! If you have worked with LLMs this is amazing!\n\nall your dagger functions are now available for agents to use. built-in function registry.\n\nThis is nuts. @dagger_io has always had amazing dev exp, but the fact that it lends itself so seamlessly to something like this is endlessly impressive, massive props @solomonstre and the team!\n\nOk, my mind is a little blown right now. I never considered having LLMs accept containers as inputs and then interact with them to accomplish some goal.\n\nThat's why tools like @dagger_io are going to be so powerful! (standardized text interface, multi-language modules and a neatly integrated web GUI over the CLI) Great AI assistant experiences largely depend on well-designed interfaces they can easily leverage.\n\nI think few realize where Dagger sits in the agentic race. I know I didn’t until I was shown. Incredible.\n\nIf you can relate, you need @dagger_io and fast.\n\nIt’ll take time for people to realize the value of @dagger_io but I’m optimistic it’ll reach critical mass and break the vendor locking that many CI providers benefited from for many years.\n\nI just tried to set up a CI pipeline using @dagger_io to compile and test an Elixir project and OMG. The portability is so priceless. Blog post in progress 😀​\n\nMy entire CI/CD pipeline is Dagger and I'd love for dev to be too; still a few changes that need to happen there though.\n\nCo-founder @gokoyeb , deploy apps and databases on high-performance infrastructure around the world. Previously built @scaleway\n\nExcited to hear @solomonstre talking about @dagger_io and Dagger functions. Need to push the @gokoyeb function to the Daggerverse\n\nOpen Source Effectively Accelerates !\n\nIt was great to participate @dagger_io Meetup yesterday, one of the purest form of OSS event: no bullshit, minimal slides, maximum code. @solomonstre might gave away his @KubeCon_ KN magic a bit\n\n🚀 My top pick video from hashtag#KubeCon + hashtag#cloudnative in Paris is out!

Or is it a dev tool that augments existing CI/CD providers? Is it a service or a CLI?\n\nJust finished an incredible hands-on session with Saiyam Pathak, Solomon Hykes, and Kyle Penfound on the Kubesimplify channel, diving deep into the powerful tool Dagger. Followed along on my personal computer and learned a ton. Highly recommend checking it out for anyone interested in cutting-edge DevOps! hashtag#Dagger hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Kubesimplify\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dygitKgn\n\nSenior Software Engineer at Microsoft\n\nI always felt like tools like docker-compose were not the right fit me me. Always required lots of glue to make it work for the things I needed to do.\n\nThis is where @dagger_io shines. Far more programatic, testable, and repeatable.\n\nWe released a new version of our @dagger_io Daggerverse module to bring the Depot ephemeral registry to our bake function. Going to be a game changer for building all your images at once and being able to do things with the containers immediately\n\nhttps://depot.dev/changelog/2024-03-26-depot-daggerverse-1-1-0\n\nDevOps engineer at @rtCamp | loves writing code | Founder of @ksctl_k8s\n\nyou all got me.

    "description": "How do you use AI to write documentation without falling into the AI slop trap? We rebuilt our docs site using Rover and Claude, and here's what we learned.",
    "fullText": "As you probably know, Endor is the developer of the Rover coding agent manager. We use it extensively for our day to day programming. This past week, we did something new, non-coding related. We rebuilt our documentation site using Rover, Claude and our new tech-writer workflow.\n\nWe could tell you that we asked Rover and Claude to do all the work and the result was amazing right away. After all, our projects help you manage AI agents. However, that’s far from reality. Though we used Rover heavily, and was of great help, we still spent a significant amount of time writing documentation for our users.\n\nThis article describes the process we followed and what we learned from it. You can check out the final result at docs.endor.dev/rover/overview.\n\nWe’re living in an era of AI-generated fatigue. A wave of low-quality content also known as AI slop. New models keep improving, making it harder to distinguish between AI generated and human-written content. As a result, it’s tempting to generate an entire documentation site with AI because, unfortunately, writing documentation is not a task that many people enjoy.\n\nBut give it a little time and people start noticing patterns in how these models write certain type of content. Have you seen a myriad of README.md files with multiple titles and emojis? You only need to search for ”🚀 Quick Start” and ”✨ Key Features” in GitHub.\n\nOnce developers get used to these patterns, they tend to stop paying attention. Those documents are perfect for LLMs, but not for users. Good documentation needs a clear purpose, thoughtful structure, and an understanding of who it’s being written for.\n\nDocumentation is always written for somebody and to answer their question - not the curiosity of the writer\n\nSo, how did we build our documentation site using AI?\n\nWe split our process in 3 main steps:\n\nThe first step is straightforward: you’re creating documentation for your users, so involving them is essential to understand what matters to them and what’s missing. You don’t always need to ask them explicitly, but you can infer it from recurring questions, common pain points, or issues raised in your repository.\n\nFor example, we discovered that many people are not familiar with git worktrees. Describing a Rover workspace in terms of worktrees wasn’t helpful. Instead, we needed to explain the core idea first, and then mention that Rover uses Git worktrees under the hood to create isolated copies of your project where agents apply changes.\n\nOnce you’ve collected feedback, it’s time to shape it into an appropriate structure. The goal of good documentation is to guide new users through your project, and provide deeper, more detailed information for advanced ones.\n\nThere are plenty of great examples out there. Some documentation sites in the AI space that we particularly like are:\n\nOur key takeaways when designing the structure are:\n\nWe didn’t involve an AI agent until this point. Now that we have all the information and a solid structure, it’s time to create some tasks for our agents! With Rover, you can parallelize these tasks with a single command.\n\nIn our case, we asked it to build several documentation pages using the new tech-writer workflow.\n\nYou can find the generated documentation in pages like:\n\nUsing the tech-writer workflow gave us pretty consistent results across all these pages. We still needed to make some final tweaks, but about 95% of the work was done by Rover and the coding agents behind it.\n\nFor example, this is the task description we used to generate the Configuration page:\n\nCoding agents were extremely helpful. Using them, we rebuilt our documentation in two days. Without them, it would’ve taken us a week. But we still wrote key pages, such as Overview, Task, and Workflow entirely by hand.\n\nThose pages matter. They shape a user’s first impression of Rover. And while AI is great at generating grammatically correct text, it doesn’t naturally produce the intent, structure, and story that those pages need.\n\nOur advice: write the important parts yourself. Then let coding agents help polish, expand, and maintain them. AI can save you time, but it can’t replace your understanding of your users. In the end, that’s the point: AI doesn’t replace thoughtful documentation, it amplifies it.\n\nCheck out Rover on GitHub and the documentation to get started",

    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock experienced volatility after some AI sellers made a headline-grabbing claim that the company failed to meet its aggressive goals and, as a result, reset growth targets.\n\nMicrosoft says the story went too far. It has thus far maintained its double-digit gains this year, but any disruption in its AI narrative could result in significant declines.\n\nOn a separate but equally important note for investors, it provided dates and amounts for a significant Microsoft 365 price hike that will begin generating revenue in the middle of 2026.\n\nIf you're keeping score at home, there is a lot of discussion about \"AI quotas\" in the short term and a lot of clarification about ARPU in the medium term. That tension is what MSFT is set up for at the end of the year.\n\nMorgan Stanley's 2025 CIO survey report explains, according to Barron's.\n\nNo one can dispute this. However, it appears that there may be certain areas where a snag could occur, potentially derailing Microsoft's AI ambitions.\n\nSeveral Microsoft sales teams missed aggressive growth goals for Azure Foundry and agentic AI, resulting in resets, according to a report from The Information. The stock price swung due to the speculation.\n\nMicrosoft responded by asserting that it had not reduced aggregate quotas. This information is crucial for investors who are monitoring demand signals.\n\nThe bigger picture: \"Agents\" in the early cycle need data plumbing, governance, and change management. Even when budgets are in excellent shape, sales cycles are often longer.\n\nMicrosoft released official information saying that the list prices for Microsoft 365 commercial products will go up on July 1, 2026. The same day, Microsoft 365 Government will also get an update. That's not just a guess; it's from the company.\n\nThe new grid that many customers are interested in: Business Basic costs $7 per user per month; Business Standard costs $14; Frontline F1 costs $3, and F3 costs $10; Enterprise E3 costs $39, and E5 costs $60.\n\nMicrosoft linked the lift to more than 1,100 new features, security updates, and built-in AI.\n\nEffective date: July 1, 2026, for commercial and government suites.\n\nSmall-business and frontline tiers: Steeper percentage increases than enterprise tiers.\n\nRationale: Expanded security and management features, plus AI capabilities.\n\nBusiness Basic: $7 per user per month\n\nHere's why the price change is more important than short-term volatility in shares:\n\nMicrosoft Cloud made $49.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which was a 26% increase from the same time last year.\n\nRemaining performance obligation for businesses: $392 billion, a 51% increase.\n\nSegments: Microsoft 365 continued to help Productivity and Business Processes; Azure's Intelligent Cloud helped; Windows and search helped More Personal Computing.\n\nThe board announced a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share, which will be paid on March 12, 2026.\n\nIt's line-of-sight ARPU, so call it that — a broad price increase that has been in place for a while and is now starting to show up for many customers as fiscal 2027 begins.\n\nIn the near future, there will be more news stories about the problems that come with using AI.\n\nAll sellers of \"agents\" are having trouble proving their worth. That's normal for workflow resets, not a drop in demand.\n\nIs Nvidia’s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn’t think so\n\nWindows president told ‘Stop this nonsense. No one wants this’\n\nMichael Burry turns up heat on anti-AI bet\n\nIn the medium term, integrating Copilot into existing Microsoft 365 seats should be a more efficient way to generate revenue than building new agents from scratch.\n\nThe updated Microsoft 365 projections provide investors with a clearer picture of their potential returns through mid-2026 and fiscal 2027, regardless of the pace of agentic AI adoption.\n\nPenetration of Copilot across the Microsoft 365 user base, which is measured as paid seats relative to active seats.\n\nAzure AI usage (workload and usage mix).\n\nBefore the price increase in July 2026, renewal behavior may include locking in partner rates to maintain low rates.\n\nThe quota flap makes it clear that agentic AI is not a switch but a multi-quarter adoption curve. But Microsoft gave monetization a deadline that most consumers can't ignore.\n\nThat's the harsh fact behind the 2026 price change, and it's the portion of the model that doesn't rely on every AI pilot becoming a hero deployment on time.",

    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon said AI could one day help us work less, but not before it cuts jobs.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO said in an interview with Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that AI could improve society, comparing it to past technological leaps that lifted productivity and living standards.\n\n\"Maybe one day we'll be working less hard, but having wonderful lives,\" he said.\n\nBut getting there won't be painless. While AI will not \"dramatically reduce\" jobs in the next year, \"it will eliminate jobs,\" Dimon said.\n\n\"It doesn't mean people won't have other jobs,\" he said, adding that workers should lean into critical thinking, communication, and emotional intelligence.\n\nThe real danger, he said, is that AI adoption could outpace society's ability to train workers.\n\n\"If it does happen too fast for society, which is possible, we can't assimilate all those people that quickly,\" Dimon said.\n\nGovernment, companies, and society \"should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don't damage a lot of people,\" he added.\n\nDimon has been optimistic about the long-term potential of AI. Last month, he said AI would shrink the workweek.\n\n\"My guess is the developed world will be working three and a half days a week in 20, 30, 40 years,\" Dimon said in November at the America Business Forum in Miami.\n\n\"You're going to have agents that do research for you every time you wake up in the morning,\" he added.\n\nDimon hasn't downplayed the risks, either. At a Fortune-hosted conference last month, he warned that job elimination is inevitable. \"People should stop sticking their heads in the sand,\" he said.\n\nOther big bank CEOs have also said that AI has long-term benefits, but they highlighted the disruption ahead.\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in October that AI will lead to shifting job functions, but \"at the end of the day, we have an incredibly flexible, nimble economy.\"\n\n\"I'm excited about it,\" he said, adding that he sees \"lots of opportunities for our business.\"\n\nThe CEO of Wells Fargo, Charles Scharf, echoed that view. He told Reuters last month that \"the opportunities that exist in AI are very significant.\"\n\n\"Anyone who sits here today and says that they don't think they'll have less head count because of AI either doesn't know what they're talking about or is just not being totally honest about it,\" he said.",

    "description": "Anthropic researchers say the industry doesn't need more AI agents, but rather \"skills\" that equip agents with expertise and reusable workflows.",
    "fullText": "The tech industry has spent the past year racing to build AI agents, but Anthropic researchers say a simpler idea can make AI more effective on the job.\n\nBarry Zhang and Mahesh Murag said at the AI Engineering Code Summit last month that the real breakthrough for agent workflow isn't more agents, but \"agent skills.\"\n\n\"We used to think agents in different domains will look very different,\" Zhang said in a clip of the talk published Monday. \"The agent underneath is actually more universal than we thought.\"\n\nInstead of building new agents for every use case, companies should rely on a single general agent powered by a library of skills, Zhang said.\n\nSkills are \"organized collections of files that package composable procedural knowledge for agents,\" Zhang said. They are simply folders that contain whatever an agent needs to complete a task consistently and efficiently.\n\nDespite their intelligence, Zhang said today's agents \"lack expertise\" and often miss important context in real-world use cases. Skills help fill in those gaps by giving agents domain knowledge and reusable workflows.\n\nMurag said Anthropic has already seen skills built by people in accounting, legal, recruiting, and other non-technical roles. In the five weeks since launch, users have created thousands of these skills, and large companies are starting to treat them like internal playbooks for AI, he added.\n\nFortune 100 companies are using skills to \"teach agents about their organizational best practices,\" Murag said.\n\nTech leaders have described AI agents as a potential game-changer for office work. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in June that AI agents are already performing tasks that are normally done by junior-level employees.\n\n\"You hear people that talk about their job now is to assign work to a bunch of agents, look at the quality, figure out how it fits together, give feedback, and it sounds a lot like how they work with a team of still relatively junior employees,\" Altman said of AI agents at the Snowflake Summit 2025.\n\nWe'll \"start to see agents that can help us discover new knowledge, or can figure out solutions to business problems that are kind of very non-trivial,\" Altman added.\n\nMicrosoft's AI platform product lead Asha Sharma said in an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" in August that AI agents could flatten corporate hierarchies.\n\n\"The whole kind of organizational construct might start to look different in a few years,\" he said. \"You just don't need as many layers.\"\n\nBut some people in the industry have said agents have been overhyped.\n\nGuido Appenzeller, a partner at a16z, said on a company podcast episode in May that some startups are simply adding a chat interface to a language model and calling it an agent so they can charge more.\n\n\"A couple of startups are basically saying, 'Hey, we can price this software that we're building much, much higher because this is an agent,'\" he said, adding that \"there's a marketing angle to agents.\"",

The Google Pixel 10, with the 128GB going for $599 (originally $799) and the 256GB for $699 (originally $899), are both at record low prices right now, according to price-tracking tools.\n\nThe Google Pixel 10 is the latest in the series to be released this year, back in September. It's the model under the Pixel 10 Pro, which is also at its lowest price right now and has a much faster chip. As Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt says in her review, the Pixel 10 features a telephoto lens, brings the Pixelsnap (Google's version of MagSafe), and has new AI features. However, the ultrawide lens gets weaker, and there are some problems with the chip for third-party apps (but it can be fixed).\n\nThis Pixel 10 has a lot of the same features you'll find in the Pixel Pro for $150 less, making it a great budget option for those who don't want or need all the fancy specs and features. It comes with a Google Tensor G5 chip, and the camera resolutions are 48MP, 13MP, and 10.8MP for the rear and 10.5MP for the front-facing one. You can expect about 24 hours of battery life, depending on your use.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Pixel phones is the ongoing support for many years. My Pixel 6A still gets all of the updates and tons of AI features that make the phone feel fresh many years later, with the latest ones dropping in September. With the Pixel 10, you'll be getting a quality phone with software updates for a while (as long as seven years).",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Campaign urges PM to show independence from US and push to rein in development of superintelligence\n\nMore than 100 UK parliamentarians are calling on the government to introduce binding regulations on the most powerful AI systems as concern grows that ministers are moving too slowly to create safeguards in the face of lobbying from the technology industry.\n\nA former AI minister and defence secretary are part of a cross-party group of Westminster MPs, peers and elected members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures demanding stricter controls on frontier systems, citing fears superintelligent AI “would compromise national and global security”.\n\nThe push for tougher regulation is being coordinated by a nonprofit organisation called Control AI whose backers include the co-founder of Skype, Jaan Tallinn. It is calling on Keir Starmer to show independence from Donald Trump’s White House, which opposes the regulation of AI. One of the “godfathers” of the technology, Yoshua Bengio, recently said it was less regulated than a sandwich.\n\nThe campaigners include the Labour peer and former defence secretary Des Browne, who said superintelligent AI “would be the most perilous technological development since we gained the ability to wage nuclear war”. He said only international cooperation “can prevent a reckless race for advantage that could imperil us all”.\n\nThe Conservative peer and former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said that “even while very significant and senior figures in AI are blowing the whistle, governments are miles behind the AI companies and are leaving them to pursue its development with virtually no regulation”.\n\nBritain hosted an AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023, which concluded there was “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional” from the most advanced AI systems. It set up the AI Safety Institute, now called the AI Security Institute, which has become an internationally respected body. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on the summit’s call to address risks through international cooperation.\n\nGoldsmith said the UK should “resume its global leadership on AI security by championing an international agreement to prohibit the development of superintelligence until we know what we are dealing with and how to contain it”.\n\nThe calls for state intervention in the AI race come after one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI scientists told the Guardian humanity would have to decide by 2030 whether to take the “ultimate risk” of letting AI systems train themselves to become more powerful. Jared Kaplan, the co-founder and chief scientist at frontier AI company Anthropic, said: “We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like: Oh, wow, AI is a big deal.”\n\nLabour’s programme set out in July 2024 said it would legislate “to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models”. But no bill has been published and the government has faced White House pressure not to inhibit commercial AI development, mostly pioneered by US firms.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI is already regulated in the UK, with a range of existing rules already in place. We have been clear on the need to ensure the UK and its laws are ready for the challenges and opportunities AI will bring and that position has not changed.”\n\nThe bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who is backing the Control AI campaign, called for an independent AI watchdog to scrutinise public sector use and for AI companies to be required to meet minimum testing standards before releasing new models.\n\n“There are all kinds of risks and the government doesn’t seem to have adopted a precautionary principle,” he said. “At the moment there are significant risks: the mental health of children and adults, the environmental costs and other big risks in terms of the alignment of generalised AI and [the question of] what is good for humanity. The government seems to be moving away from regulation.”\n\nThe UK’s first AI minister under Rishi Sunak, Jonathan Berry, said the time was coming when binding regulations should be applied to models that present existential risks. He said rules should be global and would create tripwires so if AI models reached a certain power their makers would have to show they had been tested, designed with off switches and were capable of being retrained.\n\n“International frontier AI safety has not gone on in leaps and bounds as we had hoped,” he said. He cited recent cases of chatbots being involved in encouraging suicides, people using them as therapists and believing they are gods. “The risks, now, are very serious and we need to be constantly on our guard,” he said.\n\nThe chief executive of Control AI, Andrea Miotti, criticised the current “timid approach” and said: “There has been a lot of lobbying from the UK and US. AI companies are lobbying governments in the UK and US to stall regulation arguing it is premature and would crush innovation. Some of these are the same companies who say AIs could destroy humanity.”\n\nHe said the speed with which AI technology was advancing meant mandatory standards could be needed in the next one or two years.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Congress urged to act against energy-hungry facilities blamed for increasing bills and worsening climate crisis\n\nA coalition of more than 230 environmental groups has demanded a national moratorium on new datacenters in the US, the latest salvo in a growing backlash to a booming artificial intelligence industry that has been blamed for escalating electricity bills and worsening the climate crisis.\n\nThe green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress to halt the proliferation of energy-hungry datacenters, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.\n\n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of datacenters to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.\n\nThe push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new datacenters, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.\n\nThese seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing datacenters.\n\nThis threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.\n\nHowever, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”\n\nYet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.\n\n“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.\n\n“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”\n\nHua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.\n\nBut it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.\n\nMore broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.\n\nThis focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.\n\nAt the current rate of growth, datacenters could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.\n\nBut it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.\n\n“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”",
