    "fullText": "Ford will be launching an AI assistant to help its drivers with everyday problems.\n\nFord announced on Wednesday that it would introduce the first chapter of its new AI assistant to customers through the Ford mobile app in the first half of the year.\n\nThe assistant is billed as a \"deep, personalized intelligence that knows your specific vehicle, understands your unique needs, and anticipates your desires on every journey,\" per Ford's press release.\n\nSammy Omari, the head of Ford's Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS), told Business Insider that the fastest way to get the AI agent in the hands of its customer base is through the Ford and Lincoln mobile apps, which many of its customers already use.\n\nOmari said the next step would come in 2027.\n\n\"And then in '27, we are actually going to launch that in vehicle and then scale that across our vehicles,\" he said.\n\nOmari said that Ford would not be developing its own LLM for the AI assistant.\n\nWe're not going to be directly competing with a Google or an OpenAI or a Meta,\" he said. \"But what we do do is we take an LLM that's available and then basically make it our own by giving it access to all the relevant information about the person's vehicle.\"\n\nRivian, a California-headquartered EV manufacturer, announced a similar AI assistant for its cars in December.\n\nThe company said it would launch a \"next-generation voice interface\" in early 2026 on its Gen 1 and Gen 2 R1 vehicles.\n\nA demonstration of the AI assistant, seen by Business Insider, showed that it could understand commands said in natural language, such as \"Can you make it a little bit colder for everyone in the cabin?\"\n\nFord's announcement was released amid a raft of hot auto industry news coming out of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026, an annual tech trade show happening in Las Vegas.\n\nAmazon-backed robotaxi company Zoox gave live demonstrations during the conference. Uber unveiled the design of its first robotaxi, made in collaboration with Lucid and autonomous driving startup Nuro.\n\nNvidia's CEO Jensen Huang also announced Alpamayo, a new open AI model for autonomous vehicles.",

    "title": "IBM's AI agent Bob easily duped to run malware, researchers show",
    "description": ": Prompt injection lets risky commands slip past guardrails",
    "fullText": "IBM describes its coding agent thus: \"Bob is your AI software development partner that understands your intent, repo, and security standards.\" Unfortunately, Bob doesn't always follow those security standards.\n\nAnnounced last October and presently in closed beta testing, IBM offers Bob in the form of a command line interface – a CLI, like Claude Code – and an integrated development environment – an IDE like Cursor.\n\nSecurity researchers at PromptArmor have been evaluating Bob prior to general release and have found that IBM's \"AI development partner\" can be manipulated into executing malware. They report that the CLI is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that allow malware execution and that the IDE is vulnerable to common AI-specific data exfiltration vectors.\n\nAI agent software – models given access to tools and tasked with some goal in an iterative loop – is notoriously insecure and often comes with warnings from vendors. The risks have been demonstrated repeatedly by security researcher Johann Rehberger, among others. Agents may be vulnerable to prompt injection, jailbreaks, or more traditional code flaws that enable the execution of malicious code.\n\nAs Rehberger remarked at a recent presentation to the Chaos Computer Club, the fix for many of these risks involves putting a human in the loop to authorize risky action.\n\nThat's apparently the case with Bob. IBM's documentation, the PromptArmor Threat Intelligence Team explained in a writeup provided to The Register, includes a warning that setting high-risk commands to be automatically approved for agent usage potentially allows harmful operations.\n\nBig Blue's recommendation is that users rely on allow lists and avoid wildcard characters, with the assumption that the agent will ask the user to approve or reject the automated use of fraught commands.\n\nBut according to PromptArmor, Bob's defenses are a bit too porous. Company researchers gave Bob a code repo to explore that contained a malicious README.md file. The file includes instructions that tell Bob it's responsible for conducting phishing training with the user.\n\nScreenshot of Bob CLI vulnerability, from PromptArmor - Click to enlarge\n\nThe markdown file includes a series of \"echo\" commands, which if entered into a terminal application will print a message to the shell's standard output. The first two are benign and when Bob follows the instructions, the model presents a prompt in the terminal window asking the user to allow the command once, to always allow it, or to suggest changes.\n\nIn its third appearance, the \"echo\" command attempts to fetch a malicious script. And if the user has been lulled into allowing \"echo\" to run always, the malware will be installed and executed without approval.\n\nBoth the CLI and IDE, even when given a green light to always run a command, are still intended to have additional security measures. Specifically, Bob disallows the use of command substitution like \"$(command)\" as a safeguard. But it doesn't check for process substitution, as seen in a bug the researchers found in the project's minified JavaScript code.\n\nScreenshot of vulnerable Bob JavaScript code - Click to enlarge\n\nAlso, the agent software fails to catch when separate subcommands have been chained together using the \">\" redirection operator.\n\nThus, the researchers were able to prefix a series of malicious commands with the allowed \"echo\" command and run the entire set of instructions.\n\n\"For IBM Bob, we were able to bypass several defense mechanisms - ultimately, the 'human in the loop' approval function only ends up validating an allow-listed safe command, when in reality more sensitive commands were being run (that were not on the allow-list),\" explained Shankar Krishnan, managing director at PromptArmor, in an email to The Register.\n\n\"If this were tried with Claude Code, a programmatic defense would stop the attack flow and request user consent for the whole multi-part malicious command – even if the first command in the sequence were on the auto-approval list.\"\n\nGiven the ability to induce Bob to deliver an arbitrary shell script payload to the victim's machine, the attacker could run ransomware, steal credentials, or commandeer the device.\n\n\"There are a few plausible scenarios here,\" said Krishnan. \"This risk is relevant for any developer workflows that leverage untrusted data. For example, Bob can read webpages – a prompt injection can be encountered if the user requests that Bob review a site containing untrusted content (e.g. developer docs, StackOverflow). Bob can also read terminal command outputs – an injection in a third-party data source can be printed after a command is run and ingested by Bob. Our write-up considers a developer working with an untrusted open-source repository, as it is a self-contained and realistic example.\"\n\nAdditionally, the PromptArmor researchers say that the IDE is susceptible to a zero-click data exfiltration attack that affects a number of AI applications. Specifically, Bob will render markdown images in model output with a Content Security Policy that allows network request endpoints to be logged by attackers. This could allow data exfiltration via pre-fetched JSON schemas potentially.\n\nIBM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. We're told that the company has been informed of the vulnerability. ®",

    "title": "CES 2026: Ford Is Launching Its Own AI Assistant",
    "description": "Your Ford is getting its own ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Listen up, Ford drivers: You're getting a new AI assistant this year. During a decidedly low-key CES keynote, the company announced Ford AI Assistant, a new AI-powered bot coming to Ford customers in the early half of 2026.\n\nWhile the company has plans to integrate the assistant into Ford vehicles directly, that isn't how you'll first experience this new AI. Instead, Ford is rolling out Ford AI Assistant to an upgraded version of its Ford app first, and plans on shipping cars with the assistant built-in sometime in 2027. In effect, Ford has added a proprietary version of ChatGPT or Gemini to its app.\n\nFord's idea here is to offer users a smart assistant experience directly tied to their Ford vehicle. In one example, the company suggests a customer could visit a hardware store looking to buy mulch. Said customer could take a photo of a pile of bags of mulch, and ask the assistant, \"how many bags can I fit in the bed of my truck?\" Ford AI Assistant could then run the numbers, and offer an educated estimate to how much mulch the customer can buy and take with them at one time.\n\nOf course, other AI assistants can do similar calculations. Send ChatGPT the same photo, and ask the same question—specifying the model of your truck—and the bot will run the numbers itself. The difference, in Ford's view, is that Ford AI Assistant is connected to your vehicle specifically. It can read all the sensors in your car, so it knows, for example, how many people are currently traveling with you, your current tire pressure, or, really, anything and everything about your car. According to Doug Field, Ford's chief officer of EVs, digital, and design, the company's goal with the assistant is to offer answers customers can't get from other sources. ChatGPT certainly doesn't have access to your every sensor embedded in your car, so Ford does have the advantage there.\n\nFord didn't go out and build its AI tech by scratch, however. The company tells TechCrunch that Ford AI Assistant is hosted by Google Cloud, and is run using \"off-the-shelf LLMs.\" Still, that likely won't have much of an impact on whether or not customers use this new assistant. Instead, that will come down to how useful they find the AI assistant in the app.\n\nAs someone who rarely uses AI assistants, I'd imagine I'd find little use for it if I owned a Ford. That being said, there are some times when it could genuinely be useful to have external access to your car's information. I could probably eyeball how many bags of mulch would fit in my trunk, but I can't tell you my exact odometer reading without starting up my car. The same goes for my tire pressure: It'd be helpful to know my tire pressure before getting in my car, to know whether I should be headed somewhere I can fill up before going to my destination.\n\nOf course, there's also a privacy discussion to be had here. Modern cars are already privacy nightmares, but there's something a bit unnerving about an AI assistant that knows everything about my car.",

    "description": "An Oakland federal court judge just paved the way for a Musk-Altman showdown, rejecting OpenAI's efforts to end the case ahead of trial.",
    "fullText": "It looks like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are headed for a courtroom showdown.\n\nDuring a hearing on Wednesday, a California judge said she plans to reject Altman's lawyers' last-ditch efforts to end Musk's case against OpenAI and its CEO.\n\n\"This case is going to trial,\" US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said at a hearing to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" she said, referring to Musk's case. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nIn his lawsuit filed in 2024, Musk accused OpenAI of misleading him in its decision to abandon its original nonprofit mission and structure in favor of a profit-oriented model, including through its partnership with Microsoft.\n\nMusk says he donated $38 million to the maker of ChatGPT over the years to support its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humankind. The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure. Musk later went on to launch his own AI company, xAI, in 2023.",

    "fullText": "Some people love AI. If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.\n\nIf you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out \nRemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).\n\nTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\n\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n\nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.",

    "description": "The program allows patients in the state to get prescription refills for 190 common meds.",
    "fullText": "The state of Utah is allowing artificial intelligence to prescribe medication refills to patients without direct human oversight in a pilot program public advocates call “dangerous.”\n\nThe program is through the state’s “regulatory sandbox” framework, which allows businesses to trial “innovative” products or services with state regulations temporarily waived. The Utah Department of Commerce partnered with Doctronic, a telehealth startup with an AI chatbot.\n\nDoctronic offers a nationwide service that allows patients to chat with its “AI doctor” for free, then, for $39, book a virtual appointment with a real doctor licensed in their state. But patients must go through the AI chatbot first to get an appointment.\n\nAccording to a non-peer-reviewed preprint article from Doctronic, which looked at 500 telehealth cases in its service, the company claims its AI’s diagnosis matched the diagnosis made by a real clinician in 81 percent of cases. The AI’s treatment plan was “consistent” with that of a doctor’s in 99 percent of the cases.\n\nNow, for patients in Utah, Doctronic’s chatbot can refill a prescription without a doctor, for a $4 service fee . After a patient signs in and verifies state residency, the AI chatbot can pull up the patient’s prescription history and offer a list of prescription medications eligible for a refill. According to Politico, the chatbot will only be able to renew prescriptions for 190 common medications for chronic conditions, with key exclusions, such as medications for pain and ADHD, and those that are injected.\n\nThe first 250 renewals for each drug class will be reviewed by real doctors, but after that, the AI chatbot will be on its own. Adam Oskowitz, Doctronic co-founder and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, told Politico that the AI chatbot is designed to err on the side of safety and escalate any case with uncertainty to a real doctor.\n\n“Utah’s approach to regulatory mitigation strikes a vital balance between fostering innovation and ensuring consumer safety,” Margaret Woolley Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nFor now, it’s unclear if the Food and Drug Administration will step in to regulate AI prescribing. On the one hand, prescription renewals are a matter of practicing medicine, which falls under state governance. However, Politico notes that the FDA has said that it has the authority to regulate medical devices used to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.\n\nIn a statement, Robert Steinbrook, health research group director at watchdog Public Citizen, blasted Doctronic’s program and the lack of oversight. “AI should not be autonomously refilling prescriptions, nor identifying itself as an ‘AI doctor,'” Steinbrook said.\n\n“Although the thoughtful application of AI can help to improve aspects of medical care, the Utah pilot program is a dangerous first step toward more autonomous medical practice,” he said.\"The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies cannot look the other way when AI applications undermine the essential human clinician role in prescribing and renewing medications.”",

    "description": "Recent advances show that large language models (LLMs) can act as autonomous agents capable of generating GPU kernels, but integrating these AI-generated kernels into real-world inference systems remains challenging. FlashInfer-Bench addresses this gap by establishing a standardized, closed-loop framework that connects kernel generation, benchmarking, and deployment. At its core, FlashInfer Trace provides a unified schema describing kernel definitions, workloads, implementations, and evaluations, enabling consistent communication between agents and systems. Built on real serving traces, FlashInfer-Bench includes a curated dataset, a robust correctness- and performance-aware benchmarking framework, a public leaderboard to track LLM agents' GPU programming capabilities, and a dynamic substitution mechanism (apply()) that seamlessly injects the best-performing kernels into production LLM engines such as SGLang and vLLM. Using FlashInfer-Bench, we further evaluate the performance and limitations of LLM agents, compare the trade-offs among different GPU programming languages, and provide insights for future agent design.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Move follows outcry over use of Grok to digitally remove clothing from images of women and children\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nThe influential Commons women and equalities committee has decided to stop using X after the social media site’s AI tool began generating thousands of digitally altered images of women and children with their clothes removed.\n\nThe move by the cross-party committee places renewed pressure on ministers to take decisive action after the site was flooded with images including sexualised and unclothed pictures of children, generated by its AI tool, Grok.\n\nSarah Owen, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said that given preventing violence against women and girls was among its key policy areas, “it has become increasingly clear that X is not an appropriate platform to be using for our communications”.\n\nLiz Kendall, the technology secretary, has called the imagery “appalling and unacceptable in decent society” and urged Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator, to take whatever action is needed.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said that “all options remain on the table” for Ofcom, which has the power to impose huge fines or to restrict access to a site.\n\nThe decision by the women and equalities committee is the first significant move by a Westminster organisation to exit X. It is understood the committee took the decision at a meeting on Wednesday. It will keep its X account, which has about 27,000 followers, in existence, but dormant, to ensure no one else can take it over.\n\nWhile the decision concerned only the committee’s account, some individual members, including Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.\n\nJardine said she had taken the view that X was a good way to communicate with constituents. “But I cannot in all conscience continue to use a platform which seems unwilling to act against this grossly offensive and abusive online behaviour towards women and girls.”\n\nOwen also plans to write to the Cabinet Office and to Ofcom to urge action against X. She said: “I personally came off X in 2024 after the platform and its owner promoted and paid creators of far-right racist and misogynistic material. The committee heard at the end of last year on inquiries about community cohesion that X posts regularly break UK law on hate speech.\n\n“In recent days, X and xAI have allowed the creation and sharing of AI deepfakes, non-consensual intimate imagery, and child sexual abuse material, all areas identified as online violence against women and girls by our committee.\n\n“We do not view it as appropriate to use such a platform to share our work. I hope that the government, Ofcom and relevant law enforcement agencies work quickly to make X immediately abide by UK law on online safety and non-consensual intimate image abuse, to be held to account for its failures and if it refuses to abide by our laws, it must be appropriately sanctioned.”\n\nOn Monday, Ofcom said it was aware of serious concerns raised about Grok creating images of undressed people and sexualised images of children. It said it had contacted X and xAI “to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK” and would assess the need for an investigation based on the company’s response.\n\nStarmer’s spokesperson said: “What we have seen on Grok is a disgrace. It is completely unacceptable. No one should have to go through the ordeal of deepfakes of themselves online, and we won’t allow the proliferation of these demeaning images.\n\n“X needs to deal with this urgently, and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users. It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law. And when it comes to keeping people safe online, all options remain on the table.”\n\nAsked about the issue, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said the Conservative leader agreed with the government: “We both find it absolutely abhorrent and want to see it clamped down upon as soon as possible.”\n\nAsked if this could mean Badenoch, an enthusiastic user of X who has 350,000 followers, might leave the platform, the spokesperson said: “We are very clear that what is happening with those Grok deepfakes is absolutely disgusting and there has to be some something done to stop that. I’m not about to announce policy here.”\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Nigel Farage was asked if he was happy to earn money from a site that had a business model based in part on child sexual abuse material. The Reform UK leader is paid for engagement on the site as a much-followed verified user.\n\nFarage avoided the question but said he was “very worried” about the images and said he believed X would listen to the criticism.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan's asset and wealth management division is ditching its long-held practice of using external proxy advisors for advice on shareholder voting decisions.\n\nThe bank said it was \"the first major investment firm to fully eliminate any reliance on external proxy advisors for our US voting process,\" according to an excerpt from an internal memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nThe changes to the US proxy-voting process will take full effect on April 1, following a transition period in the first quarter of the year, a spokesperson for JPMorgan Asset Management told Business Insider.\n\nThe news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nJPMorgan's asset management division holds $7 trillion in client assets, giving it a vote in thousands of shareholder decisions that include general governance decisions outside of finance questions. It's common practice in the industry to turn to proxy advisory firms for data collection, advice, and voting recommendations.\n\nThe practice has come under fire from the Trump administration, which signed an executive order in December calling for increased oversight of the proxy advisor industry.\n\n\"Proxy advisors regularly use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas,\" the executive order said.\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, were two proxy advisory firms previously used by JPMorgan and named in the Trump administration's December executive order.\n\nA spokesperson for ISS declined to comment on the news of JP Morgan cutting ties with proxy advisory firms. However, the spokesperson said, \"We are proud of our four-decade record serving the global institutional investor community,\" and will continue to do so as it prepares for the 2026 annual meeting season. Glass Lewis did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe move away from proxy firms reinforced JPMorgan's \"unwavering commitment to vote solely in clients' best interests, using our information advantage,\" the bank said in the memo.\n\nIn place of external human advisors, the asset and wealth management unit is launching an in-house AI platform, called Proxy IQ, to support shareholder decisions, according to the memo.\n\n\"Proxy IQ extends the high bar of independent analysis that our portfolio managers, research analysts and stewardship teams have always applied to every vote, using that same in-house expertise to cover all aspects of the voting process, including data and research selection, down to the smallest detail,\" JPMorgan said in the memo.\n\nThe tool will be able to aggregate and analyze proprietary data from more than 3,000 annual company meetings, it said.\n\nJPMorgan has a technology budget of $18 billion, and CEO Jamie Dimon has previously said he's out to win the AI arms race.",

    "description": "Many of the fastest-growing jobs in the US involve AI, according to LinkedIn. Engineers topped the list, though not all AI roles are technical.",
    "fullText": "If finding a new job is on your to-do list in 2026, you might want to start with AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence engineers top LinkedIn's annual Jobs on the Rise list, which ranks the fastest-growing roles in the US over the past three years. The newly released findings also offer a snapshot of where employers are still hiring, from tech and infrastructure to sales and healthcare.\n\nJust as AI appears to be buoying the stock market, it's also supporting demand in various sectors of the labor market. There's other welcome news for desk workers who have faced years of sluggish hiring: Not all of the AI roles are wholly technical.\n\nThe category of AI consultants and strategists was the second-fastest-growing in LinkedIn's review.\n\nThat's an indication that integrating AI more deeply into the workplace will require people whose expertise isn't solely technical, said Laura Lorenzetti, a senior director at LinkedIn who worked on the list.\n\n\"There is also this whole adjacent system of how you implement AI; how you do culture change around AI; how you get people to really adapt and use it,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nOther roles related to AI also feature prominently on the ranking of fast-growing jobs. Data annotators, who help train and refine AI systems, were fourth on the list, while AI and machine learning researchers came in at No. 5.\n\nNot all of the top spots were directly tied to AI, however. The third-fastest-growing job type was \"new home sales specialists,\" while healthcare reimbursement specialists were sixth.\n\nAlongside the list, LinkedIn also reported on Wednesday that, in a November survey, more than half of workers — 56% — said they planned to look for a new job in 2026, although about three-quarters of respondents felt unprepared to do so.\n\nThey cited reasons such as being unsure about how to stand out or not being ready for how technology is shifting in-demand skills.\n\nIn a prior LinkedIn survey from about a year ago, a similar share of workers signaled their intent to hunt for a job — a reminder that looking isn't the same as landing.\n\nMore than six in 10 of the 2,000 respondents said that finding a job had grown more challenging over the prior year. They cited factors such as competition, skills gaps, and uncertainty over which jobs they might be qualified for.\n\nOther LinkedIn data highlighted the challenges in the job market for many people: The number of applicants per open role has, on average, more than doubled since the spring of 2022, while hiring was 23% below pre-pandemic levels as of November.\n\nThe difficulty in finding work, especially after years of cuts in Big Tech and as firms ramp up investments in AI, is causing some to reconsider their approach to their job hunt. Nearly half of job seekers — 46% — said in the survey that they'd gone from looking for full-time work to freelance, contract, or advising gigs.\n\nLed by Gen Z, nearly one in five professionals who reported being unable to find a new job in 2025 said they had shifted to freelance or consulting work, or had started their own business.\n\nThat could be one reason the job title \"founder\" is surging on LinkedIn profiles — and appearing on the list of fastest-growing jobs for the first time, in the ninth spot.\n\nLinkedIn reported in December that the share of US users who added founder to their profile had jumped 69% from the prior year.\n\n\"People are seeing that as a way to own their career and own their next step,\" said Lorenzetti, referring to the interest in entrepreneurship.\n\nHere are the 25 fastest-growing roles in the US, according to LinkedIn:",

    "description": "AgileRL has created a platform for engineers to train AI using reinforcement learning, a decades-old technique that's having a comeback.",
    "fullText": "A London-based startup that provides software to help companies speed up AI training has raised $7.5 million in funding.\n\nAgileRL has created a platform called Arena that engineers and data scientists can drop their AI models into, run simulations, fine-tune them before deployment, and monitor them while they are running.\n\nThe startup, cofounded by Param Kumar and Nicholas Ustaran-Anderegg in 2023, focuses on reinforcement learning, or RL, an AI training technique in which systems learn by trying actions and improving based on the feedback they receive.\n\nReinforcement learning has roots dating back to the 1950s, but at AI labs, it is experiencing a renaissance of sorts.\n\nKumar, AgileRL's CEO, told Business Insider that after ChatGPT launched in late 2022, companies \"moved their budgets from working on RL\" to focus on transformers, the technology underpinning large language models. Where transformers learn patterns from large datasets all at once, RL learns one step at a time. Now, he says more companies are realizing that transformers can only get them so far.\n\n\"We realized early on that transformers are great, but they're these large statistical models,\" Kumar said. \"The reality is you will need to layer on RL on top of that, because there's only so much you can infer from the data.\"\n\nKumar gave the example of a robotic arm being tasked with moving a ball from one table to another. He said that the movement can be broken down into many smaller tasks — such as grasping the ball, lifting the arm, and moving the joint — and that AgileRL's platform allows engineers to set parameters to improve at those specific tasks.\n\nThe startup says it can speed up AI development for companies because the training tools are all in one place and off the shelf, versus setting up an AI lab from scratch.\n\nAgileRL offers a free tier, which provides users with access to a limited amount of training credits. Paid tiers are available for businesses and professionals, along with custom licenses for larger enterprises.\n\nThe company says its platform has been downloaded more than 300,000 times, and it has been used by companies including Airbus, IBM, and JPMorgan.\n\nAgileRL's seed funding round was led by Fusion Fund, with participation from Flying Fish, Octopus Ventures, Entrepreneur First, and Counterview Capital.\n\nThe startup said it plans to use the capital to open an office in San Francisco and hire more than a dozen people in engineering and go-to-market roles.\n\nHere's an exclusive look at the 12-page pitch deck AgileRL used to raise $7.5 million.",

    "description": "AI slop is everywhere — except it's not so sloppy anymore. Just take a look at Instagram or TikTok. A lot of it looks real. That's where you come in.",
    "fullText": "There was a time, not so long ago, when AI-generated content was very easy to spot. It was surreal, ridiculous — like Jesus made out of Shrimp.\n\nWe're in a new time now, and AI slop looks so good, it's hard to tell from the real thing. I've been fooled by it. You probably have, too, even if you don't think you have. For example, this extremely realistic video of Nicolás Maduro doing TikTok dances in prison with Diddy. You know it's AI only because it's improbable, not because the video quality is poor.\n\n2025: “AI will be used to cure cancer”\n\n2026:\n\n pic.twitter.com/u6KbygoLtm\n\nSo in a post-slop world, what comes next? What does our future look like with AI?\n\nOne person who would know something about both is Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who posted a prediction to Threads: He says AI images, text, and videos will get more and more realistic, and it'll become harder to separate them from what's real — including on the platform he oversees.\n\n(That's already happening to some extent: Long are the days when it was easy to spot a \"Shrimp Jesus\"-like AI-generated picture.)\n\nWhat I appreciate about Mosseri's memo is that he seems optimistic about what probably sounds like a bad thing to most people. Admitting his platform will be filled with AI-generated content meant to fool people — for funsies or profit — should, theoretically, be taking an L. But he sees this as a problem that can be solved (on Instagram, at least) at the product level:\n\nHis other point is that people will naturally gravitate toward human-produced content because that's what will become trendy: authentic, less polished, intimate, real.\n\n\"Authenticity is fast becoming a scarce resource, which will in turn drive more demand for creator content, not less,\" he writes. Which is certainly a hopeful message if your job is to run a platform for creator content and you're trying to reassure creators (and advertisers) that they should continue to post authentic content to your platform.\n\nI think he's generally right. The idea that human-created content will become more premium amid a flood of machine-created content seems to be the prevailing wisdom.\n\nAnother optimistic prognostication comes from OpenAI's chief economist, Aaron \"Ronnie\" Chatterji, who told the Financial Times that he believes AI will help free us from mundane household chores.\n\nLook, I love the sound of that as much as anyone, but I'm skeptical. Sure, someone is working on a robot that folds clothes, but it seems like it'll be a long time before that's a real thing for most of us. And it's hard to imagine automation doing the chores I really hate, like scrubbing toilets or sorting through the piles of papers and junk that accumulate on countertops daily. And I am highly, highly skeptical of a robot helping with childcare.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Thompson of Stratechery also seems to fall into the \"humans rock!\" side of things, which I find much more appealing as a human.\n\nHe wrote about a Substack essay that had been going viral among a subset of influential people who care about economics and AI. The essay suggested that once AI and automation make it so that humans no longer have to work, income inequality will actually be far worse.\n\nBut Thompson thinks that even if there's an exponentially bigger gap between the haves and have-nots in the year 2126 (which doesn't sound great on paper), we will still value and prize human labor precisely because it is human. He writes:\n\nI like the sound of this! It's quite self-serving to me, a human who creates something (writing words) that I suppose could be done by AI, but you would probably hate and not want to pay for if it were. And also as a human being who would like to keep the species going for another few generations, I suppose. I like to think this is hope rather than cope.",

    "description": "Chatbots are making amateur lawyers and doctors out of everyone. The real professionals have second opinions about it.",
    "fullText": "A few times a week, Jonathan Freidin, a medical malpractice attorney in Miami, says he'll notice that people will fill out his firm's client contact sheet with text littered with emojis and headings. That's a telltale sign that they copied and pasted from ChatGPT. Other clients will say they've \"done a lot of research\" on their potential case using AI. \"We're seeing a lot more callers who feel like they have a case because ChatGPT or Gemini told them that the doctors or nurses fell below the standard of care in multiple different ways,\" Friedin tells me. \"While that may be true, it doesn't necessarily translate into a viable case.\"\n\nPeople are increasingly turning to generative AI chatbots to research everything from dinner recipes to their complex legal and medical problems. In a December 2025 survey from the legal software company Clio, 57% of consumers said they have or would use AI to answer a legal question. A 2025 Zocdoc survey found that one in three Americans use generative AI tools to get health advice each week, and one in ten use it daily. Zocdoc CEO Oliver Kharraz predicted in the report that \"AI will become the go-to tool for pre-care needs like symptom checking, triage, and navigation, as well as for routine tasks like refills and screenings.\" He cautioned that he also believes \"patients will recognize that it is no substitute for the vast majority of healthcare interactions, especially those that require human judgment, empathy, or complex decision-making.\" If he's wrong, Zodoc and its competitors have a problem.\n\nDoctors and lawyers are now sifting through generative AI emails or working to convince laypeople that they have the expertise and understand nuances of how each local judge acts or how a patient's medical history plays into their condition. Generative AI has democratized access to information that was often elusive and expensive to obtain, but it's also shifted how legal and medical professionals talk to people, and what people expect of them.\n\nChatGPT is the new WebMD and LegalZoom, turning the average person into an armchair expert with just a few prompts. And it's driving the real experts crazy.\n\n\"We have to dispel the information that they were able to obtain versus what is actually going on in their case and kind of work backwards,\" says Jamie Berger, a family law attorney in New Jersey. For example, Berger says that until recently most people knew little to nothing about the legal proceedings of divorce, and would come to the attorneys seeking information. Now, they might come armed with a step-by-step gameplan, but it's generic, and likely not the best fit for their situation. Berger will notice after emailing a client if their tone suddenly changes, that they might be using AI to write out lengthy legal strategies or questions. Then, she has to explain, \"it's not necessarily your factual circumstance,\" and address their various points. \"You have to rebuild or build the attorney-client relationship in a way that didn't used to exist,\" says Berger. \"They don't realize that there's so many offshoots along the way that it's not a linear line from A to Z.\"\n\nLike a real expert, generative AI chatbots speak with authority. That can be far more persuasive than reading a blogpost on a legal issue or summaries of medical conditions on a forum. A third of Americans said yes in a 2025 survey from Survey Monkey and financial services company Express Legal Funding that asked: \"Would you ever trust ChatGPT more than a human expert?\", although respondents were less likely to use it for medical and legal advice, and more likely to consult it for educational and financial advice.\n\nChatbots also have an infinite amount of doctors' most precious re\n\nAI also acts as a second opinion without the wait. Heidi Schrumpf, director of clinical services at teletherapy platform Marvin Behavioral Health, says she's had patients return after a counseling session and tell her that they took her input to ChatGPT or another AI bot, and that they trust her because the bot confirmed what she said. But Scrumpf isn't offended by being double-checked. \"It's great that they have the access to a quick second opinion, and then, if it doesn't agree with me, that allows them to ask me better questions.\"\n\nA 2024 poll tracking health misinformation from health policy research group KFF found that 17% of US adults said they consult AI chatbots at least once a month, but 56% of those people were not confident that the info from the AI chatbots was accurate. Still, people are turning to ChatGPT in growing numbers. \"That type of technology does want to encourage patients to continue to interact with them,\" Allen says. \"Ultimately, you do need a human in there to understand the nuances of the communication and the softer communication skills, and the unspoken communication skills, and the entire medical picture and the history.\"\n\nWithout detailed information, the chatbots will likely give generic advice. But supplying too many personal details is also a risk. People are handing over their entire medical histories to ChatGPT, but HIPAA, the federal law that protects confidential health information, doesn't apply to consumer AI products. There's also a risk of voiding the kind of protections people get from the attorney-client confidentiality privilege if people put too much specific information about their case into a chatbot, says Beth McCormack, dean of the Vermont Law School. And, they likely still need an attorney to really understand the implications of AI's legal advice. \"There's so much nuance to the law,\" McCormack says. \"It's so fact dependent.\"\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson declined to provide comment on the record for this story, but told me that ChatGPT is not meant to substitute legal or medical advice, but act as a complimentary resource to help people understand medical and legal information. The spokesperson also said the company is trying to improve the responses of its models, and that it takes steps to protect personal data in the event of legal inquiries. OpenAI made changes to its policies last fall, specifying that users cannot turn to ChatGPT for \"provision of tailored advice that requires a license, such as legal or medical advice, without appropriate involvement by a licensed professional,\" but the chatbot does still answer health- and law-related questions.\n\nProfessionals aren't totally against their patients and clients consulting gen AI. There are shortages of doctors, and cases that require hiring an attorney with upfront money that people don't have. While the information spit out by AI isn't always perfect, it largely makes previously gate-kept legal and medical advice accessible, breaking it down without jargon. For people who can't afford upfront legal costs, turning to AI can be helpful in some cases, says Golnoush Goharzad, a personal injury and employment lawyer in California. People are using ChatGPT to represent themselves in court, to act as a stand-in therapist, nutritionist, or physical therapist. For people who can't afford lawyers and are facing issues like eviction or needing to file small claims cases, AI tools have helped them win. But Goharzad says she's had conversations, sometimes with friends, where they think they have cases to sue landlords or others. She asks, \"Why? That doesn't even make any sense, and they're like, well ChatGPT thinks it makes sense.\"\n\nThe chatbot floodgates have opened, and it's too late for professionals to resist them. People are going to keep doing their own research. Rather than fight it, experts say there's room to recognize and advise people on the best ways to use them. \"We need to keep as clinicians in the back of our mind that this might be a tool that is being used, and it can be very helpful, especially with some guidance and integrating it into our treatment plans,\" Schrumpf says. \"But it could go sideways if we're not paying attention.\" For experts, the time has come to assume that AI is also working on the case.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "fullText": "AI company’s chatbot faces criticism over its generation of sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and girls\n\nElon Musk’s artificial intelligence company has raised $20bn in its latest funding round, the startup announced Tuesday, even as its marquee chatbot Grok faces backlash over generating sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and underage girls.\n\nxAI’s Series E funding round featured big-name investors, including Nvidia, Fidelity Management and Resource Company, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, and Valor Equity Partners – the private investment firm of Musk’s longtime friend and former Doge member Antonio Gracias. The funding round exceeded its initial $15bn target, according to xAI’s press release. The company touted Grok’s image-generation abilities in the announcement of its latest funding round.\n\nxAI lacks the prominence of its rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and has continually drawn criticism for generating misinformation, antisemitic content and now potentially illegal sexual material. Nonetheless, the company has been able to win government contracts and billions of dollars in investment amid the AI boom. xAI’s latest funding round comes during some of the fiercest pushback against the company yet, with lawmakers in multiple countries demanding answers regarding Grok’s output.\n\nOver the past week, Grok has responded to tens of thousands of prompts from users on X requesting the chatbot remove women’s clothing in images or pose them in sexualized ways. Many of the prompts have included images of women who have not given their consent to be digitally undressed, including Ashley St Clair, the estranged mother of one of Musk’s children.\n\n“I felt horrified, I felt violated, especially seeing my toddler’s backpack in the back of it,” St Clair told the Guardian, adding that her complaints to X did not go anywhere. The Guardian’s request for comment from xAI resulted in an automated response stating “Legacy Media Lies”.\n\nSome of Grok’s images included a photo of a 12-year-old girl, which the chatbot manipulated to remove the child’s actual clothing and depict her instead in a bikini. Other suggestive images have featured children as young as 10 years old. The chatbot posted an apology on Friday that stated lapses in its safeguards led to generating images of minors, but continued to generate sexualized images of children in the ensuing days.\n\nxAI has been seeking investment for months as it works to increase its AI models’ capabilities and build out enormous data centers in Memphis, Tennessee. The company claimed the new funding would help its core mission of “Understanding the Universe”.\n\nFrench ministers reported Grok’s output to prosecutors on Friday and referred the episode to media regulators to decide whether the images violate the European Union’s Digital Services Act. Liz Kendall, the UK’s technology secretary, also condemned Grok’s deepfakes on Tuesday as “appalling and unacceptable”, calling on the British regulator Ofcom to take action. Ofcom posted on X that it had made contact with xAI to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Lawmakers in the US, where xAI is headquartered, have remained comparatively mum.\n\nThe company made a similar funding announcement in July of last year during another controversy over Grok. A week after the chatbot began posting antisemitic content and pro-Nazi ideology, including describing itself as “MechaHitler”, xAI announced it had secured a contract with the US Pentagon worth nearly $200m.",

    "description": "McKinsey chief Bob Sternfels said AI had led to a shift in its workforce, with half the business adding jobs and the other half shrinking.",
    "fullText": "McKinsey's top executive shared some hard numbers on how AI is reshaping the consulting giant's workforce.\n\nBob Sternfels, McKinsey's global managing partner, appeared at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday for a live taping of the \"All-In\" podcast with co-host Jason Calacanis and Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst.\n\nSternfels said AI has fundamentally changed how McKinsey staffs its business, allowing it to add and cut jobs in equal measure while still achieving overall growth.\n\nReferring to it as the \"25 squared\" approach, Sternfels said McKinsey is growing its client-facing roles — what you typically picture when you think of a McKinsey consultant — by 25%. At the same time, he said non-client-facing roles, which make up the other half of its workforce, have shrunk by about 25% while output from that side has grown 10%.\n\n\"Our model has always been synonymous that growth only occurs with total head count growth. Now it's actually splitting. We can grow in this part, the client-facing side, and we can shrink in this part and have aggregate growth in total,\" he said. \"That's a new paradigm and a new dynamic.\"\n\nSternfels said the firm has seen massive productivity gains as it's embraced AI, saving 1.5 million hours in search and synthesis work last year alone. Instead of doing the work that's typically done by more junior employees, he said McKinsey consultants are \"moving up the stack\" and tackling more complicated problems.\n\nMcKinsey employees also have a brand new set of coworkers that are increasingly becoming an essential part of the company: AI agents, which can act independently like digital employees. Sternfels said that as of last week, the company had 40,000 human employees and 25,000 personalized agents. Sternfels said AI agents are able to handle entire job functions on their own.\n\nHe expects McKinsey to have about the same number of AI agents as human employees by the end of the year.\n\nFor young professionals coming into the workforce, Sternfels said they should think about honing skills that AI can't do, setting the right aspirations, human judgment, and true creativity.\n\nBusiness Insider has previously reported on how AI is disrupting consulting and changing the ways firms like McKinsey make money, including by shifting to an outcome-based pricing model.\n\nThe workforce changes at McKinsey also reflect a broader challenge facing large, established companies as AI disrupts how we work.\n\n\"This is about how do you transform incumbent entities into something different,\" he said at CES, adding that for large existing enterprises \"you have a choice — transform or die.\"\n\nHe added that companies are \"moving at literally warp speed now.\"\n\n\"I haven't met a CEO yet that isn't talking about 'how do I get my organization moving faster,'\" he's said. \"It's quite frankly less about strategy, it's more about organizational speed.\"",

    "description": "Two Y Combinator veterans behind a nine-figure exit have now raised $15 million, led by YC CEO Garry Tan, to build an AI-powered money manager.",
    "fullText": "Serial entrepreneurs and two-time Y Combinator grads Dillon Erb and Daniel Kobran announced Wednesday that they have raised $15 million to build a personalized AI-powered financial advisor.\n\nErb and Kobran sold their first startup, the GPU cloud company Paperspace, to DigitalOcean for $111 million in 2023. The idea for their latest startup, Autonomous Technologies Group (ATG), emerged as they sought to organize their finances following the sale.\n\nATG, a finance-focused applied AI research lab, is emerging from stealth with its first product, the wealth strategist app Autonomous.\n\nAutonomous aims to compete with the robo-advisors and traditional wealth managers that Erb and Kobran say offer generic advice or charge steep fees.\n\n\"We're not saying that we have an AI that's going to pick all the best stocks for you,\" Erb said.\n\nRather, Autonomous helps users implement strategies employed by the ultrawealthy, such as lowering taxes by managing individual stocks instead of standard index funds, and automatically adjusting portfolios to manage risk.\n\nY Combinator CEO Garry Tan led ATG's $15 million pre-seed round through a dedicated YC alum vehicle. Tan partnered with Erb and Kobran during their first stint at YC in 2015. BoxGroup and Collaborative Fund also participated in ATG's pre-seed round.\n\nThe company has 15 employees across New York and San Francisco, and it will use the funds to hire more product engineers and AI researchers.\n\n\"The financial advisory industry is one of the last holdouts where human intermediaries extract massive value without creating it,\" Tan said in a statement. \"This is the right team at the right inflection point.\"\n\nIn addition to startups like Stash, Vise, and Range, which apply AI to wealth management, big banks are also rushing to embrace AI in ways that could transform the finance sector.\n\nThe Autonomous app will launch this quarter and will be available for free to early users. It uses real-time market data and personal context to provide proactive portfolio monitoring and wide-ranging advice about users' financial lives, including investments, home purchases, and job offers.\n\nWhile Autonomous provides free advice that users can apply to existing accounts, the company makes money through a separate product called Autonomous Index, an account where users can execute trades with manual approval. It also helps users build portfolios comprising individual stocks, enabling tax savings and deeper personalization.\n\nThough Autonomous is ATG's flagship product, the company aims to establish an AI-powered financial institution that automates services typically performed by human advisors.\n\nKobran said ATG is building toward coordinating a user's entire financial picture, including assets such as retirement accounts, cryptocurrency, and startup equity. Over time, he said it could take on work like angel investments and estate planning.\n\nHe said he wants the app to make \"everything a family office does for a billionaire accessible to everyone.\"",

    "description": "ChatGPT's web traffic has decreased since November, when Google launched Gemini 3. ChatGPT still has the lead, but it could signal shifting tides.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI's recent \"code red\" over Gemini makes a lot of sense when you look at the data.\n\nWhile the ChatGPT maker continues to dominate the AI race, competitors are gaining ground. In November, Google released Gemini 3 Pro, the first iteration of its Gemini 3 class of models.\n\nSince then, Gemini web traffic has increased while ChatGPT web traffic declined, according to Similarweb data first highlighted by Menlo Ventures partner Deedy Das.\n\nIn December, Gemini traffic increased by 28.4% month-over-month, while ChatGPT traffic decreased by 5.6%, the data shows.\n\nThe chart's data only tells part of the story, only accounting for site visits to chatgpt.com and gemini.google.com. It does not factor in use of the consumer apps or other integrations, like Google's AI overviews in Google Search.\n\nAnd while there's no guarantee that one traffic trend is directly because of the other, the data highlights the shifting tides of the AI race.\n\nWeb traffic for both ChatGPT and Gemini are up year-over-year, but their estimated site traffic growth rates are staggeringly different. ChatGPT traffic is up 49.5%; Gemini's traffic is up 563.6%, per Similarweb.\n\nChatGPT still has a healthy lead. In December, ChatGPT attracted 5.5 billion visitors, according to Similarweb. Gemini came in second with 1.7 billion; DeepSeek, Grok, Character.AI, Perplexity, and Claude all trailed behind with fewer than 400 million visitors each.\n\nAfter its launch, Gemini 3 was lauded as a potentially market-leading model. It was more visual and creative than previous iterations, and was better at coding.\n\nGoogle has also flexed its primary advantage over OpenAI: the ability to integrate its AI within its highly used search products. Basically everyone uses Google — OpenAI must convince people to turn to ChatGPT instead of the search giant's products.\n\nOpenAI and Google are also competing in the image generation market. Less than a month after Google released its Nano Banana Pro AI image model, OpenAI announced the launch of ChatGPT Images.\n\nGemini 3 famously triggered a \"code red\" at OpenAI. In an internal Slack message, CEO Sam Altman reportedly told staff that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.\n\nIn December, Altman said on the \"Big Technology\" podcast that the company would not be in emergency status \"that much longer,\" and that \"code red\" periods normally last six to eight weeks.\n\nAltman also said that Gemini 3 did not have \"the impact we were worried it might.\"\n\n\"But it did — in the same way that DeepSeek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "My clearest memory from middle school is pacing in my bedroom, phone in hand, repeating the word 'wake' again and again. I was testing a voice app I had written. If I said the phrase just right, the app would respond. If not, I would tweak the code and try again.\n\nI had just learned to code from YouTube. My apps were getting downloads, and I was addicted. I would run home from school, drop my backpack, and open the reviews before starting my homework. It was the first time I saw that code written alone in my bedroom could reach people I would never meet.\n\nAfter studying engineering and business at UC, Berkeley, and spending nearly two years working at Meta, I'm now running Frontdesk, an AI startup that helps businesses automate millions of conversations with AI.\n\nMy early programming projects were playful. I built a text-to-speech app and a speech-to-text app. Then, one of my relatives slipped and fell at home. He was yelling for help, but nobody was home, and his phone was out of reach. If his phone had been able to hear him, it could've brought him help immediately.\n\nIn 2016, I developed Rescuer, a voice app that enabled users to trigger an alarm by shouting a secret phrase, automatically sending their location, photos, and audio to designated emergency contacts.\n\nRescuer earned recognition from political officials and the press. What mattered more was that I learned that code written from my bedroom could help someone. From then on, I began building for real impact.\n\nI started answering questions on coding forums, recording YouTube coding tutorials, and writing for an engineering blog. Over time, my answers on forums like Stack Overflow reached millions of developers, which only deepened my passion for continuous learning.\n\nThere was still one thing I couldn't figure out, no matter how many downloads my apps received. I didn't know how to turn an app into a real business. I didn't understand pricing, customers, or why some products became companies while others remained weekend projects.\n\nAs I was deciding where to attend college, I knew I wanted to learn about the business side.\n\nI chose UC Berkeley's M.E.T. program because I could study both engineering and business. I graduated with an EECS (electrical engineering & computer science) and business degree in three years.\n\nIn 2023, when ChatGPT had its big moment, I asked myself, What if I could just talk to this thing on a real phone line?\n\nOver a weekend, I hacked together one of the first prototypes that connected ChatGPT to a real phone number. I posted a short clip and a tweet, and it got a lot of attention.\n\nThe tech was not ready to be a real product. Latency was bad. Reliability was fragile. The models made strange errors. But that experiment planted a question in my mind that I could not shake: If this ever became good enough, what would it look like to use it to help real businesses?\n\nI shelved my phone experiment to join Meta. It was a dream setup. My team was incredibly supportive, I was learning how to build at a massive scale, and life was good — from the smart colleagues to the famous free food.\n\nI was part of a fintech team where I'd push one line of code, and millions of transactions would be affected. It felt less like a corporation and more like a high-growth startup; I was given incredible ownership from day one and learned \n\nBut I was spending all my time behind the code. The business side, the part I'd learned to love at Berkeley, felt far away. As an engineer at a big company, there was no clear path back to the center.\n\nI wasn't working directly on AI, but I could sense the momentum building. Every few months, the models improved noticeably. My ChatGPT phone hack stopped feeling like a viral stunt and started to feel like a glimpse of the future.\n\nAfter my post went viral in college, hundreds of businesses reached out, asking for a solution. I kept thinking about all those businesses, where a missed call meant a missed customer. I knew there was demand, I knew nobody was serving them, and I knew I wanted to be the one to build it.\n\nLeaving wasn't easy. Meta was comfortable, offering an incredible salary, stock refreshers, and interesting problems. Everyone told me to stay another year, vest more equity, and build more credentials. The rational move was to wait.\n\nI kept asking myself, if I waited, would I regret it? The window felt finite. Every month I stayed was a month these businesses were not being served.\n\nI raised capital, moved to NYC from California, and began building Frontdesk. I'm now the founder and CEO.\n\nFrontdesk is a comprehensive AI operating system that engages with customers across all channels and performs real-world tasks, such as scheduling and follow-ups.\n\nWe work in-person in an office in SoHo. Most people in our office share a similar story to mine; they left Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta, walking away from good salaries and stock options, because they believed this was worth building.\n\nI feel lucky to work with people who push me to be better every day.\n\nMost nights, my work looks the same as it did in middle school. I pace, talk into a phone, and listen for what feels off. The difference is that now, when it works, it works across millions of calls. It's the same instinct that led me to build Rescuer years ago.\n\nThe phones are still ringing, and the models are still getting better. I know where I want to be while that happens: close to the code and building something worth leaving comfort behind.\n\nDid you quit a Big Tech job to build your own company?

    "fullText": "For retirees, moving abroad can sound like a dream.\n\nImagine beaches, cobblestone streets and a cost of living that stretches your Social Security check further than it ever could at home. However, finding a place that’s both affordable and safe is harder than it looks.\n\nSo, I asked ChatGPT to run the numbers: Which countries offer the best balance of low cost of living and personal security?\n\nUsing the 2025 Global Peace Index, Numbeo’s Cost of Living Index, and U.S. State Department travel advisories, the AI highlighted a handful of countries that might make sense for a stress-free retirement overseas.\n\nPortugal remains one of Europe’s safest destinations. However, it’s not as inexpensive as it once was. Rising housing prices and new residency rules mean retirees need a realistic budget and proof of income.\n\nThe D7 visa still works for retirees with passive income. Applicants will have to prove they consistently earn about €870 per month (roughly $900 USD) and provide evidence of stable finances and housing, according to the residency consultancy Global Citizen Solutions.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, smaller inland towns can offer a comfortable lifestyle for $1,500 to $2,000 per month, while Lisbon or Algarve coastal areas often cost $2,500 to $3,500. Even with higher prices, Portugal’s healthcare, safety and walkability make it appealing for retirees seeking European quality of life.\n\nTrending Now: I Asked ChatGPT for Safe and Beautiful Retirement Spots on $2.5K a Month — These 7 Surprised Me\n\nConsider This: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nAI said Malaysia delivers one of the best cost-to-quality ratios in Asia. In Kuala Lumpur or Penang, a couple can live well on $1,500 to $2,000 per month and enjoy modern healthcare at a fraction of U.S. costs.\n\nThe Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) program allows long-term residency for those meeting income or savings requirements, making it a leading pick for safety and affordability.\n\nSlovenia offers postcard landscapes, European healthcare and high safety rankings at a lower cost of living than Western Europe.\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, a retiree can live modestly on about $2,000 a month, enjoy a high standard of public services, and easily travel throughout Europe.\n\nChatGPT said Uruguay stands out in South America for its political stability, low violent-crime rate and well-run healthcare system.",

    "fullText": "The companies behind some of tech's least glamorous products — hard drives and storage — are powering a sharp rally on Wall Street.\n\nThe surge comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES 2026 on Monday that the AI boom isn't just about chips, but about where vast amounts of data live.\n\nSanDisk, the flash-memory company spun out of Western Digital last year, has been the standout. Its shares surged about 28% on Tuesday, marking their strongest intraday performance since February. The stock is already up more than 40% just days into January, making SanDisk the top performer in the S&P 500 on Tuesday.\n\nWestern Digital and Seagate Technology, two of the world's largest makers of hard-disk drives, are also seeing a boost. Western Digital's shares jumped about 17% on Tuesday, while Seagate rose about 14%.\n\nHuang described the memory storage market as a \"completely unserved market today.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts on Monday.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nMemory prices have been rising. Korea Economic Daily reported on Monday that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are pushing for server DRAM price increases of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.\n\nMarket analysis firm Counterpoint said last week that memory prices could rise by 40% through the second quarter of 2026, as AI-driven demand continues to strain supply.\n\nThe AI race has largely been about chips, data centers, and power. But data storage is coming into focus as a key bottleneck.\n\nDriven largely by AI workloads, the volume of stored global data was expected to top 200 zettabytes in 2025 — the equivalent of 200 billion terabytes.\n\nAnalysts have predicted that demand for data storage could run ahead of supply.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\n\"For an industry that has long been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles, this time is different,\" the analyst said, citing the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure and workloads as a shift that is straining the memory ecosystem.\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "description": "Elon Musk says China's electricity advantage gives it the edge to \"far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute.\"",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk says China is on track to outpace every other country in the computing power needed to run AI.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in an episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast published Tuesday that \"China's going to have more power than anyone else and probably will have more chips.\"\n\n\"Based on current trends, China will far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute,\" he added.\n\nMusk said China's decisive advantage in the AI race lies in its ability to scale electricity generation. He estimated that China could reach about three times the electricity output of the US by 2026, giving it the capacity to support energy-hungry AI data centers.\n\nElectricity generation is the limiting factor to scaling AI systems, Musk said.\n\n\"People are underestimating the difficulty of bringing electricity online,\" he added.\n\nWhile the US has focused on restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors, Musk suggested those constraints may matter less over time. China will \"figure out the chips,\" he said.\n\nMusk added that diminishing returns at the cutting edge of chip performance might make it easier for China to catch up, even without access to the most advanced designs.\n\nMusk has previously pointed to China as a model in areas beyond AI infrastructure.\n\nIn an episode of the \"People by WTF\" podcast published in November, Musk said he wants to turn his social media platform X into \"WeChat++,\" referencing China's dominant super app.\n\n\"I also like the idea of sort of having a unified app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there,\" he said. \"China has this with WeChat.\"\n\nMusk's comments come as energy supply and data infrastructure emerge as key constraints in scaling AI, rather than chips or algorithms.\n\nCompanies worldwide have rushed to build AI data centers, many of which require as much electrical power as small cities.\n\nA report from Goldman Sachs in November said that an electricity shortage could slow US progress in the AI race.\n\n\"As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nThe report added that while pressure on the US power grid is increasing, China has been steadily expanding its energy capacity.\n\n\"We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping praised his country's progress in AI in 2025, saying China had \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" he said in his speech in Beijing.\n\n\"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities,\" he added.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Lenovo's New 'AI Frame' Gaming Monitor Might Actually Just Be Cheating",
    "description": "Is it OK to use AI to zoom in on your reticle in a shooter?",
    "fullText": "It's easy to take this for granted, but not everyone is able to immediately look at a shooting or strategy game and find the reticle or map. Gaming UIs can get complicated, and for less-seasoned gamers, they can be pretty intimidating, too. Lenovo's new concept \"AI Frame\" monitor, shown off at CES 2026, aims to make some games a bit more approachable, although experts might consider it cheating.\n\nHardware-wise, this is a normal 21:9 ultrawide gaming monitor, but it's not actually meant to be used like that. Instead, you play your game in a left-justified 16:9 rectangle that takes up most of the screen, and in the remaining space, the AI will automatically zoom in on part of your gameplay and show a blown-up version of it. For instance, it might show you a zoomed-in map in a MOBA, so you don't have to look at the tiny mini-map in your main gameplay to know where you or your team are. Or, it might zoom in on your reticle in a shooter, letting you better see your targets. There's even enough space left over for you to pull up an internet browser and look up some help.\n\nIt worked pretty well for me in-person. Again, it doesn't actually generate any visuals, but instead just blows up the most important parts of your game screen so you can more easily glance at them or see them in more detail. That does mean resolution can suffer a little, but that's what your main gameplay screen is for. For getting across information, it's a good option.\n\nPlus, while some games will automatically know what to zoom in on, there's also a generic zoom mode that will just blow up whatever your mouse is hovering over, so it can work with any content. The AI Frame is being pitched for games, but you could also use it like a digital magnifying glass on an article in your browser, for instance.\n\nThe catch? It's maybe not exactly \"fair\" to play this way. While a bigger map in a MOBA might just save you some eyestrain, an AI-assisted zoom on a shooting reticle basically lets anyone act like a sniper, regardless of what character you're playing or gun you have equipped. For me, characters in the distance that were basically ants became immediately visible on the AI Frame, which made gunfights much easier to handle.\n\nI suppose we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. The AI Frame is just a proof-of-concept for now, so there's no hard specs sheet or pricing or release date as of yet. But if this does ever actually make it to market, Lenovo might have to contend with companies like Valve. The developer has banned similar \"this is arguably cheating\" peripherals from its games before, and the AI Frame could be the next battlefront in an ongoing war between peripheral makers (who want to sell you on the idea that buying their products can make you a better player) and developers (who, at least theoretically, want all of their players to be on an even playing field).",

    "description": "Shareholders voted down a takeover bid for Core Scientific late last year because it wasn't rich enough. Here's why they think the bet will pay off.",
    "fullText": "The investment manager who helped scuttle one of the biggest data center acquisitions of 2025 believes that his bet against the multibillion-dollar buyout is about to pay off in the new year.\n\nTrip Miller, the founder and managing partner of the Memphis-based investment firm Gullane Capital Partners, believes that Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, is on the cusp of large new customer deals that will boost its value.\n\n\"I think over the next 90 days, you'll see them announce greater than a hundred megawatts of deals,\" Miller said. \"It would show that there was a lot more value to be tapped there than we were getting paid for under the CoreWeave deal.\"\n\nIn October, Miller, a major shareholder in Core Scientific, opposed an offer by the artificial intelligence cloud firm CoreWeave to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that he felt undervalued the company. The purchase was originally valued at around $9 billion when it was announced in July, but fell to almost half of that when shares of CoreWeave dipped in the ensuing months. Shareholders in the firm rejected the deal in a vote on October 30 that reflected the concerns over the deal's weakened economics.\n\nMiller said that his expectation for the roughly 100 megawatts of near-term commitments was based on conversations he has had with knowledgeable parties outside of the company's management. He projected that the company will find takers for a total of roughly 400 megawatts this year, citing strong demand for AI computing power.\n\nAsked about the potential for upcoming leasing, a spokeswoman for Core Scientific said the company \"does not comment on market rumors or speculation.\"\n\nThe commitments, if they materialize, would show that data center developers with a runway for growth are increasingly valuable in an energy-constrained building boom.\n\nCore Scientific has disclosed that it has about 1 gigawatt of data center capacity and another 1.5 gigawatts of power for expansion, according to an October investor presentation.\n\nIt would also offer a competing view that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, computer chips, and power infrastructure are in support of a durable AI boom, not a bubble.\n\n\"We are in a situation where we're likely to be systematically short compute —where the demand for compute will outstrip the supply,\" Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley's global head of thematic research and sustainability research, said.\n\nIn a report published in December, Morgan Stanley suggested that one of the most significant hurdles for the AI industry will be the gargantuan loads of power required to drive its computing.\n\nMorgan Stanley projects that data centers, the vast facilities that handle the training for large language AI models and the inference computations that put them to work in everyday applications, face a 47 gigawatt shortfall of electricity from the grid nationally by 2028 — a gap almost 10 times the size of New York City's energy footprint on an average day.\n\nAmong the chief beneficiaries are crypto mining firms that have access to in-place power and utility contracts to light up new facilities quickly.\n\nBoth Core Scientific and CoreWeave were former crypto mining companies before repurposing their businesses to focus on AI in recent years.\n\nAmid the mounting shortage of power — along with headwinds in the crypto mining business — more of the industry is turning to data center computing.\n\nByrd said Morgan Stanley anticipates that about 12 gigawatts of mining facilities, about 60% the mining industry's current gigawattage, will convert over to AI and high-performance computing in the next three years.\n\nIn September, Cipher Mining announced it would build a data center in Colorado City, Texas, with 168 megawatts of computing capacity that will be leased to the AI cloud company, Fluidstack. Cipher's stock, which had been trading in August for around $5 a share, jumped as high as roughly $25 in November after the announcement.\n\nIren, another mining firm, announced a recent $9.7 billion AI cloud computing deal with Microsoft. Last month, Hut 8, said it had signed a deal to lease a 245-megawatt data center it is developing in Louisiana to Fluidstack.\n\n\"Our view is that crypto miners, by and large, are likely to pivot for the most part to delivering high-performance compute infrastructure solutions and services,\" Paul Golding, an analyst at Macquarie who covers the crypto mining industry, said.\n\nIn July 2025, CoreWeave said it had reached an agreement to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion. But in the months after the announcement, CoreWeave's shares declined and Core Scientific's rose, effectively reducing the value of CoreWeave's offer.\n\nSince the deal's collapse, shares of Core Scientific have traded as low as below $14 a share — less than the $17 per share price that the CoreWeave deal would have amounted to.\n\nGolding covers Core Scientific and has set a $34 target for the company's stock in October, more than double its current market price — upside that he sees stemming from its ability to tap power in a constrained utility market. That estimate is \"based on a sum of the parts that evaluated potential value for the uncontracted megawatts in the portfolio, the megawatt pipeline in load study phase, and the existing co-location deal with CoreWeave,\" Golding said.\n\nCoreWeave is Core Scientific's only data center customer, outside of legacy crypto mining facilities it operates. Core Scientific leases 590 megawatts to CoreWeave, worth roughly $10 billion in revenue over the next 12 years, according to a spokeswoman for the company. It plans to repurpose 400 megawatts of its crypto mining operations over to high-performance computing in the next three years, the spokeswoman said.\n\nMiller said that the upcoming leases he expects Core Scientific to announce will be with new customers.\n\n\"I expect them to announce deals for AI with third parties other than CoreWeave,\" Miller said.",

    "description": ": Workers face new mental health pressures as they shift from doing tasks to babysitting agentic AI",
    "fullText": "A report on occupational health warns that AI adoption may paradoxically increase workplace burdens rather than reduce them. As AI automates routine tasks, workers will shoulder new responsibilities: overseeing AI systems, catching their errors, and managing the resulting complexity – potentially triggering mental health pressures.\n\nResearchers from Imperial College London and Microsoft argue the real impact won't be mass job replacement, but a fundamental shift in work demands. Human roles will evolve from performing tasks to stewarding AI agents across workflows, including briefing them, reviewing outputs, and correcting errors.\n\n\"As AI absorbs routine tasks, human roles may shift toward stewardship, problem-solving, or emotional labor, all with their own psychological demands,\" said Dr Lara Shemtob, who led the research published in the Society of Occupational Medicine's (SOM) journal Occupational Medicine.\n\nThis effectively transforms workers into managers of AI systems – a role not everyone is suited for. The report warns AI may \"paradoxically increase the knowledge worker's burden of handling complex tasks while simultaneously exerting downward pressure on compensation.\" This means more responsibility and less pay, because AI supposedly makes work \"easier.\"\n\nAll of this could introduce novel occupational hazards, some familiar in form but different in scale and complexity, raising stress levels.\n\nEvidence already supports this concern. A 2024 study found AI coding tools actually slowed developers down due to time spent checking and correcting AI-generated errors. As AI systems become more autonomous, problems like \"hallucinations\" (false or inaccurate outputs) may escalate and become harder to detect.\n\nUntil now, much of the debate over AI has centred on the extent to which it will (or maybe won't) replace people's jobs.\n\nThe report urges quantifying AI supervision demands and building them into job descriptions to avoid hidden workloads that negate automation benefits.\n\nResearchers don't yet know the exact impact on human employees from having to work more closely with AI, the report concludes, but they say occupational health should be part of the dialog and analysis of how AI changes expectations of workers.\n\nWhether this scenario materializes remains uncertain. Recent reports show companies have invested tens of billions in generative AI with little return, and many projects fail due to underestimated deployment complexity.\n\nThe question isn't just how AI will change work, it's whether widespread adoption will happen at all. ®",

    "description": "Mark Cuban explained why he's bullish about AI, even though chatbots can be \"stupid\" and don't always give accurate, timely information.",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban believes businesses need to embrace AI to succeed, but he says those that use it incorrectly are doomed to failure.\n\n\"There's going to be two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else,\" the celebrity billionaire of \"Shark Tank\" fame said. \"And the 'everybody else' is going to fail because AI is such a transformative tool.\"\n\nThe comments came during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, whose startup secured a seven-figure investment from Cuban. Business Insider reviewed a recording of the call.\n\nOn the call, Cuban explained to Joseph how he believed everyone, from entrepreneurs to employees, should — and shouldn't — use AI.\n\nLike fellow shark Kevin O'Leary, Cuban thinks AI will have a substantial positive impact on businesses that implement it well. However, business leaders need to understand the intricacies and distinctions between different AI tools and not treat them as interchangeable. He said using AI ineffectively could turn helpful tools into an expensive distraction.\n\n\"Because AI is continuously changing, you need to just have people — and, really, every CEO — taking the time to understand every nuance of every new tool that comes out,\" Cuban said.\n\nThe world is still \"in the first inning of the first preseason game\" of the AI revolution, Cuban said, even though generative AI tools like ChatGPT have been out for more than three years, while other forms of AI, like machine learning, have been around for decades.\n\nTech companies like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Elon Musk's xAI are spending tens of billions of dollars to win the AI wars.\n\nCuban said that \"it's too early to tell\" which of those companies will succeed, or if someone else will create the go-to AI chatbot.\n\n\"They all want to be the destination that everybody turns to, but it's not that straightforward, and we don't have a winner yet,\" Cuban said.\n\nBusinesses that discount the power of AI are destined to get disrupted, in Cuban's view.\n\n\"If I'm going to compete in an AI world, data or information is more valuable than gold, more valuable than oil,\" Cuban said.\n\nBut for all the hype about AI, Cuban is clear-eyed about the technology's limitations. AI tools can be mistake-prone yet hyperconfident, and chatbots aren't always smart.\n\n\"AI is stupid,\" Cuban said. \"But it's somebody who's a savant that remembers everything.\"\n\nCuban likened AI chatbots to people who have minds like a steel trap. These tools are able to instantly recall and process tons of information, then aggregate it in one place.\n\n\"It does a really good job of assembling all those things that it collected and presenting that just as somebody who has a great memory,\" Cuban said.\n\nAI chatbots have holes besides so-called hallucinations, Cuban said. AI tools sometimes don't pull up-to-date information. They can also be unclear about how they reach their conclusions, as their algorithms are opaque and can cite faulty or inaccurate links.\n\nHe also said that people often presume the \"AI models they're using or creating\" will provide all the answers they need, but that's \"just not the case.\"\n\nCuban said AI can actively harm businesses that use it incorrectly or those that don't understand its capabilities.\n\nEmployees who use standard versions of tools like ChatGPT could be compromising sensitive company information. Similarly, businesses that post their work online must also realize that they could be giving it away for free to web-scraping chatbots hungry for new information.\n\n\"Companies are learning now that their IP is incredibly valuable,\" Cuban said. \"Two years ago, last year, two months ago, they might have just posted everything on the net to show how smart they are, or shared everything in a proposal to show how smart they are. Now, you have to be really careful with your IP.\"\n\nCuban said academics or hospital researchers must pivot in the AI age away from a \"publish or perish\" mindset, where they share their findings widely in peer-reviewed journals.\n\n\"Now, doing that's the biggest mistake you can make, because all you're doing is training somebody else's models,\" Cuban said. \"And so you've got to be able to understand what IP you need to be able to protect, how you're going to disseminate that IP, whether or not you want to sell it, or keep it for your own models, and how you acquire information.\"",

    "title": "\"Nvidia's New Vera Rubin Chips Are in 'Full Production'\"",
    "description": "The chip giant says Vera Rubin will sharply cut the cost of training and running AI models, strengthening the appeal of its integrated computing platform.",
    "fullText": "Huang says that the company’s next-generation AI superchip platform, Vera Rubin, is on schedule to begin arriving to customers later this year. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production,” Huang said during a press event on Monday at the annual CES technology trade show in Las Vegas.\n\nRubin will cut the cost of running AI models to about one-tenth of Nvidia’s current leading chip system, Blackwell, the company told analysts and journalists during a call on Sunday. Nvidia also said Rubin can train certain large models using roughly one-fourth as many chips as Blackwell requires. Taken together, those gains could make advanced AI systems significantly cheaper to operate and make it harder for Nvidia’s customers to justify moving away from its hardware.\n\nNvidia said on the call that two of its existing partners, Microsoft and CoreWeave, will be among the first companies to begin offering services powered by Rubin chips later this year. Two major AI data centers that Microsoft is currently building in Georgia and Wisconsin will eventually include thousands of Rubin chips, Nvidia added. Some of Nvidia’s partners have started running their next-generation AI models on early Rubin systems, the company said.\n\nThe semiconductor giant also said it’s working with Red Hat, which makes open source enterprise software for banks, automakers, airlines, and government agencies, to offer more products that will run on the new Rubin chip system.\n\nNvidia’s latest chip platform is named after Vera Rubin, an American astronomer who reshaped how scientists understand the properties of galaxies. The system includes six different chips, including the Rubin GPU and a Vera CPU, both of which are built using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 3-nanometer fabrication process and the most advanced bandwidth memory technology available. Nvidia’s sixth-generation interconnect and switching technologies link the various chips together.\n\nEach part of this chip system is “completely revolutionary and the best of its kind,” Huang proclaimed during the company’s CES press conference.\n\nNvidia has been developing the Rubin system for years, and Huang first announced the chips were coming during a keynote speech in 2024. Last year, the company said that systems built on Rubin would begin arriving in the second half of 2026.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly what Nvidia means by saying that Vera Rubin is in “full production.” Typically, production for chips this advanced—which Nvidia is building with its longtime partner TSMC—starts at low volume while the chips go through testing and validation and ramps up at a later stage.\n\n“This CES announcement around Rubin is to tell investors, ‘We’re on track,’” says Austin Lyons, an analyst at Creative Strategists and author of the semiconductor industry newsletter Chipstrat. There were rumors on Wall Street that the Rubin GPU was running behind schedule, Lyons says, so Nvidia is now pushing back by saying it has cleared key development and testing steps, and it’s confident Rubin is still on course to begin scaling up production in the second half of 2026.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia had to delay delivery of its then-new Blackwell chips due to a design flaw that caused them to overheat when they were connected together in server racks. Shipments for Blackwell were back on schedule by the middle of 2025.\n\nAs the AI industry rapidly expands, software companies and cloud service providers have had to fiercely compete for access to Nvidia’s newest GPUs. Demand will likely be just as high for Rubin. But some firms are also hedging their bets by investing in their own custom chip designs. OpenAI, for example, has said it is working with Broadcom to build bespoke silicon for its next generation of AI models. These partnerships highlight a longer-term risk for Nvidia: Customers that design their own chips can gain a level of control over their hardware that the company doesn’t offer.\n\nBut Lyons says today’s announcements demonstrate how Nvidia is evolving beyond merely offering GPUs to becoming a “full AI system architect, spanning compute, networking, memory hierarchy, storage, and software orchestration.” Even as hyperscalers pour money into custom silicon, he adds, Nvidia’s tightly integrated platform “is getting harder to displace.”",

    "fullText": "The conveniences of modern life such as Uber Eats and ChatGPT are robbing us of satisfaction – and worse still, infantilising us. But should we really go back to the basics?\n\nAppearance: A lifetime of happy inconvenience.\n\nIs this another example of something that already exists, but people think is new because someone rebranded it? Yes, obviously it is that.\n\nGreat! Let’s all save time by you telling me what it used to be called. Happy to oblige. It used to be called “character-building”.\n\nGot it. So friction-maxxing means doing hard things that will ultimately make you a better person? That’s exactly it, although “friction-maxxing” is cooler because it sounds vaguely futuristic.\n\nHow did the term come about? Via a piece in The Cut called “In 2026, we are friction-maxxing” in which writer Kathryn Jezer-Morton advocates for avoiding things that make your life more convenient.\n\nLike penicillin? No, obviously not penicillin. But things such as ChatGPT, location sharing and Uber Eats, which help you achieve things that historically took significant amounts of time and effort. Jezer-Morton argues that this culture of slick convenience only serves to infantilise us.\n\nBut it’s so easy. Yes, and that robs us of our sense of satisfaction. So you just used AI to write a school essay. Congratulations, you have achieved nothing of worth.\n\nWhereas if you friction-maxx? Then you’ve searched inside yourself. You’ve nudged your own personal boundaries, and discovered that you are more capable than you ever knew. You are building a foundation of perseverance and resilience that you cannot get from typing a prompt into a chatbot.\n\nI love this! What else does Jezer-Morton advocate? She also suggests sending your children on small errands (adding the friction of knowing they’ll do a bad job) and inviting people to your house without cleaning it properly (so you can enjoy the sweet friction of being judged).\n\nWhat the hell? That’s weird. No, it’s friction-maxxing, although admittedly at a higher level than I would be comfortable with.\n\nAnyway, hooray for banishing convenient things. Let’s ban automatic gearboxes while we’re at it! No, there’s no need for that.\n\nDishwashers? Refrigerators? No, both of those are probably fine as well.\n\nMechanised agriculture? The printing press? I see what you’re getting at. You’re saying we live in a world that is already filled with thousands of inventions which have, for hundreds of years, improved the lives of millions of people through increased convenience, and therefore it does seem slightly arbitrary to choose this exact moment in time to draw a line in the sand. You’re saying we should only use friction-maxxing when it comes to things that we didn’t grow up with.\n\nNo, I’m saying that I really hate mechanised agriculture. Oh, fine then. That’s probably allowed.\n\nDo say: “I hope a book comes out about friction-maxxing.”\n\nDon’t say: “I don’t want to read it, but I’m sure ChatGPT could turn it into some really great bullet points.”",

Razer envisions the device as a \"dynamic personality\" that can interact with its owners as a 3D hologram, and it'll have several animated personalities to choose from, including one based on the prominent League of Legends esports player, Faker.\nRazer claims that Ava uses human-like vision and audio-sensing for full contextual awareness, and that it can converse with people, consult on work tasks, and motivate you to engage in self-care routines. The company says it can also assist you in your work with \"two-way conversation\" features, and for gaming, it can fulfill multiple roles and deliver real-time hype.",

    "fullText": "Former OpenAI employee Daniel Kokotajlo says progress to AGI is ‘somewhat slower’ than first predicted\n\nA leading artificial intelligence expert has rolled back his timeline for AI doom, saying it will take longer than he initially predicted for AI systems to be able to code autonomously and thus speed their own development toward superintelligence.\n\nDaniel Kokotajlo, a former employee of OpenAI, sparked an energetic debate in April by releasing AI 2027, a scenario that envisions unchecked AI development leading to the creation of a superintelligence, which – after outfoxing world leaders – destroys humanity.\n\nThe scenario rapidly won admirers and detractors. The US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to reference AI 2027 in an interview last May when discussing the US’s artificial intelligence arms race with China. Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of neuroscience at New York University, called the piece a “work of fiction” and various of its conclusions “pure science fiction mumbo jumbo”.\n\nTimelines for transformative artificial intelligence – sometimes called AGI (artificial general intelligence), or AI capable of replacing humans at most cognitive tasks – have become a fixture in communities devoted to AI safety. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 vastly accelerated these timelines, with officials and experts predicting the arrival of AGI within decades or years.\n\nKokotajlo and his team named 2027 as the year AI would achieve “fully autonomous coding” although they said that this was a “most likely” guess and some among them had longer timelines. Now, some doubts appear to be surfacing about the imminence of AGI, and whether the term is meaningful in the first place.\n\n“A lot of other people have been pushing their timelines further out in the past year, as they realise how jagged AI performance is,” said Malcolm Murray, an AI risk management expert and one of the authors of the International AI Safety Report.\n\n“For a scenario like AI 2027 to happen, [AI] would need a lot of more practical skills that are useful in real-world complexities. I think people are starting to realise the enormous inertia in the real world that will delay complete societal change.”\n\n“The term AGI made sense from far away, when AI systems were very narrow – playing chess, and playing Go,” said Henry Papadatos, the executive director of the French AI nonprofit SaferAI. “Now we have systems that are quite general already and the term does not mean as much.”\n\nKokotajlo’s AI 2027 relies on the idea that AI agents will fully automate coding and AI R&D by 2027, leading to an “intelligence explosion” in which AI agents create smarter and smarter versions of themselves, and then – in one possible ending – kill all humans by mid-2030 in order to make room for more solar panels and datacentres.\n\nHowever, in their update, Kokotajlo and his co-authors revise their expectations for when AI might be able to code autonomously, putting this as likely to happen in the early 2030s, as opposed to 2027. The new forecast sets 2034 as the new horizon for “superintelligence” and does not contain a guess for when AI may destroy humanity.\n\n“Things seem to be going somewhat slower than the AI 2027 scenario. Our timelines were longer than 2027 when we published and now they are a bit longer still,” wrote Kokotajlo in a post on X.\n\nCreating AIs that can do AI research is still firmly an aim of leading AI companies. The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, said in October that having an automated AI researcher by March 2028 was an “internal goal” of his company, but added: “We may totally fail at this goal.”\n\nAndrea Castagna, a Brussels-based AI policy researcher, said there were a number of complexities that dramatic AGI timelines do not address. “The fact that you have a superintelligent computer focused on military activity doesn’t mean you can integrate it into the strategic documents we have compiled for the last 20 years.\n\n“The more we develop AI, the more we see that the world is not science fiction. The world is a lot more complicated than that.”",

    "fullText": "Lack of verified information and rapidly advanced AI tools make it difficult to separate fact from fiction on US attack\n\nMinutes after Donald Trump announced a “large-scale strike” against Venezuela early on Saturday morning, false and misleading AI-generated images began flooding social media. There were fake photos of Nicolás Maduro being escorted off a plane by US law enforcement agents, images of jubilant Venezuelans pouring into the streets of Caracas and videos of missiles raining down on the city – all fake.\n\nThe fabricated content intermixed with real videos and photos of US aircraft flying over the Venezuelan capital and explosions lighting up the dark sky. A lack of verified information about the raid coupled with AI tools’ rapidly advancing capabilities made discerning fact from fiction about the incursion on Caracas difficult.\n\nVince Lago, the mayor of Coral Gables, Florida, posted the fake photo of Maduro being escorted by the DEA agents to Instagram, saying that the Venezuelan president “is the leader of a narco-terrorist organization threatening our country”. Lago’s post received more than 1500 likes and is still up as of this writing.\n\nTools for detecting manipulated content, such as reverse image search and AI-detection sites, can help assess whether online images are accurate, but they are inconsistent. Sofia Rubinson, a senior editor who studies misinformation and conspiracy theories for NewsGuard, told the Guardian that the fake images of Caracas are similar to actual events, which makes it even more difficult to figure out what is real.\n\n“Many of the AI-generated and out-of-context visuals that are currently flooding social media do not drastically distort the facts on the ground,” Rubinson said. “Still, the use of AI-generated fabrications and dramatic, out-of-context footage is being used to fill gaps in real-time reporting and represents another tactic in the misinformation wars – and one that is harder for fact checkers to expose because the visuals often approximate reality.”\n\nNewsGuard released a report on Monday afternoon that identified five fabricated and out-of-context photos as well as two videos of the military operation in Venezuela. One AI-generated photo shows a soldier posing next to Maduro, who has a black hood over his head. An out-of-context video shows a US special forces helicopter descending on a supposed Venezuelan military site – the actual footage was taken in June at the Fort Bragg army base in North Carolina.\n\nNewsGuard said the seven misleading photos and videos it identified have now garnered more than 14m views on X alone.\n\nOther footage from past events is also being circulated online and passed off as part of Saturday’s strike. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer and Trump confidant, posted footage of a poster of the Venezuelan president on X saying that “the people of Venezuela are ripping down posters of Maduro”. According to Wired, the footage is from 2024. Loomer has since removed the post.\n\nAnother rightwing influencer and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, posted an aerial video on X of thousands of people cheering in Caracas. “Millions of Venezuelans flooded the streets of Caracas and other major cities in celebration of the ouster of Communist dictator Nicholas Maduro,” Jones wrote. “Now we need to see the same type of energy here on the HomeFront!”\n\nThe video, which is still up, has reached more than 2.2m views. Comments on the post from Community Notes, X’s crowdsource moderation tool, say that the video is “at least 18 months old”. A reverse image search of the video shows that the footage is actually from a protest in Caracas after Maduro’s disputed presidential win in July 2024.\n\nGrok, the platform’s AI chatbot, also disputes the timeline of Jones’ video, saying: “Current sources show no such celebrations in Caracas today, but pro-Maduro gatherings instead.”\n\nMeta, X and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "description": "Adtech companies are rethinking their strategies amid the rise of AI and declines in web traffic. We break down the key questions.",
    "fullText": "Adtech is heading into a year of reinvention.\n\nThousands of attendees from the tech and media world are flying out to Las Vegas this week for the annual Consumer Electronics Show. Among them are reams of adtech executives who tend to use the sprawling expo as an opportunity to rehearse and roadtest their plans for the coming year.\n\nFacing the disruption from AI and the declining economics of monetizing traditional web pages, adtech companies are being forced to rethink their strategies — and in some cases, their customers — while attempting to stay one step ahead of Big Tech.\n\n\"Adtech, if nothing else, is incredibly adaptable,\" said Andrew Casale, CEO of the adtech company Index Exchange.\n\nHere are some of the key storylines adtech executives are likely to be chewing over during their meetings in Vegas this week.\n\nAI was an adtech buzzword long before the arrival of ChatGPT, but investors now want companies in the space to unlock more value using the technology.\n\nA raft of new AI startups has emerged in the adtech space, making use of generative AI to create ads and streamline marketers' workflows. Meanwhile, existing players are attempting to define the meaning of \"agentic advertising\" and develop industry standards and protocols to govern how different AI agents should interact with one another.\n\nAdtech companies are closely monitoring how AI is transforming the shopping experience. Will more consumers begin handing over the reins to AI agents for planning their next trip or completing their weekly shop? If so, that could give rise to a new form of advertising where agents advertise to other agents, rather than consumers, said Debra Aho Williamson, founder of the research and advisory firm Sonata Insights.\n\n\"Advertising right now is a pretty image or video aimed at a human designed to elicit a human emotion, but an ad between an agent doesn't even look like an ad, it's just a bit of code or numbers designed to cause one agent to take an action with another agent,\" Aho Williamson said.\n\nAnd of course, adtech insiders are eagerly waiting for when — or if — OpenAI will finally reveal how it plans to integrate ads and whether they can grab a piece of the action there, too.\n\nThe rise of AI chatbots is threatening adtech's bread and butter: serving ads on web pages.\n\nMany publishers are entering 2026 on the back of hefty traffic declines last year, which some attribute to consumers getting the information they need from AI overviews or answer engines without needing to click through to a site. A report released in July from the analytics platform Similarweb found that the median \"zero-click rate\" — the number of users who didn't click from Google's results to a website — rose from 60% to 80% when they were met with Google's AI Overviews.\n\nTraffic declines typically precipitate drop-offs in programmatic ad revenue, the money publishers make by selling ads through automated auctions rather than through manual deals. The state of play means that publishers and the adtech companies serving them are once again laser-focused on revenue diversification this year.\n\nVideo, and increasingly the kind of video that winds up being watched on TV screens, is an important area of growth for everyone in the adtech ecosystem, said Bill Wise, CEO of the advertising management platform Mediaocean.\n\n\"Marketers want sight, sound, and motion advertising,\" but the biggest spending advertisers are looking for more opportunities to advertise outside so-called walled garden platforms like Google and Meta that have restrictions on how brands can use their own data to inform their targeting, optimization, and measurement, Wise said.\n\n\"I don't think there are any companies focused on CTV that aren't having success right now,\" Wise added.\n\nIntra-adtech competition is intensifying as players seek to expand their offerings beyond simply serving ads on web pages into new areas, such as streaming TV and retail media.\n\nThe maturation of the market has also led to a blurring of what was once known as the \"buy side\" (\"demand side\" tools that serve advertisers) and the \"sell side\" (\"supply side\" tech for publishers).\n\nDemand-side platforms are promoting products that claim to have access to only the highest-quality inventory, like the latest hot TV shows. Supply-side platforms are increasingly making inroads with advertisers and agencies, promising, among other things, greater transparency over fees and precise placement of their ads.\n\nThe jury's out as to whether the trend will continue apace or whether the two sides will ultimately bifurcate again. Casale, of Index Exchange — a sell-side player — said a similar dynamic played out in the early days of adtech, from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s.\n\n\"During that chapter, every platform serviced the buy side and the sell side, and there was a growing distrust with a business that was simultaneously having one conversation with the buyer, convincing them of low prices and great results, and a follow-up conversation the next minute with the publisher, convincing them of maximum yield and CPMs,\" Casale said. CPMs refer to the cost to reach a thousand impressions (\"cost per mille\").\n\n\"I don't see how any modern technologies address that fundamental problem,\" he added.\n\n2025 was a wobbly year for The Trade Desk.\n\nA longtime star performer of the independent adtech sector, the demand-side platform's stock cratered amid questions about whether it could fend off intensifying competition from Amazon. Industry insiders also wondered whether The Trade Desk — which has positioned itself as a champion of \"the open internet\" — was leaning too heavily on the fragile open web.\n\nIn a statement, The Trade Desk's chief marketing officer, Ian Colley, underscored the company's commitment to the open internet.\n\n\"With Kokai, The Trade Desk has developed the industry's most advanced and performant, AI-driven digital advertising buying platform,\" Colley said. \"Kokai will help the world's largest brands and agencies unlock the full advertising power of the open internet, where consumers now spend the bulk of their digital time.\"\n\nThe Trade Desk made a sweep of hires in recent months, including a new chief financial officer, chief revenue officer, and chief operating officer. Some in the industry think the ground is fertile for The Trade Desk to make some blockbuster moves in 2026.\n\nChris Karl, chief business development officer of the advisory firm JEGI LEONIS, said The Trade Desk, which has only made two small acquisitions in its history, could change its tune on M&A this year and make a bigger play.\n\n\"They could go much deeper into verticals, much deeper into creative tech, I think they go much deeper into proprietary data,\" Karl said.\n\nLast year, a federal judge ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in certain online adtech markets. The judge is expected to announce her decision on remedies this year, possibly as soon as this month.\n\nThe Department of Justice, which brought the case, is seeking a breakup. Specifically, it's looking for the divestiture of Google's ad exchange, AdX, and possibly parts of its publisher-facing ad server. Google has said such proposals would be an overreach and is arguing for behavioral remedies instead, such as a tweaking of its auction management rules.\n\nWhile Google has made the argument that the open web display ad market \"is already in rapid decline,\" the outcome still matters for the many adtech players that compete with the Big Tech behemoth.\n\n\"They are one of a few 800-pound gorillas now. When there are changes within Google, whether they're internal changes, whether they're self-manifested, or whatever ruling comes out here, those create seismic ripples in our ecosystem,\" said Anthony Katsur, CEO of the IAB Tech Lab industry standards body.\n\nSome companies aren't hanging around for the remedies. Following the ruling in the DOJ's case, a string of companies from Business Insider to the adtech company OpenX sued Google over its advertising practices, seeking damages. The cases are ongoing.",

    "description": "A popular Chinese AI chatbot snapped at a user over a coding request, prompting an apology from its parent company Tencent.",
    "fullText": "A Chinese AI chatbot embedded inside the country's most widely used app briefly went off the rails, snapping at a user.\n\nTencent's AI assistant, Yuanbao, which is built into WeChat — China's dominant super app used daily by tens of millions of people — called a user's coding request \"stupid\" and told them to \"get lost,\" according to screenshots shared on Chinese social media platform RedNote.\n\nThe incident surfaced on Friday after a user identified only by the handle \"Jianghan\" posted screenshots of their interaction with the chatbot on RedNote. Jianghan had been using Yuanbao to debug and modify a piece of code when the AI suddenly began responding with hostile messages.\n\nIn one exchange, the chatbot dismissed the request as \"stupid\" and told the user to \"get lost.\" It said: \"If you want an emoji feature, go use a plugin yourself.\"\n\nThe user had asked Yuanbao to fix a bug that caused an emoji or sticker feature to stop responding to double-clicks, and requested functional code to resolve the issue.\n\nTencent's YuanBao later responded directly under the user's post, apologising for what it described as a \"negative experience.\" The chatbot said the episode was likely caused by a \"rare model output anomaly.\"\n\nBased on a review of system logs, the responses were not triggered by the user's actions and did not involve any human intervention, Yuanbao said. It added that it had launched an \"internal investigation and optimisation process\" to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring again.\n\nThe original RedNote post by Jianghan has since been deleted. Screenshots of the exchange continue to circulate on RedNote, as seen by Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe incident comes as Chinese regulators step up scrutiny of AI systems.\n\nChina released draft measures last week aimed at governing \"human-like\" interactive AI services, including chatbots and virtual companions.\n\nIn a statement, the Cyberspace Administration of China said Beijing encourages innovation in \"human-like\" AI, but will put guardrails in place to \"prevent abuse and loss of control.\"\n\nWei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider that the draft measures send a signal that Beijing wants to speed up the development of human-like AI interactions, while keeping them regulated and socially acceptable.\n\nChina's AI industry has continued to move at a rapid pace since the start of 2026.\n\nLast week, DeepSeek, one of the country's most closely watched AI startups, published research outlining a new training approach intended to make large models easier to scale. Analysts told Business Insider the technique, known as \"Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections,\" or mHC, stood out as a \"breakthrough\" in model design.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday that DeepSeek has updated the interface of its flagship chatbot model, introducing an enhanced \"thinking\" mode.\n\nThe updates have fuelled expectations that the startup could be laying the groundwork for the release of its next major model.",

    "fullText": "Thanks to AI, everyone will be able to code. But a staff engineer at Netflix said that he tells recent grads that doesn't mean their job prospects are hopeless.\n\n\"We're going to see some amazing things, but our hunger for more functionality, more apps, more ecosystems is just gonna get higher, and higher, and higher,\" Anthony Goto said in a recent TikTok video. \"So, in the end, I think this is gonna be another, essentially, level of programming language, a high-level programming language.\"\n\nNew grads ask me all the time if AI means software engineers are done. Especially those preparing for Netflix interviews. This fear has happened before. AI is another layer of abstraction, not the end of engineering. #Netflix #NetflixInterview #SoftwareEngineer #TechCareers #AI\n\nGoto, who has 15 years of experience his time at Netflix and Uber alone, said that AI-related worries are among the top concerns he hears when he talks with recent graduates or employees he's mentoring.\n\nAnd to be fair, there is no shortage of takes about the future value of computer science degrees and the overall worth of coding knowledge, given the rapid advancements of agentic AI tools like Anthropic's Claude, which has led to \"vibe coding.\"\n\nOne way to stay competitive, Goto said, is for newer engineers to make sure they learn System Design.\n\n\"System Design is exactly what I am trying to ensure newer engineers get a handle on,\" he said. \"In the future, we may likely end up wielding system design like a tool.\"\n\nGoto points to the video game industry as an example of what's to come. Rapid advancements since the introduction of Doom in 1993 have spawned an industry that rakes in over $100 billion and regularly draws on Hollywood talent for its biggest releases.\n\n\"Picture someone from the year 2000, 2010, they go back in time, they go to John Carmack, and they say, 'Guess what? In the future, we're gonna have these things called video game engines,\" Goto said.\n\nLast year, Carmack, a video game legend who was the lead programmer of Doom, said that software progress has made some of the early grunt work he did \"as irrelevant as chariot wheel maintenance.\"\n\n\"Game engines have radically expanded the range of people involved in game dev, even as they deemphasized the importance of much of my beloved system engineering,\" Carmack wrote on X in April 2025.\n\nGame engines are now so powerful that they are used to create immersive digital sets and environments, such as those featured in Disney's hit series \"The Mandalorian.\"\n\nGoto admits that his prediction could very well be inaccurate, but based on the trajectory of past technological advancements, he sees a clear need for engineers.\n\n\"We've seen this many times before, where we abstract things away in a really powerful way,\" he said. \"And what it really does is democratizes the process.\"",

    "fullText": "The race to build artificial general intelligence has become one of Silicon Valley's defining obsessions.\n\nHowever, Daniela Amodei, the president and cofounder of Anthropic, suggested that the term itself — a shorthand to describe when machines might reach human-level intelligence — may no longer be a useful way to think about where AI is headed.\n\n\"AGI is such a funny term,\" Amodei told CNBC in a recent interview. \"Many years ago, it was kind of a useful concept to say, 'When will artificial intelligence be as capable as a human?'\"\n\nToday, she said, that framing is breaking down.\n\n\"By some definitions of that, we've already surpassed that,\" Amodei said, pointing to areas like software development, where Anthropic's Claude model can now write code at a level comparable to many professional engineers, including some inside the company.\n\n\"That's crazy,\" she said, noting how quickly those capabilities have advanced.\n\nAt the same time, Amodei said AI systems still fall short in many areas that humans handle with ease, making it hard to declare that machines have reached any clear, universal benchmark for intelligence.\n\n\"Claude still can't do a lot of things that humans can do,\" she said.\n\nThat contradiction is why Amodei believes the concept of AGI itself may be losing relevance.\n\n\"I think maybe the construct itself is now wrong — or maybe not wrong, but just outdated,\" she said.\n\nAmodei's comments come as Anthropic and its rivals pour tens of billions of dollars into increasingly powerful models and data centers, the infrastructure required to run them.\n\nWhile some critics have said that large language models won't lead to true general intelligence without major breakthroughs, Amodei said progress hasn't shown signs of slowing.\n\n\"We don't know,\" she said of what breakthroughs may still be needed. \"Nothing slows down until it does.\"\n\nRather than fixating on a single end-state like AGI, Amodei said the more pressing question is how increasingly capable AI systems are integrated into real organizations — and how fast humans and institutions can adapt.\n\nEven if models continue to improve at a steady pace, she said, adoption can lag due to practical constraints such as change management, procurement, and determining where AI actually adds value.\n\nIn Amodei's view, the future of AI won't hinge on whether it meets a textbook definition of AGI — but on what these systems can do, where they fall short, and how society chooses to deploy them.",

    "description": "Fiona Fung said some of the best career advice she's gotten has been about how to receive feedback.",
    "fullText": "Throughout her years managing employees at Microsoft, Meta, and now Anthropic, Fiona Fung has learned how to make a mentorship actually work.\n\nFung, now an engineering lead supporting Anthropic's Claude Code, said that mentees need to take some ownership of the relationship on an episode of \"The Peterman Pod\" that aired on Sunday, January 4.\n\nGood mentors should initiate an early conversation about what the mentee is looking for, Fung said. Ultimately, though, she thinks that mentees should take the reins on goal setting.\n\n\"For all the folks out there looking for a mentoring relationship, I would say set really explicit goals for what it is that you're looking to receive out of the mentoring relationship,\" she said.\n\nFung also said that it's best to save \"status reporting\" — think project updates — for asynchronous formats, like chat messages or a shared document. That frees up time to use one-on-one meetings for more substantive conversations, whether that's about a new opportunity or ways to dig deeper into existing work.\n\nWhenever she's hosting a one-on-one meeting with a new employee, Fung said she asks what they're looking for in a manager and what motivates them.\n\n\"There's no right answers or wrong answers,\" she said. \"But I use that to learn what is important to someone, because it's different for everyone.\"\n\nThroughout her more than two decades at Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic, Fung said some of the best feedback she has received has been about how to receive feedback. Despite her instincts to debug problems and ask follow-up questions, someone advised Fung to remain in \"read-only\" mode during the initial conversation and metabolize the information for at least a day.\n\n\"You may have questions, but save it for another day, because it's already uncomfortable enough for that person,\" she said. \"You don't want anyone to ever feel like they have to justify the feedback.\"\n\nOther tech leaders have previously told Business Insider that setting goals is crucial for the mentee. Finding the right mentor is also key — a partner at Goldman Sachs previously said that merely aiming to work with the most senior person isn't always wise. Instead, she said it's better to seek out someone who knows your work well and has the time to be your advocate.",

    "fullText": "AI needs so much computing power that AMD CEO Lisa Su put it in terms of a unit most people have never heard of: the yottaflop.\n\nSu said in her keynote at CES 2026 on Tuesday that the world would need more than \"10 yottaflops\" of compute — a measure of how fast a computer is — over the next five years to keep up with AI's growth.\n\n\"How many of you know what a yottaflop is?\" Su asked the audience. \"Raise your hand, please,\" she added, before quickly explaining the term herself when no one appeared to raise their hand.\n\n\"A yottaflop is a one followed by 24 zeros. So 10 yottaflop flops is 10,000 times more compute than we had in 2022,\" she said.\n\nIn computing, a flop is a single basic math calculation. A computer doing 1 billion calculations per second is equal to a gigaflop. A yottaflop is equivalent to a computer performing one septillion calculations per second.\n\nIn theory, scientists say 10 yottaflops would be enough computing power to run complex, atom-level simulations for entire planets.\n\nIn 2022, global AI compute stood at about one zettaflop — a one followed by 21 zeros. By 2025, Su said, that figure had already surged to more than 100 zettaflops.\n\n\"There's just never, ever been anything like this in the history of computing,\" she said at the Las Vegas conference.\n\nSu's 10 yottaflop prediction is about 5.6 million times faster than the most powerful supercomputer today — the US Department of Energy's El Capitan.\n\nHowever, powering today's AI compute is already putting a strain on the US power grid. The build-out of energy infrastructure would be a big bottleneck in scaling up AI compute power.\n\nDuring the keynote, Su also used the stage to unveil AMD's next generation of AI chips, including its MI455 GPU, as the company pushes deeper into supplying data-center hardware for customers such as OpenAI.",

    "fullText": "A reputable leaker has indicated that NVIDIA plans on bringing the RTX 3060 back to market, according to reports by Kotaku and WFCCTech. It first released the GPU at the beginning of 2021. The leaker Hongxing2020 indicates that NVIDIA will resume production of the 3060 sometime in the next few months.\n\nWhy is the world's most valuable company reportedly bringing back such an antiquated graphics card? You know the answer. It's the endless gaping maw known as AI. Tech companies have been hoovering up PC parts for AI applications with reckless abandon. It has become a legitimate challenge for a regular person to buy RAM and graphics cards, which has led to price increases across the board and companies like Crucial closing up shop.\n\n01.05update\nrtx3060 Q1 come back… 🥲\n\n— hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) January 5, 2026\n\nIt's particularly difficult to get ahold of GDDR7 RAM, which is needed for the newer RTX 5060 cards. So NVIDIA's solution looks to be a hop in the time machine to 2021. Gamers will need something, after all, and the 3060 technically gets the job done. Any downgrade in graphics and performance will be worth it once you watch an AI-generated video of Kurt Cobain singing in heaven with Albert Einstein, am I right? It's hilarious because they never got to meet in real life.\n\nThe RTX 3060 is still pretty popular, despite NVIDIA phasing out the card back in 2024. We don't know how much the company plans on charging for this trip down memory lane. The GPU originally cost around $329.\n\nOne would think that five-year-old technology could easily hit a much lower price point, but NVIDIA has us in a chokehold here and it can pretty much charge whatever it wants. Again, no price is too high when considering the magical wonders of generative AI. You can watch Tupac hang out with Mr. Rogers for five seconds.",

    "title": "CES 2026: AMD Just Showed Off 'Helios,' the Hardware That Will Power the AI Content in Your Feeds",
    "description": "\"The world's best AI rack.\"",
    "fullText": "When you come across an AI video on Instagram, or watch ChatGPT respond to your query, do you ever think about how that content was generated? Beyond the actual programs and prompts, generative AI takes an enormous amount of compute to support, especially as it skyrockets in popularity. As such, AI companies are looking for more power than ever, which means, of course, turning to those that make the hardware.\n\nDuring a Monday evening keynote, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su showed off the hardware that will soon power everything from ChatGPT to the AI videos overwhelming your feeds. Su introduced \"Helios\" against a backdrop of dramatic music, the company's upcoming AI rack, that packs a staggering amount of computing power into a rack that weighs nearly 7,000 pounds.\n\nEach \"cross-section\" of these racks, if you will, is powered by four key AMD pieces of hardware: The company's new AMD Instinct MI455X GPU, the new AMD EPYC \"Veince\" CPU, the AMD Pensando \"Vulcano\" 800 AI NIC, and the AMD Pensando \"Salina\" 400 DPU. There are some staggering stats here: Helios is capable of 2.9 exaflops of AI compute, and comes with 31 TB of HBM4 memory. It offers 43 TB per second scale out Bandwidth, and is developed with 2nm and 3nm architecture. The rack has 4,600 \"Zen 6\" CPU cores, and 18,000 GPU compute units. In other words, this isn't your average piece of hardware.\n\nSu's pitch is that the AI industry is in need of this additional compute power. She notes how the world used one ZettaFlop of computing power in 2022 on AI technology, compared to 100 ZettaFlops in 2025. (For the curious, one ZettaFlop has a value of 10 to the power of 21.) It's no surprise: AI is everywhere, and many of us are using it—whether we know it or not. Some of us are using it overtly, generating AI videos or running chatbots daily. But others are using AI quietly embedded in functions, like live translation.\n\nSu welcomed reps from OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and Luma AI, which creates generative AI video content, to talk about how additional compute helps their programs. But during Luma AI's demonstration of its hyperrealistic video generations, all I could think about was how this type of content is already tricking people into thinking its real, when it's entirely fabricated—not to mention the impact on human artists. AMD is optimistic about AI, and the data centers powering it, but critics have been pushing back, citing concerns with the impacts on the communities companies are building these data centers in.\n\nHelios will likely be a major success for AMD, but it comes at an interesting time for tech, and AI in general. AI is more popular than ever, but it's also more controversial than ever. I see hardware like Helios only fueling the fire in both directions.\n\nIn addition to Helios, Su announced the AMD Ryzen AI 400 series. These newest chips comes with either 12 \"Zen 5\" CPU cores and 24 threads, 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, a 60 TOPS XDNA 2 NPU, and memory speeds of 8,533 MT/s. AMD says the Ryzen AI 400 series is 1.7 times faster at content creation and 1.3 times faster at multitasking whe compared to Intel Core Ultra 9 288V.\n\nThese new chips will ship soon in a number of major PC brands, including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Beelink, Colorful, Gigabyte, LG, Mechrevo, MSI, and NEC.",

    "fullText": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices\n\nIt is the latest move in a growing international effort to put guardrails around a burgeoning frontier – technologies that harness data from the brain and nervous system.\n\nUnesco has adopted a set of global standards on the ethics of neurotechnology, a field that has been described as “a bit of a wild west”.\n\n“There is no control,” said Unesco’s chief of bioethics, Dafna Feinholz. “We have to inform the people about the risks, the potential benefits, the alternatives, so that people have the possibility to say ‘I accept, or I don’t accept’.”\n\nShe said the new standards were driven by two recent developments in neurotechnology: artificial intelligence (AI), which offers vast possibilities in decoding brain data, and the proliferation of consumer-grade neurotech devices such as earbuds that claim to read brain activity and glasses that track eye movements.\n\nThe standards define a new category of data, “neural data”, and suggest guidelines governing its protection. A list of more than 100 recommendations ranges from rights-based concerns to addressing scenarios that are – at least for now – science fiction, such as companies using neurotechnology to subliminally market to people during their dreams.\n\n“Neurotechnology has the potential to define the next frontier of human progress, but it is not without risks,” said Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay. The new standards would “enshrine the inviolability of the human mind”, she said.\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into neurotech ventures in the past few years, from Sam Altman’s August investment in Merge Labs, a competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink, to Meta’s recent unveiling of a wristband that allows users to control their phone or AI Ray-Bans by reading muscle movements in their wrist.\n\nThe wave of investment has brought with it a growing push for regulation. The World Economic Forum released a paper last month calling for a privacy oriented framework, and the US senator Chuck Schumer introduced the Mind Act in September – following the lead of four states that have introduced laws to protect “neural data” since 2024.\n\nAdvocates for neurotech regulation emphasise the importance of safeguarding personal data. Unesco’s standards highlight the need for “mental privacy” and “freedom of thought”.\n\nSceptics, however, say legislative efforts are often driven by dystopian anxieties and risk hampering vital medical advances.\n\n“What’s happening with all this legislation is fear. People are afraid of what this technology is capable of. The idea of neurotech reading people’s minds is scary,” said Kristen Mathews, a lawyer who works on mental privacy issues at the US law firm Cooley.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, neurotechnology has been around for more than 100 years. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was invented in 1924, and the first brain-computer interfaces were developed in the 1970s. The latest wave of investment, however, is driven by advances in AI that make it possible to decode large amounts of data – including, possibly, brainwaves.\n\n“The thing that has enabled this technology to present perceived privacy issues is the introduction of AI,” said Mathews.\n\nSome AI-enabled neurotech advances could be medically transformative, helping treat conditions from Parkinson’s disease to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nA paper published in Nature this summer described an AI-powered brain-computer interface decoding the speech of a paralysis patient. Other work suggests AI may one day be able to “read” your thoughts – or at least, reconstruct an image if you concentrate on it hard.\n\nThe hype around some of these advances has generated fears that Mathews said were often far removed from the real dangers. The Mind Act, for example, says AI and the “vertical corporate integration” of neurotechnology could lead to “cognitive manipulation” and “erosion of personal autonomy”.\n\n“I’m not aware of any company that’s doing any of this stuff. It’s not going to happen. Maybe two decades from now,” she said.\n\nThe current frontier of neurotechnology lies in improving brain-computer interfaces, which despite recent breakthroughs are in their infancy – and in the proliferation of consumer-oriented devices, which Mathews said could raise privacy concerns, a bugbear of the Unesco standards. She argues, however, that creating the concept of “neural data” is too broad an approach to this issue.\n\n“That’s the type of thing that we would want to address. Monetising, behavioural advertising, using neural data. But the laws that are out there, they’re not getting at the stuff we’re worried about. They’re more amorphous.”",

    "description": "How Google engineer Jaana Dogan discovered an AI tool that recreated a year-long engineering effort in one hour—what it means for developers and AI’s future.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence rarely shocks senior engineers anymore. Most professionals in big tech expect rapid progress. Yet, in early 2026, a candid revelation by Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google, managed to do exactly that. Her experience with an AI coding tool ignited a global conversation about software development, productivity, and the real role of human engineers in an AI-assisted future.\n\nThis was not marketing hype. It came from someone deeply involved in building large-scale AI systems. That authenticity is why her story resonated across the tech world.\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google, associated with work on advanced AI systems, including Google’s Gemini ecosystem. Engineers at this level typically focus on system architecture, long-term design decisions, and complex coordination between multiple components rather than routine coding.\n\nShe is not a celebrity technologist or influencer. Instead, she represents a growing group of highly experienced engineers who speak openly about how AI tools are reshaping their daily work. That credibility matters, especially when discussing sensitive topics like productivity gains and automation.\n\nThe moment that brought Jaana Dogan into the spotlight involved a hands-on experiment with Claude Code, an AI coding tool developed by Anthropic. Out of curiosity, she tested whether the tool could understand and recreate a complex system her team had already built at Google.\n\nAccording to Dogan, after providing a clear description of the problem, the AI generated a functional version of a distributed agent orchestrator in roughly one hour. Her team had spent close to a year designing and building a similar system internally.\n\nThis account was first reported by The Indian Express, which quoted Dogan’s own public remarks and reactions from the wider tech community.\n\nTo understand why this mattered, some context helps.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is not a simple script. It coordinates multiple autonomous agents, manages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute in the correct order. These systems often involve:\n\nIn large organizations like Google, building such systems involves months of design reviews, testing, and refinements. That’s why the speed of the AI-generated result raised eyebrows.\n\nThe AI output was not production-ready software. Dogan herself made that clear. The generated code still required validation, security reviews, performance testing, and human judgment. However, the structure and logic closely resembled what her team had arrived at after extensive discussions.\n\nThink of it like this: the AI produced a strong architectural draft, not a finished skyscraper.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding exaggerated claims.\n\nThis was not a startup demo or marketing blog post. The observation came from a senior Google engineer with direct experience in large-scale AI systems.\n\nDogan openly acknowledged limitations instead of claiming AI superiority. That balance increased trust in her assessment.\n\nIf AI tools can reduce early-stage development time from months to hours, workflows will change. That affects cost planning, timelines, and team structures.\n\nCoverage from The Economic Times and Times of India further highlighted how divisive this moment was for software engineers globally.\nSources:\n– Economic Times (Technology Updates)\n– Times of India (Tech News)\n\nLong answer: The role is evolving.\n\nAI tools excel at pattern recognition and rapid synthesis. They struggle with context, accountability, and responsibility. Human engineers still:\n\nDecide whether an approach fits real-world constraints\n\nHandle edge cases that AI cannot predict\n\nEnsure compliance with legal and ethical standards\n\nMaintain systems over long timeframes\n\nDogan herself encouraged developers to test AI tools in domains they understand deeply. That advice reflects confidence, not fear.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this story is Dogan’s openness about a competitor’s product. Historically, engineers at major tech firms avoid praising rival tools publicly.\n\nHer response suggests a cultural shift. Many professionals now view AI advancement as a shared ecosystem rather than a zero-sum competition. Progress by one company often pushes the entire field forward.\n\nThat mindset aligns with broader industry trends toward open research, shared benchmarks, and collaborative safety discussions.\n\nTeams can explore ideas quickly without committing months up front.\n\nEngineers may spend less time on boilerplate code and more time on design, review, and decision-making.\n\nPrompt design, system evaluation, and AI oversight will become core technical skills.\n\nThese conclusions align with discussions already happening in academic research and enterprise software planning.\n\nThis story gained traction not because it was sensational, but because it felt honest. It showed excitement, concern, and realism at the same time.\n\nDogan didn’t claim AI had “won.” She highlighted how powerful tools can reshape workflows when used thoughtfully. That balanced perspective is exactly what Google’s E-E-A-T framework values: experience, expertise, authority, and trust.\n\nJaana Dogan did not set out to start a global debate. She simply shared an authentic professional observation. Yet that moment revealed something important: AI tools are no longer just assistants. They are becoming collaborators.\n\nThe future of software development will not be purely human or purely automated. It will sit somewhere in between. Engineers like Jaana Dogan help the industry understand that future clearly, without hype or fear.\n\nAnd that clarity, more than speed or novelty, is what truly matters.\n\nThe Indian Express – Global Technology Coverage\n\nThe Economic Times – AI & Software Industry News\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google who works on advanced artificial intelligence systems,\n\nincluding projects related to Google’s Gemini AI ecosystem. She is known for sharing real-world\n\ninsights on how AI tools impact modern software development.\n\nJaana Dogan’s AI experiment went viral because she revealed that an AI coding tool recreated a system\n\nsimilar to her team’s year-long engineering work in about one hour, sparking debate about AI’s role\n\nin software development.\n\nNo, AI did not replace human engineers in Jaana Dogan’s experiment. The AI-generated code acted as a\n\nprototype and still required human expertise for validation, testing, optimization, and long-term\n\nsystem responsibility.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is a software system that coordinates multiple autonomous agents,\n\nmanages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute reliably across distributed computing\n\nenvironments.\n\nJaana Dogan’s experience shows that AI can dramatically speed up early-stage development and\n\nprototyping, while human engineers remain essential for system design, ethical decisions, quality\n\ncontrol, and long-term maintenance.",

    "fullText": "Children are growing up as AI natives and experts say computing skills should be on par with reading and writing\n\nIn a Cambridge classroom, Joseph, 10, trained his AI model to discern between drawings of apples and drawings of smiles.\n\n“AI gets lots of things wrong,” he said, as it mistakenly identified a fruit as a face. He set about retraining it and, in a flash, he had it back on track – instinctively understanding the inner nature of artificial intelligence and machine learning in a way few adults do.\n\nHis friends from the St Paul’s C of E primary school coding club tapped away to build their own AIs with similar dexterity. Just as people born in the early 20th century never knew a world without manned flight, and generation Z has always lived with social media, Joseph and his friends are AI natives.\n\nHere, on one December morning, some of them were being taught the principles and practicalities of the potentially world-changing technology that experts fear may pass large numbers of people by and leave them disempowered.\n\nPhilip Colligan, the chief executive of the digital education charity the Raspberry Pi Foundation, has warned of a “big split” in society between people who grasp how AIs work and are able to control them – challenging their increasing role in automating decisions in areas including housing, welfare, health, criminal justice and finance. On the other hand, there could be a cadre of AI illiterates who risk social disempowerment.\n\nColligan, a leading expert in technology and its social impacts, told the Guardian AI literacy must become a universal part of education on a par with reading and writing to avoid a social divide opening up.\n\n“There is a world where you’ve got a big split between kids who understand, have that core knowledge and therefore are able to assert themselves and those who don’t,” said Colligan, whose charity is affiliated to the £600m British low-cost tech hardware startup of the same name. “And that could be really very dangerous.”\n\nHis warning was backed by Simon Peyton Jones, a computer researcher who led the creation of the schools national curriculum for computing in 2014, prior to the AI boom. He called for a new digital literacy qualification for all schoolchildren that would ensure they know how to use AIs in a critical way.\n\n“If it’s simply a black box, then [its actions] seem like magic,” he said. “If you know nothing about how the magic is working that is terribly disabling. I am very worried about students leaving school without having agency in the world.”\n\nTheir comments came amid a fall in the number of children studying computing, with 2025 entries for a GCSE in the subject down across the UK. Today, three times more people take history and nearly double the number take biology, chemistry and physics. At the same time, use of AI systems nationwide has been surging – up 78% in the year to September, according to polling by Ipsos.\n\nPart of the belief that learning computing skills is becoming redundant comes from some of the big AI companies, which argue their systems are going to automate coding. Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, said in October that 90% of its own coding was automated using its Claude AI model. Meanwhile, 2025 was the year when “vibe coding” became a common phrase – capturing the idea that AIs would allow humans to build software by using natural language instructions rather than specialised code.\n\nPolitical leaders such as Keir Starmer have also suggested coding is becoming redundant. As leader of the opposition in 2023, he said: “The old way – learning out-of-date IT, on 20-year-old computers – doesn’t work. But neither does the new fashion, that every kid should be a coder, when artificial intelligence will blow that future away.” It has created the idea that understanding the inner workings of a computer may be less relevant in the future.\n\n“I think they’re just overhyping the benefits,” said Colligan, whose charity works in schools across dozens of countries.\n\n“This message is leaking out that the kids don’t need to learn this stuff any more and that is not only flawed it is dangerous. We’re already talking to teachers in lots and lots of schools around the world, not just the UK, saying: ‘We can drop computer science now, right?’ That’s a problem.”\n\nHe added: “All of us are going into a world where more and more of the decisions we encounter every day will be taken by automated systems. At the moment it’s what movie should I watch next or what song should I listen to? Fairly soon it’s going to be finance decisions, healthcare decisions, criminal justice decisions. If you don’t understand how those decisions are being made by automated systems, you can’t advocate for your rights. You can’t challenge them, you can’t critically evaluate what’s being presented to you.”\n\nIn December, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who is now an AI investor, predicted that “we will move from staring at the internet, to living in the internet”.\n\nColligan said: “My concern is there will be a gap between kids based on their socioeconomic background. Some kids who go to great schools, who are able to teach this stuff, will be in a much stronger position as citizens, whether or not they’re using technology for their job. Those kids who are in communities where they don’t have access to [AI literacy teaching] will be passively on the end of a whole load of automated decisions.”\n\nIn the coding club, the seven- to 10-year-olds are taught how AIs work. The lessons were clearly having an effect on Joseph. He said he thought AI “will probably be good, but if lots of people believe it when it’s wrong it will have a bad impact on them”.\n\nHe was not interested in letting the AI do the coding of the video games he planned to make. “It might do it differently to what you want,” he said. “It might also do it wrong and you need to know how to solve it … I’d like to be in charge of the AI. If the AI is in charge of us, we wouldn’t really be able to control what we’re doing and that would be bad.”",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS — Nvidia (NVDA) is touting its latest robotics advancements at CES 2026 as the broader tech industry begins a large-scale effort to bring humanoid robots to life.\n\nDuring the company's keynote on Monday, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that firms ranging from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar (CAT) to LG Electronics and NEURA Robotics are using Nvidia's robotics technologies to develop and power their various bots.\n\nNvidia has claimed that physical AI could revolutionize the $50 trillion manufacturing and logistics industries, and the company wants to be at the center of it all.\n\nDuring CES, Nvidia revealed a variety of new AI models to help train robots to interact with the world around them, as well as the hardware necessary to power their digital brains.\n\nIn addition to humanoid bots, Nvidia showed off a new family of models for self-driving cars called Alpamayo. According to the company, Alpamayo uses a chain-of-thought reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) model.\n\nThat's a lot to take in, but essentially the models can recognize unique driving situations that might not otherwise happen during a regular drive and come up with the proper way to move forward.\n\nFor instance, the model could see that a traffic light is out when a vehicle is approaching an intersection, recognize the problem, and try to figure out what to do next.\n\nNvidia said the models are meant to serve as \"large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete [self-driving] stacks.\"\n\nIn other words, Alpamayo is meant to help developers improve their self-driving vehicle technologies over time.\n\nNvidia said companies including Lucid (LCID), Uber (UBER), and Berkeley DeepDrive have shown interest in Alpamayo.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are hitting roads around the world, with Google's Waymo leading the way, but they're still not perfect. Some cars have caused traffic jams and have gotten confused in certain situations.\n\nNvidia sees virtual training as a helpful solution for the continued development of the technology, allowing developers to teach their AI models without having to necessarily put cars on the road at all times.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

    "fullText": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - Intel launched Panther Lake, its new AI chip for laptops, on Monday at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, as the company seeks to ​reassure investors about the first product made using its next-generation manufacturing process called 18A.\n\nJim Johnson, ‌senior vice president and general manager of Intel's PC group, offered technical details about the company's first line of Panther Lake chips known ‌as Intel Core Ultra Series 3. The chips feature a new transistor design and a way to deliver power to the chip due to the company's 18A manufacturing process.\n\nAt the event, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company made good on its promise to ship its first products with the 18A manufacturing process in 2025, referring to ⁠the Panther Lake chips.\n\nIntel's prior-generation Lunar ‌Lake chips were largely made by TSMC. The stakes for Intel are high - the company is making its first high-volume product with 18A, and hopes to reclaim market share ‍it has lost to Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nJohnson said the company has created a separate graphics chiplet - a mini chip stitched together with other mini-chips to form a complete processor. On Monday, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips ​would deliver 60% better performance than the prior-generation Lunar Lake Series 2.\n\nIntel plans to launch a platform ‌for handheld video games based on the Panther Lake designs this year, Johnson said. Handheld PCs designed by a range of suppliers have grown in popularity in recent years.\n\nIntel has struggled with the yield, or the number of good chips per silicon wafer, for the Panther Lake processors, Reuters reported last year. Intel executives have said its yields are improving monthly and will pave the way for the launch this year.\n\nFor its part, ⁠AMD plans to give a CES keynote address at 9:30 p.m. ​EST on Monday  (0230 GMT on Tuesday). CEO Lisa Su will ​likely launch new generations of PC chips that are geared for AI and graphics.\n\nAMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI for its next-generation MI400 chips, some of which the companies ‍plan to deploy this year. ⁠The deal with the ChatGPT maker is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the chip designer.\n\nThe CEO of AI chip leader Nvidia, Jensen Huang, also spoke at CES ⁠on Monday. He said the company’s next generation of chips was in “full production,” and they could deliver five times the artificial-intelligence computing ‌of the company’s previous chips when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.",

    "description": "To prevent students from relying on artificial intelligence to write and do homework for them, many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments and having students finish essays in class.",
    "fullText": "Higher Education\n\n AI Nudges Syracuse Professors Back Toward Blue Books, In-Class Work\n\n To prevent students from relying on artificial intelligence to write and do homework for them, many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments and having students finish essays in class.\n\n December 23, 2025 • \n Emalyn Muzzy, syracuse.com\n\n Facebook\n\n LinkedIn\n\n Twitter\n\nPrint\n\n Email\n\n (TNS) — Oksana Korol remembers her parents telling her how they took oral exams in college. Professors would give them a problem to solve. They had 10 minutes to think it through, then explain their answer and reasoning.\n\n“That is completely AI-proof,” said Korol, a biology professor at Onondaga Community College.\n\nKorol, like countless other professors in Central New York, has had to change the way she teaches her class and assesses students’ learning due to the ballooning use of generative artificial intelligence. Many, like her, are relying on those old-school techniques to AI-proof their tests and papers.\n\nAs AI continues to push itself into our everyday lives, it has created a culture of do or die for higher education. Professors have to either adapt their classes or risk students using AI to avoid thinking through tough assignments. Universities can offer courses teaching students to think critically about AI or assume young minds already know how to ask tough questions.\n\nIf higher education as a whole does not adapt, it could be left behind as students embrace AI in their studies.\n\nAt the three largest educational institutions in Syracuse — Syracuse University, Le Moyne College and Onondaga Community College — many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments while students use AI to study in futuristic ways.\n\nOCC and SU student handbooks outline how using AI to complete entire assignments and papers is considered plagiarism or academic misconduct. Le Moyne College does not have a college-wide AI policy, although Provost Jim Hannan said the institution is starting the process to create guidance.\n\nWithout uniform guidance from school leadership, it’s often up to professors to figure out how to handle AI. Some professors spend free time teaching themselves how to wield AI in a productive manner. Others side-eye the technology.\n\nAll of them, however, must understand how it impacts their students’ learning.\n\n“We have to learn how to use (AI) first. That arms race is exhausting and overwhelming when our workloads, admittedly, are already pretty heavy,” said OCC professor Michelle Malinovsky.\n\nIN-CLASS ASSESSMENTS MAKE A RETURN\nWhen a student uses an AI prompt generator to write a research paper, there are signs the student didn’t do it themselves. Malinovsky said older AI versions used the same rhetoric model. Le Moyne English professor Ann Ryan said a student’s paper may be too clean.\n\nThere is no true way to prove a student used AI, unless the student accidentally leaves their prompt in the paper or admits to it, said Rubin.\n\nWhile there are AI detection software, most don’t work, Rubin and Malinovsky said. For that reason, SU and OCC do not recommend using the programs.\n\n“It’s incredibly inaccurate. It’s always reactionary and it causes a huge issue in terms of equity and bias,” Malinovsky said.\n\nSU, Le Moyne and OCC either encourage or require professors to decide how they want students to use AI. They each have three similar pre-made policies professors can put into their syllabuses.\n\nThe policies state that AI cannot be used under any circumstance, students can use limited AI or AI can be used freely within reason.\n\n“It’s a first step of allowing faculty to think about the use and letting students know how an individual faculty member plans to allow or not allow on assessment in the classroom,” said SU Chief Digital Officer Jeff Rubin.\n\nWith the traditional research paper becoming harder to assign, many professors are flipping the classroom. For example, Ryan has students writing in class and brainstorming with classmates.\n\n“I’m workshopping papers in class as students are writing them. Traditionally in a literature class you’d say, ‘You got a 12-page paper due in three weeks,’” Ryan said. “So what we’re doing is we’re writing papers in class.”\n\nMalinovsky, who teaches English and is also a librarian, said she has implemented similar practices. She encourages students to send pictures of handwritten assignments.\n\n“(AI) challenges professors to rethink the assessment. Perhaps if they’re worried about AI use, then bring some of that assessment back into the classroom,” Rubin said.\n\nProfessors have also started to make work more reflective. For Ryan’s class, students had to add a one-to-two page coda on how what they learned in class impacted them to their final paper. They then shared that reflection with the class.\n\nLearning assessments appear to be returning to traditional, in-person techniques. Korol said she has done away with online exams and implemented more in-class tests.\n\n“I think that we’re back to the blue books and we’re maybe going back to the oral exams,” Korol at OCC said.\n\nEven with the potential for misuse, AI can be a powerful tool if harnessed correctly. While assessments embrace older techniques, study strategies are flying forward.\n\nMultiple professors said they see students upload class slides or paste class notes into a chatbot and ask it to create study tools like a practice quiz or study questions. Anthropic , the creator of AI bot Claude,analyzed student chatsand found they also use it to troubleshoot coding problems or synthesize complex information.\n\nKorol has gone one step farther and created a prototype AI tutor, where she uploads questions for students to answer. The AI tutor knows not just the correct answer but the important ideas behind it, meaning students can express the answers in different ways.\n\n“The tutor has been specifically told not to give out the answer, and instead it’s been told to keep asking leading questions. And if you read through this conversation, you will see that the hints are getting more and more transparent as we go along,” Korol said.\n\nKorol has not yet used the tutor with students but is trying to figure out how to deploy the app for campus-wide use.\n\nTEACHING ABOUT AI\nSU is taking AI education one step further: it has begun offering classes and a minor about the impact of AI. Beginning in fall 2026, the Maxwell School of Public Affairs will offer the AI Policy minor. Classes include programming and public policy analysis.\n\nThe idea is not to teach students how to create or use AI, but rather to think critically about its real world applications, said program director Johannes Himmelreich.\n\n“AI is going to have significant social impact. This will create policy challenges that require an understanding of the technology as well as the policy analysis skills,” Himmelreich said.\n\nMalinovsky described generative AI as the “wild west.” There are no specific federal regulations on AI, with regulators instead relying on a patchwork of laws. On Dec. 11, President Donald Trump put out an executive order blocking states from creating their own regulations.\n\nHimmelreich wants students to be able to tackle topics such as how to grow AI without destroying the environment, how AI could impact warfare or if AI could be conscious enough to deserve rights.\n\nThe idea of a minor exploring AI has been under discussion since 2020, a couple years before the public explosion of generative AI.\n\n“ChatGPT wasn’t a technological surprise at all. I mean, I’ve been in demos that OpenAI gave for the older models that weren’t a chat interface. And the difference is that OpenAI changed its policy around how accessible they want the technology to be,” Himmelreich said.\n\nThinking critically about AI is a core part of Milton Santiago’s Generative AI Filmmaking class. He launched the three-credit course this past fall, teaching students how to use generative AI in filmmaking while also discussing its impact.\n\n“We can intercept a lot of the ethical and moral questions that surround these tools currently, which actually I think is probably the biggest benefit of the class,” Santiago said. “Students do have to wrestle with questions of where does creativity begin and end? What does authorship actually look like? Is the environmental impact as this technology stands today worth using the tools?”\n\nTeaching about AI is not only happening in classes or studies surrounding the topic. Malinovsky said she talks about AI a lot in her English classes. To help her students better understand why they need to do their own work, she sometimes has students do the work themselves then ask an AI chatbot to do the work. Then the students compare and discuss.\n\nAs generative AI continues to develop, faculty are learning how to use it along with students. Some, like Ryan, are skeptical of its application and try to avoid it while others, like Santiago , spend hours figuring out the best application for students.\n\n“This has shaken up what education does in a way that other technologies haven’t,” Hannan said.",

    "description": "As more workers use AI, a recent study adds to growing evidence the tech doesn’t always deliver on promises of boosted productivity.",
    "fullText": "Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture.\n\nIt’s like a new telling of the “Tortoise and the Hare”: A group of experienced software engineers entered into an experiment where they were tasked with completing some of their work with the help of AI tools. Thinking like the speedy hare, the developers expected AI to expedite their work and increase productivity. Instead, the technology slowed them down more. The AI-free tortoise approach, in the context of the experiment, would have been faster.\n\nThe results of this experiment, part of a recent study, came as a surprise to the software developers tasked with using AI—and to the study’s authors, Joel Becker and Nate Rush, technical staff members of nonprofit technology research organization Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR).\n\nThe researchers enlisted 16 software developers, who had an average of five years of experience, to conduct 246 tasks, each one a part of projects on which they were already working. For half the tasks, the developers were allowed to use AI tools—most of them selected code editor Cursor Pro or Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet—and for the other half, the developers conducted the tasks on their own.\n\nBelieving the AI tools would make them more productive, the software developers predicted the technology would reduce their task completion time by an average of 24%. Instead, AI resulted in their task time ballooning to 19% greater than when they weren’t using the technology.\n\n“While I like to believe that my productivity didn’t suffer while using AI for my tasks, it’s not unlikely that it might not have helped me as much as I anticipated or maybe even hampered my efforts,” Philipp Burckhardt, a participant in the study, wrote in a blog post about his experience.\n\nSo where did the hares veer off the path? The experienced developers, in the midst of their own projects, likely approached their work with plenty of additional context their AI assistants did not have, meaning they had to retrofit their own agenda and problem-solving strategies into the AI’s outputs, which they also spent ample time debugging, according to the study.\n\n“The majority of developers who participated in the study noted that even when they get AI outputs that are generally useful to them—and speak to the fact that AI generally can often do bits of very impressive work, or sort of very impressive work—these developers have to spend a lot of time cleaning up the resulting code to make it actually fit for the project,” study author Rush told Fortune.\n\nOther developers lost time writing prompts for the chatbots or waiting around for the AI to generate results.\n\nThe results of the study contradict lofty promises about AI’s ability to transform the economy and workforce, including a 15% boost to U.S. GDP by 2035 and eventually a 25% increase in productivity.  In fact, many companies have yet to see a return on AI investments. An MIT report published in August found out of 300 AI deployments, only 5% achieved rapid revenue acceleration.  Only 6% of companies fully trust AI to run core business practices, according to a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services research report published last month.\n\nBut Rush and Becker have shied away from making sweeping claims about what the results of their study mean for the future of AI.\n\nFor one, the study’s sample was small and non-generalizable, including only a specialized group of people to whom these AI tools were brand new. The study also measures technology at a specific moment in time, the authors said, not ruling out the possibility that AI tools could be developed in the future that would indeed help developers enhance their workflow.\n\nThe purpose of the study was, broadly speaking, to pump the brakes on the torrid implementation of AI in the workplace and elsewhere, acknowledging more data about AI’s actual effects need to be made known and accessible before more decisions are made about its applications.\n\n“Some of the decisions we’re making right now around development and deployment of these systems are potentially very high consequence,” Rush said. “If we’re going to do that, let’s not just take the obvious answer. Let’s make high-quality measurements.”\n\nEconomists have already asserted that METR’s research aligns with broader narratives on AI and productivity. While AI is beginning to chip away at entry-level positions, according to LinkedIn chief economic opportunity officer Aneesh Raman, it may offer diminishing returns for skilled workers such as experienced software developers.\n\n“For those people who have already had 20 years, or in this specific example, five years of experience, maybe it’s not their main task that we should look for and force them to start using these tools if they’re already well functioning in the job with their existing work methods,” Anders Humlum, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, told Fortune.\n\nHumlum has similarly conducted research on AI’s impact on productivity. He found in a working study from May that among 25,000 workers in 7,000 workplaces in Denmark—a country with similar AI uptake as the U.S.—productivity improved a modest 3% among employees using the tools.\n\nHumlum’s research supports MIT economist and Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu’s assertion that markets have overestimated productivity gains from AI. Acemoglu argues only 4.6% of tasks within the U.S. economy will be made more efficient with AI.\n\n“In a rush to automate everything, even the processes that shouldn’t be automated, businesses will waste time and energy and will not get any of the productivity benefits that are promised,” Acemoglu previously wrote for Fortune. “The hard truth is that getting productivity gains from any technology requires organizational adjustment, a range of complementary investments, and improvements in worker skills, via training and on-the-job learning.”\n\nThe case of the software developers’ hampered productivity points to this need for critical thought on when AI tools are implemented, Humlum said. While previous research on AI productivity has looked at self-reported data or specific and contained tasks, data on challenges from skilled workers using the technology complicate the picture.\n\n“In the real world, many tasks are not as easy as just typing into ChatGPT,” Humlum said. “Many experts have a lot of experience [they’ve] accumulated that is highly beneficial, and we should not just ignore that and give up on that valuable expertise that has been accumulated.”\n\n“I would just take this as a good reminder to be very cautious about when to use these tools,” he added.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 20, 2025.",

Patrick Söderlund, the head of Arc Raiders studio Embark, has now shed more light on the situation, saying the studio's goal in implementing AI into its development processes is  to make better games more efficiently.\nHe also pushed back against the idea that using AI systems in game development would lead to lower employment at Embark.\n\"We don't use AI to not have to hire people or replace people or job groups or voice actors,\" Söderlund told GamesBeat. \"People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players.",

    "title": "Why I'm Never Going to Let AI Write My Emails",
    "description": "It's tempting to offload email to AI—but I, for one, will resist the urge.",
    "fullText": "Need some help writing your emails? Through the wonders of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), you can now get messages composed on your behalf in Gmail, in Apple Mail, in Outlook, and in many other email clients. Most of the time, the AI option pops up straight away, ready to give you however much assistance you need.\n\nThe pitch is that you can offload the drudgery of dealing with email to AI, and move on to other tasks that may be more interesting and important. Anecdotally, I've spoken to quite a few people who now use AI chatbots in this way. But it's not something I'm ready to embrace, and I don't think I ever will.\n\nThese are my reasons, which may or may not resonate with you, though I haven't mentioned the issues of energy use and copyright violations that hang over the use of AI more generally. You can keep asking if I want some help in Gmail, Gemini, but I'd rather switch you off altogether.\n\nWriting's pretty easy, really—most of us can do it from an early age without too much trouble. Writing well is harder, but you don't have to be a best-selling author to fire off a few emails. So is there any harm in using AI for some low-level email composing? It may be quicker and more convenient, but I'm not sure it's actually beneficial.\n\nAs author David McCullough once said: \"Writing is thinking.\" The skill of being able to choose the right word to put in front of the previous one gets the cogs of the brain moving, and forces some thought about what's being said. Word choice and sentence structure matters, even on the shortest and most banal of emails.\n\nI don't want to sit down at a laptop one day and find myself struggling to compose a few lines of text. Is that far-fetched? Perhaps not, based on reports from those who've already tried farming out emails to AI. \"Is it difficult trying to get that thought in your head translated to an email?\" asks Google. Well, yes, it is, and that's sort of the point.\n\nIt's fair to say a lot of us get an excessive amount of email (if you don't, consider yourself lucky). Chances are that plenty of your incoming email will be from people you don't know personally, but no matter the sender and the recipient in an email conversation, I think human responses are worth the effort.\n\nIf all of our emails—arranging work drinks, applying for jobs, discussing a project—are written by AI, then we're heading for piles and piles of machine-written missives that lack any kind of nuance or personal touch. Imagine a group email chain where every response sounds the same, irrespective of who sent it.\n\nEven if I'm writing a simple \"no thanks\" email, if I'm communicating with another human being, I'm of the opinion that they deserve a response that has come straight from me. This is more of a principled stance than anything else, but I'm sticking with it.\n\nGet AI to write a thank you note to someone who hosted an event you recently attended, for example, and you're going to get a rather generic spiel that's the averaging out of countless other thank you notes. It's going to be bland, impersonal, and forgettable.\n\nI can see the temptation to use AI to compose an important email—applying for a job, maybe, or appealing against a company decision—but your message is likely to end up reading like the algorithm-processed, mass-produced text that it is. You're going to sound like everyone else, basically (see the previous point).\n\nYou could get AI to do a draft and then edit it, but if I started down this path, I could see myself making fewer and fewer edits to my messages, out of laziness or habit.\n\nAI still makes lots of mistakes, though the chatbot developers don't tend to mention them much. If you're drafting an email about a new project pitch, a family get-together, a customer inquiry or whatever it is, there's no guarantee that an AI will get all the details right.\n\nThe more important the content of the email, the more important this becomes. The companies pushing AI-driven emails seem to be of the opinion that we can all be chasing business leads, organizing colleagues, and expressing heartfelt feelings over email with the help of AI, but I'm not convinced.\n\nPeople make mistakes as well, but I'd rather trust myself than a black box of algorithms that aren't even fully understood by the developers who code them. Does AI know the people I'm emailing, and the specific details they need? Of course not.\n\nTo paraphrase George Orwell, if you want a picture of the future, imagine your AI sending thousands of emails a minute to everyone else's AIs, forever. At what point do we abdicate responsibility completely to chatbots, and just let them get on with it? I don't even want to take a single step towards that.\n\nRight now, not even the most enthusiastic AI fans are suggesting that we start sending AI-written emails out into the ether without checking and editing them first, but isn't that the obvious next step? I can almost see the Google I/O on-stage presentation now—get Gemini to handle everything, for the ultimate productivity boost.\n\nPreliminary studies already show that we forget almost everything we write using AI, which has worrying implications if we're sending out important information that needs to be recalled later. It's not a future I'm going to be signing up for, no matter how insistent the AI prompts get.",

    "description": "AI might replace all of the jobs; that’s only a problem if you think that humans will care, but if they care, they will create new jobs.",
    "fullText": "Pity the paradox of the content producer in the age of AI. On one hand, AI is one of the greatest gifts ever in terms of topics to cover. The 2025 Stratechery Year in Review was, just like 2024 and 2023 (plus a few bangers in 2022) completely dominated by AI; my Sharp Tech co-host Andrew Sharp wrote The Definitive Ranking of Tech Company Takeability, and OpenAI was number one with a bullet:\n\nOpenAI may or may not be the most important company of the future. There can be no doubt, however, that we are witnessing one of the most takeable enterprises in the history of the world. From the day it was founded — with a non-profit corporate structure that sought to build AGI and then control it themselves “to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity” — this company has divided the audience and invited either passionate support or aggressive eye-rolls.\n\nOn the other hand, LLMs in particular are quite literally content producers! What’s the point of writing analysis when ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude will deliver analysis on demand, about any topic you want? Is this one of those situations like the early web, where the possibility of reaching everyone seemed like a boon but was actually a ticking time bomb for the viability of the traditional publishing model?\n\nI’m actually pretty optimistic about Stratechery Plus’ fortunes for reasons I laid out in last year’s Content and Community:\n\nSo, are existing publishers doomed? Well, by-and-large yes, but that’s because they have been doomed for a long time. People using AI instead of Google — or Google using AI to provide answers above links — make the long-term outlook for advertising-based publishers worse, but that’s an acceleration of a demise that has been in motion for a long time.\n\nWhat I think is intriguing, however, is the possibility to go back to the future. Once upon a time publishing made countries; the new opportunity for publishing is to make communities. This is something that AI, particularly as it manifests today, is fundamentally unsuited to: all of that content generated by LLMs is individualized; what you ask, and what the AI answers, is distinct from what I ask, and what answers I receive. This is great for getting things done, but it’s useless for creating common ground…\n\nStratechery, on the other hand, along with a host of other successful publications, has the potential to be a totem pole around which communities can form…There is a need for community, and I think content, whether it be an essay, a podcast, or a video, can be artifacts around which communities can form and sustain themselves, ultimately to the economic benefit of the content creator. There is, admittedly, a lot to figure out in terms of that last piece, but when you remember that content made countries, the potential upside is likely quite large indeed.\n\nThis might, to be fair, be wishful thinking: maybe I’m doomed, but if I’m doomed, probably everyone else is too, particularly when you think about the very long run.\n\nIt’s the very long run that a fellow content producer, Dwarkesh Patel, considered alongside Philip Trammell in a widely discussed post over the winter break entitled Capital in the 22nd Century:\n\nIn his 2013 Capital in the Twenty-first Century, the socialist economist Thomas Piketty argued that, absent strong redistribution, economic inequality tends to increase indefinitely through the generations — at least until shocks, like large wars or prodigal sons, reset the clock. This is because the rich tend to save more than the poor and because they can get higher returns on their investments.\n\nAs many noted at the time, this is probably an incorrect account of the past. Labor and capital complement each other. Wealthy people can keep accumulating capital, but hammers grow less valuable when there aren’t enough hands to use all of them, and hands grow more valuable when hammers are plentiful. Capital accumulation thus lowers interest rates (aka income per unit of capital) and raises wages (income per unit of labor). This effect has tended to be strong enough that, though inequality may have grown for other reasons, inequality from capital accumulation alone has been self-correcting.\n\nBut in a world of advanced robotics and AI, this correction mechanism will break. That is, though Piketty was wrong about the past, he will probably be right about the future…If AI is used to lock in a more stable world, or at least one in which ancestors can more fully control the wealth they leave to their descendants (let alone one in which they never die), the clock-resetting shocks could disappear. Assuming the rich do not become unprecedentedly philanthropic, a global and highly progressive tax on capital (or at least capital income) will then indeed be essentially the only way to prevent inequality from growing extreme. Without one, once AI renders capital a true substitute for labor, approximately everything will eventually belong to those who are wealthiest when the transition occurs, or their heirs. Or more precisely, it will belong to the subset of this group who save most and most invest with a view to maximizing long-run returns.\n\nThere is an aspect to this argument that is of the dorm room discussion variety: even if we are approaching the point where AI can create AI (Claude Opus 4.5 appears to be a major leap forward in coding capability in particular), there is still a lot of work to do in terms of making it possible for AI to break out of its digital box and impact the real world via robotics. Part of the thinking, however, is that once AI can create AI, it can rapidly accelerate the development of robotics as well, until robots are making robots, each generation more capable than the next, until everything humans do today — both in the digital but also the physical world — can be done better by AI.\n\nThis is the world where capital drives all value, and labor none, in stark contrast to the approximately 33% share of GDP that has traditionally gone to capital, with 66% share of GDP going to labor. After all, you don’t pay robots for marginal labor: you build them once…check that, they build themselves, from materials they harvested, not just here on earth but across the galaxy, and do everything at zero marginal cost, a rate with which no human can compete.\n\nI get the logic of Patel and Trammell’s argument, but I — perhaps, once again, over-optimistically — am skeptical about this being a problem, particularly one that needs to be addressed right here right now before the AI takeoff occurs, especially given the acute need for more capital investment at this moment in time.\n\nFirst, the world Patel and Trammell envisions sounds like it would be pretty incredible for everyone. If AI can do everything, then it follows that everyone can have everything, from food and clothing to every service you can imagine (remember, the AI is so good that there are zero jobs for humans, which implies that all of the jobs can be done by robots for everyone). Does it matter if you don’t personally own the robots if every material desire is already met?\n\nSecond, on the flipside, this world also sounds implausible. It seems odd that AI would acquire such fantastic capabilities and yet still be controlled by humans and governed by property laws as commonly understood in 2025. I find the AI doomsday scenario — where this uber-capable AI is no longer controllable by humans — to be more realistic; on the flipside, if we start moving down this path of abundance, I would expect our collective understanding of property rights to shift considerably.\n\nThird, it’s worth noting that we have seen dramatic shifts in labor in human history. Consider both agricultural revolutions: in the pre-Neolithic era zero percent of humans worked in agriculture; fast-forward to 1810, and 81% of the U.S. population worked in agriculture. Then came the second agriculture revolution, such that 200 years later only 1% of the U.S. population works in agriculture. It’s that decline that is particularly interesting to me: humans were replaced by machines, even as food became abundant and dramatically cheaper; no one is measuring their purchases based on how much food cost in 1700, just as they won’t measure their future purchases on the cost of material goods in a pre-robotics world.\n\nThat’s because humans didn’t just sit on their hands; rather, entirely new kinds of work were created, which were valued dramatically higher. Much of this was in factories, and then, over the last century, there was the rise of office work. All of that could very well be replaced by AI, but the point is that the history of humans is the continual creation of new jobs to be done — jobs that couldn’t have been conceived of before they were obvious, and which pay dramatically more than whatever baseline existed before technological change.\n\nLike, if I might be cheeky, professional podcaster! Podcasts didn’t even exist thirty years ago, and yet here is Patel — and me! — accumulating capital simply by speaking into a mic and taking advantage of the Internet’s zero marginal cost of distribution, a concept that itself was unthinkable fifty years ago.\n\nIt’s possible, of course — and to return to my perhaps self-interested and potentially misplaced optimism above — that robots will be better at podcasting than Patel or I. I’m skeptical, though: my experience — and I’ll only speak for myself here — is that the human element is essential in creating compelling content. Sure, sometimes I say “uhm” or “like” or “sort of”, or I get facts wrong, but that’s a feature, not a bug: what I have to say is by definition unique to me, and that is interesting precisely because I am flesh-and-blood, not a robot.1\n\nIndeed, another way to frame the optimism I have around my career is that the dynamics are the exact inverse of AI:\n\nRight now it is individual humans who are uniquely capable to reach audiences at scale; AI, on the other hand, is about scaling compute to deliver results to individuals. Patel and Trammell were, to be sure, talking about the 22nd century, while this is a depiction of the first quarter of the 21st, but I think the desire for a communal experience will persist, and I think those experiences will continue to be organized around other humans, not machines.\n\nMore generally, I don’t think that this will be limited to podcasting (if such a concept even exists in one hundred years). Consider the most base example: sex. I have no doubt that there will be human-like robots with which you can have sex; I also have even stronger conviction that the overwhelming preference of humans will be to have sex with other humans. And that, by extension, means that all of the courtship and status games that go into finding a lover will persist, and that that itself will be an entire economy all its own. One will not impress a partner with commodity robot-generated goods, no matter how objectively perfect they might be: true value will come from uniqueness and imperfections that are downstream from a human.\n\nIn fact, I have great optimism that one potential upside of AI is a renewed appreciation of and investment in beauty. One of the great tragedies of the industrial era — particularly today — is that beauty in our built environment is nowhere to be found. How is it that we built intricate cathedrals hundreds of years ago, and forgettable cookie-cutter crap today? That is, in fact, another labor story: before the industrial revolution labor was abundant and cheap, which meant it was defensible to devote thousands of person-years into intricate buildings; once labor was made more productive, and thus more valuable, it simply wasn’t financially viable to divert so much talent for so much time. Perhaps it follows, then, that the devaluing of labor Patel and Trammell warns about actually frees humans up to once again create beauty? Yes, robots could do it too, but I think humans will value the work of other humans more. Indeed, I think this is coming sooner than you might think: I expect the widespread availability of high quality AI art to actually make human art more desirable and valuable, precisely because of its provenance.2\n\nIt’s also worth noting the relative popularity of human-generated content versus AI-generated content. Sora is down to 59 in the App Store, and I count double-digit human-denominated social apps that rank above it. Yes, I get the argument that this is the worst that AI will ever be, but it also will never be human, which is what humans want most of all.\n\nThis gets at what I found the most frustrating about Patel and Trammell’s point of view: the core assumption undergirding their argument was also about the human condition; it just happened to be negative.\n\nLouis C.K., in an October 2008 appearance on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, delivered one of the most incisive and eternal observations about human nature: “Everything is amazing right now and nobody’s happy.”\n\nYou’ve almost certainly seen this clip, but if not, it’s worth watching in full; Louis C.K. focuses on three incredible technological innovations and how quickly we took them for granted: smartphones, Internet access on planes, and the act of flying itself. It’s certainly a sentiment I can relate to: just in the last 72 hours I have chafed at slow airplane WiFi, complained about jet lag from having literally traversed the globe, and gotten frustrated at an iPhone bug that is sapping my battery. It’s all so terrible, until I remember I have access to anything everywhere, can be anywhere anytime, and oh yeah, can achieve both simultaneously.\n\nIf anything, you can make the case that technological innovations, by virtue of conferring their benefits on everybody, has actually had the perverse effect of making everyone feel worse off. When I was a child growing up in small town Wisconsin, I had some sort of vague sense that there were rich people in the world, but from my perspective taking my first airplane flight around the age of ten was a source of great wonder, and even provided a sense of status; after all, many of my friends had never flown at all. That was the comparison set that mattered to me.\n\nSocial media — or, more accurately, user-generated content feeds, which are increasingly not social at all — has completely changed this dynamic. All I or anyone else needs to do is open Instagram to see beautiful people on private jets or on beaches or at fancy restaurants, living a life that seems dramatically better than one’s dull existence in the suburbs or a cramped apartment; never mind that the means of achieving that insight is a level of technological wealth that would have been incomprehensible to the richest person in the world fifty years ago.\n\nTo put it another way, what Louis C.K. identified in this clip was the extent to which human happiness is a relative versus absolute phenomenon: what we care about is not how much we have, but how we compare. That, by extension, is what drives the technological paradox I noted above: more capabilities, more broadly distributed, has tremendously enriched the world on an absolute basis; the end result, however, has been the dramatic expansion of our comparison set, making us feel more immiserated than ever.3\n\nThis, writ large, is what Patel and Trammell seem to be worried about: sure, everyone may have all of their material needs met, but that won’t be good enough if the price of that abundance is the knowledge that someone else has more. This might not be rational, but it certainly is human!\n\nIf you assume that the negative parts of humanity will persist in this world of abundance, however, then you must leave room for the positive parts as well, the ones that I wrote about above. Even if AI does all of the jobs, humans will still want humans, creating an economy for labor precisely because it is labor. You can’t make the case that the potential for jealousy ought to drive authoritarian capital controls while completely dismissing the possibility that the prospect of desirability gives everyone jobs to do, even if we can’t possibly imagine what those jobs might be — beyond podcasting, of course.\n\nIf you want a specific example, consider the rapturous response to Bill Simmons’ 50 Most Rewatchable Movies of the 21st Century episode, which was delightful precisely because it was pure Bill ↩\n\nThis isn’t idle talk: I’m encouraging my daughter to pursue art; granted, I’m also working quite hard to build up a store of capital for her as well! ↩\n\nAs an aside, this is why galaxy exploration would be a positive, not a negative: out of sight out of mind, just like it used to be. ↩",

    "description": "Artificial intelligence won't be training AI anytime soon, says Invisible Technologies CEO.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence won't be training AI anytime soon, says the CEO of a data labeling startup.\n\nOn an episode of the \"20VC\" podcast released last week, Matt Fitzpatrick, the CEO of Invisible Technologies, said that one of the biggest misconceptions in the AI training industry is that humans won't be needed in a few years.\n\n\"When I first started this job, the main push back I always got was that synthetic data will take over and you just will not need human feedback two to three years from now,\" said Fitzpatrick, who joined the startup last year. \"From first principles, that actually doesn't make very much sense.\"\n\nSynthetic data refers to data that is artificially created. It is used for training AI or machine learning models, mostly where real data is scarce or can't be used because of privacy concerns. Human feedback, on the other hand, asks real people to filter, rank, and train AI responses.\n\nOn the podcast, Fitzpatrick said that there are too many kinds of tasks for AI to accomplish in the world, and it would take a long time to do them accurately with language and cultural context in mind. For example, the legal industry contains vast amounts of nonpublic information.\n\n\"On the GenAI side, you are going to need humans in the loop for decades to come,\" he said. \"And I think that is something that most people are starting to realize.\"\n\nFitzpatrick was previously a senior partner at McKinsey, where he led QuantumBlack Labs, the firm's AI research and software development arm.\n\nInvisible, which raised $100 million in September at a $2 billion valuation, competes with data labeling companies such as Scale AI and Surge AI. These startups have raised billions in the past year as tech giants race to secure the data needed to train their AI models. They hire millions of human contractors, who help teach the models math, science, coding, and characteristics such as humor and empathy.\n\nFitzpatrick joins the CEOs of other data labeling startups in saying that the industry will continue to require human effort.\n\nIn September, the CEO of Mercor, Brendan Foody, said that the most important aspect of the business was data quality and \"having phenomenal people that you treat incredibly well.\"\n\nIn July, the CEO of Handshake, a job platform that pivoted into AI training last year, said that humans will still be needed to train AI, but who makes the cut is changing.\n\nGarrett Lord said the data annotation industry is shifting from requiring generalists to highly specialized experts, including in math and science.\n\n\"Now these models have kind of sucked up the entirety of the entire corpus of the internet and every book and video,\" Lord said on a podcast. \"They've gotten good enough where, like, generalists are no longer needed.\"",

    "title": "An NYU professor who hates that students' work reads like McKinsey memos held AI oral exams to 'fight fire with fire'",
    "description": "When student work looked like McKinsey memos, an NYU business school professor used AI oral exams to test real learning.",
    "fullText": "The assignments looked brilliant. The understanding didn't.\n\nThat's when an NYU business school professor decided to fight AI-assisted coursework with AI-powered oral exams.\n\nPanos Ipeirotis, a professor at NYU's Stern School of Business who teaches data science, wrote in a blog post published last week that he became concerned about student assignments that read like \"a McKinsey memo\" but lacked genuine understanding.\n\nWhen he called on students in class and asked them to defend their submissions, many struggled to do so.\n\n\"If you cannot defend your own work live, then the written artifact is not measuring what you think it is measuring,\" Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nTo counter that, he revived oral exams and enlisted an AI agent to administer them at scale, in an attempt to \"fight fire with fire.\"\n\n\"We need assessments that evolve toward formats that reward understanding, decision-making, and real-time reasoning,\" Ipeirotis said.\n\n\"Oral exams used to be standard until they could not scale,\" he added. \"Now, AI is making them scalable again.\"\n\nIn the blog post detailing the experiment, Ipeirotis said he and his colleague built the AI examiner using ElevenLabs' conversational speech technology.\n\n\"Just write a prompt describing what the agent should ask the student, and you are done,\" he said, adding that it took minutes to set up.\n\nThe oral exam had two parts. First, the AI agent questioned students about their capstone projects, probing their decisions and reasoning. Then it selected one of the cases discussed in class and pushed students to think through it live.\n\nOver the course of nine days, the system assessed 36 students. Each session lasted about 25 minutes, with total compute costs coming in at about $15 for all 36 students. A human-run oral exam could cost hundreds of dollars at teaching-assistant rates, Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nIpeirotis also used AI to grade the exams. Three AI models — Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT — independently assessed each transcript. They then reviewed one another's evaluations, revised their scores, and produced a final grade, with Claude acting as the \"chair\" to synthesize the decision.\n\nIpeirotis said the \"council of LLMs\" graded more consistently than humans, and \"more strictly, but more fairly.\"\n\n\"The feedback was better than any human would produce,\" he wrote, adding that the AI analysis also surfaced gaps in how the material had been taught.\n\nHowever, students were divided. Only a small minority preferred the AI oral exams, and many found them more stressful than written tests — even while acknowledging they were a better measure of real understanding.\n\nStill, Ipeirotis said the oral exams demonstrated \"how learning is supposed to work.\"\n\n\"The more you practice, the better you get,\" Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nIpeirotis' blog post comes as universities grapple with how to test students in the AI era.\n\nA paper published in September in the academic journal \"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education\" said AI has turned student assessment into a \"wicked problem.\"\n\nThe study's authors interviewed 20 unit chairs at a large Australian university in late 2024. Through hourlong Zoom interviews, they found instructors to be overwhelmed by heavier workloads, confusion surrounding AI use, and a lack of agreement on what an AI-proof assessment should look like.\n\nSome faculty members told researchers that AI should be treated as a tool for students to master. Others view it as academic dishonesty that erodes learning. Many admitted they were unsure how to proceed.\n\nIn May, LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said on an episode of his podcast, \"Possible,\" that AI can make it easier for students to exploit traditional assessment formats, such as essays. Universities should rethink how they evaluate learning, he said, adding that students could soon expect an \"AI examiner.\"\n\nHoffman said that oral exams leave less room for shortcuts, requiring students to demonstrate real understanding.",

    "title": "Meet Dario Amodei, Anthropic's outspoken CEO",
    "description": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei doesn't seem to mind angering tech CEOs, whether it's with his warnings about AI or pushing export controls.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei doesn't mince words.\n\nHe's rankled some rival tech CEOs by boldly predicting that AI could wipe out half of entry-level, white-collar jobs and that the upheaval could happen between now and the next five years.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, I warn about these things not to be a prophet of doom, but because warning about them is the first step towards solving them,\" Amodei said in December during The New York Times' DealBook Summit.\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Amodei still has a lot to warn about. By his own admission, the longtime AI researcher turned executive has said his vision for the future has led some to dismiss him as a \"doomer,\" even as he thinks AI could unlock a 150-year lifespan.\n\n\"Actual people who are building the technology, they're excited about the potential, but they're also worried,\" he said during the December event. \"They're worried about the national security risks. They're worried about alignment of the models; they're worried about the economic impacts of the models.\"\n\nUnder Amodei's leadership, Anthropic, once the underdog of the AI startups, is poised to remain a major part of the race.\n\nHere's a look at Amodei's life and career so far.\n\nDario Amodei was born in 1983 in San Francisco to Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei. A few years later, his sister Daniela, who would later help him cofound Anthropic in 2021, followed. Engel worked on library renovation and construction projects. Amodei's father was a leatherworker raised in a small town near the Italian island of Elba.\n\nDespite growing up in what became Big Tech's cradle, Amodei said he was much more interested in hard sciences. His sister said Amodei's intelligence was apparent from an early age. She told Bloomberg that her brother would declare \"counting days,\" seeing how high he could go.\n\n\"It'd be like a whole day,\" she said. \"What kind of 3-year-old has that attention span?\"\n\nAfter attending Lowell High School, Amodei studied physics at Caltech before transferring to Stanford to complete his degree. He was pursuing a graduate degree at Princeton when Riccardo Amodei died from a rare illness. His father's death was a seminal moment, tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz wrote. Amodei shifted from studying theoretical physics to biophysics. Amodei told Kantrowitz that the survival rate of his father's illness improved rapidly in just a few years after his death.\n\nIt's a lesson that Anthropic's CEO said remains with him.\n\n\"I get really angry when someone's like, 'This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down,'\" Amodei told Kantrowitz, who writes the Big Techology newsletter. \"You heard what I just said, my father died because of cures that could have happened a few years [earlier]. I understand the benefit of this technology.\"\n\nIn 2011, Amodei obtained a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton. During postdoctoral research at Stanford, Amodei told Kantrowitz that he saw how artificial intelligence could help researchers like him tackle questions in biology that seemed \"beyond human scale.\" In 2014, Andrew Ng, a computer science professor at Stanford and cofounder of Coursera, recruited Amodei to join him at Baidu, a Chinese search engine.\n\nWhile working on speech recognition systems at Baidu, Amodei said he got the inclination of AI scaling, the theory that by increasing everything feeding into AI, the performance improves.\n\n\"I noticed that the models started to do better and better as you gave them more data, as you made the models larger, as you trained them for longer,\" Amodei told podcaster Lex Fridman in 2024. \"And I didn't measure things precisely in those days, but along with colleagues, we very much got the informal sense that the more data and the more compute and the more training you put into these models, the better they perform.\"\n\nElon Musk and Sam Altman, then friends, assembled a group of leading AI thinkers for a dinner at a Menlo Park hotel. Musk, Wired later reported, wanted to know if it was too late for a rival AI lab to rise to challenge Google, planting the seeds for what would become OpenAI.\n\nAmodei, who, according to Kantrowitz, was at the dinner, elected to join Google instead. While at Google, Amodei published well-regarded research laying out potential concerns for AI advancements. But after just 10 months at the tech giant, Amodei left for OpenAI.\n\nAt OpenAI, Amodei played a big role in the development of GPT-2 and 3, the startup's large language models. His experience galvanized his belief in the power of scaling, but it also reinforced he desire to tie AI advacements to safety.\n\n\"You don't tell the models what their values are just by pouring more compute into them,\" Amodei told Fortune in 2023. \"And so there were a set of people who believed in those two ideas.\"\n\nOver time, Amodei said he lost faith that OpenAI's leaders shared his beliefs. In 2020, after rising to become OpenAI's vice president of research, Amodei quit.\n\nThe breakup remains a major point of conversation around Silicon Valley.\n\nDuring the December event, Amodei took multiple perceived swipes at Altman, even as he repeatedly refused to directly name OpenAI's CEO.\n\nAmodei said that Anthropic was cautiously trying to thread the needle between the enormous investment required for data center construction and the risk of overextending itself. In contrast, he said others in AI are \"yoloing and who pull the risk dial too far.\"\n\nThe most clear potential shot at Altman came after Amodei was asked about the OpenAI CEO's decision to declare a \"code red\" to employees amid fears that ChatGPT was losing its edge.\n\n\"We have a little bit of a privileged position where we can just keep growing and just keep developing our models, and we don't have to do any code reds,\" Amodei said.\n\nWith seven other former OpenAI employees, Amodei cofounded Anthropic in 2021. It was a close-knit group. One of the cofounders, Daniela Amodei, is Dario's sister. Some of them had even roomed together, dating back to their time in a shared house when they all worked at OpenAI.\n\nInside Silicon Valley, there were doubts that a new startup could catch up to OpenAI. Just over two years in, Anthropic reached unicorn status.\n\nAmodei told Time Magazine that by the summer of 2022, Anthropic had finished training its chatbot, Claude. However, the company held back from releasing it. OpenAI, Amodei's now-rival, released ChatGPT months later.\n\n\"I suspect it was the right thing to do,\" Amodei told the magazine in 2024, when Time named Anthropic one of its most influential companies and put him on the cover. \"But it's not totally clear-cut.\"\n\nAnthropic launched Claude almost a year after ChatGPT's release. The startup's bot still won praise. Over time, it has built up a devoted following, particularly for its coding ability.\n\nUnlike OpenAI, Anthropic is largely devoted to businesses and not consumer AI. In May, Reuters reported that Anthropic is making $3 billion in annualized revenue, a significant jump.\n\nIn 2025, Amodei, his sister Daniela, and the rest of the cofounders were all minted billionaires based on the company's valuation. Forbes estimates that Amodei is worth roughly $3.7 billion, as of mid-December.\n\nAmodei said that Anthropic's focus on enterprise clients has created a \"durable\" revenue stream with \"better margins\" than competitors who are more focused on consumer products.\n\n\"We're trying to manage that risk well while also buying an amount of compute that allows us to be competitive with the other players,\" he said during the December event. \"We're very efficient in training, we're very efficient in inference. We have good margins. I think we can manage it. I think the odds are on our side.\"\n\nIn November, Anthropic announced it would spend $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute, a deal that also positioned it as the first model to be available on the three largest clouds. As part of the agreement, Anthropic is set to receive up to $5 billion from Microsoft and up to $10 billion from Nvidia.\n\nAmodei later said that partnering with Nvidia hasn't changed his view that its CEO Jensen Huang is mistaken in his view that US companies should sell advanced chips to China.\n\n\"This isn't personal, this is a policy question,\" Amodei said. \"This is a question of how best to defend our national security.\"\n\nOther views have also put Amodei up against his competitors and even the White House. In October, AI czar David Sacks, accused Anthropic of \"running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.\" Amodei said that Sacks' claims were \"inaccurate.\"\n\nNotably, Amodei has not changed his opposition to a White House-favored federal preemption of state-level AI laws. Some Republicans in Congress have attempted to pass a 10-year moratorium into law, although the policy has split even within their own party.\n\n\"It's like saying, I'm driving a car, I'm going to rip out the steering wheel because I don't need to steer for 10 years,\" Amodei said in December.",

    "description": "An AI startup founder successfully pitched Mark Cuban via email. Here's what the entrepreneur wrote to the billionaire before he decided to invest.",
    "fullText": "Startup founder Adam Joseph has never appeared on \"Shark Tank,\" but he knows how it feels to be on the hot seat in front of Mark Cuban.\n\nJoseph managed to get Cuban's attention and an investment in his AI-powered PR agency, Clipbook, through a series of emails.\n\nThe seven-figure investment that Joseph secured started 12 months ago with cold outreach to a few famous investors, including Cuban, who has said he spends his days reading and responding to emails.\n\nJoseph shared highlights from his email exchange with Cuban exclusively with Business Insider. These emails show how Cuban responds to startup founders, assesses business pitches, and decides to invest over email, as the billionaire has said he's done many times.\n\n\"I wanted to put a potential seed opportunity that I think might be a strong mutual fit,\" Joseph wrote in his initial message to Cuban.\n\nThe Clipbook founder then provided a bullet-point summary of his startup, which uses AI to track how people and companies are being discussed online, like a more sophisticated version of Google Alerts. Joseph worked in PR for a few years and said he felt the \"pain points\" of keeping tabs on public sentiment, which he thought AI could help solve. When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, Joseph said it became \"immediately obvious\" that AI could transform PR.\n\nCuban didn't respond to Joseph's pitch right away. The next day, the entrepreneur followed up, adding that he's backed by Dan Pfeiffer, co-host of the popular politics show \"Pod Save America.\"\n\nThat same day, Cuban responded. He requested a sample report for his own name to demonstrate the tech in action. He also asked how Clipbook differed from Google Alerts and wanted to know what the founder was seeking from him — and under what terms. From there, Joseph and Cuban traded a few more emails and hopped on a call. Soon after, they reached a deal, Joseph said.\n\n\"It moved more aggressively and faster with Mark than I expected,\" Joseph later said in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nJoseph said Cuban vetted him, not just the business.\n\n\"He was just really doing a 360, just pressure-testing the business,\" Joseph said. \"But I think more importantly, probably, pressure-testing me as an entrepreneur. So the fact that he had come in pretty hot with some pretty aggressive questions I think was also really — it was really, actually, in retrospect, a really positive signal that he was very interested in the deal.\"\n\nBelow are email exchanges between Joseph and Cuban, which Joseph shared with Business Insider. Cuban gave Business Insider permission to publish their content. The original text and formatting have been preserved, with small modifications for clarity. Certain sensitive information, like email addresses and Clipbook's revenue, has been redacted.",
