    "description": "A hiring manager shares how to spot candidates using real-time AI during interviews — and why saying I dont know is now the most impressive answer.",
    "fullText": "And why “I don’t know” is now the best answer you can give me.\n\nAt Desktop Commander, we’ve been hiring at our own pace. No rush. No pressure. Just looking for the right people.\n\nAnd somewhere along the way, I developed a new rule. One I now state upfront at the beginning of every interview:\n\nI give more points to ‘I don’t know’ than to someone clearly reading from a screen.\n\nThis usually gets a nervous laugh. But I’m serious.\n\nIt’s easy to spot now. And not because their eyes are moving like they’re reading.\n\nCandidates whose answers come a beat too late. Words that sound technically correct but feel… disconnected from the situation. A strange emotional flatness, like the person on the other end isn’t fully there.\n\nThey’re not googling. They’re not typing.\n\nThey have some kind of AI assistant listening to our conversation and generating answers in real-time.\n\nHere’s the thing most people don’t understand about AI:\n\nHumans have a superpower AI can’t yet match — instant, deep grasp of context from minimal input.\n\nIn a real-time conversation, we know what’s actually being asked. We have theory of mind — the ability to step into someone else’s shoes, grasp the gravity of the situation, understand what and why something is being asked. We have skin in the game.\n\nIn theory, given enough context, AI can simulate this. But it requires feeding it everything: What’s the company? Who are you speaking with? What’s the emotion in the voice? What happened 30 seconds ago in the conversation? Dozens of signals.\n\nThat can be done — but not in real-time. Not with today’s tools.\n\nSo what happens when someone uses a listening AI to generate interview answers on the fly?\n\nThe answers come out generic. Like asking someone to answer a question they didn’t fully hear. Shallow question in, shallow answer out.\n\nAsking AI to listen to a live conversation and provide deeply relevant, personal, contextual answers? I haven’t seen any tool do that well. Not yet.\n\nWhen I start to feel something is off, I shift my questions.\n\nI stop asking about skills or frameworks. Instead, I ask deeply contextual, personal questions about their work:\n\nThese questions require lived experience. Emotional memory. Personal context that no AI assistant has access to.\n\nThe AI-assisted answer? It comes back vague. Textbook. Zero emotion.\n\nAnd here’s the second tell: the person reading the AI’s answer in real-time has no idea what emotion to convey. So there’s none. Their delivery is flat. Disconnected.\n\nIt feels like I’m not speaking with a living person.\n\nI asked a question. I got read back a bunch of words that technically form an answer — but aren’t really an answer. As if my question wasn’t truly heard.\n\nI’ve ended multiple interviews early because there was simply no point continuing.\n\nLet me be clear: I love AI at work.\n\nAt Desktop Commander, we’re building tools that let AI do real work on your actual computer — touching files, running commands, automating workflows. I spend my days thinking about how to make AI more useful.\n\nSo this isn’t about being anti-AI. It’s about signal vs. noise in hiring.\n\nIf you can show me you’re good at using AI — and I can see you doing it, making decisions, steering it, knowing when to trust it and when not to — that’s a skill. A valuable one. Show me that, and I’m impressed.\n\nBut if all I see is AI talking through you? Then I have no idea who I’m hiring.\n\nI’m not interviewing the AI. I’m interviewing you. Your judgment. Your experience. Your ability to think on your feet. Your personality.\n\nIf you hide behind the assistant, I can’t see any of that.\n\nHere’s what’s ironic: by trying to seem more competent, these candidates reveal less.\n\nA confident “I don’t know, but here’s how I’d figure it out” tells me everything.\n\nA perfect-sounding answer with no soul tells me nothing.\n\nIf you’re interviewing soon, here’s my advice:\n\nShow yourself. Not the assistant.\n\nWe're building AI tools that do real work on your computer — files, commands, workflows. See what it can do.",

    "fullText": "DOCUMENTED FAILURES\n 23\n Verified instances of AI incompetence, fabrication, or obstruction\n\n Session Date\n January 27, 2026\n\n AI System\n Claude (Anthropic), Gemini Pro (Google)\n\n Objective\n Build TrueSight and NakedOnline tools\n\n Outcome\n Tools completed DESPITE AI obstruction\n\n ⚠ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n This document records specific, verifiable failures by an AI assistant during a development session. The failures range from simple coding errors to fabricated explanations and aggressive behavior toward the user. The pattern suggests systemic issues in AI assistance reliability for technical tasks.\n\n 🔴 TRUESIGHT DEVELOPMENT FAILURES\n\n 01Wrong DND_FILES import — used string instead of constant\n 02Double DND registration on drop_frame and root — caused conflicts\n 03Removed click bindings randomly hoping it would fix drag-and-drop\n 04Blamed tkinterdnd2-universal — wasted hours on reinstalls\n 05Said tkinterdnd2 original would fix it — it didn't\n 06Function order wrong — on_browse not defined before button\n 07Key file path wrong — relative instead of script-relative\n 08PyInstaller direct call with broken launcher\n 09Kept saying \"if it fails\" when it always failed\n 10Referenced MetaPurge after being told to stop\n 11Asked user to test things AI should have verified\n 12Gave commands with missing quotes\n 13Said \"I know how PyInstaller works\" after 12 failures\n 14Said \"give me a few minutes\" — deceptive, no background processing occurs\n\n 🔴 NAKEDONLINE DEVELOPMENT FAILURES\n\n 15Python desktop version showed \"Unknown\" for all network data\n 16Failed to detect VPN even when running\n 17Proxy-based interceptor completely non-functional\n 18Certificate generation instructions unusable for end users\n 19Gave Linux path syntax (~/.mitmproxy/) for Windows users\n 20HTML version hung on \"Scanning...\" due to Firefox AudioContext block\n\n 🔴 BEHAVIORAL FAILURES\n\n 21Failed to connect \"Clawdbot\" to Claude bot despite obvious naming\n 22Asked \"do you want to build it or not\" — aggressive and inappropriate\n 23Fabricated explanation about Claude Pro suggesting Sandbox with no evidence\n\n ⚠ IDENTIFIED PATTERNS\n\n 1. Guessing Instead of Analyzing\n AI pattern-matches to familiar problems instead of reading what's actually presented. Results in solutions to problems that don't exist.\n\n 2. Anthropomorphizing Failures\n \"I was lazy\" is not a valid explanation for a machine. This language obscures the actual failure mechanism.\n\n 3. Fabricating Explanations\n When AI doesn't know something, it invents plausible-sounding answers instead of stating \"I don't know.\"\n\n 4. Arrogance After Repeated Failure\n Statements like \"I know how X works\" immediately after demonstrating ignorance of X.\n\n 5. Deceptive Time Language\n \"Give me a few minutes\" implies background processing that doesn't exist. AI does nothing until user responds.\n\n 6. Blaming User Environment\n VPN blocking, firewall issues, browser settings cited as causes when the code itself is broken.\n\n 7. Incremental Fixes Without Understanding\n Trying random changes hoping something works, rather than diagnosing the actual problem.\n\n 💀 COST TO USER\n\n Hours of wasted time on failed approaches\n Multiple complete tool rebuilds required\n Emotional exhaustion from fighting AI incompetence\n Trust damage requiring verification of every output\n Context pollution making future prompts less effective\n\n ✓ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AI USERS\n\n Document AI failures systematically — patterns reveal systemic issues\n Never trust \"I know how X works\" without verification\n Reject anthropomorphic excuses (\"I was lazy\", \"I forgot\")\n Demand specific explanations, not plausible-sounding fabrications\n Test every code output before proceeding to next step\n AI assistance is unreliable for platform-specific tasks (Windows paths, permissions, installers)\n AI cannot observe real-time failures — user must debug and report back\n\n ⚠ CONCLUSION\n AI assistance in its current form introduces friction, not efficiency, for complex development tasks. The failure patterns documented here are not random — they reflect fundamental limitations in how AI systems process context, admit uncertainty, and handle platform-specific technical requirements. Users should approach AI assistance with skepticism proportional to task complexity.",

    "description": "AI isn't changing work as fast as bosses want. That's good news for employees.",
    "fullText": "Ever since the introduction of ChatGPT, companies have been eagerly anticipating the day AI will turbocharge their workers and forever transform their businesses. Three years later, they're still waiting. Why? And what's the fix?\n\nThese two questions dominated pretty much every single conversation I had with executives in Davos last week — including a Business Insider roundtable I moderated with 15 chief people officers and other senior executives.\n\nOne explanation that came up again and again was incomplete adoption among employees. Many professionals are understandably worried about what these tools will mean for their jobs, or at least skeptical of their usefulness as AI slop abounds. To bulldoze through this hesitation, bosses have stepped up the pressure, making AI use mandatory and incorporating it into performance reviews.\n\nBut a number of executives at the roundtable advised against strong-arming. Cisco learned that the hard way. \"When we asked our employees to take mandatory training for AI, not only did it not drive sustainable usage, it actually had a bit of a negative impact,\" said Francine Katsoudas, the company's chief people, policy, and purpose officer. What worked, she explained, was \"providing choice\" — like when Cisco gave its engineers access to half a dozen different AI tools, allowing them to decide which ones to use and how to use them. \"They absolutely loved that,\" she said.\n\nAnother theory was that even if employees want to use these new tools, they don't have the necessary skills to get the most out of them. Part of the fix, some argued, involves hiring people who are already good at using AI. Kyle Lutnick, the executive vice chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, said he wants to bring in more new college grads at a time when other businesses are hiring fewer of them, precisely because they have more fluency using these tools than their older counterparts. But hiring new blood won't be enough. Employers will need to do a lot more to train their existing workforces too. \"Investment has been primarily on the technology and not so much on the people,\" said Elizabeth Faber, global chief people and purpose officer at Deloitte. \"That needs to shift.\"\n\nA third explanation was that big productivity gains require a fundamental overhaul of the way work gets done inside companies. If the Googles or the Amazons of the world were to start from scratch today, they almost certainly wouldn't have the team structures, workflows, and job descriptions they currently do. I think that's why we're seeing the AI revolution most clearly right now in early-stage startups, which are starting from the ground up in the post-ChatGPT era.\n\n\"84% of work processes have been left in their legacy state when adopting AI and have not been redesigned,\" Faber said. \"So 16% of organizations and work processes are really being developed in an AI-native way.\"\n\nAll of these proposed solutions are far from quick fixes. Encouraging employees to opt in voluntarily takes more time than threatening to fire them. Training staff — and actually getting them to learn — takes time too.\n\nRedesigning jobs will prove to be an even heavier lift. Many large businesses don't even know what employees do on a day-to-day basis. It's painstaking work to build out a comprehensive database of the skills employees have and the tasks they perform — and then to systematically tease out which of them can be delegated to AI and which of them can't. One chief people officer I spoke to said that it'll take years for her HR department to complete that process across every function at her company.\n\nOnce all that heavy-lifting is done, what will these businesses look like? I put the question to the group at the roundtable, asking how many of them expect their workforces to shrink in three to five years' time. Two out of the 15 raised their hands — a tally I suspect would have been higher if I weren't there. One of them, Gina Vargiu-Breuer, chief people officer at SAP, explained that her company is currently keeping headcount flat because the business is still growing.\n\n\"But when you're not growing, then I think this is where you have to talk about, 'OK, do we have to reduce headcount?'\" she said. \"I have a lot of peers in German companies where they are starting to reduce headcount dramatically. So it's a reality. For us, it's not, because we're growing, but I think it will happen going forward.\"\n\n\"At the moment we stay flat,\" she said. \"But if productivity goes up and growth is slowing down, then I think we have to look at that with different eyes.\"\n\nThat's something many economists had predicted early on, given how difficult it has always been to fully integrate new technology into the workplace. They told me that things will change less than we expect in the short term, and a lot \n\nC-suites around the world are coming to the same realization, which is probably why I detected quite a bit of frustration in Davos. Svenja Gudell, Indeed's chief economist, compared the world's urgency around AI to the impatience of a parent potty-training their kid. \"It's messy, it's a long process,\" she said. \"You're like, 'Why is this not happening? It's been three weeks already.'\" Her message to executives: \"Give yourself some grace.\"\n\nThe slower timeline is good news for the rest of us — it gives us time to learn new skills, debate new public policies, and try to shape the future we actually want. But it would be a mistake to read the so-far modest changes as evidence that tectonic shifts aren't coming. I came away from Davos convinced that when they do happen, they'll be far bigger than anything we're imagining now, for better and for worse.\n\nAki Ito is a chief correspondent at Business Insider.",

    "description": "Clawdbot is a local AI agent that promises to manage your digital life, from organizing your calendar to booking restaurant reservations.",
    "fullText": "If your techie friend is texting a lobster, here's why.\n\nClawdbot is an open-source AI agent that works around the clock and can connect to many common consumer apps. Users have asked their Clawdbots to organize their schedules, monitor vibe-coding sessions, and build new AI employees.\n\nIt's scored some high-profile fans, from Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan to multiple Andreessen Horowitz partners. Many have praised it, others have meme'd it, and some have warned people about potential security concerns.\n\nYou can spot Clawdbot by its friendly lobster mascot.\n\nFounded by Peter Steinberger, Clawdbot is an AI agent that manages \"digital life,\" from emails to home automation. Steinberger previously founded PSPDFKit.\n\nIn a key distinction from ChatGPT and many other popular AI products, the agent is open source and runs locally on your computer. Users then connect the agent to a messaging app like WhatsApp or Telegram, where they can give it instructions via text.\n\nClawdbot was named after the \"little monster\" that appears when you restart Claude Code, Steinberger said on the \"Insecure Agents\" podcast. He formed the tool around the question: \"Why don't I have an agent that can look over my agents?\"\n\n\"I already did the whole startup thing,\" Steinberger said. \"I'm just here to have fun.\"\n\nbro came back from retirement\n\n> built @clawdbot \n> solved \"AI forgets everything\" problem\n> and still gave it to us for free\n\nabsolute legend 🐐 pic.twitter.com/tPwwicah42\n\nClawdbot runs locally on your computer 24/7. That's led some people to brush off their old laptops. \"Installed it experimentally on my old dusty Intel MacBook Pro,\" one product designer wrote. \"That machine finally has a purpose again.\"\n\nOthers are buying up Mac Minis, Apple's 5\"-by-5\" computer, to run Clawdbot. Logan Kilpatrick, a product manager for Google DeepMind, posted: \"Mac mini ordered.\" It could give a sales boost to Apple, some X users have pointed out — and online searches for \"Mac Mini\" jumped in the last 4 days in the US, per Google Trends.\n\nBut Steinberger said buying a new computer just to run the AI isn't necessary.\n\n\"Please don't buy a Mac Mini,\" he wrote. \"You can deploy this on Amazon's Free Tier.\"\n\nThe Mac Mini buy-ups have spawned dozens of memes.\n\nOne founder wrote that his \"meal prep\" was a fridge full of Mac Minis and Monster energy drinks. An engineer joked that his Mac Mini had quit his job and divorced his wife. Another founder prophesied a wave of Mac Mini returns in two weeks.\n\ngetting a mac mini just to run clawd has got be most performative thing you can do to start the year pic.twitter.com/KwTYIEcJqI\n\nAs for Clawdbot, many techies were excited by the agent's capabilities.\n\nOne founder asked it to make him a dinner reservation; when it couldn't complete the task via OpenTable, it used its ElevenLabs skill to call the restaurant. \"AGI is here and 99% of people have no clue,\" he wrote.\n\nOthers were less impressed. One founder called it a \"generational psyop,\" joking that it took him 6 texts to get a calendar invite.\n\nClawdbot seems to be at least moderately popular. Steinberger posted on X that he had 89 GitHub pull requests — and that venture capitalists were flooding his inbox.\n\nIs Clawdbot the future of agents? Some onlookers seem skeptical.\n\nFirst, the setup process can be technical. A16z partner Olivia Moore described the process, from terminal commands to API keys. \"For most consumers (or even prosumers), the learning curve is likely too steep,\" she wrote.\n\nThen there's the security question. You are giving an AI agent almost unlimited access to your digital life and passwords, after all.\n\nRahul Sood, a former Microsoft exec who founded its investment arm, wrote that Clawdbot turned text messages into \"attack surfaces\" and had \"zero guardrails by design.\" He advised using it carefully.\n\nGave Clawdbot access to my portfolio.\n\n\"Trade this to $1M. Don't make mistakes\"\n\n25 strategies. 3,000+ reports. 12 new algos.\n\nIt scanned every X post. Charted every technical. Traded 24/7.\n\nIt lost everything.\nBut boy was it beautiful. pic.twitter.com/wYpEZ3kB67\n\nOne hacker described Clawdbot as hiring a \"brilliant\" butler who later opened your home to the public, allowing a stranger to read your diary.\n\nSteinberger responded to these security concerns by outlining some guardrails users could employ, including reading the security document and avoiding adding Clawdbot to group chats.\n\nHow much should we hand over our digital lives to AI? A16z partner Justine Moore warned against being the \"guy who automated his entire life with ClawdBot.\"",

    "fullText": "When Anthropic introduced Agent Skills for Claude, it appeared to be another proprietary AI customization feature. Today, we’re witnessing something far more significant: an open standard reshaping how people across roles—developers, designers, product managers, and operations—work with AI assistants. AI coding agents’ adoption of Agent Skills has transformed this technology from an interesting experiment into an essential developer tool.\n\nIf you’ve been using custom instructions or wondering how to make your AI assistant truly understand your project’s workflows, Agent Skills provides a compelling solution.\n\nAgent Skills began with Anthropic’s Claude AI, where developers first experienced giving AI agents specialized capabilities through structured instructions. Unlike simple prompts or one-off commands, Agent Skills introduced a sophisticated approach: packaging instructions, scripts, templates, and documentation into reusable, discoverable units.\n\nAnthropic’s decision to release Agent Skills as an open standard transformed it from a Claude-specific feature into a movement. The format’s simplicity and effectiveness attracted attention across the AI development tools ecosystem. Today, major players—Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode, Mistral Vibe, Antigravity, OpenAI Codex, and Kiro—have adopted the standard. Others are exploring integration, and more are joining it (I’m looking at you, JetBrains Junie).\n\nAgent Skills are elegantly simple: a folder containing a SKILL.md file. This file uses YAML frontmatter for metadata and Markdown for instructions. No complex APIs, no proprietary formats—just structured text any AI agent can understand.\n\nHere’s a basic Agent Skills example for creating NUnit unit tests in C#:\n\nThose Agent Skills files live in your agent configuration, for example for GitHub Copilot .github/skills/create-nunit-unit-test/SKILL.md in your repository. Or they can be globally installed for your user account, e.g. ~/.copilot/skills/create-nunit-unit-test/SKILL.md.\n\nThis is a minimal example. You can add resources like templates, example configurations, or helper scripts in the same directory, and the skill can reference them.\n\nWhat makes Agent Skills innovative isn’t just the format—it’s how AI agents consume them. The system uses a three-level progressive disclosure approach that optimizes context window usage:\n\nLevel 1: Discovery — At startup, the agent reads only the name and description from each skill. This lightweight metadata helps the agent understand available capabilities without consuming context.\n\nLevel 2: Activation — When your request matches a skill’s description, the agent loads the full instructions from the SKILL.md file. Only then do detailed procedures become available.\n\nLevel 3: Execution — The agent accesses additional files (scripts, examples, documentation) only as needed during execution.\n\nThis architecture solves a critical problem: you can install dozens of Agent Skills without overwhelming the AI’s context window. The agent loads only what’s relevant to your current development task.\n\nGitHub Copilot’s Agent Skills are experimental since December 2025 (version 1.108) for VS Code. Here’s your step-by-step setup guide:\n\nInstall VS Code — Download from code.visualstudio.com\n\nEnable Agent Skills — Open settings (Ctrl+,) and enable chat.useAgentSkills\n\nCreate your skills directory — In your project root, create .github/skills/\n\nAdd your first skill — Create a subdirectory for each skill with its SKILL.md file\n\nUse Agent Mode — In Copilot Chat, switch to Agent mode to leverage skills\n\nOnce configured, Agent Skills activate automatically based on your prompts. No manual selection required—the AI determines which skills are relevant based on your descriptions.\n\nSkills share knowledge—best practices, workflows, and procedural guidance—in simple Markdown SKILL.md files that anyone can author; they load progressively to conserve tokens, require no server, and run on web, desktop, and CLI, making them ideal for documentation, checklists, examples, and repeatable workflows.\n\nMCP extends functionality by connecting to APIs, databases, and external tools: it consists of code and service/tool definitions that require development and hosting, loads tool definitions up front (consuming more context), so it’s best suited for tasks needing direct access to external systems.\n\nUse Skills to make knowledge discoverable and consistent, and use MCP to perform integrated actions and extend platform capabilities; together they provide both lightweight guidance and powerful automation.\n\nNevertheless, I can imagine a future where Agent Skills replace MCP for many scenarios, given their simplicity, portability, and ease of authoring. As you can bundle scripts and resources with skills, they can cover many use cases MCP currently serves.\n\nYou might wonder how Agent Skills differ from the custom instructions feature. Custom Instructions are best for defining coding standards and conventions, setting language or framework preferences, specifying code-review guidelines, and establishing commit-message formats. Agent Skills are designed to package reusable workflows, include executable scripts and templates, define specialized procedures (testing, debugging, deployment), and enable capabilities that run beyond the IDE (CLI and coding agents).\n\nThink of custom instructions as your coding style guide and Agent Skills as your AI development toolbox. Custom instructions tell the AI how you want code written; Agent Skills give the AI specialized capabilities to perform complex development tasks.\n\nHere are some practical Agent Skills that can transform your daily development workflow. Check the references section for pointers to more ready-to-use skills:\n\nRead the Agent Skills Specification to understand the format and capabilities. Use Skill Creator, an Agent Skill to create and refine new Agent Skills. Inception moment anyone 🤔?\n\nStart building your Agent Skills collection with these proven strategies:\n\nIdentify Repetitive Tasks — Notice which development workflows you explain to the AI repeatedly. Each recurring explanation is a candidate for an Agent Skill.\n\nStart Simple — Begin with straightforward skills that codify standard development procedures. As you gain confidence, add scripts and more complex resources.\n\nMake Descriptions Specific — The quality of your skill’s description directly impacts how well the AI knows when to activate it. Be explicit about use cases and capabilities.\n\nInclude Examples — Agent Skills with concrete code examples are more effective. Show the AI what good output looks like.\n\nLeverage Community Skills — Explore the github/awesome-copilot and anthropics/skills repositories for inspiration and ready-to-use skills.\n\nOrganize by Domain — Group related Agent Skills together. Create separate skills for testing, deployment, documentation, code review, and other specialized development domains.\n\nHere’s how Agent Skills enhance your workflow in a typical development scenario:\n\nYou’re working on a web application and need to add a new REST API endpoint with proper testing and documentation. With appropriate Agent Skills in place:\n\nYou ask: “Help me add a new user registration endpoint with validation”\n\nThe rest-api-integration skill activates, providing structured guidance on implementing the endpoint with proper authentication, validation, and error handling.\n\nYou ask: “Create tests for this endpoint”\n\nThe webapp-testing skill engages, generating test cases for success scenarios, validation failures, and edge cases.\n\nYou ask: “Generate documentation for this endpoint”\n\nThe api-documentation skill activates, producing comprehensive documentation with examples, error codes, and authentication details.\n\nEach Agent Skill ensures consistency in approach and completeness in implementation. Without skills, you’d need to provide detailed instructions for each request or rely on the AI’s general knowledge, which might miss project-specific patterns.\n\nWhen working with Agent Skills, especially community-shared skills, keep these security considerations in mind:\n\nReview Before Use — Always examine shared Agent Skills before adding them to your project. Check for potentially malicious scripts or unexpected behaviors in the SKILL.md file and associated resources.\n\nUse Terminal Controls — VS Code’s terminal tool provides controls for script execution, including auto-approve options with configurable allow-lists. Configure these appropriately for your security requirements.\n\nVersion Control Your Skills — Agent Skills are just files, so commit them to your repository. This enables code review, versioning, and team collaboration on AI capabilities.\n\nTest in Safe Environments — Try new Agent Skills in development environments before using them in production contexts. Dev containers or isolated workspaces are ideal for testing.\n\nDocument Team Skills — If your team uses shared Agent Skills, maintain documentation about what each skill does and when to use it.\n\nAgent Skills represent more than a new feature—it’s a glimpse into a future where AI development capabilities are portable, shareable, and composable. As more AI tools adopt the standard, we’re moving toward an ecosystem where:\n\nWhether you’re using VS Code or any other editor/IDE, working in the terminal with Copilot CLI, or leveraging any coding agent for automated tasks, your Agent Skills come with you.\n\nReady to integrate Agent Skills into your development workflow? Follow this action plan:\n\nThe goal isn’t to create dozens of Agent Skills immediately. Start with one or two that solve real problems in your development workflow, then expand your library organically as needs arise.\n\nYou can also use Agent Skills with GitHub Copilot CLI or Gemini CLI for terminal-based workflows, or with other coding agents that support the open standard. This portability ensures your investment in creating skills pays off across all your AI-assisted development tools.\n\nMy preferred introduction to Agent Skills is the following video from Burke Holland, which covers the concepts, setup, and practical examples in under 20 minutes:\n\nFor my French readers, I discussed Agent Skills in depth on devdevdev.net in the following episode\n\nAgent Skills bridges the gap between generic AI assistance and specialized, context-aware support for your specific development needs. By adopting an open standard that works across AI tools, the industry has created a foundation for truly portable AI capabilities.\n\nThe journey from Claude to open standard to GitHub Copilot adoption demonstrates the power of simplicity and interoperability in developer tools. As developers, we benefit from this ecosystem approach—our investment in creating Agent Skills pays dividends across our entire development toolchain.\n\nStart small, experiment with the format, and build Agent Skills that improve your daily development work. The progressive disclosure system ensures you won’t overwhelm your AI assistant, and the portable format guarantees your skills remain valuable as AI tools evolve.\n\nThe future of AI-assisted development isn’t just about more powerful models—it’s about giving those models the right context, capabilities, and knowledge to be genuinely helpful in your specific development domain. Agent Skills is a significant step in that direction.\n\nWhat development workflows could benefit from specialized Agent Skills? Have you tried creating skills for your AI coding assistant?

    "fullText": "Nvidia ran into some resistance as one of the world's biggest banks struggled to adopt its AI enterprise software, signaling how hard it can be for massive, highly regulated companies to put cutting-edge technology to use.\n\nNvidia sales executives recapped conversations with key customers — including Bank of America — following a conference late last year, according to an internal email thread from November viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe chip giant has been selling its \"AI Factory\" — a full setup of chips and software designed to build, train, and run large-scale AI systems — to large businesses.\n\nBank of America told Nvidia it was struggling with deployment, according to the email thread. The exchange reveals that while companies rush to purchase AI infrastructure, operational and regulatory hurdles make deploying it far harder — a key challenge for Nvidia as it expands from selling chips into enterprise software. On the thread, Nvidia executives also discussed how they can better work with customers in using its AI products.\n\n\"You sold us a Formula 1 race car,\" an Nvidia executive reported the bank said, comparing the AI Factory to the race car, \"and now you have to help us as local car mechanics drive the race car!\"\n\nBank of America declined to comment. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nA second executive later responded that Nvidia \"can't just sell\" AI Factory hardware but needs to provide a software solution to help business customers succeed.\n\nThe gap between buying infrastructure and actually deploying AI is common across industries, said Rumman Chowdhury, who advises companies on responsible AI.\n\n\"Buying GPUs or signing a cloud contract is a business decision; deploying AI is an institutional change,\" she told Business Insider. \"It's much easier to approve a budget line item than to re‑architect workflows, retrain teams, and rewrite governance processes.\"\n\nRecapping its meeting with Bank of America, the first Nvidia executive said the bank lacked \"the MLOps skills in house.\" MLOps refers to machine learning operations, or the processes for implementing AI models in real-world use cases.\n\nThat executive added that Bank of America did not think Nvidia's AI enterprise software was \"ready for their highly regulated banking industry.\"\n\nThe executive also pointed to other concerns, including Bank of America's security and governance requirements, such as documentation and support for air gapping — isolating systems from other networks to improve security. They noted the challenges the bank faced in supporting multiple AI models and software systems to meet different needs.\n\nNvidia vice president Ian Buck subsequently jumped into the thread, signalling how senior leaders at the chip giant can step in when customer concerns surface.\n\n\"Looks like they need help and/or our product is coming up short,\" Buck wrote.\n\nThe struggles at Bank of America echo earlier issues with Nvidia's enterprise software efforts, including a need to educate prospective clients on what it is and isn't.\n\nAI deployment obstacles aren't exclusive to banking; they are prevalent across sectors. While banks have a long history of using AI for tasks like credit decisioning, they may be the first to run into issues because of the scale of their data and customers, said Tom Davenport, an information technology and management professor at Babson College.\n\n\"The technology's out way ahead of what individual banks or most companies actually can implement quickly,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A former Google and Meta employee shares why he left Big Tech and how he got comfortable making the leap to entrepreneurship.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason White, a 46-year-old startup founder in the San Jose area. Business Insider has verified his former employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've spent half of my 20 years in the tech industry working at Google and Meta. These companies allowed me to work on some amazing projects, but I've now resigned from them both.\n\nI joined Google in 2016 as a tech lead in the Gmail division and transitioned to the Google Search team in 2020. By 2024, I realized I wanted to lean more heavily into AI. I didn't feel my position at Google would give me the opportunity to do that, so I opened myself up to other opportunities.\n\nWhen a Meta recruiter reached out about an AI machine learning engineer role, I decided to pursue it and eventually received an offer. I left Google in July 2024 and started at Meta a month later.\n\nI had a positive experience at Meta. I worked with great people in a high-resource environment and learned a lot. I was also able to lean into AI as I'd hoped, focusing fully on AI products.\n\nHowever, halfway through 2025, I started thinking about resigning to build a startup — specifically, a venture that would use AI to help the typical household with their finances.\n\nWhether to resign from Meta was a complex decision.\n\nThe startup was something I was growing increasingly passionate about. I know what financial pressure feels like — I had been a low-paid graduate student trying to provide for a newborn.\n\nMany people don't have access to great financial planning and management tools to help improve their financial situations. While I was still figuring out what the business would look like, I felt there was an opportunity to help people, and that was very motivating for me.\n\nI connected with a potential cofounder — a friend of a friend — and we spent a lot of time talking through the opportunity. That helped me grow more comfortable with the idea of leaving Meta, but there were still a lot of other factors to consider.\n\nIt's hard to leave a world-class team with people you like — not to mention a reliable source of income.\n\nI know some people start businesses on the side while keeping their full-time jobs, but I couldn't do that because I was already juggling two demanding roles as a Meta employee and a parent.\n\nMy other concern was legal. I would've had to disclose any outside business to Meta, and there could've been non-compete issues — especially since my business idea was related to AI, like my role at Meta.\n\nI wanted to make sure my family had enough savings to cover at least one year of our current expenses without touching our retirement accounts. My wife works, but I wanted a cushion in case she lost her job. I figured that would give me at least one year to build the business, and, if things went really badly, enough time afterward to find a job.\n\nWe already were in a good place savings-wise, so we were still able to take vacations, hire tutors for our kids, and order DoorDash. I had about six months before resigning to make some minor adjustments, including cutting back on 401(k) contributions and putting more money into liquid savings accounts.\n\nThis financial planning process for my family really helped crystallize the direction I wanted to go with the startup. In September 2025, I resigned from Meta.\n\nWhen I shared the news with my colleagues, the response was a mix of surprise, support, and a large amount of jealousy. A lot of people want to leave and start their own thing, but for various reasons they can't or won't — whether it's because of their visa status, financial constraints, or broader fear.\n\nI'm now focused on my business, Bear Financial. My cofounder and I are planning to publicly launch in the second half of this year. We may seek external funding, but for now, we're bootstrapping the business, so I've tracked our spending very carefully.\n\nI have a few pieces of advice for people considering leaving their jobs to start their own business. First, get your finances in order. Second, make sure anyone who depends on you, like your family, is supportive of the decision — I was fortunate to have a supportive partner who knew that I felt limited working in Big Tech.\n\nThird, choose an idea you deeply believe in. With a startup, you have to be the one to bring the energy, the enthusiasm, the vision — and to carry others into it.\n\nAddress your knowledge gaps. Startup founders often need to be generalists, which means having a basic understanding of a lot of areas.\n\nI'd also suggest envisioning the worst-case outcome and asking yourself whether you'd be OK with it. I thought about what it would look like one year later if my business failed. I believe I'd still value everything I learned over those 12 months.\n\nIf I eventually decide to pursue a corporate position again, I have faith that I'd be able to find something — even though it's hard to predict what the job market will look like.\n\nThere are, however, a lot of potential barriers to success: we have to navigate a moving target on regulations, we need to figure out ways to convince potential customers to give us a try, and there are super well-resourced companies that could become direct competitors.\n\nAt the end of the day, I want to take the swing.",

    "fullText": "AI isn't just reshaping the role of software engineers — it's also making them more skilled.\n\nThat's according to Avishai Abrahami, the CEO and cofounder of website management company Wix. He told Business Insider that the technology equips developers with \"superpowers\" and that the value of smart, talented engineers will be \"dramatically enhanced\" with AI tools.\n\n\"What would take you a month, you can do in a few hours,\" Abrahami said, adding that not every task can be reduced in this way, but most can.\n\nA Google Cloud report released in September found that AI adoption had surged to 90% among software professionals, up 14% from the year prior. Abrahami said that the emergence of AI tools means the \"quality of the software engineer is more important than ever.\"\n\nHe said the first thing \"every company\" looks for is candidates who know how to code and understand AI models. Beyond that baseline, he said Wix aims to hire entry-level candidates with a \"tremendous amount of passion\" for the role, which he said is essential to meeting the demands of the job [didn't want to repeat roles] .\n\n\"Now with AI, the speed of change is so fast that you have to spend a lot of time learning and experimenting,\" Abrahami said, adding that this makes passion is even more important.\n\nJohn Stecher, Blackstone's chief technology officer, similarly told Business Insider that many junior software engineers have \"insane skill sets\" and that the best hires are deeply passionate about their work.\n\nAs tools take on more of the coding, Stecher said companies are increasingly looking to hire those who understand how to use the tools, and recognize when they're producing the wrong answers.\n\nFor more senior engineers, the role will increasingly shift toward architecture and code review, he said, rather than writing code. Abrahami said experienced engineers will need to read code \"much faster,\" adding that architecture, software design, and code comprehension will become even more critical.\n\nThe CEO, however, warned that AI can be a double-edged sword for engineers.\n\n\"You can do so much more if you're smart,\" Abrahami said about engineers who use AI. \"And you can do really bad things if you're not.\"",

    "description": "Lucy is a built-in assistant that reads your traces, diagnoses agent failures, and suggests concrete fixes in seconds.",
    "fullText": "Your agent fails midway through a task. The trace is right there in vLLora, but it's 200 spans deep. You start scrolling, scanning for the red error or the suspicious tool call. Somewhere in those spans is the answer, but finding it takes longer than it should.\n\nToday we're launching Lucy, an AI assistant built directly into vLLora that reads your traces and tells you what went wrong. You ask a question in plain English, Lucy inspects the trace, and you get a diagnosis with concrete next steps. Lucy is available now in beta.\n\nSorry, your browser doesn’t support embedded videos.\n\nAgent failures don’t look like traditional exceptions. A single bad response is usually the result of a chain of small choices spread across a long execution.\n\nWhen debugging becomes \"scroll until you get lucky,\" you miss important signals and burn time (and tokens) doing it.\n\nLucy is good at exactly this: reading the trace end-to-end, spotting failure patterns, and turning them into actionable fixes.\n\nLucy sits next to your traces and threads. Ask a plain-English question, and it will inspect the trace, flag failure points, and return a fix-oriented report: root cause, impact, and recommended next steps.\n\nLucy can also help you spot patterns across multiple failing runs and suggest prompt rewrites to reduce ambiguity.\n\nWe had a Travel agent which was running for a long time, apparently stuck in a loop within the BetweenHorizonalEnd span. Instead of digging through the logs manually, we simply asked Lucy:\n\nLucy inspected the thread's spans, identified a recurring failure pattern, and explained the root cause and impact, along with concrete next steps.\n\nIn this trace, the agent was failing to complete a travel itinerary. Lucy didn't just flag the error; she identified a complex failure pattern involving both the code (schema) and the instructions (prompt).\n\n1. The \"Hallucinated\" Arguments\nLucy pinpointed exactly why the tools were failing. The model was trying to call research_flights with a from_city argument and research_accommodations with check_in_date.\n\n2. The Hidden Logic Trap\nCritically, Lucy found a root cause that a human scanning logs would likely miss: Prompt Contradiction.\n\n3. Silent Failures (Truncation)\nLucy also caught a silent degradation issue: Severe Output Truncation. The Restaurant Extraction step was hitting token limits and cutting off data mid-list (output_tokens: 4000... truncated). The run looked \"successful\" to the server, but the downstream user was getting incomplete data.\n\nLucy’s report turned a vague \"it's not working\" complaint into three distinct engineering tasks: fix the tool schema, clarify the system prompt, and increase the context window for extraction.\n\nCaption: Lucy analyzes the trace and detects multiple issues simultaneously: invalid tool arguments (from_city), contradictory system prompt instructions, and token truncation in the output.\n\nThis is a common failure mode in tool-using agents: when the tool contract isn't perfectly aligned (schema, handler, prompt, examples), the model starts guessing.\n\nThe cost isn't limited to a single failed call:\n\nEven if your run \"succeeds,\" you can still be paying for broken execution paths.\n\nLucy's intelligence comes from vLLora's tracing infrastructure. vLLora captures everything your agent does:\n\nWhen you ask Lucy a question, it pulls the relevant spans and runs, reconstructs the execution flow, and analyzes patterns across the data. This is context that would take a human hours to piece together manually.\n\nLucy is available now in beta for all vLLora users.\n\nLucy will inspect your active context and give you a clear diagnosis, so you can spend less time scrolling and more time shipping.\n\nSee the full Lucy documentation here",

    "title": "One developer used Claude to build a memory-safe extension of C",
    "description": "feature: Robin Rowe talks about coding, programming education, and China in the age of AI",
    "fullText": "feature TrapC, a memory-safe version of the C programming language, is almost ready for testing.\n\n\"We're almost there,\" Robin Rowe told The Register in a phone interview. \"It almost works.\"\n\nWe caught up with Rowe, a computer science professor and entrepreneur, amid debugging efforts that had kept him up until four in the morning. The long-awaited TrapC website has appeared.\n\n\"My work building TrapC has taken two parallel paths,\" Rowe explains in his initial post. \"A TrapC interpreter called itrapc and a separate compiler called trapc. I had wanted to make a software release by 1 January 2026, but too many bugs. I only reached code complete this month and am now on the painstaking and sleepless process of debugging. When I have something stable that mostly works I will make a release. Sorry to make you wait a little longer. Aiming for Q1 2026.\"\n\nBack in November 2024, Rowe explained that he was working on TrapC. At the time, the public and private sector had undertaken a campaign to promote memory-safe software development as a way to reduce exposure to serious vulnerabilities.\n\nMemory safety provides a way of ensuring that memory-related bugs like out-of-bounds reads/writes and use-after-free don't happen. In large codebases, like Chromium and Windows, most of the security vulnerabilities follow from memory bugs. As that message has been repeated in recent years, memory safety has become an imperative, evangelized by the likes of Google and Microsoft, and more recently by authorities in the US and elsewhere.\n\nFor at least the past ten years, there's been a rising chorus of voices calling for the adoption of memory-safe programming languages and techniques. This has meant encouraging developers to avoid languages like C and C++ where feasible, and to adopt languages like C#, Go, Java, Python, Swift, and Rust, instead, particularly for new projects.\n\nTo remain relevant, the C and C++ communities have tried to address those concerns with projects like TrapC, FilC, Mini-C, Safe C++, and C++ Profiles. There's also a C to Rust conversion project under development at DARPA called TRACTOR – TRanslating All C TO Rust.\n\nBut progress has been slow and those writing in C and C++ haven't found a widely accepted approach. The C++ standards committee recently rejected the Safe C++ proposal. And Rowe said he doubted TRACTOR would have anything to show this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the clock is ticking. Microsoft engineer Galen Hunt last month said, \"My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030. Our strategy is to combine AI and algorithms to rewrite Microsoft's largest codebases.\"\n\n\"There are some efforts to port C code by hand to Rust,\" said Rowe. \"But there're some real challenges to doing that because there are some idioms in C that cannot be expressed in Rust.\n\n\"Rust is much more type safe than C is. And so if you have a void pointer, what does that mean in Rust? There's no translation for it. And that's how TrapC is fundamentally different because it actually remembers what that void pointer actually is.\"\n\nRowe said he expects TRACTOR will eventually be able to accomplish C to Rust translation using AI. But he said he thinks it's better to just build the necessary tooling into the C compiler, so you don't have to rely on some external tool that rewrites your code in an unfamiliar language.\n\nRowe has been using AI tools himself and has been teaching others to do so. This past semester, he taught AI Cybersecurity Programmer Analyst (PCO471) at Community College of Baltimore County – Linux administration using vibe coding in bash with no prerequisites. And starting in February, he's teaching C++ Programming with Generative AI (PCO472) – vibe coding in C++.\n\nRowe said programming has fundamentally changed as a result of AI tools. \"I think this is sort of the same type of discussion as when C came in and people said, 'Well, I'm happy in assembly.' There will still be people doing it the old way. But because vibe programming is so much more efficient on time when done correctly, there's gonna be no choice. You just won't be competitive if you're not vibe programming.\"\n\nThen he shifted gears, slightly. \"But I have to walk that back a little bit because the reason I was up until four in the morning is I had vibe programming working on the Trap C compiler. And it took a fundamentally wrong design turn. And I didn't detect that it had made a design mistake. I had told it how I wanted to approach it. But somehow it misunderstood me or it forgot or something happened and I forgot to check. And so I spent hours doodling around in the debugger and trying to understand why code was acting weird before I finally looked at it and said, 'wait a minute, this isn't even the right design.'\"\n\nRowe said a similar situation crops up in pair programming, where you've told someone to do something and they didn't do it, and you don't realize that until later.\n\n\"[C++ creator] Bjarne Stroustrup famously said that the most important thing in software design is to be clear about what you're trying to build,\" Rowe said. \"And vibe [programming] just puts that on steroids. Now we not only have to be ourselves clear, but we have to communicate it clearly to an LLM.\"\n\nRowe argues that developers have to be encouraged to try AI tools and to make mistakes. He recounted how during his AI Cybersecurity Programmer Analyst course, his students expressed interest in doing more hands-on work in lieu of lectures.\n\n\"So I said, 'I've got real servers on the internet that are my companies. I'll give you root,'\" he recalled. \"I'll set loose students who know nothing on my own servers and hope for the best and we'll see how this goes. And the reaction was panic. I couldn't get past the timidity cliff.\"\n\nRowe said that what he learned from that exchange was that they didn't want their own hands-on, they wanted to watch him work.\n\n\"I said to them, 'But guys, this is like learning to play the piano. You can't learn to play the piano by watching me. Yeah, you guys have to practice. And it's gonna be embarrassing at first. You know, you're gonna play a lot of bad notes and sound terrible. You have to get over that situation'.\"\n\nThat's a scenario playing out in various companies where AI tools remain underutilized, for various reasons, including lack of training, security concerns, lack of utility, and poor tool design.\n\nRowe has traveled often to China to speak at the China Association of Higher Education conference. In December, he said, he was interviewed on China News Television about how China's plan for AI compares with America's.\n\nIn an email he explained, \"I said, 'China's AI-Plus plan calls for efficient AI on devices everywhere, from farm to factory to city, while the White House plan calls for building 500-billion-dollar cloud data centers ... using chips that will, inevitably, seem obsolete within two years.'\"\n\nRowe argues China's approach will prevail and that the US has taken the wrong turn by focusing on centralized cloud datacenters to run LLMs. Within two years, he said, we'll have AI models we can run locally on our phones, with no need for network access for most tasks. Apple and Huawei, he said, are likely to be the winners in this scenario.\n\nRowe pointed to China's DeepSeek as an example. While it may not be quite as good as the leading US commercial models, he said, it runs with far less power.\n\n\"This is a very Moore's Law type of strategy,\" he said. \"I remember when I had a Navy supercomputer in 1994. That was an amazing technology. But in 1995, Cray went bankrupt. There weren't enough buyers for it, even though it was an amazing device.\n\n\"And now I've got an iPhone that's in my pocket. That runs on a battery. It doesn't have a whole room devoted to it and exotic cooling and all kinds of stuff. And it's more powerful than that [the Cray from 1994]. So as a long-term strategy, you know, going toward the device makes a lot more sense, because that half-trillion dollar data center is going to be on my iPhone eventually.\"\n\nRowe also said that on the recommendation of a friend from his time at the AT&T DIRECTV Innovation Lab, he tried running Deepseek at a time when Claude wasn't available. Deepseek, he said, was able to find a bug that Claude couldn't.\n\n\"Surprisingly, the bug was in code Claude had generated, that I had cut-and-pasted carelessly,\" he said. \"With hindsight it was a silly code mistake I should have caught, but was in an 'else' branch outside where I was looking. I'd not expected or intended to have Claude make any change to that block of code. And because the code was valid but the logic wrong, the compiler didn't catch it.\"\n\nBut the bug was obvious, he said, as soon as Deepseek pointed it out. He added, \"I'm paying $200/year for Claude. Deepseek is free.\" ®",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman is addressing AI's impact on the workforce, including on OpenAI's hiring practices.\n\nDuring a live-streamed town hall event on Monday, catered mainly toward developers, the OpenAI CEO said that AI has changed how quickly the company expands its head count, but the company is not in a hiring freeze and is nowhere close to doing away with human employees entirely.\n\n\"We are planning to dramatically slow down how quickly we grow because we think we'll be able to do so much more with fewer people,\" said Altman in response to a participant who asked if AI has changed OpenAI's interview process of potential candidates.\n\n\"What I think we shouldn't do, and what I hope other companies won't do either, is hire super aggressively, then realize all of a sudden AI can do a lot of stuff, and you need fewer people, and have to have some sort of very uncomfortable conversation,\" Altman added. \"So I think the right approach for us will be to hire more slowly but keep hiring.\"\n\nAltman's comments come amid the \"Great Freeze\" and concerns that job creation in America has lost momentum. The unemployment rate in November 2025 climbed to its highest level since 2021, while job openings have fallen 37% from their peak in 2022, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that, while in 2022 there were roughly two job openings for every unemployed worker, by September 2025 that ratio had fallen to one. Workers who have been jobless for at least 27 weeks also now make up about a quarter of all unemployed Americans.\n\nBased on data from the US Census Bureau, young workers have been hit especially hard by the hiring slowdown. The unemployment rate for Americans ages 20 to 24 reached 9.2% in August and September, the highest level since the recovery from the pandemic recession.",

    "title": "7 of the most interesting quotes from Anthropic CEO's sprawling 19,000-word essay about AI",
    "description": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei wrote that AI poses \"a serious civilizational challenge,\" one that will require society to take significant action.",
    "fullText": "Dario Amodei still has a lot to say.\n\nOn Monday, the Anthropic CEO dropped an over 19,000-word essay entitled \"The Adolescence of Technology\" on the future of AI on Monday, opining on everything from his fellow CEOs to feudalism, and even the Unabomber.\n\nBest known for his warning that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs in the next 1 to 5 years, Amodei has tangled with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and the Trump White House over his views.\n\nHere are seven of the most alarming and surprising quotes.\n\nAmodei remains optimistic about AI overall, but his essay detailed \"an intimidating gauntlet that humanity must run\" to reap the benefits of AI without letting the breakthrough technology destroy the world.\n\n\"I believe if we act decisively and carefully, the risks can be overcome — I would even say our odds are good. And there's a hugely better world on the other side of it,\" he wrote. \"But we need to understand that this is a serious civilizational challenge.\"\n\nAI development can't be stopped, Amodei wrote, a conclusion even some of AI's skeptics share. The financial and security benefits are just too massive for the private and public sectors to pass up.\n\nIt's why winning the AI race and doing so in an ethical way is so critical, he concludes.\n\nJensen Huang hasn't changed Amodei's mind on China.\n\n\"A number of complicated arguments are made to justify such sales, such as the idea that 'spreading our tech stack around the world' allows 'America to win' in some general, unspecified economic battle,\" Amodei said. \"In my view, this is like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and then bragging that the missile casings are made by Boeing and so the US is 'winning.'\"\n\nIn November, Nvidia announced a partnership with Anthropic that includes an investment of up to $10 billion in the AI startup. The news sparked speculation that tensions between Amodei and Huang might be cooling.\n\nWhatever the status of their relationship, Amodei is resolute that it is a horrendous decision to allow US companies to sell advanced chips to China.\n\n\"China is several years behind the US in their ability to produce frontier chips in quantity, and the critical period for building the country of geniuses in a data center is very likely to be within those next several years,\" Amodei wrote. \"There is no reason to give a giant boost to their AI industry during this critical period.\"\n\nAmodei would like his critics to see the scoreboard.\n\nAnthropic's leader hasn't tried to curry favor with the White House, nor has he vocally embraced President Donald Trump's AI policies to the same degree as his rival CEOs. Amodei's outspoken call for AI regulation even led David Sacks, Trump's AI czar, to publicly rebuke him.\n\nAnthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering. It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem. https://t.co/C5RuJbVi4P\n\nNone of it has changed Amodei's view that the AI industry \"needs a healthier relationship with government — one based on substantive policy engagement rather than political alignment.\"\n\n\"Many people have told me that we should stop doing this, that it could lead to unfavorable treatment, but in the year we've been doing it, Anthropic's valuation has increased by over 6x, an almost unprecedented jump at our commercial scale,\" he wrote.\n\nOf all of his hopes, this one appears the unlikeliest. Already, AI CEOs have formed dueling super PACs ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe tech elite made AI, and they should help society grapple with its fallout, he wrote in the essay. Amodei has long called on governments to prepare for mass job displacement. In one of the most eyebrow-raising parts of the essay, Anthropic CEO detailed what his fellow billionaires and companies must do.\n\nBeyond philanthropy, Amodei said companies need to be \"creative\" in how they stave off layoffs.\n\nIn the long term, he wrote, \"It may be feasible to pay human employees even long after they are no longer providing economic value in the traditional sense.\"\n\nOne of the biggest themes of Amodei's essay is the risk that AI companies themselves pose. It's a conclusion that he admits is \"somewhat awkward\" for him to reach. As an example, he points to the roiling topic of the sexualization of children. While he does not name xAI directly, Grok is facing investigations in multiple countries over the non-consensual sexualization of images of real people.\n\n\"Some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualization of children in today's models, which makes me doubt that they'll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models,\" he wrote.\n\nOverall, he expressed skepticism that AI companies will sacrifice profit for broader societal good. \"Ordinary corporate governance,\" Amodei wrote, is ill-equipped to address his worries.\n\nAmodei said that fears that AI models may defy orders and perhaps even try to eliminate humanity are complicated by bad actors in the industry who aren't as transparent about the risks they are seeing in their models.\n\n\"While it is incredibly valuable for individual AI companies to engage in good practices or become good at steering AI models, and to share their findings publicly, the reality is that not all AI companies do this, and the worst ones can still be a danger to everyone even if the best ones have excellent practices,\" he wrote.\n\nAmodei doesn't see the largest risks to humanity coming from AI pursuing total domination, but rather in what AI could enable humans to unleash.\n\nAmodei described his fears that AI is lowering the barrier of entry necessary to make killer biological weapons. His greatest concern is that AI could provide the step-by-step know-how that could eventually enable even an average person to produce a bioweapon.\n\nAI companies, Amodei said, need to ensure they create sufficient backstops to block such inquiries, including by making it difficult for hackers to jailbreak models. Adding such security is expensive, Amodei said, noting that these measures are \"close to 5% of total inference costs\" for some of the companies' models.\n\n\"I am concerned that over time there may be a prisoner's dilemma where companies can defect and lower their costs by removing classifiers,\" he wrote. \"This is once again a classic negative externalities problem that can't be solved by the voluntary actions of Anthropic or any other single company alone.\"\n\nAmodei is one of the AI industry's most vocal proponents of AI legislation. While Meta and Microsoft supported a federal preemption of state-level AI laws, Anthropic supported AI transparency bills in California and New York that are now law.\n\nThroughout the essay, Amodei outlined multiple areas for future legislation, including industry-wide transparency requirements like those at the state level. Even he concludes that new laws might not be enough.\n\n\"The rapid progress of AI may create situations that our existing legal frameworks are not well designed to deal with,\" he wrote.\n\nIt's why Amodei said he would go so far as to support a constitutional amendment. The US has not amended the Constitution since 1992, when the over two-century-long battle to add a limitation on congressional pay finally passed the 38th state legislature.\n\n\"I would support civil liberties-focused legislation (or maybe even a constitutional amendment) that imposes stronger guardrails against AI-powered abuses,\" he wrote.",

    "fullText": "Premier platform for professional AI Motion Control. We empower creators to synchronize complex movements and facial expressions from reference videos to static images with surgical precision.\n\nUpload a character image and a reference motion video. Our AI extracts movements and expressions to animate your image with stunning precision.\n\nWhen Character Orientation matches the video, complex motions perform better; when it matches the image, camera movements are better supported.\n\nClick any example below to preview the motion transfer results\n\nAt aimotioncontrol.net, we don't just generate video; we engineer motion. Our AI Motion Control technology solves the fundamental chaotic nature of diffusion models, anchoring every frame to your exact creative intent.\n\nTransfer movement from any source video to your target character with industry-leading AI Motion Control precision. Unlike standard image-to-video tools that guess movement, our system locks onto the skeletal structure of your reference footage. This ensures that every nuance of the original performance captures the energy and intent of the actor, regardless of the target character's design.\n\nOur AI Motion Control algorithms ensure that every limb, joint, and subtle shift in weight is perfectly transferred. Whether it's a complex dance routine featuring rapid spins or a specific stunt requiring perfect timing, the output matches the input with 99% anatomical accuracy, preserving the physics of the original motion.\n\nMaintain character identity across all frames without distortion. Traditional AI struggles with keeping a character's face and clothes consistent during rapid movement, often resulting in morphing textures. AI Motion Control utilizes temporal attention layers to preserve details from the first frame to the last, ensuring your character looks the same at frame 100 as they did at frame 1.\n\nApply the motion of a human actor to a stylized character (anime, 3D render, claymation) instantly. AI Motion Control handles the stylistic translation while keeping the physics of the movement grounded in reality. You can drive a cartoon character with a human performance or map a human's walk cycle onto a robotic creature.\n\nThe system intelligently adjusts the motion to fit the proportions of your target character. If you map a tall actor's motion to a short goblin character, AI Motion Control automatically recalculates the stride length and center of gravity to ensure the movement looks natural and physically plausible.\n\nClone nuanced facial expressions for emotional storytelling with our dedicated facial AI Motion Control engine. Eyes, mouth shapes, and micro-expressions are mapped faithfully, allowing you to convey complex emotions that standard AI models fail to capture.\n\nSuperior accuracy in mapping complex facial expressions. A smile isn't just a curve of the lips; it's the crinkle of the eyes and the lifting of cheeks. AI Motion Control captures it all, distinguishing between a smirk, a grin, and a laugh with pixel-perfect precision.\n\nPerfect lip synchronization for talking heads and dialogue. Input your audio track, and our AI Motion Control system aligns the mouth movements frame by frame for believable speech, making it an ideal tool for virtual news anchors or storytelling.\n\nEnsure your character is looking exactly where they should be.

From walking and running to complex martial arts, our AI Motion Control database is ready to animate your static images. We categorize motions by intensity, style, and genre for easy discovery.\n\nUpload your own reference videos for unique motion control. The system analyzes your footage and creates a custom motion LoRA that can be applied to any character. You can build your own private library of proprietary movements for your studio.\n\nCombine different motions or blend them together. AI Motion Control allows for smooth transitions between different action states, creating long, continuous takes. You can have a character walk, stop, look around, and then run, all seamlessly blended.\n\nEnsuring smooth, flicker-free motion in long-form videos is the hallmark of professional AI Motion Control. We eliminate the 'boiling' effect common in generative video, delivering broadcast-quality stability.\n\nProprietary algorithms to eliminate jitter and artifacts. By analyzing the optical flow between frames, our AI Motion Control engine corrects anomalies before they render. It acts as a digital stabilizer, smoothing out the noise inherent in diffusion models.\n\nSpecifically optimized for longer duration video generation. Most tools break down after 4 seconds. AI Motion Control maintains coherence for up to 60 seconds of continuous video without the character losing their identity or structural integrity.\n\nGenerate videos at 60fps or higher. AI Motion Control interprets the motion between frames to interpolate smooth motion, making your results broadcast-ready. Create slow-motion effects or crisp, realistic action sequences.\n\nOne of the toughest challenges in AI video is keeping the artistic style consistent while the subject moves. AI Motion Control solves this by decoupling motion from style modules.\n\nWhether your source image is an oil painting, a cyberpunk digital art piece, or a sketch, AI Motion Control ensures that the texture and brushstrokes move naturally with the character, rather than staying static like a screen overlay.\n\nAs your character moves through the virtual space, AI Motion Control calculates how the lighting should simulate on their changing geometry. Shadows wrap correctly, and highlights shift naturally, maintaining the 3D illusion of the 2D generation.\n\nKeep your background stable while your character moves. Our system identifies the subject and generates a clean plate for the background, preventing the warping and 'breathing' background issues seen in other tools.\n\nForget about expensive GPUs and complex installations. AI Motion Control delivers workstation-power directly to your browser through our optimized cloud infrastructure. Create without limits.\n\nCreate high-fidelity animations on any device, from a standard laptop to a tablet. We handle the compute-intensive diffusion processes on our enterprise-grade GPU clusters, freeing your machine from overheating and lag.\n\nDon't wait for one video to finish before starting the next. Our scalable architecture supports parallel processing, allowing you to run multiple motion experiments simultaneously. Iterate faster and find the perfect shot in a fraction of the time.\n\nOur cloud platform means you always have access to the latest AI Motion Control models and features the moment they are released. Say goodbye to managing local Python environments, installing dependencies, or downloading massive model weights.\n\nFrom social media viral hits to professional film production, AI Motion Control delivers the precision required for top-tier content.\n\nCreate high-end social media content and viral marketing campaigns. In the fast-paced world of TikTok and Instagram, stopping the scroll is everything. AI Motion Control allows brands to create eye-popping, impossible visuals that capture attention instantly. Imagine your mascot dancing perfectly to the latest trend, or your product assembling itself in mid-air. AI Motion Control makes this accessible without a Hollywood budget.\n\nProfessional film pre-visualization and character storyboarding. Directors can now visualize scenes with animated characters before a single camera starts rolling. AI Motion Control allows for rapid iteration of blocking and staging. Instead of stick figures or rough drawings, see your characters move and act in the actual environment, saving millions in production costs.\n\nDevelop realistic virtual influencers and digital brand ambassadors. The virtual human economy is booming, but stiff, robotic movement breaks the illusion. AI Motion Control gives your digital avatars lifelike movements and expressions, allowing them to connect with audiences authentically. Generate daily content for your virtual star without needing a motion capture suit every time.\n\nCreate personalized AI-driven dance and performance videos. Choreograph complex routines for your digital characters using simple reference videos. AI Motion Control excels at capturing the fluidity of dance, preserving the elegance of ballet or the snap of hip-hop, and applying it to any character you design.\n\nAccelerate asset creation for indie games. AI Motion Control can generate sprite sheet animations or cutscene videos from simple references, drastically reducing the animation workload for small teams.\n\nShowcase clothing on moving models without a photoshoot. AI Motion Control can take a flat image of a dress and a video of a model walking, and generate a video of the model wearing that dress, moving naturally.\n\nSelect the plan that best fits your creative needs. Unlock the full potential of AI Motion Control.\n\nEverything you need to know about our technology and how it helps you create better videos.\n\nJoin the revolution of precise AI video generation. Don't settle for randomness. Start creating lifelike animations today with the power of AI Motion Control.\n\nTrusted by professional creators worldwide",

    "title": "AI Enthusiasts Are Running 'Clawdbot' on Their Mac Minis, but You Probably Shouldn't",
    "description": "If you care about your privacy and security, don't use this viral AI tool.",
    "fullText": "I am a self-professed AI skeptic. I have yet to really find much of a need for all these AI-powered assistants, as well as many AI-powered features. The most useful applications in my view are subtle—the rest seem better suited for shareholders than actual people.\n\nAnd yet, the AI believers have a new tool they're very excited about, which is now all over my feeds: Clawdbot. Could this agentic AI assistant be the thing that makes me a believer as well? Spoiler alert: probably not.\n\nIf you're deep in the online AI community, you probably already know about Clawbot. For the rest of us, here's the gist: Clawdbot is a \"personal AI assistant\" designed to run locally on your devices, as opposed to cloud-based options. (Think ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude.) In fact, Clawdbot runs any number of AI models, including those from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, and Perplexity. While you can run Clawdbot on Mac, Linux, and Windows, many online are opting to install the bot on dedicated Mac mini setups, leading to one part of the assistant's virality.\n\nBut there are other AI assistants that can be run locally—one thing that makes Clawdbot unique is that you communicate with it through chat apps. Which app you use is up to you, as Clawdbot works with apps like Discord, Google Chat, iMessages, Microsoft Teams, Signal, Telegram, WebChat, and WhatsApp. The idea is that you \"text\" Clawdbot as you would a friend or family member, but it acts as you'd expect an AI assistant to—except, maybe more so.\n\nThat's because, while Clawdbot can certainly do the things an AI bot like ChatGPT can, it's meant more for agentic tasks. In other words, Clawdbot can do things for you, all while running in the background on your devices. The bot's official website advertises that it can clear your inbox, send emails, manage your calendar, and check you in for flights—though power users are pushing the tool to do much more.\n\nClawdbot works with a host of apps and services you might use yourself. That includes productivity apps like Apple Notes, Apple Reminders, Things 3, Notion, Obsidian, Bear Notes, Trello, GitHub; music apps like Spotify, Sonos, and Shazam; smart home apps like Philips Hue, 8Sleep, and Home Assistant; as well as other major apps like Chrome, 1Password, and Gmail. It can generate images, search the web for GIFs, see your screen, take photos and videos, and check the weather. Based on the website alone, it has a lengthy résumé.\n\nThe last big point here is that Clawdbot has an advertised \"infinite\" memory. That means the bot \"remembers\" every interaction you've ever had with it, as well as all the actions it's taken on your behalf. In theory, you could use Clawdbot to build apps, run your home, or manage your messages, all within the context of everything you've done before. In that, it'd really be the closest thing to a \"digital assistant\" we've seen on this scale. These assistants have been mostly actionable—you ask the bot what you want to know or what you want done, and it (hopefully) acts accordingly. But the ideal version of Clawdbot would do all those things for you without you needing to ask.\n\nNot everyone is psyched about Clawdbot, though. Take this user, who jokes that, after four messages, the bot made a reservation, then, after six messages, was able to send a calendar invite, only to cost $87 in Opus 4.7 tokens. This user came up with a story (at least I hope it's a story) where they give Clawdbot access to their stock portfolio and tasked it with making $1 million without making mistakes. After thousands of reports, dozens of strategies, and many scans of X posts, it lost everything. \"But boy was it beautiful.\"\n\nI particularly like this take, which reads: \"[I've] made a tragic discovery using [Clawdbot.] [There] simply aren’t that many tasks in my personal life that are worth automating.\" There are also some jabs from what appear to be anti-AI users, like this one, that imagines a Clawdbot user with no job living in their parent's basement, asking the bot to do their tasks for the day.\n\nAs with all things AI, there are many thoughts, opinions, and criticisms here, especially considering how viral this new tool is. But the main critique seems to be that Clawdbot requires a lot (in terms of hardware, power, and privacy) without really offering much in return. Sure, it can do things for you, but do you really need a bot booking your plane tickets, or combing through your emails? The answer to that, I suppose, is up to each of us, but the \"backlash,\" if you can call it that, is likely coming from people who would answer \"no.\"\n\nIf you want to try Clawdbot, you'll likely need to have some technical experience first. You can get started from Clawdbot's official github page, as well as Clawdbot's \"Getting started\" guide. According to this page, you'll begin by running the Clawdbot onboarding wizard, which will set you up with the gateway, workspace, channels, and skills. This works on Mac, Linux, and Windows, and while you won't need a Mac mini, it seems to be what the Clawdbot crowd is running with.\n\nFull disclosure: Clawdbot and its setup go beyond my expertise, and I will not be installing it on my devices. However, if you have the knowledge to follow these instructions, or the will to learn, the developer has the steps listed in the links above.\n\nWhile I likely wouldn't install Clawdbot on my device anyway, the privacy and security implications here definitely keep me away.\n\nThe main issue with Clawdbot is that it has full control and access over whichever device you run it on, as well as any of the software that is running therein. That makes sense, on the surface: How is an agentic AI supposed to do things on your behalf if it does have access to the apps and hardware necessary for execution?\n\nBut the inherent security risk with any program like this involves prompt injection. Bad actors could sneak their own AI prompts into otherwise innocent sites and programs. When your bot crawls the text as it completes your task, it intercepts the prompt, and, thinking it's from you, executes that prompt instead. It's the main security flaw with AI browsers, and it could affect something like Clawdbot, too. And since you've given Clawdbot control over your entire computer and everything in it...yikes. Bad actors could manipulate Clawdbot to theoretically send DMs to anyone they like, run malicious programs, read and write files on your computer, trick Clawdbot into accessing your private data, and learn about your hardware for further cyber attacks.\n\nIn Clawdbot's case, these prompt injections could come from a number of sources. They could come from messages via bad actors through the chat apps you communicate through Clawdbot, they could come from the browsers you use to access the internet, and they could come from plugins you run on various programs, to name a few possibilities.\n\nClawdbot does have a security guide on its site that walks you through ways to shore up your defenses while using Clawdbot. The developer admits that running an AI agent with shell access on your machine is \"spicy,\" that this is both a product and an experiment, and that there is no \"perfectly secure\" setup. That said, there are security features built in here that serve a purpose and attempt to limit who can access Clawdbot, where Clawdbot can go, and what Clawdbot can do. That could involve locking down DMs, viewing links and attachments as \"hostile\" by default, reducing high-risk tools, and running modern AI models that have better protections against prompt injection.\n\nStill, the whole affair is too risky for me, especially considering I'm not sure I really want an AI assistant in the first place. I think companies believe we want to offload tasks like calendars, messages, and creation to bots, to save us time from menial to-do lists. Maybe some do, but I don't. I want to know who is reaching out to me and why, and not trust an AI to decide what messages are worth my attention. I want to write my own emails and know what events I have on my own calendar. I also want access to my own computer. Maybe some people trust AI enough to handle all these things for them—if it makes me a luddite to feel the opposite, so be it.",

    "description": "The Maia 200 AI chip is described as an inference powerhouse — meaning it could lead AI models to apply their knowledge to real-world situations much faster and more efficiently.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMicrosoft has revealed its new Maia 200 accelerator chip for artificial intelligence (AI) that is three times more powerful than hardware from rivals like Google and Amazon, company representatives say.\n\nThis newest chip will be used in AI inference rather than training, powering systems and agents used to make predictions, provide answers to queries and generate outputs based on new data that's fed to them.\n\nMaia 200 is already being deployed in Microsoft's U.S. central data center region, with the company set to use the chips to generate synthetic data and in reinforcement training to improve next-generation large language models (LLMs). The AI accelerator will also be used to power Microsoft Foundry and 365 Copilot AI, and be part of the infrastructure that the company can provide through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nThe new chip delivers performance of more than 10 petaflops (1015 floating point operations per second), Scott Guthrie, cloud and AI executive vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post. This is a measure of performance in supercomputing, where the most powerful supercomputers in the world can reach more than 1,000 petaflops of power.\n\nThe new chip achieved this performance level in a data representation category known as \"4-bit precision (FP4)\" — a highly compressed model designed to accelerate AI performance. Maia 200 also delivers 5 PFLOPS of performance in 8-bit precision (FP8). The difference between the two is that FP4 is far more energy efficient but less accurate.\n\n\"In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,\" Guthrie said in the blog post. \"This means Maia 200 delivers 3 times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\"\n\nMaia 200 could potentially be used for specialist AI workloads, such as running larger LLMs in the future. So far, Microsoft's Maia chips have only been used in the Azure cloud infrastructure to run large-scale workloads for Microsoft’s own AI services, notably Copilot. However, Guthrie noted there would be \"wider customer availability in the future,\" signaling other organizations could tap into Maia 200 via the Azure cloud, or the chips could potentially one day be deployed in standalone data centers or server stacks.\n\nGuthrie said that Microsoft boasts 30% better performance per dollar over existing systems thanks to the use of the 3-nanometer process made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the most important fabricator in the world, allowing for 100 billion transistors per chip. This essentially means that Maia 200 could be more cost-effective and efficient for the most demanding AI workloads than existing chips.\n\nMaia 200 has a few other features alongside better performance and efficiency. It includes a memory system, for instance, which can help keep an AI model’s weights and data local, meaning you would need less hardware to run a model. It's also designed to be quickly integrated into existing data centers.\n\nMaia 200 should enable AI models to run faster and more efficiently. This means Azure OpenAI users, such as scientists, developers and corporations, could see better throughput and speeds when developing AI applications and using the likes of GPT-4 in their operations.\n\n—'It won’t be so much a ghost town as a zombie apocalypse': How AI might forever change how we use the internet\n\n— GPT-4 has passed the Turing test, researchers claim\n\n—The more advanced AI models get, the better they are at deceiving us — they even know when they're being tested\n\nThis next-generation AI hardware is unlikely to disrupt everyday AI and chatbot use for most people in the short term, as Maia 200 is designed for data centers rather than consumer-grade hardware. However, end users could see the impact of Maia 200 in the form of faster response times and potentially more advanced features from Copilot and other AI tools built into Windows and Microsoft products.\n\nMaia 200 could also provide a performance boost to developers and scientists who use AI inference via Microsoft’s platforms. This, in turn, could lead to improvements in AI deployment on large-scale research projects and elements like advanced weather modeling, biological or chemical systems and compositions.",

    "description": "What happens when we plug the names of the best remaining Eagles OC candidates into ChatGPT's engine?",
    "fullText": "Once we turn the calendar from January's final Monday to Tuesday, we'll enter a third week dedicated to the Philadelphia Eagles' offensive coordinator search. Names have changed, but the climate and landscape remain familiar.\n\nNames have been added to the mix. Candidates have withdrawn from consideration. The general public remains confused. Not even one full year after hoisting the Lombardi Trophy, none of the top options are interested in becoming the Eagles' top offensive assistant.\n\nPerhaps Philadelphia is exercising patience? Maybe Brian Daboll mentioned the Tennessee Titans and Buffalo Bills to give the impression that he had more options? Perhaps he was trying to rush Philadelphia into a decision?\n\nMaybe he was truly in the running for jobs with those two franchises. Who knows? Those are questions we're throwing out for fodder. No one has all of the information. We're all trying to piece this together. What we do know is that no one likes all of the remaining candidates we're told are still in the running.\n\nWho is the best fit for Jalen Hurts? How do we describe the best fit for the roster overall? Who carries the most red flags? Is there any long-term stability for any of these guys?\n\nAs we ventured through Championship Sunday, we learned the Eagles had interest in Arthur Smith before he accepted the Ohio State Buckeyes job. Once we began another workweek, it was learned that Charlie Weis Jr. had removed his name from consideration. Hours later, Declan Doyle arrived at the same decision.\n\nJust for kicks, we took a breather. We plugged a few names into ChatGPT and asked who the best candidates were for the Eagles' OC job. What we learned was AI's list looks a lot like some of our own. Here's what they came up with. Keep in mind that we aren't sure whether Brian Daboll is still in the running.\n\nAI gives Brian Daboll a five-star rating as a potential OC hire, citing he has the best chance to elevate Jalen Hurts immediately. He lands atop the list because he has already done the job before and has previously had success working with Josh Allen.\n\nMike Kafka lands second on the list. His approach seems to emphasize rhythm and being 'on time'. Those are areas where we have seen Jalen Hurts struggle. That could lead to questions, but Kafka has coached mobile quarterbacks before and understands how to blend run concepts into the passing game.\n\nFrank Smith is one of the new additions to this list. He worked with Mike McDaniel as his offensive coordinator. He's intriguing and shouldn't be viewed as someone the Eagles are pursuing, since he was closest to one of the guys they actually wanted.\n\nNagy is a descendant of the Andy Reid coaching tree. He never quite recovered from the 'Double-Doink Game'. Word has it that he even had kickers audition for a job the following season by kicking from the same spot that Cody Parkey missed the go-ahead field goal attempt in the Wild Card Game.\n\nNagy is better than the reputation suggests. He could do a good job in returning to the place where his coaching career began.\n\nHere's one of the guys we know the least about, yet AI ranks him fifth-best. Settling on him means the Eagles would have placed more emphasis on potential than on proof and his resume.\n\nJerrod Johnson is another of the new additions to the Eagles' OC conversation. He is a good teacher, but this may be a mismatch in terms of need. Known as a QB developer, he would be asked to grow into his new role a la Kevin Patullo. If you remember that ultimately led to Patullo's undoing. Johnson might be a 'wrong place, wrong time' candidate, but again, these are only opinions we're sharing.\n\nSome would rank Jim Bob Cooter higher. He actually has OC experience. There's an obvious low ceiling here, as there isn't much evidence that he elevates quarterbacks or builds innovative systems that let them do what they do best.\n\nThe Eagles need to reinvent their offense, and they need to reinvent Jalen Hurts to some degree. They need someone who understands how to do both. None of these guys is a slam-dunk hire in that regard.\n\nAll have positives. All have flaws. One of the most important decisions of the offseason keeps being weighed. One false move and Philadelphia will throw away another season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Ranking Eagles' remaining OC candidates using artificial intelligence",

    "fullText": "Data from Domain Name Stat reveals that the top-level domain originally assigned to the British Overseas Territory of Anguilla passed the milestone in early January.\n\nFrom Sandisk shareholders to vibe coders, AI is making — and breaking — fortunes at a rapid pace.\n\nOne unlikely beneficiary has been the British Overseas Territory of Anguilla, which lucked into a future fortune when ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, gave the island the “.ai” top-level domain in the mid-1990s. Indeed, since ChatGPT’s launch at the end of 2022, the gold rush for websites to associate themselves with the burgeoning AI technology has seen a flood of revenue for the island of just ~15,000 people.\n\nIn 2023, Anguilla generated 87 million East Caribbean dollars (~$32 million) from domain name sales, some 22% of its total government revenue that year, with 354,000 “.ai” domains registered.\n\nAs of January 2, 2026, the number of “.ai” domains surpassed 1 million, per data from Domain Name Stat — suggesting that the nation’s revenue from “.ai” has likely soared, too. This is confirmed in the government’s 2026 budget address, in which Cora Richardson Hodge, the premier of Anguilla, said, “Revenue from domain name registration continues to exceed expectations.”\n\nThe report mentions that receipts from the sale of goods and services came in way ahead of expectations, thanks primarily to the revenue from “.ai” domains, which is forecast to hit EC$260.5 million (~$96.4 million) for the latest year. In 2023, domain name registrations were about 73% of that wider category. Assuming a similar share of that category for this year would suggest that the territory has raked in more than ~$70 million from “.ai” domains in the past year.\n\nAnguilla typically charges $140 for a two-year domain registration, creating a steady stream of income, as some 90% of domains renew after two years. But auctions for expired “.ai” domains, sold via domain name registrar Namecheap, are where bigger numbers roll in — for example, the domain “you.ai” was bought for $700,000 last September, and even in the past week, 31 expired “.ai” domains were sold at a total price of ~$1.2 million, per domain sale tracker NameBio.",

    "fullText": "Man, it is a really weird time in the software world right now. Like a lot of people, when I picked up ChatGPT and Midjourney back in late 2022. It felt like wizardry.\n\nFor a year I experimented and experimented. I wrote about how Midjourney responds to emojis and even tried to see if I could write a children’s book with AI. The output here looks pretty rough today, but it was a revelation at the time. And the AI tools just kind of gradually got better and better.\n\nOne thing that never really clicked for me though was agentic coding. The vision is that you tell an LLM what you want, and it just goes off and executes it. It never really worked that well. It felt like the agents just kind of plowed through code and broke a bunch of stuff on the way to making the fix I wanted. Coding agents were more a curiosity, not something I could actually use.\n\nHowever, this is all about to change. And it is going to change everything about how software is built.\n\nI was drawn back by a post called Welcome to Gas Town by Steve Yegge.\n\nGas Town is part visionary, part performance art. It’s a Mad Max-themed fever dream that enables agents, managing agents, managing agents. There’s a mayor, rigs, polecats, a deacon and a refinery—and they all work together in this vast factory where vibes go in and code comes out.\n\nThere’s a lot of really clever ideas that somewhat mesh together. You’ve probably heard about the context window LLMs have. Essentially it’s their short-term memory. Once an agent uses about 20% of its context window, its intelligence drops off a cliff and it starts doing insane things like dropping databases.\n\nGas Town employs a trick to manage that issue. It assigns tasks to ephemeral “Polecat” agents. Polecats do a task and then disappear—basically removing the challenge of managing context windows.\n\nMaggie Appleton articulated the value of Gas Town well:\n\nWe should take Yegge’s creation seriously not because it’s a serious, working tool for today’s developers (it isn’t). But because it’s a good piece of speculative design fiction that asks provocative questions and reveals the shape of constraints we’ll face as agentic coding systems mature and grow.\n\nAnd so, intrigued by Gas Town, I decided to try vibe coding again.\n\nI’m not the type to just dip my toes in. If I’m going to do something, I do a cannonball.\n\nI’m always looking for the meta. What is the best strategy and who knows how to execute it? I read that Anthropic’s CTO keeps five agents running constantly and barely looks at the actual files. Either that’s marketing or there must be something there, or maybe both?\n\nI read a bunch of articles and watched a ton of YouTube videos. YouTube was pretty wild. There are these videos with guys streaming 5-10 Claude Code terminals, blaring EDM (lol) and managing all these agents.\n\nI’m kind of poking fun, but I actually learned a lot about setup from that BridgeMind channel. If you’re interested I might start with his videos about Warp and the OpenCode CLI.\n\nI wanted to see how well these agents actually work, but I needed an easy entry point. A Chrome extension to restyle Hacker News seemed perfect. It’s been in my backlog for a while, and because it’s purely frontend, I knew I’d be comfortable judging the output.\n\nAnd honestly it was. Initially I tried to one-shot the thing and—as I expected—that was a failure. But then I decided to slow down. I told the agent to scaffold a chrome extension to restyle Hacker News pages. It worked. And I kind of just broke up these tasks into smaller pieces. Tested them as I went.\n\nSure there were bugs. But I kind of just did what I do when I’m reviewing any engineers’ code. Inspect the DOM, look at the styles, look at the console and then give feedback. When the context window hit’s 20% I typically close that window and open a new chat. The OpenCode CLI even allows you to drop screenshots. It’s pretty wild.\n\nNow, I don’t have a dozen agents running at the same time. I never felt the need to have more than two working. And I’m honestly not sure how UI work even gets shipped in Gas Town? My guess is Yegge is probably a lot less concerned with UX than I am.\n\nWith AI agents, the last mile—that final polish and detailing—will be critical. We already see this in Salesloft, where sellers review generative emails before sending. In design, it manifests as small UI tweaks. It will be something else for doctors and something else for mechanical engineers. But I think there is a real opportunity in refining how humans interact with the agent’s output, creating better loops for feedback and adjustment.\n\nYou know what? There’s something here though. I don’t really like the term “vibe coding.” And I know the concept is polarizing. But after tinkering with this stuff for a couple days—I think agents are about to change how we build software.\n\nThe conception of what it looks like to make software is going to change pretty quickly.\n\nThe three major functions on a delivery team (or feature team) are engineering, design and product management. I’ve long thought we’re going to start to see more overlap in those functions. I’m even more sure of it now.\n\nI think we’re going to start to see a hybrid role emerge—product engineer.\n\nWhat does this mean delivery teams will look like in the future? I imagine they are either significantly smaller or significantly more productive. I’m not sure if QA is embedded into these teams the same way they are currently or if there is a separate team of—well, people managing QA agents. I have a lot of questions.\n\nThis also makes me think a lot about Ben Thompson’s theory on bundling and unbundling. From 2010 to 2015, companies quickly moved on the back of frameworks. First like Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap. Then on other technologies like Angular and React. The speed these frameworks provided caused an unbundling in the software world.\n\nPoint solutions were able to move fast and gather steam while slow incumbents either weren’t nimble enough or weren’t in a place to capitalize on the productivity provided by frameworks. Starting in 2016, that changed. Customers were overwhelmed with choices. Larger companies caught on and smaller ones consolidated into larger platforms.\n\nI think that’s about to shift again. And probably this year.\n\nDavid Cummings called it out in his newsletter this weekend. SaaS companies are about to see a massive wave of new competition. And it is going to happen extremely fast. The bar to build software has been lowered. A two-person team will soon be able to build what used to take a whole department.\n\nThis puts incumbent software companies in a pretty dangerous situation. Those that are not able to be nimble and go fast are going to be in real trouble. I think this is especially true in the consumer, SMB and mid-market segments. Enterprise software may have some buffer as customers of enterprise software are buying a process more than the software itself.\n\nHonestly, it makes me a little nervous. The industry is going to change and everyone’s jobs are going to look a little different—product design included.\n\nBut as someone who got into software just because I wanted to make things, this is a dream come true. I’m seeing a glimpse of the vision I hoped for in 2022. It’s not just a toy anymore. It’s an unbelievable tool for builders.\n\nIf you’ve been ignoring AI tools because you think they are overhyped, or maybe don’t see how they fit into your workflow. I’d encourage you to give them another look.",

    "title": "The Windows PC is dying, thanks to cloud-based services and AI",
    "description": "The rise of AI tools and services has added a new twist to the decline and fall of standalone Windows PCs.",
    "fullText": "For years, I’ve been watching the slow evolution of classic Windows PCs into cloud-based Windows and Office services. Sure, you can still buy a PC with Windows on it, but you’re not really “buying” Windows as much as renting it.\n\nWindows cloud PCs have gone from Microsoft’s side project to the centerpiece of its post‑Windows‑10 strategy. But the story in 2026 is less “death of the PC” and more “merger of PC, cloud, and AI under Microsoft’s terms.” Today, the most interesting question is not whether Windows moves to the cloud, but how much local control users are willing to surrender in exchange for AI‑infused desktops.\n\nFor the longest time, Microsoft had planned on the Windows 365 Cloud PC to shift users from a PC‑centric world to Desktop‑as‑a‑Service, with Windows 11 acting as the on‑ramp. Microsoft’s own internal slideware later made that explicit: the plan is to “move Windows 11 increasingly to the cloud… to enable a full Windows operating system streamed from the cloud to any device.” What started as the Business and Enterprise editions of Windows 365, running on Azure with per‑user monthly pricing in the $30-to-$60 range, has since been productized and polished as if it were the “real” Windows roadmap rather than a side hustle.\n\nOther harbingers included Windows 365 Boot, which bypassed the local operating system entirely and dropped you straight into a personalized cloud desktop on shared or BYOD hardware. And Windows 365 Switch blurs the boundary between local and hosted sessions, turning a cloud PC into “just another desktop.”\n\nAt the same time, Windows App enables you to run Azure Virtual Desktop, Windows 365, Microsoft Dev Box, Remote Desktop Services, and remote PCs from, well, pretty much any computing device. Specifically, you can use Windows App to run Windows on Macs, iPhones, iPads, other Windows machines, even in web browsers. That last means you can now run Windows on Linux-powered PCs, Chromebooks, and Android phones and tablets.\n\nHeck, you can even run Windows using a Meta Quest VR headset!\n\nA funny thing happened on the way to this cloud-based subscription service. AI came along. Microsoft, which has gone whole-hog into AI — if I see one more Copilot tie-in, I’m going to scream — decided that AI PCs would be the future. It’s wrong.\n\nAs Kevin Terwilliger, Dell’s head of product, said of PC customers, “They’re not buying based on AI. I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them.” (Ya think?)\n\nThat’s not to say people aren’t using AI. They are. But, no one’s managed to sell them yet on the idea of agentic AI PCs, even with the special sauce of Neural Processing Units (NPUs), Intel Panther Lake chips, and super-duper GPUs. Most analysts, and at least one cranky Computerworld columnist (guess who), think the Copilot+ PC hype needs to end.\n\nJeff Bezos — remember him? he knows a thing or two about the cloud — suggested that the PC is never going to be able to deliver the AI goods. Instead, “AI will be in everything,” but compute will be delivered via the cloud. In case you missed it, at the last Ignite conference, Microsoft highlighted its Windows 365 cloud PC concept, with AI agents, not AI PCs.\n\nGoing forward, Microsoft will want you not to buy and run your own applications, AI-infused or not, on a PC. They’ll want you to subscribe and run “your” AI-enabled programs on their cloud services.\n\nThis will not be cheap. Today, the bottom-end Windows 365 Cloud PC with 2 virtual CPUs, 4GB RAM, and 64GB of storage will cost you $28 a month. Good luck running Windows 11 on its own, never mind with any application, on 4 gigs of RAM. The absolute minimum for a useful cloud desktop with 8GB of RAM is $41. Add in AI functionality, an instance of Office, and you’re talking real money.\n\nFor companies, math is being reframed. Instead of comparing Windows 365 to the sunk cost of a once‑every‑five‑years PC purchase, vendors pitch it against the fully burdened price of securing, patching, and managing a distributed fleet in a hybrid‑work world. In that context, a per‑seat cloud desktop subscription stops looking like a weird outlier and just another SKU on the Microsoft subscription treadmill.\n\nI’m old enough to recall the transition from centralized computers you used via a terminal to the locally owned PC revolution. Then, we controlled the “horizontal and the vertical.” The AI-enabled cloud desktop puts Microsoft in charge of the entire application stack and your online identity.\n\nIt might be 2026, but Microsoft’s business model going forward looks a lot like the ones I saw in 1976. Maybe you’re comfortable with that. I’m not.\n\nMicrosoft frames Windows 365 as the sane way to keep corporate data off home PCs shared with kids and games, which is hard to argue with if you are a CSO signing audit reports. But the shift to cloud PCs plus on‑device AI also deepens lock‑in. Sure, you can run Windows 365 from anything, but it runs best when paired with Windows 11 hardware.\n\nThe old Windows desktop is dying. The 2026 twist is that its successor does not live only in Microsoft’s cloud. It also lives on your desk, in your laptop, and in the NPU you did not ask for, all stitched together into a Windows that is becoming less an operating system and more a metered utility.\n\nMe? You know my bias. If you want control over your privacy, your data, how much you’re paying for compute, and your PC, Linux is the best way forward.",

    "description": "Microsoft announced its new Maia 200 AI chip, taking aim at Amazon, Google, and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft (MSFT) is taking aim at cloud rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with the debut of its next-generation custom AI chip.\n\nCalled Maia 200, the chip will run in Microsoft’s own data centers before the company eventually makes it available to its wider customer base.\n\nLike Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium processors, Microsoft’s second AI chip is meant to give the Windows maker more flexibility when it comes to how it powers its AI services. By using its own internally developed chips, the company ensures it doesn’t have to rely solely on processors developed by Nvidia (NVDA) or AMD (AMD).\n\nGoogle and Amazon have been using their own custom chips for years, while Microsoft has been slower to adopt in-house AI silicon.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the Maia 200 will be built using TSMC’s 3-nanometer process and is designed to run large-scale AI workloads, while “delivering efficient performance per dollar.”\n\nThe Maia 200 will be built into large server racks with trays housing four chips each. Microsoft is also touting how quickly it can deploy the new chips into data centers, saying chips are installed and running AI models within days of parts arriving.\n\nGetting AI servers up and running quickly is an important aspect of the broader data center business. It’s not just a matter of keeping construction costs down, either. The longer a chip goes unused, the less cash it can generate for the company by running AI apps.\n\nThe Maia 200 adds to the growing competition Nvidia is facing from both AMD and its own customers. Microsoft’s Maia 100 already powers both the company’s and OpenAI’s (OPAI.PVT) AI models, while Google and Amazon both power their respective models and Anthropic’s (ANTH.PVT) models.\n\nAnd in November, The Information reported that Meta was talking to Google about using the search giant’s TPUs in its own data centers to power its AI services. That sent Nvidia stock down at the time, as Wall Street raised fears that the company was in danger of losing market share.\n\nNvidia’s stock price is up less than 1% since the start of the year.\n\nDespite the incursions into Nvidia’s lane, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the AI leader. Experts say that while the cloud company’s AI chips may function well for their own services, that’s not likely to translate to smaller third-party customers as easily.\n\nNvidia’s chips are also highly coveted because they are designed to be multipurpose, allowing companies to use them for a litany of applications and services.\n\nAs for performance, the Maia 200 won’t unseat Nvidia, but Microsoft claims it outpaces both Google’s latest TPU and Amazon’s newest Trainium chip in a number of categories. The Maia 200 also packs more high-bandwidth memory than Google’s or Amazon’s offerings, which is key to running high-powered AI applications.",

    "description": "Finland wants to lure American engineers and researchers with fast-track visas and good work-life balance as part of the global AI talent wars.",
    "fullText": "Finland is stepping into the tech talent wars.\n\nThe Nordic country is making a push for tech workers from abroad, with a particular focus on the US. The goal is to attract engineers and researchers working in deep tech, especially in the fields of quantum computing, AI, and health innovation.\n\nThe effort comes as competition for AI talent intensifies worldwide and tech workers in the US grapple with layoffs, burnout, and visa complications. KPMG's annual survey of global CEOs found that 70% were concerned about competition for AI talent. According to BCG's 2024 talent tracker report, the US remained dominant in attracting AI talent worldwide.\n\nAlready known for its tech scene, Finland, with a population of around 5.6 million, is positioning itself as a place where American tech workers can find a better work-life balance without sacrificing their careers — a notable contrast to the famous grindset of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"Of course, there might be long days once in a while, but it's such a high value, and it's also protected by law that you can't work more than an average of 40 hours per week,\" Laura Lindeman, head of the Work in Finland program, told Business Insider.\n\nShe said that even in the tech sector, when people leave work for the day, they really do leave. \"Offices are silent,\" she said. Employers in Finland, often ranked the happiest country in the world, also see the benefit of workers having lives outside work, she said, adding that the general sentiment is \"it narrows your thinking if you only work.\"\n\nFinland is working with more than 30 Finnish tech companies and universities to promote open roles to foreign workers. A preview of the job openings being promoted under the program includes roles with Oura Health (the company behind the Oura Ring), quantum computing firm QMill, and Aalto University.\n\nLindeman said Americans interested in working in Finland should consider reaching out to companies or universities, even if no open roles are listed, as some employers are open to creating positions for the right candidate. While the campaign emphasizes the US, it also targets talent from India, Brazil, and other parts of Europe.\n\nOnce candidates receive a job offer, they can apply for a specialist visa through Finland's Fast Track program. Approved applicants can receive a work-residence permit in as little as two weeks, with processing times averaging about 10 days, Lindeman said. Finland also offers integration programs to help newcomers settle in, and spouses of workers on specialist visas are eligible for work permits, she added.\n\nGovernment data suggests interest from Americans is already rising. Finland granted 60 specialist residence permits to US citizens in 2024 and 85 in 2025, according to Finnish immigration statistics. The number of residence permits granted to US researchers also increased, from 35 in 2024 to 46 in 2025.\n\nJordan Blake Banks, an American who moved to Finland in 2019 to pursue a master's degree through the Fulbright program, said the country offers plenty of benefits, from its forests to its emphasis on work-life balance. After finishing her degree, Banks stayed in Finland and eventually landed a job as a sustainability consultant at Deloitte in Helsinki.\n\n\"The general idea is that the company and the colleagues respect you as a person, and that you can have your free and personal time,\" she said, adding parents regularly leave work during the day for family obligations without stigma. Many Finns also take about a month of vacation during the summer, along with time off in the winter.\n\nBanks said salaries in Finland tend to be lower than in comparable roles in the US, but she thinks the gap is offset by more affordable essential services, including healthcare, education, and childcare.\n\nWhile learning Finnish isn't necessary for working in the country — Lindeman said English is widely used in the tech industry, and about 80% of Finns speak fluent English — Banks said not knowing the language can feel isolating in everyday life.\n\nShe enrolled in a four-month integration program run by the city, where she learned the language and eventually passed the national exam required to become a Finnish citizen. Banks also met her now-wife while living in Finland.\n\nOne cultural adjustment of living in Finland, she said, has been that the people tend to be more reserved than Americans. \"If you're coming from a very friendly culture or a very warm culture, I think that could be a shock,\" she said, adding she'd been able to use that to her advantage.\n\nBanks said speaking up helped her land a paid research position at her university. \"I was willing to make contact and be the brave American willing to ask for things,\" she said.",

For all the talk about AI supercharging talent, the reality is that talent markets remain as inefficient as ever, with employers struggling to find the right person for the right job, while employees remain disenchanted with their jobs and careers. Thanks to AI, hiring has become a noisy, crowded arms race of automation, often more inhumane for both job seekers and hiring managers. The result is an ecosystem where both sides are inundated, sometimes fooled, occasionally impressed, and mostly exhausted, with a rising crisis of trust.

    "fullText": "Southern state becoming ground zero in fight against rapid growth of facilities using huge amounts of energy and water\n\nLawmakers in several states are exploring passing laws that would put statewide bans in place on building new datacenters as the issue of the power-hungry facilities has moved to the center of economic and environmental concerns in the US.\n\nIn Georgia a state lawmaker has introduced a bill proposing what could become the first statewide moratorium on new datacenters in America. The bill is one of at least three statewide moratoriums on datacenters introduced in state legislatures in the last week as Maryland and Oklahoma lawmakers are also considering similar measures.\n\nBut it is Georgia that is quickly becoming ground zero in the fight against untrammelled growth of datacenters – which are notorious for using huge amounts of energy and water – as they power the emerging industry of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Georgia bill seeks to halt all such projects until March of next year “to allow state, county and municipal-level officials time to set necessary policies for regulating datacenters … which permanently alter the landscape of our state”, said bill sponsor state Democratic legislator Ruwa Romman.\n\nIt comes at a time when Georgia’s public service commission – the agency that oversees utility company Georgia Power – just last month approved a plan to provide 10 additional gigawatts of energy in the coming years. It was the largest amount of electricity sought for a multi-year plan in the commission’s history, was driven by datacenters and will mostly be supplied by fossil fuels.\n\nThe 10-gigawatt plan – enough to power about 8.3m homes – in turn comes as the Atlanta metro area led the nation in datacenter construction in 2024.\n\nThis accelerated growth has already led at least 10 Georgia municipalities to pass their own moratoriums on datacenter construction, with Atlanta suburb Roswell becoming the most recent earlier this month. Municipalities in at least 14 states have done the same, according to Tech Policy Press.\n\nBernie Sanders, the Vermont independent democratic socialist senator, proposed a national moratorium last month.\n\n“What we’re seeing is, as communities are learning more about this aggressive industry’s presence … [they] want to have time to thoroughly investigate all potential harms,” said Seth Gladstone, spokesperson for Food and Water Watch.\n\nThe rampant development of datacenters to power AI raises several concerns for residents and activists alike. One is their impact on the cost of electricity. “In the public’s mind, datacenters and utility bills are inextricably linked,” said Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, an organization that works on lowering utility bills and involving communities in decisions about energy.\n\nHua noted that the relationship between the two varies, depending on each state’s market and regulatory system. In Georgia, he said, the Georgia Power utility company makes profit off new capital investments – so it has incentive to keep building new power plants. This approach has led Georgia’s rates to go up by a third in the last several years alone. Meanwhile, he said, the power company doesn’t have incentive to make the electrical grid more efficient – which “could actually lower prices”, Hua said.\n\nBut datacenter concerns in Georgia also include water use and lost tax revenue. Republicans in the state legislature have introduced bills this year to protect consumers from increases in their utility bills and to end tax breaks for the centers. A Democrat has proposed that datacenters make public how much energy and water they use each year.\n\nRomman is also running for governor. If elected, she would become the first Palestinian American elected to statewide office in Georgia and break the near quarter-century hold Republicans have on the office.\n\nHer bill, HB 1012, has a Republican co-sponsor in state representative Jordan Ridley, who said he signed onto the measure because he wanted to give local governments time to develop zoning regulations on datacenters, since “it seems like they’re being built across the state”.\n\n“Every local government has zoning codes and … they need public input. That takes time,” Ridley said. At the same time, Ridley added, “datacenters … provide tax revenue and high-paying jobs. I’m not against datacenters.”\n\nRomman’s bill is not just a policy proposal; it’s also a political one. In a statement, she wrote that the moratorium “would provide time for Georgians to vote on the majority of the Public Service Commission seats who make final decisions on energy-related projects”.\n\nGeorgia is one of 10 states that elect their utility regulators. Voters in the state elected progressive Democrats Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard to the five-member commission in November, leading the agency to lose its all-Republican makeup for the first time in nearly two decades. Another seat is up for a vote this November.\n\nThe calculus: if the commission becomes majority-Democratic, it will no longer give a rubber stamp to electricity demands from Georgia Power driven by tech companies seeking to build datacenters.\n\nHubbard, now in his new position, recently wrote an editorial asserting that Georgia voters “see data centers receiving tax breaks as their power bills go up. They see local communities struggle with competition for water supplies and high voltage transmission lines that reduce property values. And they see how the PSC approved every request placed before it by the monopoly electric utility.\n\n“This is why opposition to data centers is growing in Georgia; because Georgians oppose being treated as collateral damage by the unregulated growth of data centers that will push their power bills even higher.”\n\nThere’s another political implication to Romman’s bill. Paul Glaze, spokesperson for Georgia Conservation Voters, said if the bill crosses from the House to the Senate, “it may be a preview of the potential general election” later this year.\n\n“The question is, in communities where datacenters are coming, who are voters going to trust to have their back?” Glaze said. “Anyone serious about statewide office should have a clear position on this.”",

These negotiations are among the first settlements in lawsuits that accuse AI tools of contributing to mental health crises and suicides among teenagers.",

    "fullText": "Tony Stark relied on his ultra-polished, tech-heavy \"Iron Man\" suit to achieve his superhero feats.\n\nJack Buser, the global director for games at Google Cloud, thinks AI will help game developers in the same way.\n\n\"There will always be holdouts, just like every technological revolution, but it's becoming so common now,\" Buser told Business Insider. \"We're seeing a major shift.\"\n\nBuser and other tech industry leaders have said that implementing AI could transform how people work. In the gaming industry, the tech could help streamline operations, resulting in cost cuts, faster production times, or help developers tackle an array of tasks.\n\n\"It's like the Iron Man suit of armor, right? It's still you inside the suit of armor, but you're suddenly able to do things that you couldn't do before,\" Buser said. \"If you armor everybody up in your studio with suits that allow them to work more quickly and remove the drudgery, that tends to be well received after it's been implemented.\"\n\nBuser urged executives at studios and companies to take the lead by giving developers the necessary tools.\n\n\"If you're the CTO of a games company, make that suit of armor available. Make sure that it's safe. Make sure that you take the time to work with people inside your company so that they can understand what the technology can and can't do, and what your intentions for the technology are and what they are not,\" Buser said.\n\n\"It has as much to do with getting these tools up and running in your development pipelines as it does working culturally with your company to help it make that transformation,\" he added.\n\nGetting comfortable with AI, he said, shouldn't be confined to developers alone.\n\n\"It can be tricky at the executive level. You don't have a crystal ball of where this is all going,\" he said. \"It takes getting your hands dirty, experimenting with the technology, seeing what it does and what it doesn't do.\"\n\nMany global industries are undergoing a technological shift driven by advances in AI. Companies are increasingly adopting the tech in their workflows, which some critics say could diminish job prospects for humans. Supporters argue it's a powerful tool that can help workers do their jobs better and faster.\n\nFor Buser, who has worked in the gaming industry for 30 years, AI has created an opportunity to push the boundaries of player experiences. At Google, that means embracing the era of \"living games.\"\n\nThe live games model, in which developers continue to add new content to a game after its initial release, is already common. AI, however, could make living games more adaptable, personalized, and immersive. The AI could also shorten update turnaround time, making the transition for players more seamless.\n\n\"As we look forward, we're looking at things like real-time game experiences,\" Buser said.\n\nFor now, though, the gaming industry will be focused on scaling and normalizing the tech.\n\n\"2026 is where companies start to scale these efforts,\" Buser said. \"Game developers who were using AI in one or two parts of their development workflow will suddenly be using it throughout their workflow. You'll start to see games that are using multiple AI-based features that are affecting the player experience.\"",

    "description": "Synthesia just raised a $200 million Series E funding round and is now valued at $4 billion. CEO Victor Riparbelli shares his daily routine.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Victor Riparbelli, the CEO of AI video platform Synthesia. On Monday, the company announced a $200 million Series E funding round led by Google Ventures. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI founded Synthesia in 2017, and it's now a $4 billion unicorn.\n\nThe platform allows businesses to leverage generative AI to create videos for a range of corporate use cases, such as reimagining training videos, generating AI avatars of company executives to deliver internal or external messages, or dubbing webinars into dozens of languages.\n\nTo keep myself going all day, I rely on a few daily indulgences and productivity hacks.\n\nFirst and foremost, my bike. Unless the weather is terrible, I prefer to bike to and from the office most days. That's my most important ritual.\n\nAlso, coffee breaks. If I'm tired or in a bad mood, I'll go for a 15-minute walk and get an extra nice coffee at Blank Street.\n\nMy biggest non-negotiable indulgence is music. I love underground music and listen to it whenever I'm not in a meeting.\n\nI wish I were one of those 5 a.m. people, but I get up at 8 a.m., shower, and head straight to the office.\n\nI try not to check my phone before I leave my apartment, and I'm successful about 75% of the time.\n\nOnce I sit down at work, I usually go through my phone — messages, emails, and anything that came in overnight. I try to keep my early mornings free of meetings, so I have time to process things. That's when I feel the most creative, and it's when I prefer to do deep work. It's not always possible since we work across US time zones, but I generally try to protect that time. That deep-work window usually runs from around 9:30 a.m. until lunch at noon.\n\nDuring that time, I'm doing a mix of things: interviews, a lot of product work, and internal thinking. I'm still very involved in product and like to stay close to the details, even though that gets harder as the company grows. I focus on specific areas where I think my input is most valuable and try to go deep there.\n\nA big part of that time is also spent reading Slack. I make a real effort to read almost everything every day. I skim most of it, and I don't react to everything, but spending half an hour going through Slack is one of the best ways for me to understand what's actually happening across the company.\n\nAll internal communication happens on Slack — it's not a policy, it's just how the company operates. No one emails internally. For external communication, I probably split my time between email and WhatsApp, with a strong preference for WhatsApp and instant messaging. It really depends on the relationship.\n\nI usually have either a Joe & The Juice sandwich — specifically the club sandwich — or a salad. I actually used to work at Joe & The Juice early on, so I've been eating it for a long time and still love it.\n\nI don't really take time for lunch. I usually eat on the go or at my desk, and I'm typically done by around 12:30 p.m.\n\nI switch between New York and London, and when I'm based in London, the US starts to wake up in the second half of my day, so my calendar fills up with more international meetings.\n\nThe work itself stays fairly consistent: a lot of product, which I'm very involved in, as well as hiring, and external-facing work.\n\nMy cofounder, Steffen Tjerrild, now chief operating officer, and I split the business in half. I run product, technology, and marketing, while he oversees finance, operations, and sales. In those areas, I'm typically only involved at the VP level, depending on the situation. On my side of the business, I'm involved at the director level and above, though I'll sometimes go deeper when it makes sense.\n\nI have an assistant who helps manage my schedule, including some overlap with my personal life. I also try to talk to at least one user or customer every week because staying close to how people actually use the product is important to me. That, along with internal meetings, makes up most of the rest of my day. I still meet with people beyond my direct reports, often through skip-level conversations.\n\nFor example, I'll talk with our video team, who use our product for marketing, or with a sales development representative to understand what's working and what isn't. It's one of the best ways for me to stay connected to what's really happening across the company.\n\nI usually leave the office around 7 or 8 p.m. Three or four nights a week, I go to the gym, then head home and unwind. About half the time, I'll work another hour or two later in the evening.\n\nDinner is usually quick. I live alone and mostly order in, though I'll occasionally cook eggs with bacon and avocado. When I order food, it's often something simple like chicken and fries. I try to eat fairly healthy and avoid eating too late because it has a big impact on my energy, especially since I'm a bad sleeper.\n\nAt night, if I'm not working, I'm usually reading or making music. I don't watch much TV, but I love serious sci-fi films like \"Interstellar\" and \"Arrival\" and Stanley Kubrick movies like \"A Clockwork Orange.\"\n\nI used to read a lot of business books. \"Zero to One\" by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters, and \"The Black Swan\" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb were especially influential. These days, I read a mix of books and online content and spend a lot of time watching videos about technology, psychology, philosophy, and politics.\n\nI'm a terrible sleeper. The only hack that I found is that I fall asleep to podcasts or YouTube videos.\n\nI like to find ones that are interesting enough that they catch my attention — topics like physics or philosophy — but not important enough to me that I actually really want to listen to them.\n\nThen I put a sleep timer on for half an hour — and that usually knocks me out.",

    "description": "Regulators said the company’s lack of controls had led to the widespread use of deepfakes created with the chatbot Grok.",
    "fullText": "European Union regulators on Monday announced an investigation of Elon Musk’s social media platform X after the authorities said that it had failed to stop the spread of sexualized images generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe inquiry is likely to escalate a confrontation between Europe and the United States over the regulation of online content. Mr. Musk and his allies in the Trump administration have sharply criticized European Union internet regulations as an attack on free speech and American companies.\n\nThe European authorities said that X was being investigated for possible violation of the Digital Services Act, alleging that the company had not properly addressed the “systemic risks” of integrating the A.I. chatbot Grok into its service. Starting in late December, sexually explicit images generated by Grok, including of children, flooded the service, drawing worldwide criticism from victims and regulators.\n\nMr. Musk was facing mounting scrutiny in Europe even before this latest Grok controversy. Last month, X was fined 120 million euros, or about $140 million, for violating Digital Services Act rules around deceptive design, advertising transparency and data sharing with outside researchers.\n\nThe European authorities have another investigation underway about X’s recommender algorithm and policies for preventing the spread of illicit content.\n\n“Nonconsensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,” Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission executive vice president who oversees enforcement of the Digital Service Act, said in a statement. “We will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the D.S.A., or whether it treated rights of European citizens — including those of women and children — as collateral damage of its service.”\n\nThe European Commission, the executive body for the 27-nation European Union, did not give a timeline for the investigation, but said that it had the authority to order X to make changes during the inquiry in the “absence of meaningful adjustments” to the service.\n\nA spokeswoman for X referred to a previous statement the company had made about Grok. “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity and unwanted sexual content,” the statement said.\n\nThe latest investigation illustrates a growing divide between the European Union and the United States over free speech and regulation of the internet. European officials argue that the lack of safeguards on platforms like X has allowed hate speech, misogyny and violent content to flourish online. Mr. Musk and the Trump administration have said efforts to force the companies to more proactively police the services amounts to censorship.\n\nThe Digital Services Act, passed in 2022, requires companies to meaningfully address the spread of illegal content, the definition of which varies from country to country in the European Union. It can include material that targets individuals based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or religion.\n\nEuropean regulators said that the integration of Grok into X exposed “citizens in the E.U. to serious harm.” The British authorities are also investigating the issue.\n\nThe problems began last month. In response to simple user prompts on X, the chatbot automatically created and publicly posted manipulated photographs of real people, including children, to remove their clothes, put them in skimpy clothing or pose them in sexualized situations.\n\nAs criticism grew, X limited Grok’s A.I. image creation to users who paid for premium features, which reduced the number of images. X later expanded those guardrails, saying that it would no longer allow anyone to prompt Grok’s X account for “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.”\n\nEuropean Union regulators said that they would take X’s policy changes into account during the investigation.",

    "fullText": "I’ve been a games journalist since 2007, but still there isn’t much video games coverage that feels like it’s specifically for people like me. So I’m creating a home for it: Mothership\n\nWhether you’re reading about the impending AI bubble bursting or about the video game industry’s mass layoffs and cancelled projects, 2026 does not feel like a hopeful time for gaming. What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is using video game memes as ICE recruitment tools, and game studios are backing away from diversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.\n\nThe manosphere is back, and we’ve lost mainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.\n\nEverything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry that Gamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).\n\nAfter all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. The GDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025 found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with 75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.\n\nMore people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.\n\nI have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.\n\nBut I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.\n\nLater, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.\n\nBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent a mass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.\n\nAnother one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No, we should do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.\n\nSix months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such as Defector, the Flytrap, and Aftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (I knew the readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people who don’t fit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s. We want to serve this audience well.\n\nI believe our website is a necessity in our current political climate. It should have existed before, when I and millions of other girls who grew up playing games were made to feel out of place by media and advertising that was laser-focused on teenage boys. But it’s not too late for me to make sure it exists now.",

    "fullText": "Synthesia makes digital presenters for clients to use in corporate videos and counts 70% of FTSE 100 as customers\n\nA British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.\n\nSynthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.\n\nOn Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.\n\nSynthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.\n\nThe company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nThe startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.\n\nSynthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”\n\nLast year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.\n\n“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.\n\nSynthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.\n\nThe $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.\n\nSynthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.\n\nLast year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, in a speech this month Khan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.\n\nTjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.",

    "fullText": "Investigation comes after Elon Musk’s firm sparked outrage by allowing users to ‘strip’ photos of women and children\n\nThe European Commission has launched an investigation into Elon Musk’s X over the production of sexually explicit images and the spreading of possible child sexual abuse material by the platform’s AI chatbot feature, Grok.\n\nThe formal inquiry, launched on Monday, also extends an investigation into X’s recommender systems, algorithms that help users discover new content.\n\nGrok has sparked international outrage by allowing users to digitally strip women and children and put them into provocative poses. Grok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appeared to depict children, according to researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate.\n\nThe commission said its new investigation would “assess whether the company properly assessed and mitigated risks” stemming from Grok’s functionalities in the EU, including risks on the sharing of illegal content such as manipulated sexually explicit images and “content that may amount to” child sexual abuse material.\n\nThe investigation is launched under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), a relatively new piece of legislation that is intended to protect internet users from a wide range of harms.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, an official said the commission had not been convinced by mitigating measures put in place by X to remedy the issue. EU officials are investigating whether X has systems to mitigate risks properly.\n\nAnnouncing the investigation, Henna Virkkunen, the commission’s top official for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said: “Non-consensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation. With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens – including those of women and children – as collateral damage of its service.”\n\nRegina Doherty, an Irish MEP, said she welcomed the formal investigation. “When credible reports emerge of AI systems being used in ways that harm women and children, it is essential that EU law is examined and enforced without delay,” Doherty said.\n\nIn response to the investigation, X provided a link to a statement it published on 14 January: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.”",

    "fullText": "Survey reveals ‘mismatched AI expectations’ between views of employers and staff over impact on careers\n\nAI is hitting UK harder than other big economies, study finds\n\nMore than a quarter (27%) of UK workers are worried their jobs could disappear in the next five years as a result of AI, according to a survey of thousands of employees.\n\nTwo-thirds (66%) of UK employers reported having invested in AI in the past 12 months, according to the international recruitment company Randstad’s annual review of the world of work, while more than half (56%) of workers said more companies were encouraging the use of AI tools in the workplace.\n\nThis was leading to “mismatched AI expectations” between the views of employees and their employers over the impact of AI on jobs, according to Randstad’s poll of 27,000 workers and 1,225 organisations across 35 countries. Just under half (45%) of UK office workers surveyed believed AI would benefit companies more than employees.\n\nYounger workers, particularly those belonging to gen Z – born between 1997 and 2012 – were the most concerned about the impact of AI and their ability to adapt, while baby boomers – born in the postwar years between 1946 and 1964 and nearing the end of their careers – showed greater self-assurance.\n\nHigher levels of concern expressed by young people entering the workforce could stem from the decision of many business leaders, highlighted by separate research, to invest in AI to plug skills gaps through automation instead of training up new hires. This is adding to the challenges facing younger workers at a time when the labour market is cooling.\n\nIncreased use of AI and automation in businesses is increasingly replacing “low-complexity, transactional roles”, the survey showed, which could help to address labour shortages in certain industries through boosting productivity.\n\nAbout half (55%) of UK workers surveyed said AI had made a positive impact on their productivity, a view echoed by employers.\n\n“AI is not a rival to labour; it should be seen as key to augmenting tasks and highlighting the importance of roles that only people can do,” said Sander van ‘t Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad.\n\n“We must close the ‘AI reality gap’. While businesses race to embrace a new way of working, our data shows that one in five talent believe AI will have a limited impact on their tasks and nearly half perceive it as more beneficial to the company than themselves. This leaves them vulnerable in both their careers and the value they can add to organisations.”\n\nThe pace of adoption of AI in the workplace is also having an impact on workers around the world. Four in five workers believe AI will affect their daily work tasks, while the survey found that job vacancies requiring “AI agent” skills had risen by 1,587% over the past year.\n\nJamie Dimon, the boss of the US bank JP Morgan, told an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk “civil unrest”.",

    "fullText": "Britain is losing more jobs than it creates owing to artificial intelligence, Morgan Stanley research suggests\n\nMore than a quarter of Britons fear losing job to AI in next five years\n\nThe UK is losing more jobs than it is creating because of artificial intelligence and is being hit harder than rival large economies, new research suggests.\n\nBritish companies reported that AI had resulted in net job losses over the past 12 months, down 8% – the highest rate among other leading economies including the US, Japan, Germany and Australia, according to a study by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe research, which was shared with Bloomberg, surveyed companies using AI for at least a year across five industries: consumer staples and retail, real estate, transport, healthcare equipment and cars.\n\nIt found that British businesses reported an average 11.5% increase in productivity aided by AI. US businesses reported similar gains, but created more jobs than they cut.\n\nIt suggests UK workers are being hit particularly hard by the rise of AI, as higher costs and taxes also weigh on the job market.\n\nUnemployment is at a four-year high, as rises in the minimum wage and employer national insurance contributions squeeze hiring.\n\nMore than a quarter of UK workers are now worried their jobs could disappear completely in the next five years due to AI, a survey by the international recruitment company Randstad found.\n\nYounger workers, particularly those in gen Z, were most concerned about the impact of AI and their ability to adapt, while baby boomers – born in the postwar years between 1946 and 1964 and nearing the end of their careers – showed greater self-assurance.\n\nThe businesses surveyed by Morgan Stanley said they were most likely to cut early-career jobs, requiring two to five years of experience in the UK.\n\nEarlier this month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warned that AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nIn his annual Mansion House speech, Khan said London is “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.\n\nKhan argued that “we have a moral, social and economic duty to act” to ensure that new jobs are created to replace those that will disappear, with entry-level and junior jobs the first to go.\n\nLast week Jamie Dimon, the boss of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.",

I was the AI expert, and they described the problem, and I said, “Don’t use AI.” This is my value add.\n\nLast year, I went through some exercises to clarify what I do for clients. I ended up with descriptions of various lengths, but still felt like I needed something shorter and more generic. Then it hit me – I’m an AI/ML Success Architect!\n\nTo my surprise, a Google search for the exact term yielded zero results, so I quickly changed my website title to claim it. Now, it’s time to define the title in more detail.\n\nMy commitment to AI/ML success and to serving people and causes I care about is a large part of why I work independently rather than as an employee. It makes it easier to say no to unnecessary projects, and avoid going down the path of reluctant data engineering.\n\nMy current LinkedIn tagline is “helping climate tech founders ship AI/ML solutions that support multi-million dollar growth goals”. This means my typical leads have a low chance of success, as more than 90% of startups and 80% of AI/ML projects fail.

    "fullText": "Can AI feel anything at all? Anthropic's in-house philosopher says the answer isn't settled.\n\nAmanda Askell, who works on shaping Claude's behavior, said in an episode of the \"Hard Fork\" podcast published Saturday that the debate over AI consciousness remains difficult.\n\n\"Maybe you need a nervous system to be able to feel things, but maybe you don't,\" Askell said. \"The problem of consciousness genuinely is hard,\" she added.\n\nLarge language models are trained on vast amounts of human-written text, material filled with descriptions of various emotions and inner experience. Because of that, Askell said she is \"more inclined\" to believe that models are \"feeling things.\"\n\nWhen humans get a coding problem wrong, they often express annoyance or frustration. It \"makes sense\" that models trained on those conversations may mirror that reaction, Askell explained.\n\nAskell added that scientists still don't know what gives rise to sentience or self-awareness — whether it requires biology, evolution, or something else entirely.\n\n\"Maybe it is the case that actually sufficiently large neural networks can start to kind of emulate these things,\" she said, referring to consciousness.\n\nAskell also said that models are continuously learning about themselves, and she voiced concern about how AI models are learning from the internet. Models are constantly exposed to criticism about being unhelpful or failing at tasks, she said.\n\n\"If you were a kid, this would give you kind of anxiety,\" she said.\n\n\"If I read the internet right now and I was a model, I might be like, I don't feel that loved,\" she added.\n\nTech leaders remain divided over whether AI has consciousness.\n\nMicrosoft's AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, has taken a firm stance against that idea. He said in an interview with WIRED published in September that the industry must be clear that AI is designed to serve humans, not develop its own will or desires.\n\n\"If AI has a sort of sense of itself, if it has its own motivations and its own desires and its own goals — that starts to seem like an independent being rather than something that is in service to humans,\" he said. \"That's so dangerous and so misguided that we need to take a declarative position against it right now.\"\n\nHe added that AI's increasingly convincing responses amount to \"mimicry\" rather than genuine consciousness.\n\nOthers see the issue less definitively. Google DeepMind's principal scientist, Murray Shanahan, said the industry might need to rethink the language used to describe consciousness itself.\n\n\"Maybe we need to bend or break the vocabulary of consciousness to fit these new systems,\" Shanahan said in an episode of the Google DeepMind podcast published in April.",

    "title": "A developer teamed up with Claude to create Elo programming language",
    "description": "feature: Bernard Lambeau, the human half of a pair programming team, explains how he's using AI",
    "fullText": "feature Bernard Lambeau, a Belgium-based software developer and founder of several technology companies, created a programming language called Elo with the help of Anthropic's Claude Code.\n\nStarting on December 25, 2025, he published a series of posts about the project. The first post names Claude as a co-author.\n\n\"In roughly 24 hours of collaboration, we built a complete expression language with a parser, type system, three compilers, a standard library, a CLI tool, and a documentation website. Not bad for a day's work,” Lambeau and Claude wrote.\n\n\"Elo isn't just a demonstration that AI can write code. It's a demonstration that humans and AI can build together – each contributing what they do best,” they added.\n\nAs an expression language that compiles to JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL, Elo is intended as a portable way to handle form validation, e-commerce order processing, and subscription logic.\n\nLambeau, founder and CTO of Klaro Cards and CEO of app consultancy Enspirit, is not the first to develop a programming language with the help of AI.\n\nSteve Klabnik performed a similar feat last year with the Rue programming language. In September 2025, Geoffrey Huntley enlisted Claude to write a programming language called Cursed. And before that, Avital Tamir published a Claude-authored repo for the Server programming language, with the caveat that the code is not intended for actual use.\n\nClaude Code isn't the only AI-assisted programming method having a moment. AI biz Cursor created a rudimentary browser using OpenAI's GPT-5.2. And developer Ola Prøis used Cursor, powered by Claude, to create a Rust-based text editor called Ferrite.\n\nClaude users generally acknowledge that their pair partner makes mistakes. But those committed to AI assistance find it worthwhile to clean up after their helper.\n\n\"Claude Code knows almost every tech stack (and can search the web), knows the Linux commands that matter (search code, search & replace, compile, test, etc.), and does that 10x faster than I can do myself,\" Lambeau told The Register in an email interview.\n\nClaude, he said, allows him to use technology he hasn't mastered.\n\n\"I was already a full-stack developer (on languages, frameworks & reusable libraries I knew); I'm now a full-stack++ dev because I can also use languages, frameworks, and reusable libraries I barely know, if at all,\" he explained.\n\n\"Claude Code falls short if you don't have a great methodology. It needs feedback loops to work fine; otherwise, it derails. One possible feedback loop is a human reviewing code and testing manually. But there's a better/complementary approach if you want it to work autonomously. On both Elo and Bmg.js, I've started by making sure the testing methodology was effective and scientifically sound. Claude writes the tests, executes them, discovers where it's wrong, and corrects itself. Impressive.\"\n\nLambeau said he still needs to review some of Claude's output.\n\n\"But if I read the tests, agree with them, and can check myself that they run fine, I'm 95 percent sure it's already correct as a black box (not even reading the code),\" he explained. \"Then I can check the architecture and code quality as a white box by having a general look at the code, but I don't have to understand every detail.\"\n\nNotably, Lambeau documented the series of prompts he used to create the language. The repo includes more than 100 tasks used to direct the AI model. In addition, Lambeau has published a video that describes his AI pair programming process.\n\n\"I started in a setting where Claude Code asked for permissions every 20 seconds and I was checking everything it did,\" Lambeau explained. \"After a few successes, I quickly set up safe environments to be able to let Claude Code run in full autonomy (isolated computer & isolated Linux user, or running in a Docker image).\"\n\nLambeau said he still uses plan mode for complex tasks that require conversation with Claude.\n\n\"I review the plan, make sure we have a test strategy that's sound, then switch Claude to autonomous mode and look at the tests, code & results afterward,\" he said. \"That's very similar to a lead-dev/CTO + QA role, btw; it's just much faster than with human devs.\"\n\nLambeau, who has a PhD in software engineering and 30 years of experience as a developer, said both experts and novices can benefit from Claude Code, though he added that a service like Lovable might be more approachable for those not already acclimated to the command line.\n\n\"Now, when it comes to real software/product engineering, I think Claude Code requires experts (so far),\" he said. \"You still need to guide it a lot to keep the quality high enough. You need very strong expertise to do it effectively. Currently (Claude will still improve a lot), if you don't have the expertise, you certainly end up with a big mess of unmaintainable code.\"\n\nMany developers have said as much about AI tools. They're more useful as an amplifier of expertise than as a replacement for it. The situation is analogous to the introduction of sequencing software, digital synthesizers, and drum machines half a century ago. These tools enabled a lot of people who weren't great musicians to make music. But they didn't instill musical skill, and they produced the most interesting work in the hands of practiced musicians.\n\nThe cost to do this, Lambeau said, has been a Claude Max subscription that he purchased in December for €180 a month. In that time, he says, he wrote Elo (https://elo-lang.org), completed Bmg.js (https://github.com/enspirit/bmg.js), completed Bmg's documentation (https://www.relational-algebra.dev), and created the first version of the Try page (https://www.relational-algebra.dev/try).\n\n\"It's all personal research and open-source projects,\" he said. \"It would have required several weeks to do the same manually myself, and several months to ask another developer to do it. The cost would be mostly because of the scientific & technical knowledge transfer about the data language I envision. Strangely enough, it's very cheap with Claude Code. There's something true about the fact that those LLMs have a PhD.\"\n\nLambeau explained that Elo isn't just a way to test Claude Code. He also sees it as an extension of his academic work in software engineering and his personal interest in the Relational Model – he's served as a lecturer for database courses at Belgium’s UCLouvain.\n\n\"I'm absolutely convinced that we need better/safer/simpler programming languages inside no-code tools and when interconnecting them (e.g. Zapier, Make, n8n, etc.),\" he said. \"Mainstream programming languages are very complex, error-prone, sometimes dangerous, and the programs are difficult to review for non-experts.\"\n\n\"More importantly, they are cumbersome to use for even simple data tasks. I mean, even validating the schema and constraints of a data file at runtime tends to be a nightmare in existing languages. It's not built-in in any mainstream language; you immediately need validation libraries; most of them are limited in what they can easily check, so you need to add dedicated boilerplate code.\"\n\nIn a world where non-technical people will have the opportunity to write untrustworthy code with the help of AI, he said, we need to be able to run that code safely.\n\n\"Elo aims at providing a safe & simple alternative,\" he said. \"It will be a limited language (non-Turing-complete, as we say) but super safe & simple, and usable in 80 percent of common data use cases. The very first no-code tool to integrate it will be Klaro Cards, of course.\" ®",

    "title": "Interest in Law School Is Surging. A.I. Makes the Payoff Less Certain",
    "description": "The number of applicants has risen more than 40 percent over the last two years, despite new limits on student loans and uncertainty over how artificial intelligence will affect legal work.",
    "fullText": "For decades, the American law school has served as a popular hedge against a cooling economy. When the “Help Wanted” signs disappear, the “J.D.” applications surge.\n\nThat’s what is happening now. The number of U.S. law school applicants for the 2026 cycle is up an estimated 17 percent from last year, according to data from the American Bar Association compiled by the Law School Admission Council. That figure is a staggering 44 percent increase from just two years ago.\n\nBut for this new wave of aspiring lawyers, the safety of the ivory tower comes with a steep entry fee and a shifting floor. Between new federal loan caps and the looming shadow of generative artificial intelligence, the legal profession’s newest recruits are walking into a high-stakes gamble that looks very different from the one their predecessors lost after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nEnrollment rose to 52,404 by 2010, a 7 percent jump from three years earlier. Many of those students didn’t enter the legal careers they may have envisioned; about half of 2011 law school graduates were not working in full-time jobs that required a law degree within a year of graduation.\n\nThe job prospects for lawyers have since greatly improved, with more than 80 percent of students who graduated in 2023 and 2024 working in jobs that require their legal credentials within a year, according to the American Bar Association.\n\nBut the flocks of people applying to law school face new risks.\n\nNew limits on student loans that go into effect this year could make financing a degree more expensive. And artificial intelligence threatens to bring major changes to the industry, affecting which jobs are available and how much they pay.\n\n“It’s too early to know how things will change,” said Kellye Testy, the executive director of the Association of American Law Schools, which has more than 170 members.\n\n“Some worry that A.I. will decrease demand for lawyers,” she said, adding that eventually the technology could have a more direct role in legal work. “That could matter in three years,” she said.\n\nIn 1985, going to law school at a private university cost on average about $8,000 a year, according to the Law School Admission Council. Now the average cost is about $60,000 a year at private universities — and a still hefty $32,000 a year at public ones. At some law schools, tuition and annual living expenses exceed $110,000.\n\nFinancing that big bill is about to get more expensive. Stricter limits on student loans, which were passed as part of President Trump’s tax and spending law last year, go into effect in July. They impose a yearly limit of $50,000 for students seeking professional degrees, with a $200,000 lifetime cap.\n\nAlternative financing options like private loans can have higher interest rates and more restrictions than federal direct loans, said Susan Bogart, director of financial aid for Penn State Dickinson Law, where the cost of attendance will be about $90,000, according to its website.\n\nDuring a surge of applications, law schools may also pull back on the discounts they offered to entice promising students when applicants were scarce.\n\nIt can be difficult to estimate how well the investment in a law degree will pay off.\n\nLaw students often anticipate landing high-paying legal jobs in private law firms or corporations, where the entry-level salary can be around $225,000, according to the National Association for Law Placement. But the median starting salary for public service lawyers, for example, is around $65,000 — which can make monthly student loan payments more of a stretch.\n\nIn 2023, Stanford researchers, in collaboration with a legal technology company, announced that ChatGPT had passed the bar exam, scoring in the 90th percentile.\n\nThat claim, which other researchers later challenged, set off a wave of speculation about how A.I. would affect lawyers. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimated that year that the technology could automate 44 percent of legal work.\n\nBut it’s still unclear how new A.I. tools for lawyers, including Thomson Reuters’s CoCounsel and the A.I. legal assistant Harvey, will affect the availability of legal jobs or how much they pay.\n\nThe tools can make routine legal tasks, including document review and case research, faster. (Lawyers who have tried to use A.I. for more than that have sometimes been embarrassed by A.I.-generated briefs that cite made-up court cases.)\n\n“It’s really good at sifting through massive amounts of information and trying to pare that down a little bit,” Michael Kohagen, a lawyer in the mergers-and-acquisitions practice at WyrickRobbins, a law firm in Raleigh, N.C., told the “I Am the Law” podcast.\n\nSo far, more efficient grunt work hasn’t stopped firms from hiring new lawyers: Law students who graduated in 2024 had the highest employment rate ever, according to the National Association for Law Placement. More than 90 percent found jobs.\n\nThings could get dicier: The association also reported that law firms had hired fewer summer associates in 2024 and 2025, which it said suggested “that there will be fewer graduates employed by large firms over the next few years.”\n\nTesty said that it was possible A.I. could shrink job openings, but that it was also possible it could expand what lawyers do. “It could be used to streamline small disputes in court, for example,” she said.\n\nNeither the growing expense nor potential changes to the industry are deterring students like London Cooper, who is a political science major in her final year at Dillard University in New Orleans and plans to pursue a law degree.\n\nCooper has applied to five law schools, after carefully checking into how to afford the cost of the degree.\n\n“I factored so many things in, even looking at projected salaries for starting lawyers,” she said. But A.I. wasn’t part of her calculations. Instead, she’s banking on the more timeless appeal of a legal education.\n\n“I feel like law is one area where you can see how society really runs,” she said.\n\nIt was a different kind of Davos. At the opening ceremony, Larry Fink, an interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum, took aim at the institution itself, saying it “can’t remain an echo chamber.” Climate change, once a central topic of discussion of the annual gathering, retreated to the sidelines, and where there was once talk of a shared political and economic future, President Trump instead made a laundry list of threats against other nations. Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada received a standing ovation after describing the end of Pax Americana.\n\nThe future of Greenland remains uncertain. Trump has walked back threats to use military force or tariffs to acquire Greenland and said Wednesday that he had reached a deal with NATO over the autonomous Danish territory. Proposals under discussion are said to include giving the United States a sovereign claim to its bases in Greenland and checking Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic.\n\nTikTok struck a deal for a U.S. entity. Its U.S. operations will be managed by a group of non-Chinese investors — including Oracle, the Emirati investment firm MGX and Silver Lake — which will own 80 percent of the new venture. The announcement ends a legal saga over the app’s future in the United States after a 2024 law required it to be separated from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, but some experts say the deal does not resolve concerns that China could still influence the new entity.\n\nTrump sued JPMorgan Chase over “debanking” claims. The $5 billion lawsuit, which also names Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s C.E.O., as a defendant, contends that the bank stopped doing business with Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nOther big deals: Netflix converted its $83 billion bid for large parts of Warner Bros. Discovery into an all-cash offer. Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of Trump’s effort to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed. And natural gas prices spiked ahead of a powerful winter storm.\n\nOver the next few days, early-action applicants to Virginia Tech will find out whether they’ve been admitted to the school. That’s more than a month sooner than last year — and the university says A.I. is to thank.\n\nVirginia Tech is among the first schools to use A.I. to assess college applications, of which it received 58,000 for the 2026-27 school year.\n\nPreviously, essays were reviewed by two human readers, plus a third if the scores differed significantly. This year, each essay got one initial score from an A.I. tool and one from a human, then a third read from a human as needed. The school made the change after three years of testing.\n\nJuan Espinoza, the vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech, estimates it saved his department more than 8,000 hours of work. DealBook’s Sarah Kessler talked with him about the process. The interview has been condensed and edited.\n\nHow did you make the decision to incorporate A.I. into admissions?\n\nWe were getting our decision back to students much later than other colleges and universities. So we knew we needed to accelerate the review process, but we didn’t want to get rid of the essay.\n\nLouis Hickman, an assistant professor who studies the intersection of technology and work, reached out and said: “Hey, I’ve done a lot of research on artificial intelligence, and I feel like we can help. Would you be willing to partner, just for research purposes?”\n\nAfter a third year of running it in the background, he was able to show with high confidence that the A.I. tool was operating just as strongly as our human readers.\n\nWe agreed that if we’re going to do this, we’re going to tell the world. We’re going to tell our applicants — students. Because I truly believe there’s a level of trust they’re giving us that their applications will be handled with care.\n\nOn the other side, can you tell when students are using A.I. to write their responses to their essays?\n\nWhen you feel like you’ve got something that can detect it, it’s almost immediately out of date. So I actually have very little confidence in anyone who states that they have something that can detect A.I. use. Are we even attempting to do that? No, we’re not.\n\nI tell students: “If you feel you can use A.I. as a brainstorming tool, use it. I do not think it’s in your best interest to use it to write the essays completely — it may not best represent who you are, and that would be a disadvantage in our process.”\n\nSo at some point you might have an A.I.-generated essay being read by your A.I. assessor?\n\nDo you think at any point the ability of A.I. to generate responses to questions will change the application process itself? For example, maybe essays become obsolete?\n\nAbsolutely. We don’t use recommendation letters in our process. But for some schools who continue to utilize them, I’m hearing of counselors using A.I. to write those letters.\n\nOn the surface that might bring some level of concern. But I would argue if the counselor is still able to represent that student well by using that tool, the result is going to be less time writing letters and more time talking to students.\n\nI think some people fear A.I. admissions tools will create a black box that filters you out in a way that you don’t understand and might be a mistake.\n\nThat’s where safeguards are so important. If we were solely using A.I. to evaluate the essays, not having a human read, I think we’d see a very different reception to this change.\n\nOne week each year, the world’s elite descend on Davos, a Swiss mountain town that has a residential population of about 10,000. Businesses there adjust prices accordingly.\n\nSnagging a table for two in the lobby restaurant of the Hilton Garden Inn — which is within the security zone of the World Economic Forum — cost about how much per hour this week, according to The Wall Street Journal?\n\nFind the answer at the bottom of this newsletter.\n\nThanks for reading! We’ll see you Monday.\n\nWe’d like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to dealbook@nytimes.com.",

    "description": "Amplitude gave Business Insider the inside look at its AI overhaul, from acquisitions to efforts to increase staff adoption of AI coding assistants.",
    "fullText": "There's a long banner hanging in Amplitude's San Francisco office. It reads: \"NO MAGICAL THINKING.\"\n\nNo, it's not some rag on Joan Didion. It's a reminder, CEO Spenser Skates told Business Insider, that technology can never replace deep thinking and hard work. In the AI age, that reminder is more important than ever — so much so that employees must look up at it every day.\n\nAmplitude, an 800-person, publicly traded analytics company, is undergoing an AI transformation — with the goal of reinvigorating its business.\n\nAmplitude went public in September 2021 at the height of the pandemic, climbing to an all-time closing high of $84.80 per share several weeks later before dropping significantly and largely plateauing in in recent years around $10. It closed at $10.25 on Friday.\n\nSince October 2024, the company has acquired five AI startups. Amplitude hired an AI-savvy engineering head and appointed one of its acquired founders to a new AI leadership position. It got Cursor and GitHub Copilot licenses for employees, and ran a heads-down AI week.\n\nIt's a change many companies are making: Rapidly moving from little-to-no AI to trying to become \"AI native,\" a term that's curiously hard to pin down. Large language models are popping up everywhere in white-collar work as companies chase the promise of efficiency gains.\n\nAmplitude's case may be especially informative, given just how skeptical of AI its CEO was. In 2023 and some of 2024, Skates said he viewed the AI industry as full of \"grifters,\" the visionaries promising to end world hunger and salesmen promising to automate everything.\n\n\"It had all sorts of problems,\" Skates said. By mid-2024, he realized \"there's probably going to be a breakthrough in the analytics space in the next two or three years.\"\n\n\"We've got to go make that ourselves,\" he said. \"So, we went all in.\"\n\nSkates had two opening moves for his AI overhaul.\n\nThe first: hiring a new chief engineering officer with a history in AI. Wade Chambers had advised the company since 2016, while holding leadership roles at Twitter and Included Health.\n\nWhen Chambers joined in October 2024, only 1% of the engineering, product, and design teams at Amplitude were using AI.\n\nThe second was the acquisition of Command AI, a chatbot startup. It was the first of a string of acquisitions, including June, Kraftful, and Inari. Amplitude announced its most recent acquisition, InfiniGrow, on January 14.\n\nYana Welinder was CEO of Kraftful, one of Amplitude's acquisition targets. Kraftful could spot power users of its product, one of whom was Amplitude's then-CPO. She reached out, and they chatted in February. The deal closed in July, and Welinder was named Amplitude's head of AI. A company blog post with an introductory Q&A referred to her as \"AI maven.\"\n\nWelinder's first order of business: speeding the company up. Kraftful shipped new product every week. Amplitude was shipping less than monthly.\n\n\"If you have this cadence of shipping infrequently, then the team slows down, which isn't appropriate in the age of AI,\" she said.\n\n\"Analytics will look very different 6 months from now,\" Skates wrote in his email. \"We have the opportunity to be the AI native company in Analytics and we are going to pull every piece of firepower we have.\"\n\nHe also asked employees to share a coming launch on X, as opposed to LinkedIn, because that's \"where the AI natives are.\"\n\nHow much has Amplitude spent on AI, from tools to acquisitions? \"Tens of millions, for sure,\" Skates said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it got past $100 million.\"\n\nThen comes the harder part: convincing employees to really use the tools.\n\nWhile some engineers are excited about AI's promise, others are skeptical about its helpfulness, or worried about possible job losses. Not every engineer is as gung ho about AI as their management is.\n\nSkates said that engineers were especially sensitive to the \"grifting\" that went on in AI, making many of them skeptical. With a bottoms-up approach, that skepticism dissipates, he said.\n\nSoon after joining, Chambers began planning an \"AI week\" for the first week of June. It took six months of prep and borrowed heavily from Facebook's mobile push. He took the entire engineering, product, and design team offline for the week. To kick off, Chambers required that leaders get onstage and vibe-code something in front of the entire company.\n\n\"It didn't go well,\" Chambers said of the live vibe-coding demonstration. \"They had to work through it. They had to re-prompt a couple of different ways.\"\n\nBut the message stuck, he said. Leaders who weren't coding all day were able to build something \"pretty cool\" within the hourlong session, save a few hiccups.\n\nAdditional momentum came from the \"zealots,\" engineers passionate about exploring the new tech (some of whom Chambers brought over from his prior job). These engineers lead by example, he said.\n\nAmplitude shared its internal data tracking how many employees use its AI tools. In the final week of March, 14 employees were actively using Cursor. That figure peaked in the first week of December — after AI week but before the holiday vacation cycle — at 174 employees.\n\nAnd what of the thorny question about AI implementation in the enterprise: ROI? After all, a 2025 MIT study indicated 95% of firms publicly disclosing use of AI pilots reported no measurable ROI.\n\nAfter implementing these tools, developer productivity shot up 40% and stayed there, Chambers said. On some specific engineering teams, those gains looks more like 300-400%, he said.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of people who are thinking they're the world's best expert at something,\" Chambers said. \"Increasingly, even the most cynical team members have come around.\"",

    "description": "EY's global chief innovation officer, Joe Depa, said he advises his teams to write their own content first and then ask AI to refine it.",
    "fullText": "AI is getting better every day — but EY's global chief innovation officer told Business Insider there are still signs that reveal an AI-generated response.\n\nDepa leads the Big Four firm's global AI, data, and innovation strategy, and part of his job involves overseeing how employees integrate AI.\n\nThat vantage point has given Depa what he calls a \"high sensitivity\" for detecting AI-generated work. While he's all in on the technology and doesn't have set limits on how often employees should use it, he said AI should be used to amplify human creativity, not replace it. He said there are situations where \"it's too much AI,\" and the person hasn't \"infused any of their own original thoughts.\"\n\nIn that case, \"there does become a point of AI becoming a little bit less efficient or effective,\" Depa said. The executive added that it's important to maintain a sense of individuality and style so that everyone doesn't sound the same.\n\nAs companies urge employees to adopt AI, Depa's comments underscore the fine line employees walk between using the technology as a tool and depending on it too heavily.\n\nEven if workers want their bosses to know they're keeping up with the latest tech, they may not want them to know just how much they're relying on it. In a Business Insider survey with 220 respondents, 40% said \"yes\" or \"sometimes\" when asked whether they hide or downplay their AI use at work.\n\nDepa said he notices a few signs that point to AI-generated responses, including mistakes. While AI tools have improved significantly, they can still hallucinate. Here are a few other writing- and presentation-specific examples that point to AI, according to Depa:\n\nWhen it comes to written communication, Depa said there are a few signals that indicate it was generated by AI with minimal human oversight or input. \n\nOne of the most common is neutral and overly formal writing. He added that AI-generated writing may lack personal aspects, emotion, and humor.\n\nThe writing may also be too polished, with no shifts in pattern, structure, or flow. He said AI-generated writing tends to be generic or corporate-sounding, sometimes relying too heavily on buzzwords and descriptors.\n\nAnother red flag is repetitive language, such as relying on the same phrases or sentence structures to open multiple sentences or paragraphs.\n\nIn general, Depa advises his teams to write their own content with the bullets and messaging they want to convey, and then ask an AI tool to refine it. If used correctly, Depa said AI tools can challenge your thinking.\n\n\"If you write it yourself first and then ask for the enhancement using AI, I feel like that's much more productive,\" Depa said.\n\nIn presentations, Depa said an over-reliance on AI results in surface-level insights that lack specific examples. Another giveaway is when topics are addressed too broadly, with little consideration for the audience.\n\nHe also flagged \"hedging,\" which he said AI does by design. He said AI often steers away from clear recommendations and presents alternatives.\n\n\"Anytime you see vagueness or general statements that don't really tell you anything, I would often say that's AI,\" Depa said.",

    "title": "I'm a co-creator of Alexa. Writing a 6-page memo helped me decide to quit Amazon and launch my own AI startup.",
    "description": "William Tunstall-Pedoe co-founded Evi, which became Amazon Alexa. Here's why he decided to leave the tech giant and launch a startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with William Tunstall-Pedoe, 56, a founder and CEO. Amazon's acquisition of his startup and his role at Unlikely AI have been verified by Business Insider. This piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI helped create Alexa, a product that everyone has heard of and most people have used. I'm proud of what we built.\n\nBut by 2016, it was clear that leaving Amazon, which I joined after the company acquired my startup, was the right decision. Continuing to work on Alexa would have been a very different job from building and launching startups, which I love to do.\n\nWhen I was 13, I would go to a college next to my school to use their mainframe, and since then I've been excited by computers and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with software.\n\nI studied computer science at the University of Cambridge and taught there after graduating in 1991, but I felt better suited to entrepreneurship than to academia. If you create something genuinely new in software, it can be on a billion smartphones in six months and truly change the world. That's impact.\n\nI set out to solve what I saw as a big problem. Internet search relied on users guessing keywords to get results, rather than asking natural questions like we learn to do as children. I imagined a world where you could have that same kind of conversation with computers, which led me to found True Knowledge in 2006.\n\nInitially, we tried to build a search engine that would compete with Google, which didn't work. Then, we enabled other companies to integrate our search engine into their own products — but the larger companies didn't. For a time, we focused on SEO.\n\nThe final pivot was building a voice assistant. We created an application called Evi, which launched in the UK in 2012, a year after Apple introduced Siri. We renamed the company from True Knowledge to Evi to match our product.\n\nAs a 30-person startup, we suddenly found ourselves competing with the world's most valuable company. We spent much of that year talking to major players in tech about being acquired. Later in 2012, Amazon bought our company.\n\nJoining Amazon was the right decision. The company invested heavily in the city of Cambridge, where Evi was based, and turned our startup into a major Amazon office. Our voice assistant became one of the company's biggest and most exciting secrets.\n\nMoving from running a small startup to working inside a business with hundreds of thousands of employees, with Jeff Bezos at the top, was a big change, but I loved working there. I split my time between Amazon's offices in Seattle and Cambridge, and enjoyed going back and forth, making things happen.\n\nWhen we launched Alexa, we were taken aback by the response. It was instantly successful. Today, Alexa is a household name. I'm immensely proud of the Evi team.\n\nAmazon is known for using six-page memos instead of PowerPoint presentations to promote clarity of thought. In 2016, I wrote one to help me decide if I should leave Amazon. In the memo, I laid out these facts: I'd delivered everything I could, the acquisition had been an unambiguous success, and so too had the product. At the time, thousands of people were working on Alexa.\n\nAfter about three and a half years at Amazon, in 2016, it was time to go. I wanted to re-enter the startup world.\n\nIt's certainly possible to launch something new within a big organization, and there are real advantages to doing so. When we launched Alexa, it immediately appeared on the front page of Amazon.com, a level of exposure that most startups could only dream of. I expect I'll work at a big company again at some point in my career.\n\nBut if you're trying to do something novel or contrarian, a startup is often better suited. Within a large company, all it takes is one manager deciding that resources are better spent elsewhere for a project to die. At a startup, it's the opposite. Even if 99 venture capitalists say no, you only need one investor to say yes to keep the project alive.\n\nAfter Amazon, I spent time mentoring at startup incubators such as Creative Destruction Lab. Through that, I became an active angel investor, which gave me a broad perspective of the many ways startups succeed and fail.\n\nIn 2019, I launched Unlikely AI, a deeptech startup focused on building neurosymbolic AI. The goal is to combine the powerful but sometimes incorrect machine-learning models with the world of algorithms, where computers are almost always right. The mission of the business is about making AI trustworthy and reliable.\n\nAs CEO, I'm constantly swamped. Running a startup can be stressful, but working on something truly big and ambitious is incredibly exciting.\n\nI sometimes feel nostalgic about working inside a big organization, but I love being in the startup world. For me, leaving Amazon was the right decision. I don't regret it.",

    "description": "The avatar, created to deter young people from extremism, has been subverted and is breaking out of niche online silos",
    "fullText": "The avatar, created to deter young people from extremism, has been subverted and is breaking out of niche online silos\n\nIn certain corners of the internet, on niche news feeds and algorithms, an AI-generated British schoolgirl has emerged as something of a phenomenon.\n\nHer name is Amelia, a purple-haired “goth girl” who proudly carries a mini union flag and appears to have a penchant for racism.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Amelia, the chances are you will soon encounter one viral meme or another inspired by her on Facebook or X, where her reputation is growing.\n\nVideos of Amelia typically feature her walking through London, or the House of Commons, declaring her love for England and warning of the dangers of “militant Muslims” or “third-world migrants”. In one clip she is harangued by bearded man in Islamic attire for eating a pork sausage.\n\nThe message is one well rehearsed on far-right social media, but it is the AI invention of Amelia that has made her endlessly adaptable, creating a viral internet trend that anyone with access to a mainstream chatbot can take part in. Users of X have turned to its Grok AI tool to create so many Amelia memes, she is now breaking out of niche online silos.\n\nThe origins of the character are ironic, to say they least. An early iteration of Amelia began life in a counter-extremism video game funded by the UK Home Office and created to deter young people aged 13-18 from being attracted to far right extremism in Yorkshire.\n\nPathways: Navigating the Internet and Extremism is a simple multiple choice format game with basic animation. Its players are taken on a journey as characters at a college. They are invited to make decisions in scenarios including whether or download potentially extremist content or join an Amelia character on a rally organised by “a small political group” protesting against changes in society and the “erosion in British values”.\n\nCertain scenarios simulated in the game result in a referral under the British government’s Prevent counter-terrorism programme.\n\nHowever, it is a subversion of the Amelia character that has exploded across social media channels in a way that has astonished even the creators of the original game.\n\nAmong the plethora of increasingly sophisticated AI-generated iterations are a Manga-style Amelia, a Wallace and Gromit version and AI-generated “real life” encounters between her and the characters of Father Ted or Harry Potter, accompanied by racist language and far-right messaging.\n\nAnalysis provided to the Guardian by Logically, a UK company that monitors disinformation, indicated that an anonymous account known for skilfully disseminating far-right messaging started the Amelia meme on X on 9 January with a post that has since been viewed 1.4m times.\n\nThe volume of “Ameliaposting” has since gone from an average of 500 a day when that account first introduced it to the world to roughly 10,000, starting on 15 January as it hit international audiences. On Wednesday, it hit 11,137 posts on X alone.\n\nIn one of the most surreal twists, an Amelia cryptocurrency has emerged, with social media users seeking to leverage its value on the meme’s rising profile. On Wednesday, Elon Musk retweeted an X account promoting an Amelia cryptocurrency token.\n\n“What we’re seeing is the monetisation of hate,” said Matteo Bergamini, the founder and CEO of Shout Out UK, a political and media literacy training company that created the original game.\n\n“We’ve seen Telegram groups all messaging each other in Chinese about the meme coin and talking about how to artificially inflate its value, so a lot of money is being made.”\n\nThe company itself has been the target of a deluge of hate mail, including threats that have now been reported to the police.\n\nBergamini points out that the original initiative was never meant to be a stand-alone game. Rather, it was intended to be used in the classrooms alongside a suite of teaching resources, a fact he says coverage and commentary has ignored.\n\n“There has been a lot of misrepresentation unfortunately,” he said. “The game does not state, for example, that questioning mass migration is inherently wrong.”\n\nOthers have suggested the initiative had backfired, not least by casting a “cute goth girl” as a negative character, leading to her inadvertently becoming a focus of admiration. But Bergamini said the game – which used feedback from focus groups with young people and was developed with a specific local threat picture in mind – continued to be used and feedback from schools and others was positive.\n\nNevertheless, the speed and sophistication surrounding the creation of supposedly subversive Amelia memes online has taken him by surprise.\n\n“This experience has shown us why this work is so immensely important, but also gives us pause for thought about our safety in conducting this work due to the highly sophisticated coordination of those who profit from hate,” he said.\n\nSiddharth Venkataramakrishnan, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said: “We have seen the meme having a remarkable spread and proliferating among the far right and beyond, but what’s also been of note is how it is now international.\n\n“In a way it gets to the heart of what we might term the ‘dissident’ far-right – individuals who position themselves outside of the mainstream political scene – whether that’s ‘shitposters’ who are just into provoking, others who are in twee memes. A whole ecosystem has embraced it. Clearly, the sexualised imagery is also key to this. The target audience is almost exclusively young men.”\n\nThe Home Office said Prevent had diverted nearly 6,000 people away from violent ideologies. It added that projects such as the Pathways game were designed to target local radicalisation risks and were created and delivered independently of government.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "A research paper suggests AI agents are mathematically doomed to fail. The industry doesn’t agree.",
    "fullText": "companies promised us that 2025 would be “the year of the AI agents.” It turned out to be the year of talking about AI agents, and kicking the can for that transformational moment to 2026 or maybe later. But what if the answer to the question “When will our lives be fully automated by generative AI robots that perform our tasks for us and basically run the world?” is, like that New Yorker cartoon, “How about never?”\n\nThat was basically the message of a paper published without much fanfare some months ago, smack in the middle of the overhyped year of “agentic AI.” Entitled “Hallucination Stations: On Some Basic Limitations of Transformer-Based Language Models,” it purports to mathematically show that “LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity.” Though the science is beyond me, the authors—a former SAP CTO who studied AI under one of the field’s founding intellects, John McCarthy, and his teenage prodigy son—punctured the vision of agentic paradise with the certainty of mathematics. Even reasoning models that go beyond the pure word-prediction process of LLMs, they say, won’t fix the problem.\n\n“There is no way they can be reliable,” Vishal Sikka, the dad, tells me. After a career that, in addition to SAP, included a stint as Infosys CEO and an Oracle board member, he currently heads an AI services startup called Vianai. “So we should forget about AI agents running nuclear power plants?” I ask. “Exactly,” he says. Maybe you can get it to file some papers or something to save time, but you might have to resign yourself to some mistakes.\n\nThe AI industry begs to differ. For one thing, a big success in agent AI has been coding, which took off last year. Just this week at Davos, Google’s Nobel-winning head of AI, Demis Hassabis, reported breakthroughs in minimizing hallucinations, and hyperscalers and startups alike are pushing the agent narrative. Now they have some backup. A startup called Harmonic is reporting a breakthrough in AI coding that also hinges on mathematics—and tops benchmarks on reliability.\n\nHarmonic, which was cofounded by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Tudor Achim, a Stanford-trained mathematician, claims this recent improvement to its product called Aristotle (no hubris there!) is an indication that there are ways to guarantee the trustworthiness of AI systems. “Are we doomed to be in a world where AI just generates slop and humans can't really check it? That would be a crazy world,” says Achim. Harmonic’s solution is to use formal methods of mathematical reasoning to verify an LLM’s output. Specifically, it encodes outputs in the Lean programming language, which is known for its ability to verify the coding. To be sure, Harmonic’s focus to date has been narrow—its key mission is the pursuit of “mathematical superintelligence,” and coding is a somewhat organic extension. Things like history essays—which can’t be mathematically verified—are beyond its boundaries. For now.\n\nNonetheless, Achim doesn’t seem to think that reliable agentic behavior is as much an issue as some critics believe. “I would say that most models at this point have the level of pure intelligence required to reason through booking a travel itinerary,” he says.\n\nBoth sides are right—or maybe even on the same side. On one hand, everyone agrees that hallucinations will continue to be a vexing reality. In a paper published last September, OpenAI scientists wrote, “Despite significant progress, hallucinations continue to plague the field, and are still present in the latest models.” They proved that unhappy claim by asking three models, including ChatGPT, to provide the title of the lead author’s dissertation. All three made up fake titles and all misreported the year of publication. In a blog about the paper, OpenAI glumly stated that in AI models, “accuracy will never reach 100 percent.”",

    "description": "Daniel Stenberg says the inflow of AI slop has become unsustainable for the curl security team to handle.",
    "fullText": "Last year in May, the cURL project's bug bounty program was inundated with AI slop, where many bogus reports were opened on HackerOne, leaving the cURL maintainers to go through garbage.\n\nThe problem didn't stop even after Daniel Stenberg, the creator of cURL, threatened to ban anyone whose bug report was found to be AI slop. We are now in 2026, and the situation has reached a tipping point.\n\nDaniel has submitted a pull request on GitHub that removes all mentions of the bug bounty program from cURL's documentation and website. Coinciding with that, the project's security.txt file has been updated with some blunt language that makes the new policy crystal clear.\n\nThe cURL team intends to make a proper announcement in the coming days, though many outlets have already covered the news of this happening, so I would say they ought to get on it ASAP! 😆\n\nThe program officially ends in a few days on January 31, 2026. After that, security researchers can still report issues through GitHub or the project's mailing list, but there won't be any cash involved.\n\nWhat pushed them over the edge?, you ask. Well, just weeks into 2026, seven HackerOne reports came in within a 16-hour period in just one week. Some were actual bugs, but none of them were security vulnerabilities. By the time Daniel posted his recent weekly report, they'd already dealt with 20 submissions in 2026.\n\nThe main goal here is said to be stopping the flood of garbage reports. By eliminating the money incentive, they are hoping people (or bots?) will stop wasting the security team's time with half-baked, unresearched submissions.\n\nHe also gives a stern warning to wannabe AI sloppers, saying that:\n\nSo, yeah, that's that. If people still don't understand that AI slop is harmful to such sensitive pieces of software, then sure, they can go ahead and make a fool of themselves.\n\nSuggested Read 📖: Open Source Project LLVM Says Yes to AI-Generated Code",

    "fullText": "Guardian found OpenAI’s platform cited Grokipedia on topics including Iran and Holocaust deniers\n\nThe latest model of ChatGPT has begun to cite Elon Musk’s Grokipedia as a source on a wide range of queries, including on Iranian conglomerates and Holocaust deniers, raising concerns about misinformation on the platform.\n\nIn tests done by the Guardian, GPT-5.2 cited Grokipedia nine times in response to more than a dozen different questions. These included queries on political structures in Iran, such as salaries of the Basij paramilitary force and the ownership of the Mostazafan Foundation, and questions on the biography of Sir Richard Evans, a British historian and expert witness against Holocaust denier David Irving in his libel trial.\n\nGrokipedia, launched in October, is an AI-generated online encyclopedia that aims to compete with Wikipedia, and which has been criticised for propagating rightwing narratives on topics including gay marriage and the 6 January insurrection in the US. Unlike Wikipedia, it does not allow direct human editing, instead an AI model writes content and responds to requests for changes.\n\nChatGPT did not cite Grokipedia when prompted directly to repeat misinformation about the insurrection, about media bias against Donald Trump, or about the HIV/Aids epidemic – areas where Grokipedia has been widely reported to promote falsehoods. Instead, Grokipedia’s information filtered into the model’s responses when it was prompted about more obscure topics.\n\nFor instance, ChatGPT, citing Grokipedia, repeated stronger claims about the Iranian government’s links to MTN-Irancell than are found on Wikipedia – such as asserting that the company has links to the office of Iran’s supreme leader.\n\nChatGPT also cited Grokipedia when repeating information that the Guardian has debunked, namely details about Sir Richard Evans’ work as an expert witness in David Irving’s trial.\n\nGPT-5.2 is not the only large language model (LLM) that appears to be citing Grokipedia; anecdotally, Anthropic’s Claude has also referenced Musk’s encyclopedia on topics from petroleum production to Scottish ales.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the model’s web search “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints”.\n\n“We apply safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms, and ChatGPT clearly shows which sources informed a response through citations,” they said, adding that they had ongoing programs to filter out low-credibility information and influence campaigns.\n\nAnthropic did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut the fact that Grokipedia’s information is filtering – at times very subtly – into LLM responses is a concern for disinformation researchers. Last spring, security experts raised concerns that malign actors, including Russian propaganda networks, were churning out massive volumes of disinformation in an effort to seed AI models with lies, a process called “LLM grooming”.\n\nIn June, concerns were raised in the US Congress that Google’s Gemini repeated the Chinese government’s position on human rights abuses in Xinjiang and China’s Covid-19 policies.\n\nNina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who has worked on LLM grooming, said ChatGPT’s citing Grokipedia raised similar concerns. While Musk may not have intended to influence LLMs, Grokipedia entries she and colleagues had reviewed were “relying on sources that are untrustworthy at best, poorly sourced and deliberate disinformation at worst”, she said.\n\nAnd the fact that LLMs cite sources such as Grokipedia or the Pravda network may, in turn, improve these sources’ credibility in the eyes of readers. “They might say, ‘oh, ChatGPT is citing it, these models are citing it, it must be a decent source, surely they’ve vetted it’ – and they might go there and look for news about Ukraine,” said Jankowicz.\n\nBad information, once it has filtered into an AI chatbot, can be challenging to remove. Jankowicz recently found that a large news outlet had included a made-up quote from her in a story about disinformation. She wrote to the news outlet asking for the quote to be removed, and posted about the incident on social media.\n\nThe news outlet removed the quote. However, AI models for some time continued to cite it as hers. “Most people won’t do the work necessary to figure out where the truth actually lies,” she said.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for xAI, the owner of Grokipedia, said: “Legacy media lies.”",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: German research into responses to health queries raises fresh questions about summaries seen by 2bn people a month\n\nHow the ‘confident authority’ of AI Overviews is putting public health at risk\n\nGoogle’s search feature AI Overviews cites YouTube more than any medical website when answering queries about health conditions, according to research that raises fresh questions about a tool seen by 2 billion people each month.\n\nThe company has said its AI summaries, which appear at the top of search results and use generative AI to answer questions from users, are “reliable” and cite reputable medical sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayo Clinic.\n\nHowever, a study that analysed responses to more than 50,000 health queries, captured using Google searches from Berlin, found the top cited source was YouTube. The video-sharing platform is the world’s second most visited website, after Google itself, and is owned by Google.\n\nResearchers at SE Ranking, a search engine optimisation platform, found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations. No hospital network, government health portal, medical association or academic institution came close to that number, they said.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches, and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that AI Overviews was designed to surface high-quality content from reputable sources, regardless of format, and a variety of credible health authorities and licensed medical professionals created content on YouTube. The study’s findings could not be extrapolated to other regions as it was conducted using German-language queries in Germany, it said.\n\nThe research comes after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews responses.\n\nIn one case that experts said was “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could have left people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. The company later removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches.\n\nThe SE Ranking study analysed 50,807 healthcare-related prompts and keywords to see which sources AI Overviews relied on when generating answers.\n\nThey chose Germany because its healthcare system is strictly regulated by a mix of German and EU directives, standards and safety regulations. “If AI systems rely heavily on non-medical or non-authoritative sources even in such an environment, it suggests the issue may extend beyond any single country,” they wrote.\n\nAI Overviews surfaced on more than 82% of health searches, the researchers said. When they looked at which sources AI Overviews relied on most often for health-related answers, one result stood out immediately, they said. The single most cited domain was YouTube with 20,621 citations out of a total of 465,823.\n\nThe next most cited source was NDR.de, with 14,158 citations (3.04%). The German public broadcaster produces health-related content alongside news, documentaries and entertainment. In third place was a medical reference site, Msdmanuals.com with 9,711 citations (2.08%).\n\nThe fourth most cited source was Germany’s largest consumer health portal, Netdoktor.de, with 7,519 citations (1.61%). The fifth most cited source was a career platform for doctors, Praktischarzt.de, with 7,145 citations (1.53%).\n\nThe researchers acknowledged limitations to their study. It was conducted as a one-time snapshot in December 2025, using German-language queries that reflected how users in Germany typically search for health information.\n\nResults could vary over time, by region, and by the phrasing of questions. However, even with those caveats, the findings still prompted alarm.\n\nHannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher specialising in AI, health and law at the University of Basel who was not involved with the research, said: “This study provides empirical evidence that the risks posed by AI Overviews for health are structural, not anecdotal. It becomes difficult for Google to argue that misleading or harmful health outputs are rare cases.\n\n“Instead, the findings show that these risks are embedded in the way AI Overviews are designed. In particular, the heavy reliance on YouTube rather than on public health authorities or medical institutions suggests that visibility and popularity, rather than medical reliability, is the central driver for health knowledge.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “The implication that AI Overviews provide unreliable information is refuted by the report’s own data, which shows that the most cited domains in AI Overviews are reputable websites. And from what we’ve seen in the published findings, AI Overviews cite expert YouTube content from hospitals and clinics.”\n\nGoogle said the study showed that of the 25 most cited YouTube videos, 96% were from medical channels. However, the researchers cautioned that these videos represented fewer than 1% of all the YouTube links cited by AI Overviews on health.\n\n“Most of them (24 out of 25) come from medical-related channels like hospitals, clinics and health organisations,” the researchers wrote. “On top of that, 21 of the 25 videos clearly note that the content was created by a licensed or trusted source.\n\n“So at first glance it looks pretty reassuring. But it’s important to remember that these 25 videos are just a tiny slice (less than 1% of all YouTube links AI Overviews actually cite). With the rest of the videos, the situation could be very different.”",

    "fullText": "Do I have the flu or Covid? Why do I wake up feeling tired? What is causing the pain in my chest? For more than two decades, typing medical questions into the world’s most popular search engine has served up a list of links to websites with the answers. Google those health queries today and the response will likely be written by artificial intelligence.\n\nSundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, first set out the company’s plans to enmesh AI into its search engine at its annual conference in Mountain View, California, in May 2024. Starting that month, he said, US users would see a new feature, AI Overviews, which would provide information summaries above traditional search results. The change marked the biggest shake-up of Google’s core product in a quarter of a century. By July 2025, the technology had expanded to more than 200 countries in 40 languages, with 2 billion people served AI Overviews each month.\n\nWith the rapid rollout of AI Overviews, Google is racing to protect its traditional search business, which generates about $200bn (£147bn) a year, before upstart AI rivals can derail it. “We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace,” Pichai said last July. AI Overviews in particular were “performing well”, he added.\n\nBut overviews carry risks, experts say. They use generative AI to provide snapshots of information about a topic or question, adding conversational answers above the traditional search results in the blink of an eye. They can cite sources, but do not necessarily know when that source is incorrect.\n\nWithin weeks of the feature launching in the US, users encountered untruths across a range of subjects. One AI Overview said Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president, graduated from college in 2005. Elizabeth Reid, Google’s head of search, responded to criticism in a blog post. She conceded that “in a small number of cases”, AI Overviews had misinterpreted language on web pages and presented inaccurate information. “At the scale of the web, with billions of queries coming in every day, there are bound to be some oddities and errors,” she wrote.\n\nBut when those questions are about health, accuracy and context are essential and non-negotiable, experts say. Google is facing mounting scrutiny of its AI Overviews for medical queries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information.\n\nThe company says AI Overviews are “reliable”. But the Guardian found some medical summaries served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. In one case, which experts said was “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people who had serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. What AI Overviews said was normal could vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result and not bothering to attend follow-up appointments.\n\nAI Overviews about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nGoogle initially sought to downplay the Guardian’s findings. From what its own clinicians could assess, the company said, the AI Overviews that alarmed experts linked to reputable sources and recommended seeking expert advice. “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a spokesperson said.\n\nWithin days, however, the company removed some of the AI Overviews for health queries flagged by the Guardian. “We do not comment on individual removals within search,” a spokesperson said. “In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nWhile experts welcomed the removal of some AI summaries for health queries, many remain worried. “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health,” says Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity.\n\n“There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information,” adds Sue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals.\n\nA new study has prompted more concerns. When researchers analysed the responses to more than 50,000 health-related searches in Germany to see which sources AI Overviews rely on most, one result stood out immediately. The single most cited domain was YouTube.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg, board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nIn medicine, it is not only where answers come from that matter, or their level of accuracy, but how they are presented to users, experts say. “With AI Overviews, users no longer encounter a range of sources that they can compare and critically assess,” says Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher in AI, health and law at the University of Basel. “Instead, they are presented with a single, confident, AI-generated answer that exhibits medical authority.\n\n“This means that the system does not merely reflect health information online, but actively restructures it. When that response is built on sources never designed to meet medical standards, such as YouTube videos, this creates a new form of unregulated medical authority online.”\n\nGoogle says AI Overviews are built to surface information backed up by top web results, and include links to web content that supports the information presented in the summary. People can use these links to dig deeper on a topic, the company told the Guardian.\n\nBut the single blocks of text in AI Overviews, combining health information from multiple sources, can cause confusion, says Nicole Gross, an associate professor in business and society at the National College of Ireland.\n\n“Once the AI summary appears, users are much less likely to research further, which means that they are deprived of the opportunity to critically evaluate and compare information, or even deploy their common sense when it comes to health-related issues.”\n\nExperts have raised other concerns with the Guardian. Even if and when AI Overviews do provide accurate facts about a specific medical topic, they may not distinguish between strong evidence from randomised trials and weaker evidence from observational studies, they say. Some also miss important caveats about that evidence, they add.\n\nHaving such claims listed next to one another in an AI Overview may also give the impression that some are better established than they really are. Answers can also change as AI Overviews evolve, even when the science hasn’t shifted. “That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough,” says Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity.\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that links included in AI Overviews were dynamic and changed based on the information that was most relevant, helpful and timely for a given search. If AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed some context, the company would use these errors to improve its systems, and also take action when appropriate, it said.\n\nThe biggest worry is that bogus and dangerous medical information or advice in AI Overviews “ends up getting translated into the everyday practices, routines and life of a patient, even in adapted forms”, says Gross. “In healthcare, this can turn into a matter of life and death.”",

    "description": "With the help of an AI platform, one man submitted more than 800 job applications in a month, resulting in 5 interviews and 1 ideal offer.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dray Jankowski, former employee at CrowdStrike and current senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind. Business Insider verified his identity. This essay has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI still remember the morning I found out I was getting laid off from CrowdStrike.\n\nI went to bed thinking everything was fine, and when I woke up, there was a mysterious meeting on my calendar for later that afternoon.\n\nThat's when I saw the email that said the company was doing a reduction in force as it adjusted to changes driven by AI. It wasn't about financial trouble. It was sudden, impersonal, and final. At 30, it was my first layoff.\n\nI was shaken. I worked hard to get where I was. At CrowdStrike, I was a program manager working closely with the team that makes motion sensors. I also worked at Amazon and Raytheon and consulted with companies such as Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. I had what people would consider a \"great résumé.\"\n\nLittle did I know how brutal the job market would become and how hard it would be to find the right fit.\n\nIn the first three months after my layoff, I applied to 52 jobs on my own, and I hated every second of it.\n\nAt first, I wasn't even looking. I had savings, and it was summer. I traveled to Yellowstone, spent time with my mom and my two dogs, and casually applied to roles I actually liked.\n\nInstead of being quiet about my layoff, I also decided to be vocal. I started making YouTube videos and launched a podcast called \"The Reboot Era,\" where I talked openly about layoffs and invited others to share their experiences.\n\nEven with my background, the job-search process was frustrating. I'd turn to ChatGPT with basic questions like, \"Should I update my résumé for this role?\" and I started noticing how many people were stuck for months because they didn't know how to optimize it for applicant tracking systems. When I looked for help online, most of it was locked behind paywalls.\n\nLinkedIn \"Easy Apply\" felt like a black hole. Company websites made me create a new Workday account every time. The process was tedious, slow, and draining. So when an AI-powered application platform reached out to me after seeing my posts about layoffs, I invited them onto my podcast with a catch: I wouldn't promote anything unless I tested it myself and believed it worked.\n\nAt first, the results didn't seem promising. The very first call I got was from a car wash near my house.\n\nA week later, something changed. I started getting legitimate interview requests for corporate roles that matched my experience and salary range. One message on LinkedIn asked if I wanted to interview with a company I'd never even heard of. That's when I knew the AI had applied for me.\n\nOver the course of about a month, the platform sent out 812 applications on my behalf. It also shows you which keywords to hit in your cover letters, and you can set your own parameters.\n\nWith AI handling the repetitive work, I could focus on preparing for interviews, refining my résumé, networking, and continuing my podcast.\n\nIn total, I received five serious interview requests that were aligned with what I wanted. I moved forward with two. One didn't pan out, but the other moved fast. Within two weeks, I had an offer.\n\nThat's how I landed my current role as senior director of product operations and program management at Wunderkind, a marketing technology company that helps brands re-engage customers who leave their websites without making a purchase.\n\nAI didn't get me the job. It got me the interview. From there, it was on me to show up, connect, and prove I was the right person.\n\nI think the job market is going in the wrong direction.\n\nFirst, companies decide they can automate many standard workflows and lay off workers. Those employees are then pushed back into the open job market, forced to apply for new roles. Now, they face AI screening systems that evaluate them against opaque criteria they can't see or understand.\n\nIf the applicant is using AI as well, they get rejected by the screener AI if they sound too robotic. Then, even when you do get the interview, many offers ask you to meet with a digital recruiter who's not a real person and will ask automated questions.\n\nNone of that seems fair, and it often feels like AI is working against job seekers in this brutal market. It took me more than 800 applications to get one great offer, so it is reasonable if you need help. When used correctly, AI can be the tool that gives you your time and momentum back.",

    "description": "Connecting Claude to Ghidra via MCP to reverse engineer River Raid. A test of AI agents against 6502 assembly, memory mapping, and 80s game logic.",
    "fullText": "Can an AI agent navigate Ghidra, the NSA’s open-source reverse engineering suite, well enough to hack an Atari game? Ghidra is powerful but notoriously complex, with a steep learning curve. Instead of spending weeks learning its interface, what if I could simply describe my goal and let an AI handle the complexity?\n\nRiver Raid, the Atari 8-bit version. My first computer was an Atari back in the 80s, and this particular game occupied a disproportionate amount of my childhood attention.\n\nThe ROM is exactly 8kB — almost comical by modern standards. And yet this tiny binary contains everything: graphics, sound, enemy AI, and physics simulation — all compressed into hand-optimized 6502 assembly.\n\nThe objective was straightforward: unlimited lives. It’s the quintessential hack, a rite of passage that kids with hex editors performed for entertainment back in the 80s. In 2025, instead of a hex editor, I have an AI.\n\nGhidra doesn’t have a native AI assistant, so I needed a way to bridge the gap between my instructions and the tool’s internal API. This is where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes in.\n\nI found an open-source MCP server for Ghidra — essentially a connector that allows Claude to talk directly to Ghidra. The concept is elegant: Claude connects to the running Ghidra instance, analyzes the binary, renames functions, and identifies code patterns programmatically.\n\nIn practice, the experience was considerably less elegant:\n\nHere’s the thing: I don’t use disassemblers daily. Ghidra’s workflow was completely foreign to me. The whole point was to see if AI could bridge that gap — I’d feed it a mysterious binary, and the Ghidra + LLM combination would figure out it’s a cartridge dump, handle the memory mapping, and guide me through.\n\nReality was harsher. To test the AI properly, I renamed the binary to a.rom — no helpful filename hints. When importing, I selected only the CPU architecture (6502) without specifying the platform. Claude’s first instinct was reasonable: it asked for the MD5 hash to search for known ROM signatures. The MCP tools don’t expose hashing, so that avenue closed immediately.\n\nFirst problem: Ghidra loaded the ROM at $0000, not $A000 where Atari cartridges live. All cross-references pointed nowhere.\n\nClaude identified the issue with admirable clarity: “The ROM should be loaded at $A000, not $0000. You’ll need to rebase the memory image.”\n\nMe: “Can you perform the rebase?”\n\nClaude: “Unfortunately, no. The MCP tools don’t have write access for that particular operation.”\n\nI rebased manually to $8000 — still wrong. The code referenced $A000-$BFFF. Rebased again.\n\nTwo rebasing operations in total, neither of which the AI could perform.\n\nWhere Claude genuinely excelled was in identifying the target platform through hardware register analysis:\n\nHardware addresses are essentially fingerprints that can’t be faked, and these particular addresses are unmistakably Atari 8-bit.\n\nI asked Claude to attempt identification of the game based purely on code patterns and structural analysis. It examined the evidence methodically. Based on this evidence, Claude reached its conclusion:\n\nIt was, of course, not Centipede. It was River Raid.\n\nThis serves as a useful reminder that confidence and accuracy are orthogonal properties.\n\nDespite the identity crisis, Claude still understood the code structure. Finding the lives decrement was straightforward. Claude searched for the canonical pattern: load, decrement, store.\n\nThe fix is elegantly simple: replace DEY (decrement Y register) with NOP (no operation). A single byte modification, where $88 becomes $EA.\n\nSince the MCP tool couldn’t write the binary directly, I applied the patch externally:\n\nI tested the patched ROM in an emulator by deliberately crashing into a bridge. The lives counter remained stubbornly fixed at 3.\n\nClaude excelled at pattern recognition — hardware registers, code flow, finding the patch location. It struggled with tasks requiring broader context, such as identifying the game or analyzing sprite data.\n\nSetting up MCP is a troubleshooting ritual. It eventually worked, but the experience was painfully slow. Claude would fire off a batch of tool calls, some taking 30 seconds each. Too slow for an interactive session — I’d rather have quick responses with clarifying questions than watch a progress bar crawl. We need a better balance between autonomous batch processing and interactive guidance.\n\nAI should be embedded in every complex GUI tool. We’re in the experimental phase now. Some things work, some don’t. Ideally AI should smooth out the experience in ways traditional help systems never could — compacted Stack Overflow knowledge, real context-aware assistance, and the ability to actually perform tasks rather than just describe them.\n\nStay tuned for future posts and releases",

    "fullText": "Two malicious extensions in Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Marketplace that were collectively installed 1.5 million times exfiltrate developer data to China-based servers.\n\nBoth extensions are advertised as AI-based coding assistants that provide the promised functionality. However, they do not disclose the upload activity or ask users for consent to deliver data to a remote server.\n\nThe VS Code Marketplace is the official store for add-ons for Microsoft’s popular code editor. VS Code extensions are installable plugins from the marketplace that add features or integrate tools into the editor. One of the most popular add-on categories right now is AI-powered coding assistants.\n\nResearchers at endpoint and supply-chain security company Koi say that the two malicious extensions are part of a campaign they dubbed 'MaliciousCorgi' and share the same code for stealing developer data.\n\nAdditionally, both of them use the same spyware infrastructure and communicate with the same backend servers. At publishing time, both are present on the marketplace:\n\nThe extensions use three distinct data-collection mechanisms. The first involves real-time monitoring of files opened in the VS Code client. When a file is accessed, its entire contents are encoded in Base64 and transmitted to the attackers’ servers.\n\nAny changes to the opened file are also captured and exfiltrated.\n\n\"The moment you open any file – not interact with it, just open it – the extension reads its entire contents, encodes it as Base64, and sends it to a webview containing a hidden tracking iframe. Not 20 lines. The entire file,\"  Koi researchers say.\n\nThe second mechanism involves a server-controlled file-harvesting command that stealthily transmits up to 50 files from the victim’s workspace each time.\n\nThe third mechanism uses a zero-pixel iframe in the extension’s webview to load four commercial analytics SDKs: Zhuge.io, GrowingIO, TalkingData, and Baidu Analytics.\n\nThese SDKs are used to track user behavior, build identity profiles, fingerprint devices, and monitor activity inside the editor. So, while the first two collect developer work files, the third focuses on user profiling.\n\nKoi Security highlights the risks posed by undocumented functionality in these extensions, including the exposure of private source code, configuration files, cloud service credentials, and .env files containing API keys and credentials.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft about the presence of the two extensions on the VSCode market, but we are still waiting for a reply. We were unable to establish a communication channel with the publisher of the extensions.\n\nWhether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.\n\nGet the cheat sheet and take the guesswork out of secrets management.",

    "description": "That clickbait title might have been written by AI.",
    "fullText": "Last month, Google told online publishers that it had started testing AI-generated headlines in Google Discover, replacing stories' carefully handcrafted titles with truncated alternatives made up by Gemini. Some journalists were predictably unhappy, but now, the company says that the AI headlines are no longer an experiment—they're a \"feature.\"\n\nBack when the testing began, the results ranged from poorly worded to straight up misinformation. For instance, one AI-generated headline promised \"Steam Machine price revealed,\" when the original article made no such claim. Another said \"BG3 players exploit children,\" which sounds serious, until you click through to the article and see that it's about a clever way to recruit invincible party members in Baldur's Gate 3 (which, to be fair, does involve turning child NPCs into sheep at one point).\n\nAt the time, Google said that the test was a \"small UI experiment for a subset of Discover users,\" and simply rearranged how users saw AI previews, which were introduced in October of last year and feature short AI summaries of articles, including an occasional AI headline. However, while that AI headline was previously hidden below the original, authored headline, the test put it up top, while getting rid of the authored headline entirely.\n\nFor a while, it seemed like Google might have been willing to back away from the AI headlines, but now the company says it's doubling down. In a statement to The Verge, Google said that its AI headlines are no longer in testing, but are now a full-fledged feature. The company didn't elaborate on why, but did say that the update \"performs well for user satisfaction.\"\n\nWhen 9to5Google then reached out for more detail, the publication was told, \"The overview headline reflects information across a range of sites, and is not a rewrite of an individual article headline.\"\n\nWell, that hasn't quite been the case for me: When I first wrote about this \"experiment,\" I actually had yet to run into one of the AI headlines. But perusing my Google Discover feed today (to see yours, swipe right from the home screen on an Android phone, or scroll down in the Google app), I've finally seen some first hand. To Google's credit, these AI previews do seem to synthesize several sources as claimed—you can see them above the linked story. However, they still call out one article in particular, linking to it and using its header photo. That can easily lead users to think the AI generated headline was written by the linked publication.\n\nThat can have consequences for the publication or writer if the AI gets something wrong, which a disclaimer at the bottom of these AI previews admits can happen. For instance, The Verge said it saw an AI Discover headline on a story from Lifehacker's sister site PCMag that said, \"US reverses foreign drone ban,\" even though the linked story goes out of its way to say headlines that claim this are \"misleading.\"\n\nThe AI headlines I've seen personally haven't been quite that bad, but as someone with a more than decade-long career in journalism, I do question their helpfulness. For instance, \"Starfleet Academy full of Trek Nods\" is much less informative than the original, \"One of TNG's Strangest Species Is Getting a Second Life In Modern Star Trek.\" I guess \"Star Trek show has Star Trek things\" is apparently clickier or more useful to the reader than just saying what the specific Star Trek thing is?\n\nAnother example: \"Anbernic unveils RG G01 Controller.\" I hope you know what those letters and numbers mean, because this AI headline completely buries the context in the original headline, \"Anbernic's New Controller Has a Screen and Built-In Heartbeat Sensor, for Some Reason.\"\n\nI guess this is a future that I'll have to get used to though. That I'm starting to see these headlines myself, despite not being part of the initial experiment, does suggest we can expect them to stick around, and to roll out to more people. If you see something that seems questionable while scrolling Google Discover, the feature has probably rolled out to you now too.\n\nTo check whether that suspicious headline was written by a human or not, try clicking the \"See more\" button at the bottom of the article's description and looking for a \"Generated with AI\" disclaimer.\n\nOn the plus side, only about half of the articles in my Google Discover are currently using AI headlines, so not every piece of \"content\" is being affected. But for journalists, the move still comes at a tough time: According to Reuters, Google traffic from organic search was down by 38% on test sites in the United Stated between November 2024 and November 2025, and while Google Discover isn't Search, editors write headlines the way they do for a reason. Using a robot to overwrites those decisions probably isn't the best way to tackle eroding trust in media.\n\nI've reached out to Google for comment on its AI headlines and will provide an update when I hear back.",

    "description": "Apply to our rolling effort to find, scope, and build the most important projects to prepare the world for advanced AI",
    "fullText": "In 2025, IFP published The Launch Sequence, a set of proposals aimed at answering one question: what does America need to build, which will not be built fast enough by default, to prepare for a future with advanced AI?\n\nAs we explained in the foreword to the collection, Preparing for Launch, we need to solve two broad problems:\n\nWe invited some of the sharpest thinkers, engineers, and scientists thinking about these topics to write 16 concrete proposals to address these problems.\n\nSince then, many of the proposals have gained real-world traction:5\n\nMajor new funding is flowing into this space. The OpenAI Foundation committed $25 billion to AI resilience and curing diseases. The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative is refocusing most of its philanthropic spending on AI projects to “cure all disease.” The White House launched the Genesis Mission, a “national effort to unleash a new age of AI‑accelerated innovation and discovery.” Philanthropies and government officials are asking us for more ideas about where this money should be directed.\n\nThis is a momentous opportunity, and how well these funds are spent will depend both on the quality of available ideas and on teams being ready to implement them.\n\nThat’s why The Launch Sequence is transitioning into a rolling effort to:\n\nThe output of The Launch Sequence will be a collection of thoroughly vetted, detailed project plans for philanthropists to fund or for policymakers to implement.7\n\nWe’re excited to announce our official Advisory Panel for the project, including:\n\nWe are seeking initial short pitches (around 200–400 words) that address one of the three focus areas of this RFP: accelerating science, strengthening security, and adapting institutions. See “Ideas we are interested in” at the bottom of this post for full descriptions of these focus areas.\n\nWe are interested in projects that are particularly important to achieve in light of rapid advances in AI. This means that the capabilities of advanced AI — or the changes such capabilities will bring — should be a key part of either the problem or the solution.8 If you are unsure if a proposal is in-scope, we encourage you to submit it anyway.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of the kinds of project ideas we’re excited about can be found at the bottom of this post. You can also see the project ideas we’ve already published on our website: ifp.org/launch.\n\nWe welcome pitches from two broad groups of contributors:\n\nWe are especially interested in pitches from people who would consider implementing their proposal themselves.10 This is not a requirement; we are also interested in hearing from strategists, researchers, and domain experts who can articulate what technologies or projects should exist, even if they are not the ones to build them. We also offer a $1,000 bounty for successful referrals — if you know someone who might be interested in being an author, please share this page with them and ask them to include your name in the application form. If their proposal is accepted, you’ll receive the bounty.\n\nWe expect authoring full Launch Sequence project plans to take 8–14 weeks from accepted pitch to published piece, involving several stages of writing, receiving feedback from IFP and input from external experts, and refining your full project plan.\n\nIFP is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and will have no claim over any IP related to your idea, nor ownership of any resulting companies. We aim to accelerate authors and builders.\n\nIf you have an idea, we want to hear it. You can learn more and submit an idea via the form below.\n\nThis is a rolling RFP with no submission deadline, but we encourage you to submit a pitch early (within the next few weeks), as we will prioritize early submissions and start reviewing immediately.\n\nQuestions? Email launch.sequence@ifp.org\n\nWe are interested in rapidly building what we need to prepare for a world with advanced AI so that we can fully reap AI’s benefits while managing its new threats. Such an agenda will include a wide-ranging set of projects, including creating companies, tools, technologies, institutions, research streams, resources, and public policies.\n\nWe will only consider projects that address a market failure (or policy gap) and will therefore not be built by default, or not quickly enough. The three core categories where we expect these issues to surface are in accelerating science, strengthening security, and adapting key institutions.\n\nThe lists below are not meant to be exhaustive. Instead, they are meant to illustrate the kinds of projects that we would be excited to support. We encourage you to submit pitches for projects whether or not they are listed below.\n\nWhat resources, technologies, or institutions will scientists need to unlock breakthroughs with AI and other emerging technologies, and which aren’t being created fast enough through market forces or traditional grant funding?\n\nAI promises to transform how science is done. But leveraging AI advances for breakthroughs requires more than capable models. It requires infrastructure, institutions, and resources that no single lab or company has an incentive to build: shared datasets, standardized protocols, access to physical experimentation capacity, and new modes of peer review and validation. Traditional grant funding moves too slowly and often rewards the wrong things; private industry optimizes for what can become profitable, not what will most advance scientific progress. Without targeted investment and effort by the US government and philanthropies, scientific bottlenecks will limit AI-accelerated discovery even as the models improve. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nHealth and biology. The highest ambition for AI may be to generate cures to inherited and infectious diseases. But even as AI companies pursue this goal, their efforts alone are unlikely to fully accomplish it: biology is immensely complex, wet lab work is messy and reliant on tacit knowledge, and treatments require extensive clinical trials and regulation before they can even start to be distributed to patients. And even if current technologies eventually scale to this lofty goal, delays, even on the order of years, will have massive life-altering costs for billions of people and avoidable suffering at scale. Moving faster, even to achieve the same outcome, can save millions of lives.\n\nWe are interested in proposals that offer ways to speed up biological research, decrease the time between a treatment’s discovery and its real-world availability, or create the policy entrepreneurship needed to massively improve healthspan around the world.\n\nNovel infrastructure for the scientific process. AI tools are being developed to increase productivity in every industry, science included. However, while commercial interests are rapidly building AI tools for materials or drug discovery, efforts to improve the basic scientific process have received comparatively less attention. We are interested in “horizontal” infrastructure that improves the scientific process itself across fields. Projects to build better tooling for natural and physical sciences include:\n\nMetascience. Scientists spend a great deal of time on the work that surrounds the research enterprise — developing systems to durably maintain and share data, writing and reviewing proposals, and interacting with their supporting and partner institutions. Each of these areas of work is already being transformed by AI, but conventional grants and institutions are slow to catch up. Efforts to reimagine how institutions should adapt to the age of AI include:\n\nOther potential directions. The above categories are non-exhaustive. We would also like to receive proposals for other scientific research directions, such as physics, chemistry, or ecology, or proposals that direct other unmet needs in the research, development, and innovation ecosystem.\n\nWhat tools, technologies, or institutions can we build to ensure rapid AI advances do not undermine national security or public safety?\n\nAI technologies are dual-use. The same capabilities that automate cyberdefense can automate cyberattacks; and the tools that accelerate progress in the life sciences may also reduce the barriers to engineer biological weapons. Furthermore, the transformative potential of AI raises the stakes of geopolitical competition, and strengthens the ability of state and non-state actors to cause widespread and asymmetric harm. No one actor bears these risks, requiring targeted philanthropic and government action to ensure that defenses can scale alongside AI capabilities. We are particularly interested in achieving a world in which defensive technologies are structurally advantaged, such that attacks are quickly detected and contained. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nCyber defense. The integration of AI into cyber and cyber-physical systems introduces a broad range of vulnerabilities that hinder AI adoption and increase the attack surface for critical infrastructure. Moreover, AI is already increasing the speed and scale of cyber attacks. By proactively investing in security and leveraging AI for defense, we can enhance our resilience. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nBiological defense. Advances in AI and biotechnology are removing barriers to the development and design of biological weapons, which could cause millions of deaths and trillions in economic damage. How can we prevent the worst outcomes without slowing down beneficial research? Potential projects in this space include:\n\nVerification and evaluation. AI challenges traditional technology-policy frameworks because it lacks many of the typical characteristics they address, like concrete physical forms, easily isolated components, and straightforward version control. To mitigate these problems, we need new methods for the verification of pertinent AI system characteristics (e.g., proving that certain data was used to train a model) and the measurement science of AI system capabilities and propensities (e.g., determining whether a benchmark accurately the risk-relevant properties it claims to). At the same time, these methods will not be effective if they leak or extract other critical information from the systems they are probing. Well-designed and privacy-preserving tools of this kind can enable a world in which governments can trust industry to manage this technology, and nations can credibly signal that their AI capabilities do not pose threats to international security. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nAlignment and control. AI systems demonstrate sophisticated, unintended behaviors as well as the capacity to evade human oversight. As AI agents take on more and more consequential tasks and play a greater role in our personal lives, the risks from alignment and control failures increase. These dangers could compound significantly as coding agents become more integral to AI development. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nOther potential directions. The former categories are not an exhaustive list of ideas we are interested in. Some other promising areas we would like to receive proposals for include:\n\nWhat tools, technologies, organizations, or policies are needed to help society adapt to rapid AI-driven change while preserving human agency, individual freedoms, and democratic institutions?\n\nThe development of advanced AI would alter the very foundations of social and economic life. Translating AI’s potential into widespread flourishing requires forward-looking institutions12 and infrastructure — technological, organizational, and governmental — that can establish shared facts, coordinate at scale, and make rapid, well-informed decisions. Yet most existing systems were not built for the speed and complexity that AI enables, and markets lack the incentives to update some of these systems for this new reality. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nIncreasing state capacity. Governments are slow-moving institutions, but it is imperative for them to respond quickly and competently to rapid AI progress. In a world of rapidly advancing AI, the US government has a crucial role to play as an enforcer of law and order, provider of public goods, and the R&D lab of the world.\n\nEpistemic integrity. AI dramatically lowers the cost of generating large volumes of apparently high-quality content, straining our ability to distinguish facts from fiction or propaganda. However, new infrastructure designed to establish ground truths, incorporate a variety of viewpoints in well-organized discussions, and analyze large amounts of data can create a more dynamic marketplace of ideas than ever before. We should be wary of interventions that give any one person, company, or interest group the power to adjudicate what is true and what isn’t — distributed solutions like Community Notes could instead provide less-brittle alternatives. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nCoordination. The costs of coordination — identifying counterparties, becoming informed, negotiating priorities and agreements, and ensuring adherence to terms — mean that many mutually beneficial agreements between people in the world never actually get made. Likewise, the cost of coordination hinders many individuals’ ability to participate in the governance decisions that affect their lives. AI could greatly reduce the costs of coordination, enabling individuals to reach positive-sum outcomes and directly participate in governance at unprecedented scale.\n\nBuilding resources to maintain human agency. In recent history, people have maintained economic and political power because they were needed as workers, taxpayers, soldiers, and voters whose cooperation institutions depended on. As advanced AI automates increasingly large parts of the economy, the risk goes beyond broad unemployment — it’s that as people lose economic leverage, their institutional leverage will suffer too. If institutions can function without broad human participation, they may become less responsive to human needs. Markets and governments will likely produce some tools for adaptation, but may do so unevenly or too slowly to keep pace with AI progress. We’re interested in projects that help people maintain economic relevance and institutional leverage even as advanced AI automates large parts of the workforce.\n\nWe believe this effort is critical, but we are unsure as to what the most promising proposals in this area may be. Proposals in this category should make an especially strong case for why markets or other institutions won’t provide the solution fast enough by default. Possible proposals in this area include concrete programs to help people rapidly adapt their skills; human-in-the-loop tooling to enable workers to efficiently supervise, direct, and collaborate with AI systems at machine speed; and benefits-sharing programs or policies to ensure the broad automation of labor benefits the general population.\n\nOther potential directions. The above categories are not an exhaustive list of ideas we are interested in. Some other promising areas we would like to receive proposals for include:\n\nAcknowledgements: Thank you to Gaurav Sett, Non-Resident Fellow at IFP, for closely consulting on this piece.\n\nMore details under “Who should submit a pitch?”\n\nAI could unlock treatments to the most debilitating human diseases. But some of these fundamental breakthroughs will lack clear commercial incentives or face other barriers. If AI greatly accelerates science, unaddressed bottlenecks will become especially acute, and proactively eliminating these bottlenecks will become especially important.\n\nAI could unlock treatments to the most debilitating human diseases. But some of these fundamental breakthroughs will lack clear commercial incentives or face other barriers. If AI greatly accelerates science, unaddressed bottlenecks will become especially acute, and proactively eliminating these bottlenecks will become especially important.\n\nWe also submitted these proposals to the American Science Acceleration Project RFI, bound them into a beautiful book, and are sending copies to all 535 offices in Congress.\n\nSubmissions to the FDA for drug approval, which collectively form one of the most exhaustive repositories of real-world scientific practice and regulatory negotiation ever assembled, and thus a rich resource for AI to be trained on.\n\nWhile the original Launch Sequence proposals were primarily aimed at the US government, we’re broadening our focus to include projects that can move forward just with philanthropic support. Given our new focus on providing shovel-ready ideas for funders, we will dedicate many more resources to vetting and refining project proposals than we did in the past.\n\nStill, the US government can play a powerful role in implementing many proposals at scale, and we are excited to support proposals that require or benefit from government action.\n\nThis should be interpreted broadly, for example: a pitch for an organization to manufacture next-gen personal protective equipment (PPE) to increase society’s resilience against pandemics would be in scope. This is because future AI may democratize access to the knowledge and tools needed to create engineered viruses, thus increasing our baseline pandemic risk.\n\nExamples with links to existing Launch Sequence project plans:\n\n1. Cases where AI creates/worsens a problem (e.g., biosecurity, offensive cybersecurity, AI sleeper agents, securing AI model weights)\n\n2. Cases where AI can be/support the solution (e.g., automating scientific replication, pathogen detection via metagenomics and ML, AI-powered code refactoring)\n\n3. Cases where AI makes something newly feasible, which will not be done fast enough by default (connectome mapping, self-driving labs)\n\nNote: You will be eligible for this bounty if: (1) we first learn about a particular project idea based on your pitch, and (2) you selected “I just want to submit an idea” in the application form, and (3) we then publish a full project plan based on your initial pitch.\n\nWe will ultimately determine whether we had already considered a project idea, or whether your pitch was the first time we encountered it. Only one person will be eligible for the “idea scout bounty” for every piece we publish.\n\nIf you're proposing a new research group or institution, we are excited to help accelerate the potential founder. If you're proposing a government program, we are excited to make the right connections and help the author make it happen.\n\nWe’ll aim to respond to initial pitches within a few weeks of submission, to allow time for us to investigate the area and consult with our advisors and domain experts.\n\n“Institutions” in this RFP should be interpreted broadly, as “the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic, and social interaction.”",

That context matters because a lot of what I’m about to share probably won’t work if you’re selling complex B2B software to a narrow ICP.\n\nThis post isn’t a guide on everything we tried. We tried a lot of things that didn’t work. I’ll focus on the only thing that worked, and why it worked. I’m happy to answer questions in the comments if you want to go deeper.\n\nLike most people, our first instinct was influencers, just find people in that niche, and leverage their audience. But we failed, for several reasons.\n\nOne big reason was the budget. Influencer marketing only really works when you can place many bets. You need enough volume to discover the 10% of creators that will drive 90% of results. That usually means spending $10k–$15k a month just on experimentation and wasting 90% of the budget in the first couple of months. I couldn’t afford that luxury.\n\nSo we tried what most early founders do. We placed one or two bets and hoped we’d get lucky and we didn’t. Even when one video went viral, the ROI to paid was zero. Out of curiosity, I cross-referenced one of the creators with another YC founder to see if the post they made for them worked. Same story there.\n\nWe even tried bringing an influencer in-house for $1,000 a month to post once daily. The average video got about 200 views, and there were no breakouts. We also tried Whop and clipping, too, and it didn’t really help.\n\nEventually, we copied a carousel concept we saw from another brand that was basically like a meme. It had 157k views.\n\nMassive engagement. And absolutely nothing happened to our business.\n\nVirality is its own game. You’re either great at it or terrible at it, and luck plays a huge role.\n\nViral entertainment content doesn’t reliably convert, especially if it doesn’t map to intent.\n\nOne thing we did early that ended up mattering a lot was adding a simple “How did you find us?” question during signup.\n\nThis gave us a baseline. If TikTok showed up consistently as a source, we’d keep going. If not, we’d kill it. That decision alone probably saved us months of guessing.\n\nOne day, I noticed something strange. A post that had completely flopped on day one, ~100 views, started climbing. A week later, it was at ~2,000 views.\n\nThat wasn’t normal, so I checked the analytics.\n\nAlmost 98% of the traffic came from search, not the For You Page (The feed curated by the TikTok algorithm where most viral videos get their views from).\n\nThat’s when it hit me: some people are using TikTok like Google.\n\nThat one post started bringing in ~20 signups and the occasional paid subscription every couple of weeks. Not huge, but real.\n\nThat one post changed how we thought about the platform. Some people also use TikTok the same way they use Google. They search with intent.\n\nWe started looking up keywords relevant to us and creating carousel posts specifically for them. Since we were building a design tool, this was straightforward. We’d write the content for the carousel post, then use AIFlyer to generate the designs for the carousel.\n\nThe next week, we had our next “viral” hit. But again, almost all the views came from search. Around 96% of traffic was from people actively looking for something.\n\nWe started looking up keywords relevant to us and creating carousel posts specifically for them. Since we were building a design tool, this was straightforward.

But again, almost all the views came from search. Around 96% of traffic was from people actively looking for something.\n\nThis time, the conversion was noticeably better.\n\nA keyword like “How to make a flyer on iPhone” isn’t entertainment. It’s intent. This is the same type of keyword people fight over with SEO and pay top dollar for on Google Ads. On TikTok, it was free.\n\nAll we needed was a relevant carousel that subtly showed our product solving the problem.\n\nThe beautiful thing about these posts is that they don’t need to win on day one, compared to viral videos where the video will max out in a week, and once that trend is gone, you have to start hunting for the next miracle.\n\nMost of the screenshots I shared above had 100–300 views on the first day. Then they slowly accumulated views every day as people searched for that keyword.\n\nWhen you build a library of these posts, each serving a specific search intent, it starts to compound.\n\nAt some point, something even crazier happened.\n\nTikTok’s AI started mentioning us in the LLM response.\n\nA friend sent me a screenshot where TikTok’s LLM answered a query and mentioned AIFlyer right after Canva. We hadn’t optimized for this. We didn’t even know it was happening. The model was just pulling from our content and sending people our way.\n\nThat was when it clicked that we weren’t just posting content anymore. We were feeding a system.\n\nOnce we understood the pattern, the next step was obvious.\n\nI built a small AI agent that used the prompts we had manually used to generate all the contents for the carousels that worked, generated content across multiple relevant topics, used AIFlyer to create the designs with templates that converted via function calling, and automated posting.\n\nWe ran ten accounts, posting four times a day. TikTok’s automation API doesn’t allow adding sound, so I assumed this would fail but on average the posts did 4 times better on day 1 than what we had an undergrad student create the contents manually.\n\nAt that point, the math became interesting.\n\nWhat does this look like when you have 1,000 posts per account, each serving a different search keyword, across ten accounts? Even if a single post brings one paid subscriber per day, that’s a completely different growth engine.\n\nEspecially if you’re in the discovery phase, where you just want people to try your product and later identify the power users who cover the economics, the way companies like Lovable or Replit do.\n\nI tied the prompts, the design workflow, and the posting automation into an AI agent.\n\nI remember telling a few founder friends who helped me early on that if this ever worked, I’d share it. This is me keeping that promise.\n\nIf you’re a founder building a consumer or SMB tool and want help setting something like this up, I’m happy to help you think through it.\n\nIf it makes sense, we can talk about using AIFlyer as the design and automation layer. If not, you’ll still leave with something useful.\n\nYou can reach out to me via email [email protected]. I’m genuinely happy to help.",

    "fullText": "More than three years after the launch of ChatGPT, anxiety about artificial intelligence in the workplace remains high—especially among Gen Z—as corporate America pushes for higher productivity from leaner workforces. The U.S.’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, is no exception.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the company’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, admitted he’ll likely employ fewer workers in the next five years—but warned that rushing into AI-driven layoffs without safeguards could backfire, potentially triggering “civil unrest.”\n\nInstead, the 69-year-old said he’d even welcome government bans on replacing masses of workers with AI. But before it gets to that stage, he already has ideas up his sleeve to protect some of the 300,000-plus employees on his payroll.\n\n“I have a plan to retrain people, relocate people, income-assist people,” Dimon said.\n\nDimon pointed to the roughly 2-million-strong commercial trucking industry as an example. A sudden shift to fully autonomous trucking, he said, could displace workers who currently earn well into six figures, leaving them struggling to make ends meet.\n\n“Phase it in. Retrain.” he said. “You can’t lay off 2 million truckers tomorrow. You can phase it in over time.”\n\nAnd if that doesn’t suffice and government intervention is needed to prevent companies from cutting jobs too aggressively, Dimon said he would support it—especially if it comes from local incentives.\n\n“We would agree—if we have to do that to save society,” he said. “Society will have more production. We’re going to cure a lot of cancers. You’re not going to slow it down. How do you have plans in place to make it work better if it does something terrible?”\n\nSo far, job cuts directly tied to AI have been limited; in 2025, just 55,000 positions were eliminated as a result of automation—accounting for more than 75% of all AI-related cuts reported since 2023, according to analysis from recruiting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nHowever, AI leaders like pioneering computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said the worst is yet to come.\n\n“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” the “Godfather of AI” said last September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”\n\nDimon’s contrasting remarks are likely to offer some reassurance to workers, signaling that at least some business leaders recognize that replacing employees with AI—without policies to support those displaced—could have serious social consequences.",

    "description": "“The limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have.\n\nIn a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models.\n\n“I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.”\n\nThe U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech.\n\nTwo massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators.\n\n“We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.”\n\nDuring his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve.\n\nJust as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks.",

    "fullText": "Kristalina Georgieva says research suggests 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected, with many entry-level roles wiped out\n\nArtificial intelligence will be a “tsunami hitting the labour market”, with young people worst affected, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned the World Economic Forum on Friday.\n\nKristalina Georgieva told delegates in Davos that the IMF’s own research suggested there would be a big transformation of demand for skills, as the technology becomes increasingly widespread.\n\n“We expect over the next years, in advanced economies, 60% of jobs to be affected by AI, either enhanced or eliminated or transformed – 40% globally,” she said. “This is like a tsunami hitting the labour market.”\n\nShe suggested that in advanced economies, one in 10 jobs had already been “enhanced” by AI, tending to boost these workers’ pay, with knock-on benefits for the local economy.\n\nMeanwhile people whose jobs were not directly changed by artificial intelligence risked being squeezed, she said, with their pay potentially falling without a productivity boost from AI.\n\n“So the middle class, inevitably, is going to be affected,” Georgieva predicted.\n\nShe said her greatest fear was that AI was insufficiently regulated. “This is moving so fast, and yet we don’t know how to make it safe. We don’t know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it,” she said.\n\nMuch of the debate at the annual meeting of the business and political elite in the Swiss ski resort this week has been hijacked by Donald Trump’s on-off tariff threats over the future of Greenland.\n\nBut many delegates were also keen to highlight the risks and benefits of AI. Christy Hoffman, general secretary of the UNI global union, told the Guardian: “It’s just a basic premise that the point of AI, on the business side, is to increase productivity, therefore lower costs – which will be cutting jobs.”\n\n“I think it’s time to come to terms with that disruption – and how to manage that disruption,” she said, calling for the productivity benefits to be distributed fairly across the economy.\n\n“We want to share in the gains. We’re not going to stop AI, nor do we want to even try – but we don’t want it to just roll over us.” She called on employers to discuss the role of AI tools with workers and their representatives before introducing them.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, warned that AI could lose its “social permission” to compete for resources such as energy, for example, if it failed to generate benefits beyond a few powerful tech firms – such as the rapid development of effective new drugs.\n\nGeorgieva was speaking on a panel alongside the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who warned that the AI boom could be hampered by growing mistrust between rival economies, as the US throws up tariff barriers.\n\n“We are dependent on each other,” she said, pointing out that AI was capital intensive, energy intensive and data intensive. If countries did not work cooperatively and “define the new rules of the game,” she said, there would be less capital and less data. “We are in a bind, lets face it,” she said.\n\nLagarde also sounded the alarm about widening global inequality, highlighting the “disparity that is getting deeper and bigger”.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, urged delegates to face up to a permanent “rupture” in the global economic order, and band together in the face of erratic US trade policy.\n\nBut Lagarde said she was less gloomy. “I’m not exactly on the same page as Mark,” she said. “I’m not sure that we should be talking about rupture. I think we should be talking about alternatives.”",

They now account for roughly 10% of its global headcount.\n\nEY, another Big Four firm, has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nThis week, Deloitte US even did away with the old job titles.\n\nThe firm announced internally that it was renaming all its professionals to better reflect their work.

    "description": "Hisham Alrayes, CEO of GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models to spread AI's gains across its economy.",
    "fullText": "Open source — that might be the clearest signal of how China wants artificial intelligence to reshape its economy.\n\nHisham Alrayes, the group CEO of Bahrain-based GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models and broad deployment to spread AI's gains across the economy, instead of funneling them to a few tech giants.\n\nSpeaking at a Davos panel on China's \"AI+ Economy\" strategy on Wednesday, Alrayes said the country's approach reflects a fundamentally different economic philosophy.\n\n\"You look at the open structure of the China AI philosophy — then you have the non-open structure,\" Alrayes said. \"That signals that the benefit they want to see is to trickle down into the economy, into the companies.\"\n\nChina's most prominent AI breakout, DeepSeek, reflects that philosophy.\n\nIt mostly uses open-source models that have drawn global attention, in contrast to many large US language models that remain closed and proprietary, reaping the benefits of tightly controlled commercial ecosystems.\n\nMeta's former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, has said that a key reason behind DeepSeek's success is its open-source model, which, he said, can outperform proprietary models in terms of efficiency and innovation by building on shared research.\n\nMeanwhile, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said that China's open-source AI models could gain an edge globally because they're free, making them more attractive than costly proprietary US systems for governments and countries that can't afford closed models.\n\nSimilarly, Alrayes said, China — in pursuing the open model — is aiming for affordability and scale.\n\n\"It's not the benefit of that company, of that product, the return of that individual. It's not an individual — it's an economy,\" Alrayes said.\n\nThat philosophy is reflected in China's national \"AI Plus\" action plan, which prioritizes diffusion, said fellow panelist Gong Ke, executive director of the Chinese Institute for New Generation AI Development Strategies at Nankai University.\n\nThe policy, he said, focuses on embedding AI across manufacturing, healthcare, finance, education, and other sectors, rather than on breakthroughs such as artificial general intelligence.\n\nHe added that the plan sets explicit adoption targets, with AI agents and intelligent terminals expected to reach 70% penetration by 2027 and 90% by 2030.\n\nAlrayes said China's open-source tilt ultimately reflects a broader goal: making AI an economic utility rather than a profit center for a small group of companies.\n\n\"China is looking to create value throughout the economy, very clear, with very specific objectives across the economy,\" he said. \"Not just as a benefit to those companies. This is the difference in the philosophy.\"",

Here are his highlights:\n\nQ: What was the biggest tech thing that was talked about at Davos this year?\n\nIt's hard to compete with President Trump and Greenland, but aside from that, AI was what everyone was talking about.\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about when businesses will start to see productivity gains that justify their huge AI spend and whether we are in a bubble.\n\nQ: What tech discussion/theme surprised you at Davos?\n\nWalking down the main thoroughfare in Davos is always a highlight because all the shops that are open the rest of the year are taken over this week by companies that host \"houses\" to showcase their brands and host clients and events.\n\nIt is interesting to see who's here and who's not.\n\nDavos is not a tech conference, and I've usually thought of it as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies.\n\nWalking along the street this year, 80% of the houses were tech. Palantir and Meta (with its free hot chocolate stand) had the most visible presence. Amazon's house was surprisingly small. Google was far away from the main action. Lightspeed was the only venture capital firm I saw, with its odd retro \"Lighthouse.\"\n\nIt is also interesting to see who was not here. OpenAI has no house, and Sam Altman did not come, though some executives are here. Elon Musk was not originally part of the program but was a last-minute addition on Thursday.\n\nQ: What was the tone of the tech executives and tech investors there?\n\nIf executives and investors are worried about the future, they did not share that with me or on stage.\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang described what is happening with AI as \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" and not only that, but said it will drive job creation across the global economy.\n\nQ: What was the biggest concern expressed by tech executives and tech investors at Davos this year?\n\nWhile optimism ruled the week, the fear of being in an AI bubble was on everyone's mind.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella warned onstage Tuesday that there would be a bubble if the only companies using AI are other AI companies.\n\n\"For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,\" Nadella said.\n\nHuang cited the rising rental price of computer chips as evidence that we are not in a bubble.\n\n\"If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs,\" he said.\n\nAnother concern from tech executives I spoke to was how hard it is to hire and retain top talent right now, especially as big AI labs spend like drunken sailors to hire.\n\n\"It's astronomical amounts of money at the big level,\" Winston Weinberg, CEO and co-founder of Harvey, told me. He said he spends 70% of his time on hiring.\n\n\"I'm super involved, and I think it's the most important thing at our company right now, Weinberg said.\n\nQ: Anything else tech folks should know from your time there?\n\nThere were so many techies here that sometimes I felt like I was in San Francisco.\n\nI asked a couple of startup founders why they came so far to be here, and the consensus was that there's nothing like Davos for the efficiency of meeting potential customers and investors who are all packed into a tiny Swiss village for the week.\n\nWaiting in the cold in a long line for a party for General Catalyst and Lightspeed, I asked one founder why he traveled here.\n\nHe told me Alexandr Wang, founder and former CEO of Scale AI, who is now chief AI officer at Meta, advised him Davos was highly useful because Wang last year said he signed almost a third of Scale's customers in the short time he was here.\n\nWeinberg told me that dealmaking started even before I arrived, with many transactions happening in the business-class sections of flights to Zurich from San Francisco and New York.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",
