    "description": "Would you trust a medical system whose only metric was “which doctor wins the Internet?” No, you'd call that malpractice. Yet that's LMArena.",
    "fullText": "Would you trust a medical system measured by: which doctor would the average Internet user vote for?\n\nYet that malpractice is LMArena.\n\nThe AI community treats this popular online leaderboard as gospel. Researchers cite it. Companies optimize for it and set it as their North Star. But beneath the sheen of legitimacy lies a broken system that rewards superficiality over accuracy.\n\nIt's like going to the grocery store and buying tabloids, pretending they're scientific journals.\n\nHere's how LMArena is supposed to work: enter a prompt, evaluate two responses, and mark the best. What actually happens: random Internet users spend two seconds skimming, then click their favorite.\n\nThey're not reading carefully. They're not fact-checking, or even trying.\n\nThis creates a perverse reward structure. The easiest way to climb the leaderboard isn't to be smarter; it’s to hack human attention span. We’ve seen over and over again in the data, both from datasets that LMArena has released and the performance of models over time, that the easiest way to boost your ranking is by:\n\nIt doesn't matter if a model completely hallucinates. If it looks impressive – if it has the aesthetics of competence – LMSYS users will vote for it over a correct answer.\n\nWhen you optimize for engagement metrics, you get madness.\n\nEarlier this year, Meta tuned a version of Maverick to dominate the leaderboard. If you asked it “what time is it?”, you got:\n\nVoilà: bold text, emojis, and plenty of sycophancy – every trick in the LMArena playbook! – to avoid answering the question it was asked.\n\nIt wasn't just Maverick. We analyzed 500 votes from the leaderboard ourselves. We disagreed with 52% of them, and strongly disagreed with 39%.\n\nThe leaderboard optimizes for what feels right, not what is right. Here are two emblematic examples of LMArena users punishing factual accuracy:\n\nIn the world of LMArena, confidence beats accuracy and formatting beats facts.\n\nInstead of rigorous evaluators, we have people with the attention span of the average TikTok user determining which AI models shape the industry.\n\nWhy is LMArena so easy to game? The answer is structural.\n\nThe system is fully open to the Internet. LMArena is built on unpaid labor from uncontrolled volunteers. There's no incentive for those volunteers to be thoughtful. No quality control. No one gets kicked off for repeatedly failing to detect hallucinations.\n\nWhen LMArena’s leaders speak publicly, they talk about the various techniques they use to overcome the fact that their input data is low quality. They admit their workers prefer emojis and length over substance. So the LMArena system, they proudly tell us, includes a variety of corrective measures.\n\nThey're attempting alchemy: conjuring rigorous evaluation out of garbage inputs.\n\nBut you can't patch a broken foundation.\n\nWhen the entire industry optimizes for a metric that rewards “hallucination-plus-formatting” over accuracy, we get models optimized for hallucination-plus-formatting.\n\nThis isn't a minor calibration problem. It's fundamental misalignment between what we're measuring and what we want: models that are truthful, reliable, and safe.\n\nThe AI industry needs rigorous evaluation. We need leaders who prioritize accuracy over marketing. We need systems that can't be gamed by bolding more aggressively.\n\nLMArena is none of these things. And as long as we pretend it is, we're dragging the entire field backward.\n\nPeople often say they can’t avoid LMArena.\n\n\"We have to optimize for it. We have to sell our models. The leaderboard shows customers which model is best, and we have to play the game.\"\n\nBut the best products have principles they stick to.\n\nThis is the brutal choice every model builder must eventually make:\n\nThe choice is real. It’s hard. But we’ve seen some frontier labs hold the line.\n\nThey stuck to their values. They ignored the gamified rankings. And users loved their models anyway – because hype eventually dies and quality is the only metric that survives the cycle.\n\nYou are your objective function. Which path will each lab choose?",

The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages.",

    "description": "Keeper, founded in 2022, raised $4 million in pre-seed funding. Here's the startup's current pitch deck.",
    "fullText": "Keeper, an AI matchmaking startup, thinks it can help deliver your \"soulmate\" to you. And if it can't, it'll let you know.\n\n\"We're saying we actually know who could be your soulmate or not,\" Jake Kozloski, Keeper's CEO, told Business Insider. \"We're not going to waste your time and pretend that a hundred thousand of these people could be. We'll tell you no.\"\n\nFounded in 2022, the dating platform uses layers of algorithms and AI models to match people who The startup is now disclosing for the first time, exclusively to Business Insider, that it raised a $4 million pre-seed investment in October 2024, led by Lightbank and Lakehouse Ventures. Goodwater Capital and Champion Hill Ventures participated in the round, among others.\n\nInvestors \"see AI as an inflection point in the dating app landscape\" and an opportunity to \"disrupt the incumbents,\" Kozloski said.\n\nKeeper isn't the only startup attempting to shake up the online dating market. Other AI matchmaking apps, such as Sitch and Amata, have raised millions to build next-generation dating apps. Dating app incumbents like Tinder and Bumble are also making plays with AI-powered experiences.\n\nKozloski said the company's values were another piece of its pitch that attracted some investors.\n\n\"They feel like there's a marriage crisis adjacent to the whole Elon Musk fertility crisis stuff that he talks about,\" said Kozloski, who described Keeper as being \"friendly with the pronatalist movement.\"\n\nWanting kids, though, isn't a requirement to use Keeper, Kozloski added.\n\nSince launching, Keeper has had more than 1.5 million sign-ups, and about 300,000 of those have made accounts, Kozloski said. Among that pool, there have been a \"small number\" of matches. Keeper didn't share exactly how many matches it's made, but according to its pitch deck, 10% of dates from its beta version resulted in marriage. With its funding, Keeper has been building out its matchmaking technology over the past year.\n\nKeeper is limited to heterosexual couples right now, and doesn't offer explicit options for different gender identities.\n\n\"We basically have to build a new algorithm for homosexual relationships, which we're happy to do and we will do eventually, but for now, we want to get to product market fit with our core product first,\" Kozloski said. \"Frankly, heterosexual relationships, especially for finding life partnership, seems to be a bigger market, a stronger market for us right now.\"\n\nMaking a profile on Keeper is a sit-down process. The initial form to make an account asks for the standard details of many dating apps (like your age or height), as well as academic test scores (including SATs), your career ambitions, salary, and net worth. It even encourages taking an external personality test. After you fill out the initial onboarding questionnaire, there are 13 more steps, ranging from uploading photos to sharing your philosophy on love.\n\n\"We don't let our users create their own profiles,\" Kozloski said. Keeper uses the information it gathers to curate a profile for you.\n\nKozloski said Keeper uses a non-AI algorithm first to streamline potential matches, focusing on data points like age range initially.\n\n\"We use LLMs once we have your top hundred that our other algorithms have identified,\" he said. \"The LLMs are trained on our matchmaking insights that we've learned so far, and so they can narrow down those last hundred and do the final pass of, 'OK, who actually is worth offering among these.'\"\n\nSome of the AI matchmaking comes into play when analyzing \"general attractiveness\" and users' specific attributes, like baldness or hair color, Kozloski said. The startup has also partnered with a team of researchers at Stanford, Kozloski said, who help train the LLMs (Keeper provides anonymized data to the research team).\n\nHowever, Keeper isn't fully automated, and for the time being, includes human matchmakers in the process. If there's a match, Keeper connects the two people over text message.\n\nThe startup has a complicated payment structure with a hefty price tag — but only for men.\n\nKeeper has male users sign a \"marriage bounty\" that typically costs $50,000 (if the user gets married) and has them pay $5,000 for any dates from the service (the date fees go toward the total bounty cost, Kozloski said).\n\nRead the most recent version of Keeper's pitch deck.\n\nNote: Keeper has shared an updated version of its pitch deck, which it is now sharing with investors, that includes new details since its raise in October 2024. Some details have been redacted.\n\nKeeper describes the matchmaking market as \"old school yet shockingly massive,\" per the slide.\n\n\"With the opportunity to 10x,\" the slide says. \"When technology provides perfect matches, matchmaking will be the best way to meet your partner.\"\n\n\"The AI matchmaker that will introduce you to your soulmate on the first match,\" the slides says. It also includes product imagery.\n\n\"Our v1 worked extremely well,\" the slide says.\n\nIt says that 10% of dates lead to marriage.\n\nIt says it has had 1.5 million sign-ups. \"This makes us the largest pool of any traditional matchmaker,\" the slides says. It lists competitors like Tawkify, Keeper, Ditto, Sitch, and Known Dating.\n\n\"Everyone signs up if we deliver soulmates on the first match,\" the slide says.\n\n\"The first mover quickly becomes a monopoly,\" it says.\n\nToban Wiebe: Co-Founder, Head of AI\n\nHere are the names of the researchers:\n\n\"We're raising to scale profitable human-in-the-loop matchmaking to $2M in annual revenue,\" the slide says.\n\n\"80% of young singles want to get married,\" the slide says. \"40% actually will.\" It cites data from Match Group and data scientist Allen Downey.\n\nDating apps are \"bad at creating relationships, worth billions,\" the slide says. \"Imagine the value of the first product that's great at it.\"\n\n\"Matchmakers can't scale,\" the slide says.\n\n\"LLMs and vision models enable scalable matchmaking for the first time in history,\" the slides says.\n\n\"We've built the most accurate process in the world,\" the slide says.\n\nHere are the steps the slide lays out:\n\n\"We earn more, faster, by aligning with users' incentives,\" the slide says.\n\nIts current model, which has humans involved in matchmaking, is free for women and costs men $5,000 per date. For male users, the marriage bounty costs $50,000, and the slide says that Keeper has contracted $14 million \"so far.\"\n\nKeeper outlines that in a future model, where the tech is fully automated, dates will cost $250, and the marriage bounty contract will cost $5,000.",

Paid users will have access to GPT-5.1 for three months under legacy models before it is sunsetted.\n\n\"We deploy GPT‑5.2 gradually to keep ChatGPT as smooth and reliable as we can,\" the company said.\n\nThe company also touted its gains in agentic coding ability.\n\n\"Even without the ability to do new things like output polished files, GPT-5.2 feels like the biggest upgrade we've had in a long time. Curious to hear what you think!\" OpenAI CEO Altman wrote on X.\n\nOpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo said more changes will be coming next year once OpenAI rolls out age verification across ChatGPT. She said an \"adult mode\" for the chatbot will debut in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThe release comes just over a week after Altman declared a \"code red\" in a private message to employees, marshaling more resources to ChatGPT amid increasing competition from Google and other companies.\n\n\"Code reds are not uncommon,\" Somo said during an interview on TBPN, adding that the hosts could \"be the judge\" of the results of Altman's declaration. She said she was \"pretty proud of\" GPT-5.2's advances, even though its development pre-dated the \"code red.\"\n\nGoogle has been considered by many in tech to be gaining, if not surpassing, OpenAI in the AI race with its recent release of Gemini 3.\n\nThe announcement also occurred hours after OpenAI brokered a major deal with Disney, which secured a $1 billion investment and access to the media giant's lucrative and popular IP.\n\n\"It has been a very cool last 10 years; OpenAI has been more special to work on than I could have possibly imagined,\" Altman wrote on X on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "Disney is losing the war for attention. Can its blockbuster OpenAI licensing deal change the momentum on the battlefield?\n\nSoon, you'll be able to use OpenAI products, such as ChatGPT and the video generator Sora, to create content featuring Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, and Darth Vader.\n\nCEO Bob Iger said the move would let Disney take advantage of a fast-growing area of entertainment.\n\nIger said initially Disney would \"curate some of the videos that have been created on the Sora platform and put them onto Disney+, which we think is a great way to increase engagement with our Disney+ users, particularly the younger users.\" Iger said eventually the company wants users to create AI videos within Disney+ itself.\n\nThere's a key word in Iger's comment that signals why Disney might be particularly motivated to make this deal: engagement.\n\nTime people spend on Disney's and other leading streaming services has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, while YouTube and social video have grown. Disney's share of US TV viewership for its streaming services — including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ — has been stuck at around 4.8% this year, according to Nielsen. YouTube is the top streaming platform on TVs, with a nearly 13% share in October, and its lead has been widening.\n\nData from analytics firm Luminate showed that engagement with Disney+'s original content fell to a 3% share of US viewing time in the third quarter of 2025. That's down from 9% three years earlier, the largest decline among paid streamers.\n\nDisney has been highly protective of its famous characters and favors keeping people on its own platforms. This stance has made it difficult for the company to capitalize on the rise of user-generated content. And it's losing its monopoly on its core constituency, kids, as they increasingly watch YouTube over Disney+.\n\nTraditional media companies are struggling to grow, so they're trying to figure out new ways to get people to engage with their content, whether it be games, live events, or fan content creation, media analyst Doug Shapiro, a senior advisor at BCG, recently told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's a zero-sum game they're losing, and it's only going to get worse,\" he said. \"I think they're all asking themselves, how can they have a deeper relationship with fans?\"\n\nDisney invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite maker Epic Games last year and struck a deal with Webtoon to create a new digital platform for Disney's comics, including Marvel and Star Wars. Outside Disney, Netflix is opening Netflix Houses, mini theme parks in malls that let people enter the worlds of its popular shows. Amazon has backed Fable Studios, a startup that has an AI streaming platform that lets users make their own shows and play with existing IP.\n\nJohn Attanasio, CEO of Toonstar, a tech-driven animation studio, said Disney's IP is so popular that the Sora videos could help drive more audience. He thought Disney could potentially charge for access to AI tools on Disney+ or use the Sora videos to discover franchise extensions.\n\n\"UGC, when it's so specific, the reach is limited,\" he said. \"But when you use known IP, that expands the potential audience.\"\n\nDisney fans and Hollywood insiders had mixed reactions to the OpenAI news.\n\nShae Noble, a Disney superfan in her late 30s, said she could see herself sending birthday messages or making fan videos of the characters interacting in interesting ways — especially if it were integrated into Disney+.\n\n\"I've already seen some of the negative impacts of AI and people pushing it too far to create harmful images,\" she added. \"So it's smart of them to be proactive about it.\"\n\nSome in Hollywood worried about the risks to professional creators.\n\nFor one thing, the deal puts the emphasis on existing IP rather than making new content, Toonstar's Attanasio said.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America came out swinging against the deal, and said it planned to meet with Disney to explore how much the pact would let user-generated videos use the work of its members.\n\nSam Tung, a storyboard artist and cochair of the Animation Guild's AI committee, wondered if OpenAI's guardrails would be strong enough to protect Disney's IP, recalling a widely publicized incident earlier this year when Fortnite users used AI to make the Darth Vader character swear. He also doubted the UGC would move the needle on engagement.\n\n\"I think what audiences want is high-quality stuff to watch with your family,\" Tung said.\n\nJames Faris contributed reporting.",

    "title": "How OpenAI's Latest Model Will Impact ChatGPT",
    "description": "GPT-5.2 is here, and, according to OpenAI, better than ever.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is having a hell of a day. First, the company announced a $1 billion equity investment from Disney, alongside a licensing deal that will let Sora users generate videos with characters like Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker, and Simba. Shortly after, OpenAI revealed its latest large language model: GPT-5.2.\n\nOpenAI says that this new GPT model is particularly useful for \"professional knowledge work.\" The company advertises how GPT-5.2 is better than previous models at making spreadsheets, putting together presentations, writing code, analyzing pictures, and working through multi-step projects. For this model, the company also gathered insights from tech companies: Supposedly, Notion, Box Shopify, Harvey, and Zoom all find GPT-5.2 to have \"state-of-the-art long-horizon reasoning,\" while Databricks, Hex, and Triple Whale believe GPT-5.2 to be \"exceptional\" with both agentic data science and document analysis tasks.\n\nBut most of OpenAI's user base aren't professionals. Most of the users who will interact with GPT-5.2 are using ChatGPT, and many of those for free, at that. What can those users expect when OpenAI upgrades the free version of ChatGPT with these new models?\n\nOpenAI says that GPT-5.2 will improve ChatGPT's \"day to day\" functionality. The new model supposedly makes the chatbot more structured, reliable, and \"enjoyable to talk to,\" though I've never found the last part to be necessarily true.\n\nGPT-5.2 will impact the ChatGPT experience differently depending on which of the three models you happen to be using. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 Instant is for \"everyday work and learning.\" It's apparently better for questions seeking information about certain subjects, how-to questions and walkthroughs, technical writing, and translations—maybe ChatGPT will get you to give up your Duolingo obsession.\n\nGPT-5.2 Thinking, however, is supposedly made for \"deeper work.\" OpenAI wants you using this model for coding, summarizing lengthy documents, answering queries about files you send to ChatGPT, solving math and logic problems, and decision making. Finally, there's GPT-5.2 Pro, OpenAI's \"smartest and most trustworthy option\" for the most complicated questions. The company says 5.2 Pro produces fewer errors and stronger performance compared to previous models.\n\nOpenAI says that this latest update improves how the models responds to distressing prompts, such as those showing signs of suicide, self-harm, or emotional dependence on the AI. As such, the company says this model has \"fewer undesirable responses\" in GPT-5.2 Instant and Thinking compared to GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking. In addition, the company is working on an \"age prediction model,\" which will automatically place content restrictions on users who the model think are under 18.\n\nThese safety improvements are important—critical, even—as we start to understand the correlations between chatbots and mental health. The company has admitted its failure in \"recognizing signs of delusion,\" as users turned to the tool for emotional support. In some cases, ChatGPT fed into delusional thinking, encouraging people's dangerous beliefs. Some families have even sued companies like OpenAI over claims that their chatbots helped or encouraged victims commit suicide.\n\nActively acknowledging improvements to user safety is undoubtedly a good thing, but I think companies like OpenAI still have a lot to reckon with—and a long way to go.\n\nOpenAI says GPT-5.2 Instant, Thinking, and Pro will all roll out today, Thursday, Dec. 11, to paid plans. Developers can access the new models in the API today, as well.\n\nDisclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "fullText": "Agreement comes amid anxiety in Hollywood over impact of AI on the industry, expression and rights of creators\n\nWalt Disney has announced a $1bn equity investment in OpenAI, enabling the AI startup’s Sora video generation tool to use its characters.\n\nUsers of Sora will be able to generate short, user-prompted social videos that draw on more than 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars characters as part of a three-year licensing agreement between OpenAI and the entertainment giant.\n\nThe agreement – a landmark deal amid intense anxiety in Hollywood over the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of entertainment – will not cover talent likenesses or voices.\n\nBob Iger, Disney’s CEO, hailed a deal which paired his firm’s “iconic stories and characters” with OpenAI’s AI technology. It will place “imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we’ve never seen before”, he claimed.\n\nThe deal is OpenAI’s most prominent move into Hollywood after a contentious rollout of Sora and longstanding pushback against AI from many entertainment industry workers. Concerns from writers, actors, visual effects artists and other creatives over AI replacing jobs and using likenesses without consent has led to union protests and copyright lawsuits against AI companies.\n\nWhen OpenAI launched its latest iteration of Sora earlier this year, it immediately ran into a slew of potential copyright issues, as feeds became dominated by videos featuring characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants or Pikachu – sometimes generated to appear in Nazi-like clothing.\n\nRacist depictions of Martin Luther King Jr prompted OpenAI to ban the use of his likeness on the platform, while the daughter of Malcolm X called seeing her father’s image on Sora “deeply disrespectful and hurtful”.\n\nDisney itself has also been concerned over the unauthorized use of its characters by generative AI platforms. The company sent a stern cease-and-desist letter to the Character.AI chatbot firm in October, alleging that the platform was “blatantly infringing on Disney’s copyrights” through using the likeness of its characters.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, attorneys representing Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, demanding that the technology company’s AI systems stop alleged infringement, Variety reported.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, has been on a charm offensive that included a recent appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the US talkshow. On Thursday, he touted the firm’s deal with Disney as proof that artificial intelligence companies could partner with the entertainment sector.\n\n“This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences,” Altman said.\n\nIn addition to Disney letting its characters appear in Sora, the company will also use OpenAI’s application programming interfaces to build new products and tools, becoming a major customer of the ChatGPT maker. A selection of the videos made by users on Sora will also be available for streaming on the Disney+ platform. It will also deploy ChatGPT for its employees, the companies said.\n\n“Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world,” said Iger. “The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - When the chairman of AI chip startup Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s CEO: Lip-Bu Tan.\n\nTan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters.\n\nTan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company.\n\nMeta’s interest spurred Intel to ​make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. The competition for the startup drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion.\n\nMeta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.\n\nThe events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources.\n\nIntel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment.\n\nIntel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a ‌venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.\n\nSince Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said.",

    "description": "AI disrupts ARR: Startups and SaaS firms face new hybrid valuation models as investors prioritize usage, efficiency, and outcome-based metrics.",
    "fullText": "Startups and other tech companies love to boast about \"annual recurring revenue.\" AI could make this metric obsolete, though.\n\nAccording to a new report by consultant AlixPartners, investors are on the cusp of abandoning the traditional ARR-multiple playbook that defined the SaaS era. In its place will emerge hybrid valuation models that reward companies not for the size of their subscription base but for how effectively they use AI to elevate customer outcomes.\n\nFor decades, ARR served as the bedrock for valuing enterprise software firms. It measures revenue from subscriptions by taking the value of current contracts and extrapolating that out over a full year.\n\nAlixPartners now argues that ARR is becoming increasingly \"meaningless\" in an AI-first economy, especially as usage- and outcome-based business models replace the per-seat licenses that have dominated the SaaS industry.\n\nThe big change is related to how expensive AI models are to run. Every time a new AI software service taps into this intelligence, the provider has to pay a per-token price. That makes fixed, per-seat SaaS subscriptions tougher to offer.\n\nThis means revenue could fluctuate \n\nAlixPartners says investors are already shifting focus toward a hybrid valuation approach in the AI era:\n\n• AI leverage ratios — These measure how effectively companies convert AI investments into revenue and margin gains. Rather than rewarding scale for its own sake, investors will reward operational efficiency and automation-driven profitability.\n\n• Outcome-based performance benchmarks — Metrics such as customer margin expansion, reduced task completion time, or increased throughput will matter more than raw seat-based user counts.\n\n• Traditional ARR multiples — Still relevant but no longer sufficient on their own.\n\nNew forecasting metrics, such as \"time to usage,\" \"usage ramp rate,\" and \"usage volatility,\" are emerging to help investors gauge how quickly customers adopt AI features and how stable their consumption patterns are over time.\n\nThe message is clear: In the AI era, value follows impact. Companies that can demonstrate real productivity gains for customers and operational leverage for themselves will earn premium valuations. Those clinging to legacy ARR-driven models risk being left behind as investors pivot to frameworks that better capture the economics of intelligent software.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Getting workers to trust and adopt AI is 'forcing HR people to reinvent themselves'",
    "description": "Workers fear AI, so one of HR's biggest challenges is getting workers to trust and adopt it by building credibility and addressing employee concerns.",
    "fullText": "Corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024, per Stanford research, but that spending won't deliver returns if workers reject the technology.\n\n\"When organizations don't set people up to use AI reliably, employees won't trust it and won't adopt it,\" says Ted F. Tschang, an associate professor of strategic management at Singapore Management University.\n\nIt is the AI paradox facing companies today: as corporate leaders invest billions in AI, many frontline workers remain deeply skeptical for many reasons.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey published earlier this year found that nearly a third believe it will lead to fewer job opportunities for them in the long run. Meanwhile, a survey by the University of Melbourne and KPMG of over 48,000 people across 47 countries found that only 46% of respondents are willing to trust AI systems.\n\nBridging this gap — getting workers to both trust and adopt AI — has become one of HR's most urgent challenges. Becoming comfortable with AI takes time and practice, but most organizations rarely make time for this, Tschang says.\n\n\"That's why HR leaders need to create space for safe learning and experimentation with AI's uses and limits, starting with their own teams,\" Tschang says.\n\nTo do that effectively, HR leaders need to develop AI fluency, meaning they must understand the technology well enough to identify where it can solve real problems and guide their workforce in using it. That's easier said than done.\n\nThe standard purview of HR includes both operational tasks, like recruiting, onboarding, benefits, and compliance, as well as strategic ones like developing talent and managing organizational change. Put simply, it's not a department known for being particularly tech-savvy.\n\nBut in the dawn of the AI era, that's changing, says Heather Conklin, CEO of Torch, a corporate coaching firm that helps companies navigate change, including AI adoption. \"It's forcing HR people to reinvent themselves,\" she says. \"And the ones I see succeeding are the ones who are going first.\"\n\nThese teams are treating their own departments as testing grounds, experimenting with different tools and learning what works and what doesn't, says Conklin. \"They're getting hands-on with AI themselves, even if they're not technical,\" she adds. \"They can't drive it across the company if they haven't lived it. They need to drive it from a place of credibility.\"\n\nThat credibility becomes currency when employees are wary. The CHROs winning people over are leading with problems worth solving, says Dexter Bachelder, CEO of Propel People, an AI recruiting platform for the construction industry.\n\n\"It's not about HR promoting AI. It's about the questions on employees' minds: How can AI do some of my paperwork so that I can leave work earlier and get home to my family faster? How can I automate some of the manual tasks of my job that aren't fun? How can I make this process better or faster?\" Bachelder says.\n\nIn other words, when workers see how AI makes their daily work easier, they're more likely to use it. \"If you solve the employee's problems, you're using the technology for a purpose,\" he says. \"\n\nNothing drives trust and adoption faster than having a coworker explain it. When a foreman explains to another foreman how they use a certain tool in the field —'This is how it works on our project, this is how it could work on yours' — that goes a long way,\" he says. \"It's not from IT or management or HR. It's from a peer, and that's what really drives adoption.\"\n\nPart of HR learning how to work with AI and earning employee confidence means understanding what's no longer working in the organization, and what AI could do to address those gaps.\n\nHR leaders have their own vested interest in this transformation. Many departments have long dealt with inadequate technology, and lots of the tools and processes HR has relied on for years weren't built for this moment, Bachelder says.\n\n\"To some degree, I don't think HR has had a lot of voice in the technology they use because a lot of tools are tied to financial systems,\" he says. \"There's a real opportunity here.\"\n\nTraditional learning management systems, for instance, struggle to keep pace when skills requirements change more frequently than every few years. Yearly engagement surveys can't capture employee sentiment quickly enough to respond to fast-moving organizational changes.\n\nMoreover, performance review cycles designed around annual goal-setting are often disconnected from organizations where priorities change on a quarterly basis. And recruitment systems built to screen for specific technical abilities may miss candidates who have the desired problem-solving skills needed for AI-related roles.\n\nOf course, upgrading HR systems won't entirely solve the trust challenge. Employee fears about job security and algorithmic bias go beyond what any tool can fix. And HR leaders still need to answer employee questions about transparency, fairness, and who's accountable for AI's decisions.\n\n\"It's challenging to do this right now,\" Conklin of Torch says. \"But if HR leaders aren't able to figure this out, they're going to be left behind.\"",

    "description": "AI spending is front and center again for investors. Oracle plunged Thursday, with top hardware makers including Nvidia and Broadcom also dropping.",
    "fullText": "Oracle just raised a fresh red flag for investors worried that tech companies are getting ahead of themselves when it comes it their massive capex spending.\n\nOracle stock plunged 14% on Thursday after the tech giant reported an earnings beat but delivered revenue that was below Wall Street estimates, posting $16.06 billion compared to $16.21 billion expected by analysts. Cloud sales rose 34% from the previous quarter but also fell short of estimates.\n\nImportantly, Oracle also pledged to spend about $15 billion more next year than previously forecast, sparking fresh concerns about aggressive capex among the biggest tech firms.\n\nThe tech titan's stock drop was enough to weigh on other AI names and drag markets lower in Thursday's session.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood at the 9:30 a.m. ET opening bell on Thursday:\n\n• Nasdaq 100: 25,563.72, down 0.8%\n\nOracle stock has been highly volatile lately, dropping almost 20% in the last month after a huge surge following a blockbuster revenue forecast issued in September.\n\nIt's flurry of deals cemented the company as an AI power player, announcing a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, new partnership commitments with both Nvidia and Meta Platforms, and plans to expand its AI and cloud computing infrastructure in booming international markets.\n\nNow Oracle's lackluster earnings are prompting speculation that its big plans in the space are going to take awhile to payoff, and that it's spending plans are too ambitious. Morgan Stanley described the results as a moment when investors might resume their disbelief about the AI trade.\n\n\"Cloud growth at the low-end of the guide with building pressure on gross margins and op margins may further sap investor confidence in ORCL's ability to execute efficiently against a large and growing book of GPUaaS business, leaving the shares lacking a clear catalyst,\" analysts at the bank wrote on Thursday.\n\nSeveral other high-growth AI stocks were pulled down by Oracle's earnings report, dragging down the entire S&P 500 index, which fell 0.31% in premarket hours, while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index rose slightly.\n\nHere are some of the biggest losers on Thursday:\n\nFor many investors, it is likely concerning that a company like Oracle could manage to fall short of analyst estimates after doing so much to position itself as an AI infrastructure leader this year. The key takeaway is likely that the company overpromised on what it could deliver.\n\n\"Oracle faces its own mounting scrutiny over a debt-fueled data center build-out and concentration risk amid questions over the outcome of AI spending uncertainty,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"This revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending.\n\nThe concerns aren't limited to Oracle. While some have recently argued that the biggest AI fears may be overblown, it's possible that if one major tech player overspent on AI in 2025, others may have done the same. This could weigh on investor sentiment around AI as the market heads into 2026.",

    "title": "Meet the young AI startup founders raising millions in the race to build the next big thing",
    "description": "These AI startups founded by bright young minds in their teens and early 20s are disrupting industries and attracting top investors in the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "They are moving fast, raising serious cash, and leaving established paths behind. Across Business Insider's Young Geniuses series, which highlights next-gen leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs, urgency is the constant.\n\nThe AI window has opened, but it may not stay that way for long. That's why these young founders are fleeing college classrooms, skipping dream internships, and leaving full-time roles to take advantage of this moment.\n\nA Stanford graduate student dropped out and raised $64 million for her AI math company. A pair of MIT freshmen dropouts secured $2.7 million for their police tech startup.\n\nThese are just a couple of young founders who are stepping into the AI race at full speed, backed by investors willing to bet early and big, driven by the sense that hesitation costs more than risk.\n\nMeet 16 young founders who spoke with Business Insider this year about their ideas for transforming everything from healthcare and shopping to how we interact with technology and one another. (Ages and figures are accurate to the time of reporting.)\n\nZach Yadegari, 18, sold his first video gaming app at age 16 for almost $100,000 and used the proceeds to fund Cal AI, an AI-powered nutrition app he co-founded.\n\nHe first discovered an interest in coding at a coding camp his parents sent him to when he was 7. For years, he'd spend hours watching people program video games on YouTube and try to emulate them.\n\nHe got the idea for Cal AI while trying to bulk up at the gym and quickly learning that most results come from diet. So, he and his co-founders set out to build a calorie-tracking app that integrates AI technology.\n\nOver the last year and a half, the app has taken off, generating around $30 million in annual revenue and employing a 30-person team, Yadegari told BI reporter Agnes Applegate in October.\n\nCarina Hong, 24, is on a mission to build a superintelligent reasoning system through her AI startup, Axiom Math.\n\nHong, a Rhodes Scholar, dropped out of her graduate studies at Stanford to found the company in March and has since hired top talent across Meta's Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) lab, Meta's GenAI team, and Google Brain.\n\n\"One thing I heard from some of the top researchers and mathematicians I've recruited to Axiom is that solving for mathematical superintelligence will be their legacy,\" Hong told BI reporter Geoff Weiss in December. \"When the problem is hard enough, talent density gets very high, and that makes you a magnet for other great thinkers.\"\n\nAnd Hong isn't only recruiting from Big Tech. She has also hired her former professor, the renowned mathematician Ken Ono.\n\nArlan Rakhmetzhanov, 18, dropped out of high school in Kazakhstan in March 2025 to pursue his AI coding agents startup, Nozomio, at Y Combinator, a startup accelerator for many young founders.\n\nBoth of his parents are entrepreneurs, so his entrepreneurial journey began at a young age. He taught himself coding and built his first company at 15.\n\nHis journey to Y Combinator wasn't easy. He applied twice before finally getting accepted the third time. Even though he didn't have a Stanford PhD, he was told his YC partner selected him because he ships fast, which is critical in the age of AI, he told BI's Weiss in September.\n\nPhoebe Gates, daughter of Bill Gates, and Sophia Kianni launched an AI-powered shopping assistant in April and said it had reached 600,000 users by October, when they spoke with BI's Jordan Hart.\n\nBoth 23 at the time of their interview, Kianni and Gates met as roommates at Stanford University, where they conceived the idea for Phia.\n\nPhia is a free app and browser extension that uses AI to help compare prices on fashion items across tens of thousands of linked sites to help users find deals.\n\nThe duo raised $8 million in a seed funding round in September, led by venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and featuring investors such as Kris Jenner, Hailey Bieber, and Michael Rubin.\n\nToby Brown, 16, has been fascinated with tech from a young age. His parents aren't in tech, but that hasn't stopped him from teaching himself to code everything, from math games to alarm systems.\n\nIn 2023, he developed the concept for his AI project Beem. \"I can't share too much about it,\" he told BI's Joshua Nelken-Zitser in October. \"I hope that if done right, it will redefine how people interact with technology.\"\n\nHe dedicated his summer break 2024 to pitching to firms and other potential investors in London, New York, Silicon Valley, and San Francisco. \"There was nobody to coach me on pitching to investors, so I just took a maniacal approach of bashing away at it until I got the right solution,\" he said.\n\nIn November 2024, he got a call from South Park Commons, founded by some of Facebook's early engineers, saying they wanted to invest $1 million in Beem. Instead of finishing school exams the following year, he left the UK to pursue his project in Silicon Valley.\n\nOne day in her Harvard University dorm room, Alyx van der Vorm felt lonely. Her friends were out of town, and while she could easily open an app to order food or stream a movie, she wanted more. Enter Clyx.\n\nVan der Vorm, 25, founded the social app in 2020 and has since rolled it out in four major cities worldwide: Miami, London, New York, and São Paulo.\n\nClyx is a social app that leverages AI to connect people in real life. It utilizes AI-powered tools to scrape events from across the web, converts those events into meetups within the app, and then helps identify which of your friends are attending the event or matches you with new connections if you don't know anyone going.\n\nAt the time of reporting, Clyx had 50,0000 active users joining events and about 200,000 looking at events, BI's Sydney Bradley reported in September.\n\nMathieu Rihet, 19, saw the inefficiencies of the healthcare system firsthand while working as a medical translator. So, he set out to try and fix some of it.\n\nHe met Georges Casassovici, 18, via his LinkedIn post seeking a non-technical cofounder to build with. Together, the two of them founded Novoflow, an AI startup that builds AI agents for medical clinics to help automate tasks, starting with cancellation recovery and appointment booking.\n\nBoth told BI's Weiss in November that they have no plans to pursue a college degree after leaving school to join Y Combinator's Spring 2025 class.\n\nRudy Arora and Sarthak Dhawan, both 20, met in sixth grade, and by high school, they were coding and building viral apps together, including a Christmas light installation app that made $60,000 in annual revenue one year.\n\nWhen they both started college in 2023, Dhawan said he struggled to take notes and listen to the teacher at the same time. So, he and Arora set out to build an AI-powered notetaking app called Turbo AI. It's attracting 20,000 new users per day, BI's Lakshmi Varanasi reported in November.\n\nSince launching Turbo AI, they've both now dropped out of college and say their startup is on track to earn eight-figures in annual recurring revenue.\n\nCollege juniors Nathaneo Johnson and Sean Hargrow say LinkedIn has become bloated with vanity metrics like follower counts and likes, which distract from the professional qualities that matter when landing a job.\n\nSo, they launched their own AI social network while attending Yale. Skipping the likes and clicks, Series connects professionals over text message. The idea is that it only focuses on who you are and what you can bring to the table, Hargow told BI's Bradley in April.\n\nBalancing college and a startup isn't easy. Johnson later told BI's Nelken Zitser that he often ends up working 120-hour weeks to manage both.\n\nOver the summer, 19-year-old Christine Zhang turned down an internship to spend two months living in a hacker house. There, she built a startup with her college roommate and cofounder, and by the end of the summer, they'd raised $1 million for it.\n\nInstead of returning to Harvard, she's taking a gap year to stay in San Francisco and help scale her startup, which has grown to six people, she told BI's Applegate in October.\n\n\"I miss a lot of things about school. I had to delete my Instagram during the first week of classes so I wouldn't get FOMO. However, I don't regret my decision,\" she said.\n\nEarly this year, Aidan Guo, 19, and Julian Windeck, 23, launched their startup, Attention Engineering, which is essentially a desktop assistant powered by AI to automate everything you do on your computer, much like a \"cursor for everything,\" Guo told BI's Varanasi in November.\n\nGuo said he's on his \"second gap year\" from college. He found encouraging mentors by joining programs like Z Fellows and Emergent Ventures. Ultimately, he decided to forgo Carnegie Mellon and move to the Bay Area to build his startup.\n\nWindeck studied computer science in Germany and at Cambridge University, and then conducted AI research at MIT before deciding academia wasn't for him.\n\nThe two met through mutual friends, discovered they worked well together, and have since raised over $1 million from noteworthy backers, including Lukas Haas, a product manager at Google DeepMind, Marvin von Hagen and Felix Schlegal, the cofounders of Interaction, and Bryan Pellegrino, the cofounder of LayerZero.\n\nJay Neo, 21, has been studying what makes a video go viral since he was a teen.\n\nAt 18, he landed a job with MrBeast, helping make short-form video content and learning the ins and outs of how the YouTube mogul grows his business and popularity. For the last year and a half, however, Neo has been focused on his own AI startup called Palo.\n\nPalo is a content creator's assistant. It utilizes AI to analyze a creator's entire catalog and then writes scripts for short-form videos with related themes, outlining content with storyboards. It also has its own network, where creators can follow one another.\n\nLarge-language AI models \"are a perfect thing not for replacing the creator, but for analyzing every little thing,\" Neo told BI's Bradley in November.\n\nShraman and Shreyas Kar, 19 and 20, participated in hackathons together throughout middle and high school.\n\nThey were busy studying at Stanford when they were accepted to Y Combinator, and seeing their peers take the risk and drop out of Stanford gave them the courage to do so, too.\n\nThey began working on their AI startup, Golpo, while at Stanford. Golpo generates animated explainer videos from documents and prompts. For example, customers can use it to create interactive lessons for school districts or training programs for work.\n\nAs of mid-October, 14,000 people had generated videos with Golpo, Shraman Kar told BI's Weiss.\n\nGeorge Cheng and Dylan Nguyen, both 19, dropped out of MIT as freshmen and raised $2.7 million in seed funding out of Y Combinator for their tech startup Code Four, which aims to arm police officers with AI.\n\nThey say their technology can generate reports from bodycam footage for record-keeping, redact footage and reports for records requests, and generate transcriptions and summaries from video interviews and security footage. Basically, it aims to reduce the time spent on paperwork, allowing officers to dedicate more time in the field.\n\nCode Four is working with 25 police departments, BI's Weiss reported in November. While Code Four uses AI to generate preliminary drafts of reports, officers review and edit them for accuracy, Cheng said.\n\n\"Many of the great AI companies of the next decade are being built right now, and I want to be a part of that,\" Raymond Zhao told BI's Nelken-Zitser in October.\n\nZhao studied math and statistics at the University of Oxford, thinking he wanted to enter the financial sector. However, after an uninspiring internship at Goldman Sachs, Zhao ultimately pursued AI instead.\n\nWhile at Oxford, he joined the venture capital society, which introduced him to a network of VCs, founders, and one of his future cofounders. They've raised about $1 million in pre-seed funding for their AI startup, Structured AI, and are pursuing it further at Y Combinator.\n\nStructured AI builds AI agents that can perform quality control on technical documents and drawings. It's laying the groundwork for the AI workforce for construction design and engineering.\n\nDavid Kobrosky, 26, dropped out of college twice. The first time was to work for businessman and social media personality Gary Vaynerchuk, at his company VaynerX. The second was to launch his own company, Intros AI.\n\nKobrosky said he always thought AI would play a huge role in how humans interact, and that's exactly what Intros AI does. Intros AI was acquired by software company Bevy in July.\n\nCompanies can use Intros AI's product to connect their most active customers to each other, creating a space for knowledge sharing and networking that helps boost their customer retention, BI's Charissa Cheong reported in November.\n\nKobrosky didn't disclose the amount he sold Intros AI for, but he is now an AI product manager at Bevy, earning over $100,000 a year, plus bonuses. \"I think starting and selling a company sets me up for the future in a way that a more traditional path wouldn't have,\" he told Cheong.",

    "description": "Darth Vader and other Disney characters are coming to ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora AI video app as part of a three-year licensing deal.",
    "fullText": "Darth Vader is coming to ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora AI video app.\n\nThe House of Mouse and OpenAI struck a three-year licensing agreement on Thursday to make Disney \"the first major content licensing partner on Sora.\"\n\nIt's also investing $1 billion into the AI pioneer and receiving warrants to purchase additional equity.\n\nShares of Disney climbed over 2% after the opening bell.\n\n\"As part of this new, three-year licensing agreement, Sora will be able to generate short, user-prompted social videos that can be viewed and shared by fans, drawing from a set of more than 200 animated, masked and creature characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars, including costumes, props, vehicles, and iconic environments,\" OpenAI said in a Thursday announcement.\n\nIn addition to striking a licensing deal, Disney is also becoming a \"major customer\" of the AI company, according to the announcement, and buying ChatGPT enterprise licenses for its employees.\n\nWhile Sora, OpenAI's TikTok-like AI video app, has been generating buzz and downloads since its launch earlier this year, users of the company's more popular product, ChatGPT, will also have access to AI versions of Disney's characters as part of the deal.\n\nThe AI-generated Disney characters will be available starting in early 2026.\n\nThe move is likely to prove controversial in Hollywood, where many actors have publicly voiced concern about AI use and concerns over how their likeness is used. Disney and OpenAI stated that \"the agreement does not include any talent likenesses or voices.\"\n\nCreators are core to Disney, and its CEO Bob Iger stressed that the deal represented no threat to creators.\n\n\"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Thursday.\n\n\"The other thing it does is it enables us to be comfortable that Open AI is putting guardrails essentially around how these are used, so that really there's nothing for us to be concerned about from a consumer perspective, meaning this will be a safe environment and a safe way for consumers to engage with our founders in a new way,\" he added.\n\nIger hinted at such a transaction during the company's most recent earnings call, making extensive comments about the potential he sees for AI to enhance Disney's direct-to-consumer strategy. He said the company was having extensive talks with AI companies to protect its IP as well as generate more engagement with users.\n\nHis comments demonstrate how Disney — like other Hollywood players — is looking for new ways for people to interact with its platforms and brands as user-generated content platforms and independent creators gain popularity.\n\nDisney, like those other players, has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content, while YouTube has grown. The bet with AI is that it can get people to spend more time on its platforms by giving them more ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nThe companies hinted as much in the announcement, saying that they would \"collaborate to utilize OpenAI's models to power new experiences for Disney + subscribers.\"\n\nDisney is also wary of the tech's risk to its IP. In June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. The suit is ongoing.\n\nDisney's $1 billion cash infusion comes at a critical time for OpenAI, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $1.4 trillion the AI company has pledged to spend over the next eight years on data centers.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman had previously said that large rights holders would ultimately welcome their content being used on Sora, provided it was done with proper guardrails in place. His comments came after OpenAI stepped up restrictions on the Sora app in the wake of viral user-generated videos depicting SpongeBob as Walter White and Pikachu in \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\n\n\"Most of the rights holders that I've spoken to are actually extremely excited to get their content in here,\" Altman told tech analyst Ben Thompson in October. \"They just want to be able to set more restrictions than they would need for images because videos feel different.\"",

    "description": "AI bubble be damned, the data center bet still looks great according to the top private markets investors. Just be careful who you're leasing to.",
    "fullText": "Concerns of an AI bubble may be mounting, but at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference on Wednesday, the biggest private investors were bullish on their own investments.\n\nBlackstone President Jon Gray said it was the firm's biggest moneymaker. Ares CEO Michael Arougheti said that the firm's international data center investments are accelerating ahead of expectations and boosting revenue expectations. Blue Owl co-CEO Doug Ostrover said the firm is \"incredibly bullish\" on its own data center investments.\n\nAll signs point to a continued investment boon.\n\n\"If you \" Gray said.\n\nApollo CEO Marc Rowan said that no matter where he is in the world, the world's biggest users of \"compute\" (data center capacity) tell him they need more of it.\n\n\"When are they going to get more compute?\" Rowan said. \"No time soon, because there are natural limits and there are energy limits and there are regulatory limits and zoning and everything else.\"\n\nOstrover said he has \"never seen a market\" with this level of supply-demand imbalance, and he sees \"demand accelerating,\" but he doesn't \"see the supply increasing.\"\n\nHowever, behind the excitement, the industry's biggest investors are mulling over the risk they can't capture right now — whether leases for these data centers will be renewed 15 to 20 years from now.\n\nRowan, looking at the present situation with his \"credit hat\" on, said, \"The risk I'm prepared to take is lease-up risk,\" Rowan said. \"The risk I'm not prepared to take is renewal risk.\"\n\nRowan said he has a chart on the wall of his office that compares different big consulting firms' projections of energy usage in 2030, and the \"spread is like a child throwing darts.\"\n\n\"The experts in this have no idea on energy use, much less chip use, compute, the impact of quantum.\" Rowan said. \"Do I really want to, with my credit hat on, take renewal risk?\"\n\nThe answer is no, and Rowan said there are plenty of ways for a credit investor to make money without taking renewal risk. In equity, you're betting on renewals, with the possibility of massive upsides or the \"chance of losing everything.\"\n\n\"There will be both great fortunes made and lost in the equity of data centers,\" Rowan said.\n\nOne way to make those bets a little safer is to vet who you're betting on.\n\nBlackstone, a major infrastructure investor, is only betting on \"long-term lease data centers where you don't put a shovel in the ground until you have a 15-plus year lease with a very large market cap company.\"\n\nOther potential bets include the power behind the AI revolution. It may be true that projections of power usage in 2030 are disparate, but they're probably all up and to the right.\n\n\"I can't come up with a scenario where we're not using significantly more power five years from today,\" said Gray.\n\nOne way to do it is to sign favorable leases with the best tenants. Blue Owl has a large \"triple-net-lease\" business, an industry term for commercial leases where taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs are paid by the tenant, instead of the landlord.\n\nUsually, Ostrover said, these leases are to solid businesses like Walgreens or Cracker Barrel, with 3% annual increases over 15 to 20-year leases. They're investment-grade tenants, around BBB credit, and have generated \"in excess of 20% return in that product.\"\n\nNow, they get those same terms with A or AA-credit tenants.\n\n\"So now, we're faced with an opportunity where instead of working with Walgreens, Cracker Barrel, firms like that, we can go to Microsoft, Meta, Google, Apple, the biggest companies in the world, signing identical 20-year leases,\" Ostrover said.\n\nThat way, even if they can't renew a lease, they're making their money.\n\n\"The way we look at it to our downside is even if the facilities are worth zero at the end of their lives, we can still make a teens return,\" Ostrover said.\n\nA Blue Owl spokesperson told BI that the firm's \"expectation\" is that there'll be \"meaningful residual value\" at the end of a lease.",

    "fullText": "Disney CEO Bob Iger says his company's major licensing deal with OpenAI is all about establishing a foothold in a new realm of entertainment and engaging younger audiences.\n\nThe licensing agreement gives ChatGPT and OpenAI's Sora video platform access to Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader. Disney is also investing $1 billion in the AI company and becoming a \"major customer.\"\n\nSpeaking on CNBC about the deal with OpenAI's Sam Altman on Thursday, Iger said it gives Disney a chance to get in on a fast-growing area of tech.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity, really, to play a part in what is really a breathtaking, breathtaking growth in essentially AI and new forms of media and entertainment,\" Iger said.\n\nIger said the deal also fulfills a longtime desire by Disney to put user-generated content on its Disney+ streaming platform. Disney initially plans to put select videos created on Sora onto Disney+ to increase engagement with users, especially younger ones. Ultimately, Iger wants to let Disney+ users create such videos within the platform itself.\n\n\"That's a big step for us,\" he said.\n\nDisney has long been highly protective of its famous characters and storylines, and Iger is widely seen in Hollywood as a champion of the creative set. But like other entertainment players, Disney has an engagement problem. The time people spend on streaming has stayed essentially flat over the past few years, despite increased spending on content. Social media and user-generated content, in contrast, continue to rise. The bet with OpenAI is that the deal can get people to spend more time on Disney platforms by giving them new ways to play around with its famous franchises.\n\nIger has long positioned the company as pro-technology, and he said, in reference to the OpenAI deal, that he'd rather participate in technological innovation than be disrupted by it.\n\n\"We think this is actually a way for us to be part of these developments, as opposed to being harmed by them,\" he said.\n\nIger said the deal is also a way for Disney to participate in the big rise in user-generated short-form video on social-media platforms.\n\nAltman said Thursday that the demand for Disney characters, in particular, is \"off the charts\" on OpenAI's products. He said he sees the deal enabling people to do things like putting themselves in a lightsaber scene from \"Star Wars\" or creating a custom birthday video for their kid using the Buzz Lightyear character.\n\nAI firms have been \"frenemies\" to media companies, as many in Hollywood are concerned about how they use copyrighted material and the threat that they could pose to the creative process. Iger said the OpenAI deal is good for creators rather than a threat.\n\n\"This does not in any way represent a threat to the creators at all. In fact, the opposite,\" Iger said. \"I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license to be associated with it.\"\n\nDisney said the agreement does not include any talent likeness or voices and that OpenAI would have guardrails in place to make sure Disney's IP was used in a safe way.\n\nIn June, Disney, along with Comcast's NBCUniversal studio business, sued AI company Midjourney, claiming its tech created unauthorized copies of works ranging from Star Wars to The Simpsons. Midjourney denied the claims in its legal response. That suit is ongoing.",

    "title": "Here are 4 ways Rivian just stepped deeper into Tesla's turf",
    "description": "Rivian revealed ambitious plans for fully autonomous driving, featuring an in-house chip, an in-car AI assistant, and a Tesla-like subscription model.",
    "fullText": "Rivian is all-in on autonomous driving, stepping deeper into a territory Tesla has long positioned itself to dominate.\n\nOn Thursday, at Rivian's R&D office in Palo Alto, the EV maker unveiled a road map to develop autonomous-driving capabilities for its future lineup of vehicles, including new hardware for the highly anticipated R2 — Rivian's cheapest car to date.\n\nThat road map includes a new silicon chip, designed in-house, that will power Rivian's next-generation hardware and support self-driving functions. The new hardware is expected to ship with R2 by the end of 2026, Rivian said.\n\nRivian CEO RJ Scaringe has been hinting at autonomous ambitions in recent years. However, since the company's first shipment of vehicles in 2021, Rivian's advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) software — Driver+ and the Rivian Autonomy Platform — has been more akin to Tesla Autopilot than Full Self-Driving Supervised. Tesla's Autopilot provides lane-centering and adaptive cruise control, while FSD can recognize traffic lights, conduct turns, and drive to a destination under constant driver supervision.\n\nThursday's announcement deepens Rivian's rivalry with Tesla as both companies have expressed goals of fully autonomous driving and licensing their software platforms to other automakers.\n\nRivian's partnership with Volkswagen, announced last year, was a clear first shot at those licensing ambitions. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently balked on X that no automaker wanted to license FSD.\n\nHere are four ways Rivian is taking a page out of Tesla's playbook.\n\nRivian has been using a combination of Nvidia and Qualcomm Snapdragon chips to power various vehicle functions, including driver-assistance and infotainment systems.\n\nNow, the company is turning to in-house silicon to power its next-generation autonomous driving hardware.\n\n\"At the core of Rivian's technology roadmap is the transition to in-house silicon, designed specifically for the vision-centric physical AI,\" the company said.\n\nA Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that the chips will be manufactured by TSMC.\n\nTesla began a production shift toward in-house chips in 2019 and has since released two iterations, AI3 and AI4. Musk has said that Tesla's next-generation chip, AI5, will be 40 times better than its predecessor.\n\nRivian's \"Gen 3 Autonomy\" hardware is under validation and is expected to be shipped with R2 by the end of 2026, the company said.\n\nWith the new chips, Rivian's explicit goal is to achieve full autonomy — that's Level 4, or the kind of self-driving technology seen in Alphabet's Waymo, in which driver supervision is not required.\n\nMusk has already made full autonomy Tesla's north star, pledging to turn every personally-owned Tesla into a robotaxi that can generate revenue.\n\nThe Tesla CEO's goals have been met with considerable skepticism, particularly due to the company's decision to abandon lidar, a sensor that many industry leaders consider essential for safety and redundancy in self-driving cars.\n\nRivian, for its part, plans to incorporate lidar into the R2 vehicle. The sensor appears to be installed within the car, just above the middle of the windshield.\n\nA Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that the company collaborated with a third party on the \"exterior design\" of Rivian's \"lidar implementation.\"\n\nThe company did not share a timeline for launching fully autonomous driving.\n\nIn the near term, Rivian will update its ADAS with hands-free assisted driving capability. The feature won't be functional on every road, according to a press release.\n\nRivian said it will be available on \"over 3.5 million miles of roads across the USA and Canada\" and can operate \"off-highway on roads with clearly painted lines.\"\n\nAt Thursday's event, Scaringe also suggested potential robotaxi ambitions.\n\n\"This also enables us to pursue opportunities in the rideshare space,\" the CEO said.\n\nRivian is following Tesla's FSD subscription model for what it's calling \"Autonomy+.\"\n\nThe software will launch \"early 2026\" and be priced at $49.99 a month or $2,500 for a one-time purchase.\n\nTesla's FSD is $99 a month or $8,000 up front.\n\nRivian said the software will be continuously updated. The \"trajectory\" for the feature will be \"point-to-point\" navigation — where users type in a destination, and the car drives itself just like FSD — as well as eyes-off driving capabilities and \"personal L4\" capabilities, according to the automaker.\n\nThe Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that \"hundreds of millions of miles contribute to the development of Autonomy+.\"\n\n\"This data is comprised of samples from around the US and Canada year-round, capturing diversity in both geography and seasonality,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMusk announced in July an integration of xAI's Grok in Tesla vehicles, providing a chatbot that drivers can talk to and, more recently, ask for directions.\n\nRivian will be following a similar playbook with \"Rivian Assistant,\" an AI voice interface that will be \"model-agnostic,\" according to the automaker.\n\n\"Our framework allows us to orchestrate different models and choose the best one for the task,\" a Rivian spokesperson said.\n\nThe company said in a press release that the AI assistant can connect to third-party apps and will start with the integration of Google Calendar.\n\nThe AI assistant can also assist with vehicle diagnostics and control certain vehicle functions, such as activating the car's seat heaters.\n\nThe feature will be shipped early 2026 on Gen 1 and Gen 2 R1 vehicles.",

    "title": "I Tried Photoshop in ChatGPT, and It Went Better Than I Expected",
    "description": "You can now get Adobe's AI image editor inside OpenAI's AI chatbot.",
    "fullText": "Generative AI tools continue to improve in terms of their photo editing capabilities, and OpenAI's latest upgrade brings Adobe Photoshop right inside your ChatGPT app window (alongside Adobe Acrobat for handling PDFs, and Adobe Express for graphic design). It's available to everyone, for free—you just need a ChatGPT account and an Adobe account.\n\nAs per Adobe, the idea is to make \"creativity accessible for everyone\" by plugging Photoshop tools directly into ChatGPT. The desktop version of Photoshop already comes with plenty of generative AI features of its own, so this is AI layered on top of more AI—but is it actually useful?\n\nAdobe Photoshop, Adobe Express and Adobe Acrobat are available now inside ChatGPT on the desktop, on the web, and on iOS. At the time of writing, you can also get Adobe Express inside ChatGPT for Android, with Photoshop and Acrobat \"coming soon.\" To weigh the capabilities of the new integration, I tested it in a desktop web browser.\n\nTo get started, all you need to do is type \"Photoshop\" at the start of your prompt: ChatGPT should recognize what you're trying to do, and select Adobe Photoshop as the tool to use for the next prompt. You'll also need to click through a couple of confirmation dialog boxes, and connect an Adobe account (if you don't have one, you can make one for free).\n\nWith all the connections and logins completed, Photoshop is then added to the overflow menu in the prompt box, so just click on the + (plus) to select it. You can start describing what you want to happen using the same natural, conversational language you'd use for any other ChatGPT prompt. You do need to also upload an image or provide a public link to one—if you don't do this before you submit your prompt, you'll be asked to do it after.\n\nYou don't need to know the names of all the Photoshop tools: Just describe what you want to happen and the relevant tools will be selected for you. One example Adobe gives is using the prompt \"make my image pop,\" which brings up the Bloom, Grain, and Lens Distortion effects—and each one can be adjusted via sliders on screen. It's actually quite simple to use.\n\nIf you do know the name of the tools you want, you can call them up by name, and the classic brightness and contrast sliders are a good place to start. You can either say something like \"make the picture brighter\" or \"adjust the image brightness\"—both will bring up an overlay you can use to make brightness adjustments, but if you use the former prompt, the image will already have been made a little brighter.\n\nChatGPT and Photoshop let you add edit upon edit as needed, and you can save the image at any stage. There's also the option to open your processed file in the Photoshop web app whenever you like: This web app uses a freemium model, with advanced features requiring a subscription, and seems to be what the ChatGPT integration is largely based on.\n\nAdobe offers a handy ChatGPT prompts cheat sheet you can browse through, which gives you a good idea of what's possible, and what you're still going to need Photoshop proper for. Note that you can specify certain parts of the image to focus on (like \"the face\" or \"the car\") but this depends on Photoshop-in-ChatGPT being able to correctly figure out where you want your selection to be. It needs to be pretty obvious and well delineated.\n\nWhen I tried cutting out objects and removing backgrounds, this worked well—but then I had to turn to Photoshop on the web to actually drop in a different background. There's no way to work with layers or masks here, and you can't remove people or objects from photos, either. Sometimes, however, you do get a spool of \"thinking\" from ChatGPT about how it can't do what the user is asking for.\n\nI was able to apply some nice colorizations here, via prompts like \"turn all the hues in this image to blue,\" and I like the way ChatGPT will give you further instructions on how to get the effect you want. You can even say \"show some examples\" and it gives you a few presets to choose from—all of which can be adjusted via the sliders again.\n\nThe ability to run prompts like \"turn this into an oil painting\" or \"turn this into a cartoon\" are useful too, though the plug-in is limited by the effects available in Photoshop for the web: You'll be directed to the closest effect and advised how to tweak it to get the look you want.\n\nActually, some of these effects work better in ChatGPT's native image editor, which maybe explains why Adobe wanted to get involved here.\n\nIf ChatGPT's image manipulation gets good enough, then Photoshop is no longer going to be needed by a substantial number of users: ChatGPT can already remove people and objects from photos, for example, quite effectively. What it's not quite as good at is some of the basic adjustments (like colors and contrast) that Adobe software has been managing for years.\n\nFor quick, basic edits you want to type out in natural language—especially where you want to adjust the edits manually and need advice on what to do next—Photoshop inside ChatGPT is a handy tool to be able to turn to, especially as it's free. For serious edits, though, you're still going to want to fire up the main Photoshop app, or maybe even shun Adobe altogether and make use of ChatGPT's steadily improving editing tools.",

    "description": "Disney is literally paying $1 billion for this.",
    "fullText": "If you've engaged in any sort of doomscrolling over the past year, you've no doubt encountered some wild AI-generated content. While there are plenty of AI video generators out there producing this stuff, one of the most prevalent is OpenAI's Sora, which is particularly adept at generating realistic short-form videos mimicking the content you might find on TikTok or Instagram Reels. These videos can be so convincing at first glance, that people often don't realize what they're seeing is 100% fake. That can be harmless when it's videos of cats playing instruments at midnight, but dangerous when impersonating real people or properties.\n\nIt's that last point that I thought would offer some pushback to AI's seemingly exponential growth. These companies have trained their AI models on huge amounts of data, much of which is copyrighted, which means that people are able to generate images and videos of iconic characters like Pikachu, Superman, and Darth Vader. The big AI generators put guardrails on their platforms to try to prevent videos that infringe on copyright, but people find a way around them. As such, corporations have already started suing OpenAI, Google, and other AI companies over this blatant IP theft. (Disclosure: Lifehacker’s parent company, Ziff Davis, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April 2025, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nBut it seems not all companies want to go down this path. Take Disney, as a prime example. On Thursday, OpenAI announced that it had made a three-year licensing agreement with the company behind Mickey Mouse. As part of the deal, Sora users can now generate videos featuring over 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars characters. The announcement names the following characters and movies specifically:\n\nThat includes licensed costumes, props, vehicles, and environments. What's more, Disney+ will host a \"selection\" of these \"fan-inspired\" Sora videos. (I'll admit, that last point genuinely shocks me.) This does only apply to Disney's visual assets, however, as Sora users won't have access to voice acting. ChatGPT users will also be able to generate images with these characters, so this news doesn't just affect Sora users.\n\nYou might think OpenAI is paying Disney a hefty licensing fee here, but it appears to be quite the opposite. Not only is Disney pledging to use OpenAI APIs to build \"products, tools, and experiences,\" it is rolling out ChatGPT to its employees as well. Oh, and the company is making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI. (Is that all?)\n\nI know many companies are embracing AI, often in ways I disagree with. But this deal is something else entirely. I'm not sure any Disney executives actually searched for \"Sora Disney\" on the internet, because right now, you'll find fake AI trailers for Pixar movies filled with racism, sexual content, and generally offensive content—all generated using an app Disney just licensed all of its properties to. OpenAI asserts in its announcement that both companies are committed to preventing \"illegal or harmful\" content on the platform, but Sora users are already creating harmful content. What kind of content can we expect with carte blanch access to Disney's properties?\n\nNow that Disney's characters are fair game, I can't imagine the absolute slop that some users are going to make here. The only hope I have is in the fact that Disney+ is going to host some of these videos. Staff will have to weed through some garbage to find videos that are actually suitable for the platform. And maybe seeing the \"content\" that Sora users like to make with iconic characters will be enough for Disney to rethink its plans.",

    "description": "AI predictions for 2026 and what they mean for DevOps engineers. From agent orchestration to local AI breakthroughs, here's how to prepare your infrastructure.",
    "fullText": "Posted on Thursday, Dec 11, 2025\n\nThe IDE is dying, and so is tool calling. OpenAI is not going to win. And next year, you’re going to be shipping code that you’ve never reviewed before, even as an experienced engineer.\n\nThese are bold claims, but the way we use AI in 2026 for coding and agents is going to look completely different. In this post, I want to cover my predictions and why they matter right now for DevOps engineers. Some of these are definitely hot takes, but that’s what makes this conversation worth having.\n\nTraditional IDEs where the code is the focus of the interface are simply going to become irrelevant. We’re moving toward agent manager interfaces where we can kick off agents in parallel to work on different features in a codebase or even work on different projects at the exact same time.\n\nWe’re already seeing this transition. Google Antigravity combines a familiar AI-powered coding experience with a new agent-first interface. You can deploy agents that autonomously plan, execute, and verify complex tasks across your editor, terminal, and browser. Cursor 2.0 lets you run up to eight agents in parallel on a single prompt, using git worktrees or remote machines to prevent file conflicts. Each agent operates in its own isolated copy of your codebase.\n\nAWS validated this direction at re:Invent 2025 by announcing “frontier agents” including Kiro for autonomous coding, along with dedicated security and DevOps agents. These agents maintain state, log actions, operate with policy guardrails, and integrate directly with CI/CD pipelines.\n\nFor infrastructure specifically, Pulumi Neo represents this same shift. Instead of writing code or running CLI commands for every operation, you describe what you need in natural language and Neo handles the implementation. It works across your entire infrastructure, understanding dependencies and creating execution plans that go through pull requests for review.\n\nFor DevOps engineers, this means your pipelines need to accommodate AI-generated code at scale. Multiple agents working simultaneously need isolated, reproducible environments. More generated code means more artifacts to track, version, and deploy.\n\nA lot of people think that in the future a single large language model is going to have a monopoly and be the best at absolutely everything. But what’s really going to happen is different providers will specialize and focus on being the best at different things.\n\nGoogle is going down the generalist play with Gemini, aiming to be the jack of all trades. Anthropic is focusing on being the best for coding. You can see this in the benchmarks: when Opus 4.5 came out, the first benchmark they highlighted was for software engineering, because that’s what Anthropic is focusing on.\n\nAmazon is carving out its own niche with the Nova model family, announced at re:Invent 2025. The Nova 2 lineup includes specialized models: Pro for complex reasoning, Sonic for real-time voice conversations, and Omni for simultaneous text, audio, and video processing. With Nova Forge, organizations can build custom frontier models by combining their proprietary data with AWS open weight models. The re:Invent message was clear: leveraging your first-party data is now fundamental to going beyond generic AI. We’re talking about 30-40% increases in accuracy when you bring your own data into the equation.\n\nBut here’s the hot take: I don’t think OpenAI is going to come out on top with any kind of specialization. They’ve disappointed time and time again with GPT-5 and GPT-4.5. With 4.5, they seemed to try to be the creative specialist, but it just didn’t work. The GPT-5 launch in August 2025 was described as “barely better than last month’s flavor of the month” and on some metrics it’s actually worse than earlier models.\n\nFor DevOps teams, this specialization means you’ll need infrastructure that’s model-agnostic and supports multiple AI backends. Plan for secrets management across multiple LLM providers and design your systems to swap models based on the task at hand.\n\n2026 is going to be the year of local AI. We didn’t see that much this year besides DeepSeek at the start of 2025, which was a big deal. We had a couple of new models like Qwen 3, but nothing that fundamentally changed the game. Now we’re starting to see new hardware that makes it obvious we’re going to be able to run very large models on smaller devices.\n\nThere’s new AI chips that can run upwards of 120 billion parameter large language models on the edge, which would be a complete game-changer. Right now, hardware requirements are one of the biggest problems when it comes to scaling local AI. If we can solve the hardware problem, we get 100% data privacy and zero-millisecond latency for our agents.\n\nAWS is addressing this with Trainium3 UltraServers, their 3nm AI chips delivering 4.4x more compute than the previous generation. More significantly, AWS AI Factories allow organizations to deploy racks of Trainium chips and NVIDIA GPUs directly into their own data centers, addressing data sovereignty concerns while keeping AI inference close to the data.\n\nFor DevOps, this opens possibilities for zero-latency inference in CI/CD pipelines, complete data privacy for sensitive codebases, and reduced cloud costs for AI-heavy workloads.\n\nWe’re finally going to get to the point where we’re not the coders. We delegate that entirely to our coding agents and we become the system architects. This mirrors the evolution of other engineering disciplines. Civil engineers don’t fabricate the steel beams; they design the structure and verify the integrity.\n\nI think of this as a three-step process:\n\nWe’re still in the loop. We are the final say in whatever is created, but we’re delegating the grunt work to our coding agents.\n\nThis is exactly the model that Pulumi Neo implements for infrastructure. When you give Neo a complex request, it creates a task plan outlining the steps it will take to accomplish your goal. This plan provides transparency into Neo’s approach and gives you the opportunity to adjust the strategy before execution begins. Neo operates in different modes: Review mode where everything requires approval, Balanced mode where only deployments need sign-off, or Auto mode for full autonomy. You define the boundaries, Neo orchestrates the work, and you validate through pull requests and previews.\n\nFor DevOps engineers, this shift means building robust validation infrastructure becomes critical. When AI writes the code, you need automated testing pipelines, security scanning, and verification systems that can operate at the speed of AI-generated changes.\n\nHere’s a key insight that kept coming up at re:Invent: models are no longer the bottleneck. Context is. Our agents are going to change a lot next year because code execution is starting to replace tool calling. The problem with tool calling right now is that all the capabilities you give an agent take up context upfront. When you try to give a lot of different tools to an agent, you completely overwhelm it.\n\nAnthropic’s research on code execution with MCP addresses exactly this problem. Code execution is a massive token reduction, faster, and more flexible. You’re giving the agent the ability to generate its own capabilities at runtime by writing code to interact with APIs. A workflow that previously consumed about 150,000 tokens when tools were passed directly through the model was reimplemented with code execution and used only about 2,000 tokens. That’s a 98.7% reduction.\n\nAWS embraced this pattern with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, which now includes code interpretation capabilities. AgentCore supports any agent framework (CrewAI, LangGraph, OpenAI SDK) and provides memory, browser tools, and observability features that make code execution practical at enterprise scale.\n\nFor DevOps, this means you need sandboxed, secure execution environments for AI-generated code. Running agent-generated code requires appropriate isolation, resource limits, and monitoring.\n\nThe best part about code execution flexibility is it unlocks progressive disclosure. All I mean by that is: you have a lot of capabilities for an agent, but you don’t actually give all of them upfront. Instead, you allow the agent to discover capabilities and then leverage them in a more flexible way.\n\nFor each capability, you just have a bit of metadata or description that loads upfront. When the agent decides to leverage that capability, then you load the full instructions. Now you can practically scale to infinity because all capabilities don’t have to be loaded at runtime.\n\nClaude Skills is a good example of this pattern. Skills are organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load dynamically. At session start, the agent scans available skills and populates the system prompt with just a brief name and description (around 100 tokens). The full skill prompt loads only after Claude selects it, preventing context bloat while maintaining discoverability.\n\nKiro Powers addresses the same problem. Connecting five MCP servers can consume over 50,000 tokens, roughly 40% of an AI model’s context window, before you even type your first request. Powers bundle MCP servers, steering files, and hooks into units that load dynamically based on conversation context. Mention “payment” and the Stripe power activates. Datadog, Figma, and others have powers available.\n\nFor DevOps, this translates to modular infrastructure definitions, on-demand capability loading, and efficient resource utilization. Think about how you can apply this pattern to your own automation.\n\nAgent-to-agent protocols are where AI agents operate in a peer network, discover each other’s capabilities in real time, and interact autonomously. When Google released their A2A protocol earlier this year, there was a ton of buzz. A lot of people thought it was going to be the next big standard, like the next MCP. But then it kind of fell to the wayside.\n\nThe big reason is the chicken-and-egg problem. In order for A2A to be useful, you need a lot of people to adopt it at the same time. Otherwise, if you build an A2A-compatible agent, it has no other agents to talk to. The whole value proposition is lost unless you already have a big network to attach to.\n\nBut that’s finally changing. The Linux Foundation launched the A2A project in June 2025, and adoption is accelerating. Adobe, Microsoft, SAP, ServiceNow, and S&P Global are all implementing A2A. In July 2025, Google released version 0.3 of the A2A protocol with a more stable interface critical to accelerating enterprise adoption.\n\nMy next big prediction is that machines paying machines is going to become a very big thing. Coinbase released the x402 protocol for exactly this: building AI agents that you expose over the internet but require payment whenever someone else interacts with them.\n\nThis goes really well with agent-to-agent protocols. You can create a peer network where you monetize your agents. They all leverage each other but make payments whenever they take advantage of another agent’s capabilities. Cryptocurrency is the perfect solution for this kind of machine-to-machine network because you need a currency where it’s easy to do micropayments quickly and globally.\n\nThe x402 protocol has achieved 156,000 weekly transactions with 492% growth since launching in May 2025. It’s now integrated with Anthropic’s MCP Protocol, Google Gemini, OpenAI Codex, and other platforms. Stablecoins like USDC make it possible to charge per request, per service, or per second of usage with near-zero transaction costs, enabling payments as low as $0.001 per request.\n\nWhen we want to do a rigorous code review traditionally, we look line by line at all the changes. But coding agents are getting to the point where they can prove their code works through artifacts. Instead of reviewing line by line, we can look at browser recordings, full working demos of a backend API, and other artifacts.\n\nGoogle Antigravity is a perfect example. As part of its coding process, it can autonomously spin up your website, visit it, scroll through it, take screenshots, and record everything. Agents generate artifacts, including tangible deliverables like task lists, implementation plans, screenshots, and browser recordings. You can verify the agent’s logic at a glance.\n\nAmazon Nova Act takes this further. It enables AI agents to automate browser-based tasks like form filling, QA testing, and workflow validation with over 90% reliability. The service includes built-in observability through live viewing, CloudTrail logging, and session replay, making it possible to review what an agent actually did rather than parsing through code changes.\n\nFor the last prediction, we’re tying everything together. We’ve talked about reviewing artifacts instead of diffs, creating systems instead of coding, and the new capabilities for agents with code execution.\n\nWe’re going to get to the point very quickly where we’re shipping code that we have never read before. And I’m not talking about people who vibe code. Even experienced engineers are going to trust their systems so much that they have the ability to review the code but they’re not going to. We’re just going to ship to production after reviewing the artifacts.\n\nI presented on this exact topic at the Tel Aviv Pulumi User Group meetup at Qodo HQ back in October, where I demonstrated how Pulumi Neo’s autonomous decision-making capabilities can handle infrastructure tasks that we traditionally managed manually. Qodo is doing fascinating work in this space with their agentic development tools, building systems that let you trust the output without necessarily reviewing every line.\n\nI’m not saying we’re taking the human completely out of the loop. I’m saying we’re going to have a lot of trust in our systems and a validation process that includes us, but that doesn’t necessarily have to be us actually looking at the code. Tools like Pulumi Neo create pull requests with clear documentation of changes, run previews to validate infrastructure modifications, and provide the transparency needed to ship with confidence.\n\nThe predictions I’ve outlined point to a fundamental shift in how software gets built and deployed. For DevOps engineers, this isn’t a threat but an opportunity to become more strategic and less operational. We’re entering the battle of the agentic frameworks, where the winners will be those who can build faster, cheaper agentic applications through their platforms.\n\nThe immediate reality is that your CI/CD pipelines need to accommodate AI-generated code at scale, your secrets management needs to handle multiple LLM providers, and your execution environments need proper sandboxing for agent-generated code. These aren’t future concerns; they’re requirements for working effectively with the AI tools available today.\n\nLooking further out, the engineers who thrive will be those who embrace the system architect role. Define clear objectives and constraints for your AI agents. Build validation frameworks that can verify outcomes without requiring line-by-line code review. Design infrastructure that’s modular enough to load capabilities on demand.\n\nThe technology to make this happen already exists. Agent orchestration platforms are shipping. Code execution is replacing tool calling. Progressive disclosure patterns are proven. The question isn’t whether these changes are coming; it’s whether you’ll be ready when they arrive.\n\nIf you want to experience what this future looks like right now, Pulumi Neo is the place to start. Neo lets you make natural language requests for routine infrastructure tasks, analysis, and management. Instead of writing code for every operation, you describe what you need and Neo handles the implementation, creating task plans, running previews, and opening pull requests for your review.\n\nWhether you’re looking to update outdated resources across your infrastructure, analyze your cloud spend, or automate complex multi-step workflows, Neo provides the agent-first experience that’s defining the next generation of DevOps tooling.\n\nGet started with Pulumi Neo and see how AI-powered infrastructure automation can transform your workflow.",

    "description": "OpenAI is in a far less commanding position than it was following the public release of ChatGPT a few short years ago.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is in a far less commanding position than it was following the public release of ChatGPT a few short years ago.\n\nBack in 2022, the sudden popularity of ChatGPT sent Google into a panic. The company was so worried about the possibility of the upstart chatbot disrupting its Search business, executives sounded a \"code red\" alert inside of the company and called Sergey Brin and Larry Page out of retirement to help it formulate a response to OpenAI. It then rushed out Bard, announcing its first commercial chatbot on February 6, 2023. Google's stock tanked days later when the AI incorrectly answered a question about NASA's James Webb Space Telescope during a public demo.\n\nBut it wasn't just Google that wanted a piece of OpenAI, while the search giant sought to compete with it, others — including Microsoft and Apple — made deals with the company to bring its technology to their products and services, all the promise that AI would eventually revolutionize every facet of the economy.\n\nSince then, OpenAI has seen its lead against Google and much of the AI industry evaporate, culminating in a series of successive blows throughout 2025. On January 20, the same day Altman was busy rubbing shoulders with other tech oligarchs at Donald Trump’s inauguration, China’s DeepSeek quietly released its R1 chain-of-thought model. A week later, the startup's chatbot surpassed ChatGPT as the most-download free app on the US App Store. The overnight success of DeepSeek eliminated $1 trillion worth of stock market value, and almost certainly left OpenAI blindsided.\n\nIn response, the company showed a newfound urgency. In one week, for instance, OpenAI released both o3-mini and Deep Research. It even went so far as to announce the latter on a Sunday evening. But for all its new urgency, OpenAI's biggest, most important release of the year was a miss.\n\nIt's safe to say GPT-5 hasn't lived up to anyone's expectations, including OpenAI's own. The company touted the system as smarter, faster and better than all of its previous models, but after users got their hands on it, they complained of a chatbot that made surprisingly dumb mistakes and didn't have much of a personality. For many, GPT-5 felt like a downgrade compared to the older, simpler GPT-4o. That's a position no AI company wants to be in, let alone one that has taken on as much investment as OpenAI.\n\nAnthropic was quick to take advantage of the weakness, signing a deal with Microsoft to bring its Claude models to Copilot 365. Previously, Microsoft depended exclusively on OpenAI for partner models in Copilot. Before the company announced the integration, reporting from The Informationsaid Microsoft made the decision based on the strength of Anthropic's Sonnet 4.0 model, judging it \"perform[ed] better in subtle but important ways\" relative to OpenAI's offerings.\n\nHowever, what will likely go down as the defining moment occurred a few short weeks after OpenAI announced the conclusion of its restructuring. On November 18, Google released Gemini 3 Pro, and immediately the new model leap-frogged the competition, including GPT-5. As of the writing of this article, Google's new model is at the top of LMArena, the site where humans compare outputs from different AI systems and vote on the best one. GPT-5, by contrast, is currently ranked sixth overall, behind models from Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nAccording to a December 2 report from TheWall Street Journal, Sam Altman sent a companywide memo following the release of Gemini 3 Pro. Echoing the words Google used to describe the situation it found itself against OpenAI in 2023, he called for a \"code red\" effort to improve ChatGPT. Altman reportedly told employees there would be temporary reassignments and that the company would delay some products, all in an effort to catch up to Google and Anthropic.\n\nThe few numbers these companies are willing to share don't paint a promising picture for OpenAI. Each month, about 800 million people use ChatGPT. On paper, that's impressive, but Google is catching up there too. In October, the company said the Gemini app had 650 million users, up from 450 million just a few months earlier in July, thanks to the popularity of its Nano Banana Pro image generator.\n\nMore importantly, OpenAI has an inherent disadvantage against Google. For the search giant, AI may touch everything the company does now, but Gemini is just one product in an extensive portfolio that includes many other popular services. Google can fund its AI advancements with money it makes elsewhere. OpenAI cannot say the same. The company is constantly raising money to stay afloat, and according to a financial roadmap obtained by The Journal, it will need its revenue to grow to about $200 billion annually to become profitable by 2030. In November, Altman said on X the company was on track to hit above $20 billion in annualized revenue this year.\n\nIn an effort to grow revenue, Altman and company have adopted an incredibly risky strategy. In recent months, OpenAI has signed more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in a bid to outscale the competition that is already beating it. Many of those agreements can only be described as circular, and I think the fears about a financial bubble are real. In the first half of 2025, investment in data centers accounted for nearly all of US GDP growth. Even if there's not a repeat of the 2008 housing market crisis or the dot-com crash, the AI boom is at the very least poised to make everyday electronics (and utilities) more expensive for regular people in the short term.\n\nSince late October, demand for server-grade computer components, including memory and storage, has sent the price of consumer PC parts skyrocketing as manufacturers devote more of their production capacity and wafers to high-margin customers like OpenAI and Google. Since late October, the cost of most RAM kits has doubled and tripled. In November, the price of some SSDs went up by as much as 60 percent. Next year, the cost of LPDDR5X memory, which is used in both smartphones and NVIDIA servers, is expected to climb as well.\n\n\"Be it carmakers, smartphones or consumer electronics, everyone that uses memory is facing pressure from price hikes and supply constraints in the coming year,\" Zhao Haijun, the co-CEO of memory manufacturer SMIC told analysts, per Bloomberg.\n\nGita Gopinath, former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, recently estimated that if the AI bubble were to burst, it would wipe out $20 trillion in wealth held by American households. The Great Recession, considered the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression, reduced US household net worth by $11.5 trillion, and it took years before for American families to rebuild their wealth to pre-recession levels.\n\nThe modern AI bubble may have been started by ChatGPT, but given the crowded field of chatbots and LLMs, it won't necessarily pop should OpenAI go bust. With novelty and technical prowess no longer on its side though, it's now on Altman to prove in short order why his company still deserves such unprecedented levels of investment.",

    "fullText": "Three industries are going to look very different in the next few years, according to an OpenAI executive.\n\nOn an episode of the \"Unsupervised Learning\" podcast, Olivier Godement, the head of product for business products at the ChatGPT maker, shared why he thinks a trio of jobs — in life sciences, customer service, and computer engineering — is on the cusp of automation.\n\n\"My bet is often on life sciences, pharma companies,\" he said, about his first pick for industries on the brink of change because of AI.\n\nGodement said that the goal of pharmaceutical companies like Amgen, with which he works, is to design new drugs. This has two components: actual research and experimentation, and admin, a time-consuming process that could be automated, he said.\n\n\"The time it takes from once you lock the recipe of a drug to having that drug on the market is months, sometimes years,\" he said. \"Turns out like the models are pretty good at that. They're pretty good at aggregating, consolidating tons of structured, unstructured data, spotting the different changes in documents.\"\n\nGodement joined OpenAI in 2023. He previously worked on products for Stripe for eight years.\n\nOn the podcast, Godement said that while we haven't reached a stage where \"any white collar job\" can be automated in just a day, he is starting to see strong use cases in fields such as coding and customer service.\n\n\"The automation is probably not yet at the level of automating completely the job of a software engineer, but I think we have a line of sight essentially to get there,\" he said.\n\nThe future of software engineering has been one of the most heated tech debates of the year, as AI-assisted coding enters most companies' workflow.\n\nAn Indeed study from October found that software engineers, quality assurance engineers, product managers, and project managers were the four tech jobs that have been axed the most during layoffs and reorgs.\n\nLastly, Godement said that customer-oriented roles like sales and customer experience may be automated soon.\n\n\"I've been working a bunch with the folks at T-Mobile, the telecom company in the US, to essentially provide a better experience to their customers, and we're starting to achieve fairly good results in terms of quality at a meaningful scale,\" he said. \"My sense is we'll probably be surprised in the next year or two on the amount of tasks that can be automated reliably.\"\n\nAcross the board, AI leaders are flagging white-collar jobs that can be easily automated by newer large language models.\n\nIn a June podcast, Geoffrey Hinton, who is recognized as the \"Godfather of AI,\" said that eventually, technology will \"get to be better than us at everything,\" but some fields are safer than others in the interim.\n\n\"I'd say it's going to be a long time before it's as good at physical manipulation,\" Hinton said. \"So a good bet would be to be a plumber.\"\n\n\"For mundane intellectual labor, AI is just going to replace everybody,\" Hinton said.\n\nHe identified paralegals as at risk, and said he'd be \"terrified\" if he worked in a call center.",

    "fullText": "It may sound like a trip through the produce aisle, but leading AI companies have something much more important on their lists.\n\nMeta, OpenAI, and Google have all relied on food-related names for their sometimes secretive plans for future AI models. Thinking with your stomach is nothing new for Silicon Valley, just look at the assortment of desserts Android assembled over the years before Google had its fill.\n\nHere is a look at the mouthwatering and just plain goofy names AI and tech companies are using\n\nMeta has codenamed its future AI frontier model \"avocado,\" per a CNBC report. Guac usually costs extra, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's AI pivot has not come cheap. Meta plans to spend more than $70 billion this year on AI infrastructure, which is on top of $14 billion investment Meta made in Scale AI and to poach its founder, Alexandr Wang.\n\nOpenAI has hit a rough patch, feeling the heat from Google's advances and stumbling with a series of missteps. So perhaps it was time to spice things up. The ChatGPT maker has codenamed its new large language model \"garlic,\" according to The Information. Garlic is separate from another LLM OpenAI is developing, codenamed \"Shallotpeat.\"\n\nGoogle appears to have loved a codename so much that it made it public. Google's AI image generator in Gemini is named Nano Banana Pro, which it released on November 20. Before then, Google had internally called the model nano-banana, though they had not publicly disclosed their zany choice.\n\nThe clearance section offers a wide selection of great names. OpenAI might have one of the best all-time codenames with \"strawberry,\" which it used to refer to its o1 model. The name was likely a play on the viral struggle of AI models to correctly identify the number of Rs in the fruit. Before Strawberry, OpenAI had a secretive project named Q*.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk's xAI had a sweet tooth when it codenamed an early testing version of Grok-3 \"chocolate.\"\n\nMistral AI, the France-based startup, went in a completely opposite direction with \"Jaguar,\" its codename for a testing model.\n\nAnd Anthropic named its family of models Opus, Sonnett, and Hakiu, a trio of three different types of compositions.",

    "fullText": "Included Health is rolling out a new AI tool that could pit it against Big Tech's latest health bets.\n\nThe healthcare startup has launched an AI-powered personal health assistant, Business Insider has learned exclusively. The tech draws on patients' medical claims, benefits information, and other data to offer on-demand answers to health-related questions.\n\nIncluded Health is tapping into a hot area in healthcare AI, where it's competing against other health startups as well as tech heavyweights. Alphabet's Verily released its own AI-powered app in October that allows patients to connect their medical records and ask a chatbot their health-related questions. OpenAI wants to win in consumer health tech, too, and is considering building tools such as its own personal health assistant, Business Insider reported in November.\n\nIncluded Health has been scaling on the premise of personalizing how patients interact with their healthcare for over a decade. The company, which sells tech to about 300 employers and health plans to help patients better navigate their health benefits, tested its AI assistant for about 18 months to ensure its accuracy in smaller pilots before making it available to its entire employer base, CEO Owen Tripp said.\n\n\"This can't be ChatGPT level of probability. It has to be precise,\" he said.\n\nTripp is optimistic about patients receiving general health guidance from LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. Those AI tools can help patients learn more about their conditions and prepare for doctor's visits, he said. But he emphasized that Included's tech takes that guidance a step further.\n\n\"When it gets down to the business of actually taking care of oneself or taking care of somebody else, you're going to need a lot of very secure, specific data and a whole context to go solve problems, including the exact medical history of that patient,\" Tripp said.\n\nPatient-facing healthcare AI sometimes walks a regulatory tightrope, especially if the tech provides personalized advice that effectively replaces the work clinicians are licensed to do. Tripp said he doubts that most large tech companies attempting to delve into medical records aggregation will want to grapple with that complexity.\n\n\"I predict, like many before them, they will pull back. It's just hard, and the juice is often not worth the squeeze for these high-profile companies,\" he said.\n\nIncluded Health's personal health assistant, called Dot, has become its members' front door and the foundation for Included's new products, said COO Nupur Srivastava.\n\nIncluded recently put Dot in front of members during open enrollment to help answer their benefits questions, Srivastava said. The AI agent can also help patients prepare for doctor's visits and send the clinician a summary of patients' past visits ahead of time.\n\nIncluded Health still employs plenty of its own clinicians and care advocates that members can talk to if they prefer. Srivastava also noted that if a patient mentions the term 'suicide' in a conversation with Dot, \"within a minute, someone will call you.\"\n\nWhen asked about Big Tech and AI startups' ambitions to build personalized health AI, Tripp said that Included Health is in talks with multiple potential partners to help them achieve those goals. He didn't specify which companies it's talking to, but he suggested some AI companies are focused on acquiring personalized health data that they can anonymize and use to train models.\n\n\"But when it comes to actually delivering patient care, we're pretty confident that companies that are going to succeed will be the ones that have well-trained physicians licensed in all 50 states, delivering on a real-time platform, across mind, body, and wallet,\" he said.\n\nIncluded Health was supposed to go public in 2022. The startup had hired banks for an IPO push, but pulled out of its planned investor meetings when the market started to tank, Tripp told Business Insider in January.\n\nTripp declined to share specifics about Included's exit strategy as of November. But Included is profitable, so the company doesn't need to raise money through a public listing, he said. Included hasn't publicly fundraised since it was formed from the 2021 merger of Grand Rounds and Doctor on Demand, and the company hasn't shared its valuation.\n\nThe public markets haven't been forgiving to healthcare startups. Only two digital health companies went public this year, Hinge Health and Omada Health. And while Hinge and Omada have fared far better than most companies that listed during digital health's 2021 IPO wave, healthcare IPO hopefuls still face high standards to going public and significant volatility risks once they begin trading.\n\n\"The last few years in our space haven't been a great commercial for being a public company,\" Tripp said.\n\nWith so many developments in healthcare AI, however, Tripp does recognize that an IPO could create opportunities for Included Health to acquire other companies.\n\n\"I do think this is a time where there are going to be some interesting capabilities and technologies available in the market that allow us to provide even more service to our members,\" he said. \"I do have my eyes very open to how I would use capital to execute on some of those M&A events. That part is more important to me.\"",

    "fullText": "Don't count on a college degree to land your dream job in Silicon Valley.\n\nIncreasingly, founders and tech companies are judging talent by how quickly someone can learn, adapt, and build — not on how long they spent in a lecture hall — reshaping traditional pathways into the workforce.\n\nFei-Fei Li, the Stanford computer science professor widely known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" is one example of this.\n\nIn an interview on \"The Tim Ferriss Show\" this week, she spoke about the value of a degree when it comes to hiring for her AI startup, World Labs.\n\n\"When we interview a software engineer, I personally feel the degree they have matters less to us now,\" Li said.\n\n\"Now, it's more about what have you learned, what tools do you use, how quickly can you superpower yourself in using these tools — and a lot of these are AI tools,\" she said. \"What's your mindset toward using these tools matter more to me.\"\n\nHer hiring bar has become even clearer: she won't hire software engineers who resist AI.\n\n\"At this point in 2025 — hiring at World Labs — I would not hire any software engineer who does not embrace AI collaborative software tools,\" Li said.\n\nIt's not about automating humans out of the equation, she added — it's about identifying people who can grow as fast as the technology around them.\n\n\"If you're able to use these tools, you're able to learn. You can superpower yourself better,\" she said.\n\nLi's stance is part of a broader shift playing out across Silicon Valley, where more founders and even major tech firms are openly questioning the value of higher education.\n\nPalantir's CEO, Alex Karp, has openly challenged the value of a college education, urging young entrepreneurs to skip the lecture hall and learn by doing instead — a view echoed by LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, who has said that adaptability and AI fluency now matter far more than the \"fanciest degrees.\"\n\n\"AI makes skill sets based on years of education irrelevant,\" Dan Rhoton, CEO of Hopeworks, told Business Insider. Hopeworks is a tech-training nonprofit that prepares underrepresented talent for AI-enabled jobs.\n\nAfter 13 years of preparing unemployed young adults ages 17 to 26 in Camden, New Jersey, and Philadelphia for tech careers, Rhoton said he has watched firsthand how AI is upending the value of a college degree.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more employers coming to us, saying, 'We used to require a bachelor's degree in this, but we don't understand why.'\"\n\nInstead, he said, employers now want a \"value proposition,\" which he said any job seeker can achieve by showing an AI-generated solution to a company's specific problems.\n\n\"This is the age of: I'm someone who's going to deliver business value,\" Rhoton said. \"Not: I have the right degree.\"",

    "description": "The gradual and systemic over-reliance on LLM outputs, especially with agentic systems, leads to a normalization of deviance.",
    "fullText": "The AI industry risks repeating the same cultural failures that contributed to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster: Quietly normalizing warning signs while progress marches forward.\n\nThe original term Normalization of Deviance comes from the American sociologist Diane Vaughan, who describes it as the process in which deviance from correct or proper behavior or rule becomes culturally normalized.\n\nI use the term Normalization of Deviance in AI to describe the gradual and systemic over-reliance on LLM outputs, especially in agentic systems.\n\nAt its core, large language models (LLMs) are unreliable (and untrusted) actors in system design.\n\nThis means that security controls (access checks, proper encoding, and sanitization, etc.) must be applied downstream of LLM output.\n\nA constant stream of indirect prompt injection exploit demonstrations indicates that system designers and developers are either unaware of this or are simply accepting the deviance. It is particularly dangerous when vendors make insecure decisions for their userbase by default.\n\nI first learned about this concept in the context of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where systemic normalization of warnings led to tragedy.\n\nDespite data showing erosion in colder temperatures, the deviation from safety standards was repeatedly rationalized because previous flights had succeeded. The absence of disaster was mistaken for the presence of safety.\n\nIn the world of AI, we observe companies treating probabilistic, non-deterministic, and sometimes adversarial model outputs as if they were reliable, predictable, and safe.\n\nVendors are normalizing trusting LLM output, but current understanding violates the assumption of reliability.\n\nThe model will not consistently follow instructions, stay aligned, or maintain context integrity. This is especially true if there is an attacker in the loop (e.g indirect prompt injection).\n\nHowever, we see more and more systems allowing untrusted output to take consequential actions. Most of the time it goes well, and over time vendors and organizations lower their guard or skip human oversight entirely, because “it worked last time.”\n\nThis dangerous bias is the fuel for normalization: organizations confuse the absence of a successful attack with the presence of robust security.\n\nTwo ways this can impact systems are:\n\nAnd we already see agents make mistakes in day to day usage, like formatting hard drives, creating random GitHub issues, or wiping a production database.\n\nSo, the signs are there. And it is inherently dangerous, not only because of attacks like indirect prompt injection, but also because these systems are trained on enormous, untrustworthy data sets from the Internet. Anthropic research recently showed that it takes only a small amount of documents to successfully add a backdoor to a model.\n\nConsider a scenario where the Normalization of Deviance has drastic consequences: an attacker trains a backdoor into a model that triggers on certain days to invoke tools, like compromising a user via code execution. Since we have a pretty centralized ecosystem, where attacks often are transferable, and natural language is universally understood by LLMs, this can have consequences across many systems and vendors.\n\nSuch a drift does not happen through a single reckless decision. It happens through a series of “temporary” shortcuts that quietly become the new baseline. Because systems continue to work, teams stop questioning the shortcuts, and the deviation becomes invisible and the new norm.\n\nEspecially under competitive pressure for automation, cost savings, a drive to be first, and the overall hype, this dangerous drift is evident. The incentives for speed and winning outweigh the incentives for foundational security. Over time, organizations forget why the guardrails existed in the first place.\n\nLet me share some examples of how this is reflected in real-world agentic AI systems.\n\nWe are all aware that chatbots have those “AI can make mistakes”, “Double check responses” and so forth disclaimers, and we can observe the drift of normalization occurring in real-time.\n\nThree years after ChatGPT shipped, vendors push agentic AI to users, but at the same time vendors are highlighting that your system might get compromised by that same AI - that drift, that normalization, is what I call “The Normalization of Deviance in AI”.\n\nThis continuous drift is a long-term danger:\n\nWhile some vendors acknowledge the risks, others appear to overlook or downplay them, potentially due to competitive pressure and focus on product and customer acquisition.\n\nIn many cases, we probably collectively hope that “someone” will solve these security and safety challenges.\n\nCompanies like Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and other institutions and organizations perform extensive research in this area, including publishing evals and mitigation ideas. However, the rush to be the first is evident from a product perspective.\n\nNevertheless, before we drift off into a utopian future with agentic AI, I believe the best and safest outcome is to stay realistic around capabilities and control mechanisms, and for AI to remain human-led, particularly in high-stake contexts, to ensure the best outcome overall.\n\nNo, of course not. There is a lot of potential and many low stakes workflows can be implemented already today. Even high-risk workflows can be done with proper threat modeling, mitigations and oversight.\n\nHowever, it requires investment and resources to design and set up systems accordingly and apply security controls (sandbox, hermetic environments, least privilege, temporary credentials, etc.).\n\nMany are hoping the “model will just do the right thing”, but Assume Breach teaches us, that at one point, it will certainly not do that.",

    "description": "The Navy is investing almost half a billion dollars in Palantir artificial intelligence software that promises to speed up shipbuilding processes.",
    "fullText": "The Navy is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into an artificial intelligence system that it says has sped up key shipbuilding processes.\n\nIn one case, the AI cut painstaking processes of submarine schedule planning — mapping out how the many pieces of construction fit together and making sure people, parts, and yard space are available at the right time — from many hours to only minutes.\n\nThe Navy is launching the new Shipbuilding Operating System, or Ship OS, as it tries to break out of decades-old shipbuilding problems rooted in outdated technologies and work practices. The service announced a $448 million investment Thursday, saying it will accelerate the adoption of AI and autonomy across the industrial base.\n\nThe Ship OS technology is powered by Palantir's Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform and began in pilot programs at submarine shipyards.\n\nAt General Dynamics Electric Boat, a long-time submarine yard located in Connecticut, submarine schedule planning saw a dramatic reduction from 160 manual hours down to under 10 minutes. And at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine, material review times for submarines went from taking weeks to under an hour.\n\nThe $448 million investment will go toward the submarine industrial base and then expand. It'll be deployed across two major shipbuilders, three public yards, and 100 suppliers, Palantir said in a press release.\n\n\"This investment provides the resources our shipbuilders, shipyards, and suppliers need to modernize their operations and succeed in meeting our nation's defense requirements,\" said Navy Secretary John Phelan in a statement.\n\n\"By enabling industry to adopt AI and autonomy tools at scale, we're helping the shipbuilding industry improve schedules, increase capacity, and reduce costs,\" he added, explaining \"this is about doing business smarter and building the industrial capability our Navy and nation require.\"\n\nMaritime Industrial Base Program, a Navy initiative to revitalize US shipbuilding and repair capabilities, and Naval Sea Systems Command are overseeing the implementation of Ship OS. Both are gathering data from multiple sources to identify where the hiccups are in submarine shipbuilding, how the processes, including engineering, can be sped up, and what specific risks can be mitigated through technology.\n\nProblems in the Navy’s submarine industrial base — from shipbuilders to the repair yards — have been building for decades. Submarines are central to any Pacific fight and a top Pentagon priority, yet major programs like the upgraded Virginia-class submarines and new Columbia-class ballistic missile subs have repeatedly run into delays and cost overruns.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog agency, has documented long-standing problems in the Navy's plans for purchasing and constructing submarines, as well as shipyard deficiencies such as worker inexperience, aging facilities and equipment, and inadequate construction space.\n\nThe introduction of the new Ship OS capability aims to address some of these problems facing US submarine shipbuilding. And once the technology has been used for the submarine programs, the Navy said, it'll apply lessons and adapt them to surface ship programs.",

    "title": "Instagram Is Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Some Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—we can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we can control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, Instagram is now experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the clickbait treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Google told Maiberg the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI reached out to Meta for comment, and this story originally published before they responded. However, a Meta spokesperson has since confirmed to me that Instagram has recently started generating these titles using AI. The goal, according to the spokesperson, is to make it easier to know what a post is about before you click the link. They also noted that these headlines might not be totally correct, as with all AI products. In addition, the spokesperson explained that search engine optimization indexing is not necessarily new. The company has been doing this for years in the U.S. to increase visibility for posts from professional accounts.\n\nThat last point is all fine and good, of course. No one is surprised that Instagram is indexing posts for search engines: Most social media platforms do that. Otherwise, you'd never find any of their posts on platforms like Google. The issue is generating fake headlines with AI without letting anyone know about it. Just because Meta AI is capable of generating headlines doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts, a risk the Meta spokesperson readily admits to. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"\n\nWhile Meta has yet to add a dedicated on/off switch for these headlines, one thing you can do to ensure your posts don't get an AI clickbait makeover is to opt out of indexing as a whole. If you run an account that relies on discoverability, this might not be worth it, since you'll be impacting how users find your posts outside of Instagram. However, if you don't care about that, or you don't need the SEO at all, you can stop Instagram from making your posts available on search engines—and putting an end to the AI-generated headlines, at that.\n\nThere are three ways to accomplish this, according to Instagram:\n\nMake your account private: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. Here, tap the Private account toggle.\n\nSwitch your account from professional to private: Open Instagram's in-app settings, scroll down and tap Account type and tools. Here, choose \"Switch to personal account.\"\n\nManually opt out of indexing: Head to Instagram's in-app settings, then choose Account privacy. You should see an option to stop your public photos and videos from appearing in search engines.",

    "description": "Built to make you extraordinarily productive, Cursor is the best way to code with AI.",
    "fullText": "Coding agents are great at lots of things, but some bugs consistently stump them. That's why we're introducing Debug Mode, an entirely new agent loop built around runtime information and human verification.\n\nTo build it, we examined the practices of the best debuggers on our team. We rolled their workflows into an agent mode, equipping it with tools to instrument code with runtime logs, prompts that generate multiple hypotheses about what's going wrong, and the ability to call back to you to reproduce the issue and verify fixes.\n\nThe result is an interactive process that reliably fixes bugs that were previously beyond the reach of even the smartest models working alone, or could take significant developer time to address.\n\nTo get started, select Debug Mode from the dropdown menu and describe the bug in as much detail as you can.\n\nInstead of immediately trying to generate a fix, the agent reads through your codebase and generates multiple hypotheses about what could be wrong. Some will be ideas you would have thought of on your own, but others will likely be approaches you wouldn't have considered.\n\nThe agent then instruments your code with logging statements designed to test these hypotheses. This prepares the agent to receive concrete data about what's actually happening when the bug occurs.\n\nNext, go to your application and reproduce the bug while the agent collects the runtime logs.\n\nThe agent can see exactly what's happening in your code when the bug occurs: variable states, execution paths, timing information. With this data, it can pinpoint the root cause and generate a targeted fix. Often that's a precise two or three line modification instead of the hundreds of lines of speculative code you'd have received with a standard agent interaction.\n\nAt this point, Debug Mode asks you to reproduce the bug one more time with the proposed fix in place. If the bug is gone, you mark it as fixed and the agent removes all the instrumentation, leaving you with a clean, minimal change you can ship.\n\nThis human-in-the-loop verification is critical. Sometimes bugs are obvious, but other times they fall into a gray area where the fix might work technically but not feel right. The agent can't make that call on its own. If you don't think the bug is fixed, the agent adds more logging, you reproduce again, and it refines its approach until the problem is actually solved.\n\nThis kind of tight back-and-forth is one way we think AI coding works best. The agent handles the tedious work while you make the quick decisions that need human judgment. The result with Debug Mode is that tricky bugs that used to be out of reach are now reliably fixed.\n\nRead the Debug Mode docs. Learn about all the new features in Cursor 2.2.",

    "fullText": "Buying the Zombies, Run! studio wasn’t part of ​my plan, but a post-apocalypse ​game with stories that make people feel seen pulled me in\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nA few days ago, I clicked a button on my phone to send funds to a company in Singapore and so took ownership of the video game I co-created and am lead writer for: Zombies, Run! I am a novelist, I wrote the bestselling, award-winning The Power, which was turned into an Amazon Prime TV series starring Toni Collette. What on earth am I doing buying a games company?\n\nWell. First of all. Zombies, Run! is special. It’s special to me – the game started as a Kickstarter and the community that grew up around it has always been incredibly supportive of what we’re doing. And it’s special in what it does. It’s a game to exercise with. You play it on your smartphone – iPhone or Android – and we tell stories from the zombie apocalypse in your headphones to encourage you to go further, faster, or just make exercise less boring. Games are so often portrayed as the bad entertainment form, but I made a game that fundamentally helps people to be healthier.\n\nThe experience of playing Zombies, Run! is also completely focused on storytelling. My co-creator Adrian Hon and I were talking about doing a project together. He said: “Let’s do something to make running more fun.” I said: “How about if we do a story where you’re being chased by zombies?” And here we are.\n\nWhen you play the game, you’re immersed in a world where every run makes you a hero – you’re collecting supplies, saving a child from no man’s land, investigating the mystery of how the apocalypse started. I’ve always focused on the storytelling being good. And it works. Players of the game become so attached to the characters that many of them report laughing out loud or even “crying while running”.\n\nOne of my jokes about storytelling in video games is that the way we tend to talk about it – in the games industry, in games journalism, even in marketing copy – is very much “never mind the quality, feel the width”. We say things like “this game has 100-plus hours of story” or “this game contains more than a million words”. Imagine marketing a movie saying that the script contains 29,000 words. Or selling a novel on the basis that it’ll take a long time to read.\n\nThat’s not how you do it. You tell the story. You give a hook. You say: “A single woman comes home one evening to find a man claiming to be her husband living in her house. And when he goes up to the attic, a different husband comes down in his place.” Now you can’t wait to find out what happens next. (That, incidentally, is the brilliant comic novel The Husbands by Holly Gramazio – who I think is the only other bestselling novelist to be also making her own video games.)\n\nSo, now I own a games company, what am I going to do? My feeling is that I must focus on the fundamentals. There’s a world of games out there that thinks it can replace writers with AI large language models. I think that’s going to make writing worse and worse. AI writing is fine for boilerplate text that is always roughly the same. It’s fine for non-writers to get their expertise into the world. But storytelling is different. It is human minds finding companionship with other human minds – we need stories, fundamentally, to feel less alone. To know that other people have been through things a bit like what we have. Things that make us laugh, and cry, even while running. You get that from work that is not the same as everything else, you get it from the unique work of other individual human minds.\n\nAnd actually, Zombies, Run! has always been a universe with strong values. We’re not a rightwing, rugged-individualism apocalypse, where one lone person can get through with just their guns. In our world – as in the real world – humans survive by working together.\n\nWhile we’re still going to have many exciting fleeing zombies, battling-the-undead storytelling, I think there’s probably also room in the ZR! universe for a 10-mission arc where you have to find all the figurines and paints you need to complete an expansion set in “Demons and Darkness”; or one where you’re working on bringing an overgrown garden back to blooming, beautiful life; or setting up and running the first post-apocalyptic travelling library while also trying to work out what happened to the first librarian who’s mysteriously disappeared, leaving only a series of cryptic notes in an old manuscript.\n\nAfter all, I do think this is quite a good time in the world to be thinking about how to rebuild after a series of catastrophic events.\n\nSelling story by the yard and not by a story hook is a marker, I think, of a lack of confidence in the form. We don’t need to lack confidence. Games are the biggest entertainment industry in the world. If we want to be taken seriously, we need to take ourselves seriously. Stop talking about the width, start talking about the quality.\n\nIt was the 20th anniversary of Xbox 360 recently, and one name that’s cropped up in every list of the console’s best games is the compulsive retro twin-stick shooter Geometry Wars. If you’re yearning for something similar, you must immediately download Evil Egg, a frenzied twin-stick blaster with gorgeous Commodore 64-style visuals and sound effects. Shoot everything that moves, hit the left trigger to boost and collect hearts to stay alive.\n\nAt first it’s a bewildering mass of rainbow pixels but as you detonate wave after wave of glitchy space pests, you begin to understand the patterns of different enemies and earn upgrades such as the executioner’s sword, which takes out foes in an orbital slash of laser particles. Evil Egg is polished, exciting, wild to look at, and has such a brilliant understanding of the genre and its unique dynamics. It’s free on Steam but I implore you to download it on Itch.io and name your own price.

I particularly enjoyed this post by writer Harper Jay MacIntyre, which considers Horses, formalism and the trans experience. The article manages to bring in so many elements of modern games criticism and academia while providing a highly personal response to the game.\n\nThe most interesting retro game articles are the ones that reassess lost or derided titles rather than merely celebrate the classics. Was the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man the worst game ever? Not according to this compelling analysis from Garrett Martin at AV Club who sees it as a misunderstood brutalist gem. I find myself in agreement.\n\nIt is also nice to see a legendary game justly praised in an interesting way. The BFI’s look at the legacy of Time Crisis considers the gun game in relation to cinema, referencing Beverly Hills Cop and Run Lola Run rather than just comparing it to Sega’s similar Virtua Cop.\n\nSkate Story – hellish premise aside, this is skateboarding paradise | ★★★★☆\n\nHorror game Horses has been banned from sale – but is it as controversial as you’d think?\n\nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 – inept game-based horror is one of the year’s worst | ★☆☆☆☆\n\nThis one comes from reader, Rebecca:\n\n“My elderly grandad is coming to stay with us for Christmas and wants to see what’s happening with video game graphics these days.

    "title": "Pay cuts, poaching, and pivoting: Inside Scale AI after Meta",
    "description": "Five months after Meta's $14 billion deal, Scale AI has lost some of its gleam, with workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele.",
    "fullText": "This summer, after Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, and after A-list clients like OpenAI and Google halted work with the startup, a worker for Scale AI anxiously asked ChatGPT what it thought of his company's fate. He knew the chatbot well, having tested it for vulnerabilities. Its prognosis was grim.\n\n\"Scale AI will no longer exist as a credible independent entity within 24 months,\" ChatGPT, which isn't any kind of official authority, wrote. \"Its infrastructure will be repurposed for Meta's internal needs. Its client base will evaporate. Its role as a neutral red teamer or external evaluator is effectively over.\"\n\nThe contractor shared the chat logs with fellow workers at Scale AI. In one reply reviewed by Business Insider, one worker said that they were already on their way out, describing the startup as a ticking time bomb.\n\nThe chatbot was drawing from a storm of headlines about Scale AI, which until this summer had been touted as one of the most ascendant startups in tech — the place Big Tech companies vying for AI supremacy went to when they wanted their chatbots stress-tested and perfected. Lately, it's lost some of its gleam, with investors significantly lowering valuations, workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele.\n\nThe vast army of human data labelers that made Scale AI a juggernaut are chafing at what they say are pay cuts, lengthy unpaid onboarding sessions to join new AI projects, and thinning workloads — and are increasingly leaving the platform altogether, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by Business Insider.\n\nActivity in the main internal chatroom for Outlier — Scale AI's flagship gig work platform, which touts more than 100,000 taskers — has plummeted since the Meta investment, with weekly discussion threads drawing dozens instead of the usual hundreds of replies, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nOne tasker said that they'd spent close to 40 hours in a single month in unpaid onboarding sessions without landing any actual work, noting that other platforms like Scale AI's rival Mercor do pay for this kind of work. Elizabeth Boyd, another tasker, says she rarely does work for Outlier anymore after seeing effective pay rates for some projects slashed to around $20 an hour — down from the $50 she used to make. One gig that advertised $20 an hour only allowed three minutes of working time every two days, or a 99-cent payout, according to screenshots obtained by Business Insider.\n\nJoe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, says the balance sheets show the company is on the right path. \"This quarter is on track to be our biggest of 2025, our data business is more profitable today than it was before the Meta deal, and our applications business, which includes work with Fortune 500 companies and governments, has doubled revenue\" in the second half of the year compared to the first, Osborne wrote in an email. He also noted there has been an increase in active users on Outlier since the Meta deal, and that pay rates are based on the skills for each project and contributors always see the rates upfront, and have the option of declining any gig.\n\nThe company is also looking to diversify. The startup has embraced fields like robotics, announcing a new lab to meet booming demand for robot training data this fall. It's doubling down on its US military and other government work, winning up to $199 million worth of defense contracts since the Meta deal.\n\nSome investors are bullish. In one current investor's view, Meta has mostly left Scale alone, letting it operate as an independent company. With around $1 billion on the balance sheet, the investor added, there are no plans to fundraise. And an IPO could still be on the table at some point.\n\nOther investors see Scale AI as more like a gutted fish. The Meta investment — which valued Scale AI at $29 billion — has dented Scale AI's valuation in private markets where people buy and sell equity from pre-IPO startups. Noel Moldvai, Augment's CEO, tells Business Insider his platform used to process millions of dollars' worth of transactions in Scale AI stock before the Meta deal, but that dried up as sellers waited to see if the startup rebounded. Activity is picking up again, he said, but at lower valuations of around $15 billion to $9 billion. The underlying message of Meta's semi-acquisition is clear to Moldvai. \"It seems like Meta was just after Alexandr Wang, and so this is probably the structure that let them get him,\" he says. He adds that Scale AI's valuation could still bounce back.\n\nOn another marketplace, Caplight, Scale's valuation has dropped to $7.3 billion. Osborne says that the valuation is not accurate because there have been no sales of stock at that price and multiples of comparable companies would yield a higher valuation.\n\nIf the company doesn't pull it off, it could become the latest example of a once-promising startup that morphed into a \"zombie\" after being invested in by a tech giant.\n\nThis summer, Scale AI painted a rosy picture of the Meta investment, describing it as a major cash infusion and source of future work in its official statement at the time of the deal. That messaging was also conveyed to the startup's corporate workforce, says another former member of Scale AI's red team, which tests chatbots for flaws and vulnerabilities. Just a few weeks after the investment, he was laid off as part of a major downsizing that saw 14% of Scale AI's full-time staff of 1,400 let go.\n\nOsborne said the layoffs were aimed at making the data division profitable, which it now is.\n\nThose weren't the only cuts. In September, Scale AI terminated 12 contractors on its red team, citing performance issues. Two ex-red teamers told Business Insider that the team's work had been drying up since the Meta deal, blaming thinning workloads for the cuts. Later that month, Scale AI shuttered a team in Dallas of contractors focused on generalist AI work as it moved towards more specialized fields.\n\nOsborne said the 12 contractors were part of Scale's temporary workforce and represented a small fraction of its overall red team, which the company is still committed to investing in. He said the Dallas cuts were part of an industry shift towards higher skilled work and represent a small fraction of its overall workforce.\n\nMeanwhile, a swarm of AI training startups has rushed in to poach Scale AI's workers and clients. Some are now raising capital at soaring valuations. Surge AI hit a valuation of $24 billion while Mercor, which is run by three 22-year-olds, announced in October it had raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation.\n\nMercor has won at least one major AI training project from Meta, Scale AI's 49% shareholder. In September, Scale AI filed a lawsuit in California against Mercor alleging it hired one of its sales employees to poach its biggest customers, allegations Mercor denies.\n\nOne Scale AI investor said he'd been frustrated with Scale AI's leadership losing customers to Surge AI in particular, which reportedly brought in more revenue than Scale in 2024, despite never having raised outside funding. (Scale AI had raised more than $1.5 billion before the Meta deal.)\n\nBrendan Foody, Mercor's CEO, has publicly criticized Scale AI for what he claims are low pay rates and data quality issues. \"Scale lost the focus on product, on scaling quality,\" Foody said in a September podcast appearance. In response, a Scale AI spokesperson told Business Insider its quality metrics are at \"record highs.\"\n\nIt's not just rival CEOs making that point. Tammy Hartline, who managed projects for Scale AI as a consultant until the summer of 2025, said Scale grew so quickly that the work became more about needing bodies than skills. \"Spam and low quality data became accepted as a cost of doing business,\" she said. Hartline joined Mercor in September.\n\nScale AI has also been beset with security issues that predate Meta's investment. In June, Business Insider reported that Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, including Google, Meta, and xAI. That practice left AI training documents labeled \"confidential\" accessible to anyone with the link and exposed reams of personal information, like private emails and pay details, about contractors. \"We take data security seriously,\" Osborne said. \"We conducted a thorough investigation and disabled any user's ability to publicly share documents from Scale managed systems.\"\n\nSloppy security isn't uncommon in the AI training space — Surge AI similarly left open sensitive work for its client Anthropic. But the exposed documents seen by Business Insider show that for a project for Google, Scale AI faced security and quality issues throughout 2023 and 2024. Thousands of taskers were flagged for being \"suspected spammers,\" \"cheaters,\" with hundreds of workers listed in spreadsheets with titles like \"Good and Bad Folks\" and \"suspicious non-US taskers.\" Meta recently removed more than 40 groups buying and reselling AI training accounts, including from Scale AI, in response to a recent Business Insider investigation. Osborne said Scale's data quality metrics are the highest they've ever been.\n\nThe company has notched some recent wins. It once appeared bogged down by litigation, but recently agreed to settle multiple lawsuits filed by ex-workers in California who alleged they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors. (Scale no longer accepts gig workers from the state.) The big question remains whether Scale AI can thrive in the increasingly competitive AI training industry it helped give birth to. For many former workers, it'll be too late to find out.\n\nCharles Rollet is Business Insider's tech correspondent in San Francisco.

    "title": "Why the music industry is changing its tune on AI",
    "description": "Your 2026 Spotify wrapped may include a shocking amount of 'robot rock.'",
    "fullText": "Last month, \"Walk My Walk\" hit number one on Billboard's Country Digital Song Sales chart. The moody stomp-clap tune, with lyrics like \"Every scar's a story that I survived, I've been through hell, but I'm still alive,\" has been played more than 8 million times on Spotify. The song wasn't performed by a human artist — Breaking Rust, despite having the face of a handsome, rugged man in a cowboy hat on its Spotify profile, is an AI project. But there is a real person claiming that Breaking Rust's work is a copycat: Blanco Brown, an artist who mixes country and rap together, who claims the song's creator used AI to emulate his style. The person behind Breaking Rust did not respond to a message I sent asking about the origin of the sound.\n\nIt's the latest example of ways that AI-generated music, with its opaque origins, can create confusion around who really made a song just as easily as it can create a hit. AI-generated music that sounds a lot like your faves but was made with a few prompts has been going viral, spreading far and wide and more quickly than music labels can always have it removed.\n\nWhen some of the first AI-generated tracks started racking up listens two years ago, music labels went to battle, threatening and filing legal action to stop AI generators from training on and using their artists' voices and music stylings. Universal Music Group (UMG) pushed to have a YouTube video where Eminem's voice rapped about cats taken down. Spotify removed AI slop songs that were listened to by bots to reap the streaming earning pool, and UMG also got streaming platforms to remove a viral \"Drake\" song that wasn't by Drake and The Weeknd at all, but a song written by Ghostwriter, an anonymous artist that uses AI to produce music and appears publicly only when cloaked in white and dark glasses.\n\nNow, the labels are starting to drop their fists and shake hands with AI music generators.\n\nWarner Music Group announced last month it had settled a lawsuit against AI music generator Suno (a test of the service by plaintiffs in the suit found that Suno would churn out works similar to ABBA and Chuck Berry when prompted in their style) and entered into a partnership with the company. Robert Kyncl, CEO of WMG, called it \"a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone.\" The announcement came just weeks after UMG, the world's largest record label, settled its copyright infringement lawsuit with AI music generator Udio, and said the two have partnered to create a new subscription service, slated to launch next year, run on gen AI and licensed music from the label's artists.\n\nAI companies face a litany of lawsuits after using copyrighted material to train their models. The battle is playing out in Hollywood, the news industry, and in visual arts — the music industry is the latest to decide it might be better to play nice with AI than continue a prickly, drawn out court battle when their rights sit in a gray area. \"AI is here to stay, it's transformative,\" Chris Wares, assistant chair of the Music Business Department at Berklee College of Music. The record labels, he says, are \"futureproofing themselves.\"\n\nThe proliferation of AI-generated voices and music stylings has sent a flood of new songs — some good, many uncatchy slop — onto streaming platforms and social media. There are more than 100 million songs on Spotify, Apple Music, and Bandcamp, and many are rarely or never played. Deezer, a French streaming platform, said in April that people were uploading some 20,000 fully AI-generated tracks each day, comprising nearly a fifth of all new content. As more playlists and artists making gen AI music are uploaded, human artists must fight for your ears. In July, a group called The Velvet Sundown rapidly racked up 1 million listens on two albums, something that many indie bands struggle to do on streaming platforms — but the photos of the band on social media are AI generated, and the real person or people behind the project remain unknown. In November, Billboard identified at least six AI or AI-assisted songs that had climbed onto its various charts. Amid the deluge, Spotify updated its impersonation policy in September, saying it would remove songs that featured the unauthorized use of someone's voice.\n\nIf someone makes a banger AI cover song or viral mashup, like reuniting Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham for a new Fleetwood Mac album or squashing the beef between Kendrick and Drake in a generated collaboration, the novelty factor could drive listening numbers that cut into original work from those artists. But the aim of these partnerships is to create new revenue streams for artists. The Warner deal stipulates that Suno will allow only paid accounts to download generated audio, and says artists must opt-in to having their names, voices, compositions, and likeness regenerated. In an industry where streaming has dramatically reduced royalties, that could be a boost — if fans make music of their faves, it could lead to passive income for the musicians. But that also means the artists' original works will be competing for ears against derivatives of themselves not just for your ears, but for streaming dollars.\n\n\"The reason why no generative AI music can be artist-first is because we are in a finite attention economy. Every minute that is spent listening to a generative AI track is a minute less spent listening to an artist track,\" Mark Mulligan, founder and senior music analyst at research firm MIDiA says. \"We are definitely in a world now where more and more consumers are creating, and that is competing with entertainment time.\"\n\nPart of that creative process may draw us back to older roots in how people interact with music. For hundreds, if not thousands, of years, music was communal. People played it together and used it to pass down stories. With recording technology and radios, music became widely distributed, which \"created this moat between artist and fan,\" Mulligan says. \"We got to this idea that music is a creative full stop, and that the audience doesn't help shape what the music is apart from when you go and see the band play live.\" But now, AI tools are becoming the ultimate form of fan expression. \"We're widening the funnel of creativity,\" says Mulligan.\n\nThat's if artists authorize their voices to be used by the platforms. Some forward-thinking musicians, like Grimes, have already made clones of their voices and invited listeners to experiment. It's less clear if your typical popstar will OK the use of their voice to sing words they haven't seen, and if the potential new revenue streams of such an experiment would prove worth the risk. On Friday, Brown released a \"trailertrap\" remix of \"Walk My Walk,\" a sort of taking back of his own style after seeing it emulated. So far, it has just 2,000 streams. \"If someone is going to sing like me, it should be me,\" Brown told the Associated Press last month. Going forward, it will likely take more than one listen to know if the music we hear is performed by the artists we've come to love.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "description": "Chris Lattner helped build the software behind Google TPUs. Now he's coming after Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, where bold technical bets abound, few bets look bolder than trying to break the grip of Nvidia's CUDA, a software stack that's quietly become the operating system of the AI boom.\n\nThat's what Modular, a startup founded by software gurus from Apple and Google, is trying to do.\n\nCofounders Chris Lattner and Tim Davis have spent decades building the software plumbing that sits beneath the modern tech industry. Lattner is famous for creating Apple's Swift programming language. He also built the software underpinning Google's TPU AI chips, with Modular cofounder Tim Davis.\n\nThey're now aiming that expertise at CUDA itself. The attempt borders on madness, but it's the kind of audacious project that could transform the AI industry.\n\n\"It's seen by a lot of people as somewhat crazy,\" said Kylan Gibbs, CEO of startup Inworld AI and a former product manager at Google DeepMind. \"That's where Chris has the advantage: He's smart enough to actually know how to do it, and somewhat crazy enough to set out to do it.\"\n\nCUDA began life almost 20 years ago as a way to make graphics chips programmable. Today, it has grown into a multilayered software ecosystem — language, libraries, compilers, inference systems — that most AI companies rely on.\n\nThat success comes at a cost: Most of the industry is now optimized around a single vendor's hardware. CUDA binds AI workloads to Nvidia GPUs. That is great for Nvidia, but deeply limiting for everyone else.\n\nOn the surface, there seems to be a ton of competition: AMD sells GPUs. Google has TPUs. Amazon created Trainium AI chips, and a host of startups are building similar hardware.\n\nThe problem is that each chip comes with its own software stack optimized just for that component. That means an endless reinvention of the wheel. Most of the time, it's simpler to just stick with CUDA — and Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nAnd yet, AI developers crave portability: Being able to use any combination of GPUs from multiple providers without juggling different software stacks.\n\n\"Nobody is building portable stuff, because why would anyone work on software for more than one chip when the chip projects themselves are doing the software?\" Lattner, Modular's CEO, told me in an interview.\n\nNvidia could extend CUDA to run well on rival AI chips. But doing so would undermine Nvidia's greatest moat: the closed-loop bond between its software and its chips. \"Obviously, they don't want portability,\" he said.\n\nFor Lattner, this paradox presents a big opportunity.\n\n\"We realized there's nobody in the industry that's actually incentivized to do this. It's very expensive, very hard,\" he said. \"And at the same time, everybody wants it.\"\n\nThat's what inspired Lattner and Davis to leave Google and start Modular in 2022, the year ChatGPT took the world by storm.\n\nSince then, Modular has raised $380 million from investors including Greylock, General Catalyst, and GV, Google's venture capital arm. The latest financing in September valued the startup at $1.6 billion. Modular isn't the only effort to break the CUDA lock-in. There has been ZLUDA, an open-source project that was funded by AMD, and more recently, the startup Spectral Compute, which has raised $6 million.\n\nLattner has used some of this money to hire talented programmers from Google, Apple, and other tech companies. They spent three years working in relative obscurity to create the building blocks of a new AI software stack.\n\nThe foundation starts with a brand-new programming language, called Mojo, that offers deep controls for making AI chips run as efficiently as possible.\n\nModular designed this to work similarly to Python, a popular and easy-to-use programming language. But Mojo also has the speed and power of other, more complex languages, such as C++, that are essential for AI development. Mojo also works well with PyTorch, an open-source framework that is often used when building AI models and applications.\n\nI first heard about Modular earlier this year when interviewing Carles Gelada, a former OpenAI researcher. \"There are several interesting projects to create GPU-agnostic frameworks and platforms, and challenge CUDA,\" he said at the time. \"Mojo is the most interesting one.\"\n\nMAX is the next major layer of Modular's new software stack. It powers AI inference, which is how models are run. This part of the system works with Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs, and similar chips from Apple. Modular hopes to add more AI chips in the future.\n\nOn top of that is another layer called Mammoth, which helps AI developers manage GPU clusters.\n\nIn late September, Modular announced that it got top performance out of Nvidia's new Blackwell B200 GPUs and AMD's latest MI355X GPUs — crucially on the same software platform.\n\nLattner said Modular got these AMD GPUs to perform roughly 50% better than when these chips run on AMD's own software.\n\nMore importantly, the ability to run different GPUs on the same software stack now supports the tantalizing opportunity to compare Nvidia's offerings with rival AI chips on a more level playing field.\n\n\"The obvious question is: can MI355X compete with Blackwell?\" Modular wrote in a blog announcing the results. \"Early signs point to yes.\"\n\nGibbs, the CEO of Inworld AI, has been putting Modular's software through its paces in the real world.\n\nInworld builds high-speed, real-time conversational AI technology that supports offerings from big companies, including Disney, NBCUniversal, and Niantic Labs.\n\nEarlier this year, when the startup designed a new text-to-speech AI model and got early access to Nvidia B200 GPUs, they issued Modular a challenge: Cut our costs by 60% and reduce our latency by 40% and we'll work with you.\n\n\"Within about four weeks, we were able to get this incredible performance,\" said Gibbs, who signed a partnership deal with Modular soon after. \"I've bet with my wallet.\"\n\nWhile Inworld was mostly lured by Modular's performance gains on Nvidia's latest GPUs, Gibbs likes the flexibility of using different AI chips more easily in the future, if needed.\n\n\"The promise is that we'd be able to move to new hardware,\" he said. \"Let's say AMD takes off, let's say TPUs take off for Google, or there could be other new hardware that comes online. So it's nice to have that optionality.\"\n\nIn fact, Google's TPUs are suddenly having a moment. The internet giant released a new AI model called Gemini 3 to rave reviews recently. That was trained and run using TPUs, and some other AI companies have signed deals to use these chips instead of, or alongside of, Nvidia GPUs.\n\nThat's put Nvidia on the defensive. A project like Modular, with its promise of portability across different AI hardware, adds to this pressure.\n\n\"Nvidia could kill this in a day,\" said Gibbs of the Modular project. \"Nvidia could basically say, 'okay, we don't really care that you run just on Nvidia hardware. Here's a CUDA option that runs on AMD GPUs as well.' It'd be a bit crazy for them to do that, but it's something they could do and that would of course be somewhat bad.\"\n\nFor all Lattner's critique of the industry, he says Modular is not trying to kill Nvidia. In fact, he argues that Nvidia will continue to thrive, even if Modular succeeds spectacularly.\n\n\"We're trying to build something like Android, but for AI hardware,\" he told me, referring to Google's mobile operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones.\n\nDespite billions of people using Android devices, this success didn't kill iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. iPhones still rule in the US, for example.\n\nLattner thinks something similar will happen in AI as Modular's software makes other hardware more competitive, giving developers more freedom, and chipping away at the industry's single-vendor monoculture.\n\n\"So Nvidia doesn't have to die, but we do want more competition. We do want more innovation,\" he said. \"I think that's good for the world.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Surge AI CEO Edwin Chen said data labeling is often over-simplified. In his view, the work is \"a lot more like raising a child.\"",
    "fullText": "It could be easy to dismiss the work data-labeling firms do. Surge AI CEO Edwin Chen said that could stem from misunderstanding what they do.\n\n\"I think a lot of people think of data labeling as it relates to simplistic work, like labeling cat photos and drawing boundary marks around cars,\" Chen told Lenny Rachitsky on his \"Lenny podcast.\"\n\nChen, who previously worked at Google, Twitter, and Meta, said that he's \"always hated the word data labeling.\"\n\n\"Because it just paints this very simplistic picture when I think what we're doing is completely different,\" he said.\n\nSurge AI, which Chen founded in 2020, competes in the AI data labeling space with companies like Scale AI and Mercor. Surge also has a partnership with Anthropic and also runs DataAnnotation.tech, where freelancers can These remote workers are often referred to as \"ghost workers\" for their behind-the-scenes labor that is critical to AI's development.\n\nBeyond any rote work it can entail, Chen said data labeling is a much more creative endeavor. He compared what companies like Surge do to how parents instill lifelong values in their children.\n\n\"I think a lot about what we're doing as a lot more like raising a child,\" he said. \"You don't just feed a child information. You're teaching them values, and creativity, and what's beautiful, and these infinite subtle things about what makes somebody a good person.\"\n\nIn this way, Chen said, companies like Surge AI are \"raising humanity's children.\"\n\nChen's view can also be seen when you navigate to Surge's website, which greets visitors with the question: \"What made Hemingway, Kahlo, and von Neumann extraordinary?\"\n\n\"Their life experiences: war, love, triumph, loss. The people they met, the cities they explored, the thousand choices that made them who they were,\" the website reads. \"Data does for AI what life did for them — transforming it into intelligence that could one day prove the Riemann hypothesis, imagine new philosophies, and send rockets to the stars.\"\n\nChen previously worked in Big Tech at companies including Twitter, Google, and Facebook — and you might remember one of his Twitter projects.\n\nWhile at the company, roughly a decade before Elon Musk would acquire it, Chen became known for making the \"Pop vs. Soda\" map by geo-tagging data from tweets around the US to illustrate which word users used to refer to soft drinks.\n\nLooking back at starting Surge AI, Chen said he was surprised to find out that he never had to stop burying his head in the data.\n\n\"I thought if I started a company, I'd have to become a business person looking at financials all day, and being in meetings all day, and doing all this stuff that sounded incredibly boring, and I always hated,\" he told Rachitsky. \"So, I think it's crazy that didn't end up being true at all.\"\n\nChen said he wishes he had known that you don't need to spend \"constantly tweeting and hyping and fundraising.\"\n\n\"You don't need to become someone you're not,\" he said. \"You can actually build a successful company by simply building something so good that it cuts through all that noise. And I think if I had known this was possible, I would've started even sooner.\"\n\nDo you work in data labeling?

    "description": "Pilots being able to control many drones is \"kind of a prerequisite\" for \"the total drone warfare that is coming to all of us,\" Ark Robotics told BI.",
    "fullText": "The future of warfare will demand one soldier being able to control huge swarms of drones that can work together autonomously, a Ukrainian arms maker predicted.\n\nAchi, the CEO of Ukrainian defense firm Ark Robotics, told Business Insider the shift from one drone per pilot to one pilot controlling many is \"kind of a prerequisite to be successful in the total drone warfare that is coming to all of us.\"\n\nWith a one-pilot, one-drone system, the only way to scale up drone fleets is by expanding the number of operators.\n\n\"This is just not sustainable,\" Achi told Business Insider, using a pseudonym as a security precaution. \"You can scale drone manufacturing much more than you can pilots,\" he added.\n\nArk Robotics develops autonomous robots used by over 20 Ukrainian brigades and is creating a system that enables thousands of aerial drones and ground robots, including those not manufactured by the company, to collaborate with minimal human intervention. It's working toward single operator control of many drones.\n\nCountries around the world, from Ukraine to Western allies to rivals like Russia and China, are supercharging combat drone manufacturing. \"You can have all these fancy drones,\" Achi said, but \"what is the use of them if you can't really deploy them at scale?\"\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has involved more drones than any other conflict in history, and innovation in their capabilities has been rapid. The West is paying attention, thinking about what it may need as it worries that Russia could spark a wider conflict with NATO.\n\nDrone technology is critical for Ukraine, vastly outnumbered by Russia's significantly larger military, as it offers mass. But one drone per operator doesn't offer anywhere near the advantage that swarming could. And reducing human involvement and embracing autonomy can accelerate combat action. That's why interest in swarm technology is surging.\n\nThere is no confirmed deployment of large, fully autonomous swarms of drones that can act without significant human oversight on the battlefield, but it would be absolutely game-changing.\n\nThat kind of capability opens up \"a whole world of tactics and strategies that we've not even thought of yet,\" James Patton Rogers, a drone expert at the Cornell Brooks Tech Policy Institute, previously told Business Insider.\n\nThe combat system that Ark is working on, called Frontier, is still in the prototype stage and is just one example of many efforts in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government says the country is pushing for the technology, but \"these systems are also just getting started,\" Achi said.\n\nUkraine demonstrates that quantity can become a kind of quality, he said, explaining that \"to really get an advantage of that, you need these asymmetrical systems that allow you to work with multiple drones at the same time.\"\n\nThat's a lesson for the West as much as it is for Ukraine.\n\nWestern officials, defense experts, and industry insiders have cautioned that to meet Russia's style of warfare — heavily attritional, masses of drones and missiles, and intense artillery barrages — militaries need a greater volume of cheap weapons developed and produced quickly, not a limited stockpile of highly advanced systems developed over decades and produced over years.\n\nDrone swarms are key to that kind of war.\n\nThere's no guarantee that drones would play as significant a role in a war involving the West as they have in Ukraine — in part because Ukraine's reliance on them is tied to shortages of other weaponry and other capability disadvantages.\n\nBut many officials still warn that the West needs far more drone and counter-drone capabilities. Swarming systems are among them.\n\nSwedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson told Business Insider that his country identified the need for drone swarms from watching this war and that it has rushed to produce technology to allow one soldier to autonomously control up to 100 drones. It's not clear when that could be operational. Other NATO members are working on this technology, too.\n\nHowever, there is still no broad NATO-wide investment in these capabilities and no clear sense of when — or whether — they could be fielded. Across the alliance, many officials warn that lessons aren't being acted on fast enough and that production of weaponry remains too slow. It's also unclear how autonomous future systems will actually be.\n\nAchi said the current autonomy in defense systems is \"greatly overhyped,\" but noted that the battlefield shows autonomy is necessary and \"past the point of no return.\"\n\nThere is acknowledgment, from industry and officials, that autonomy is needed to break past manpower limits, increase speed, and keep troops safer.\n\nThe CEO of Origin Robotics, a drone maker in NATO member Latvia that supplies Ukraine, previously told Business Insider he sees autonomy as essential to NATO’s defense, especially for the smaller member states bordering Russia.\n\n\"For a NATO country, you need a scalable solution,\" Agris Kipurs argued. \"Autonomy, in our case, is what allows us to scale. We don't have the numbers in terms of infantry.\"\n\nAchi said he wants Europe not only to learn from Ukraine and catch up to its drone leadership, but to think further ahead. He described Europe as \"having the time\" compared to Ukraine, which is fighting for survival.\n\nIf Europe's increased defense spending \"goes to outdated technology or just wrongly copied technology, it doesn't make any sense to me,\" he said. \"So I want to see them thinking a few steps ahead and taking lessons from the lessons.\"",

It's also how Tom Brady scored his seventh Super Bowl ring, with the Buccaneers, after being cast off by the Patriots.\n\nWhen you've had a taste of greatness, it's normal to keep pushing.\n\nThis same logic can be applied to the stock market. The S&P 500 is up big again, for a third straight year. It's been a veritable bonanza for 401(k)s everywhere. Yet there's a clear dividing line between the haves and have-nots: exposure to the Magnificent 7.\n\nYes, the annual percentage return for the S&P 500 has been solidly in the teens and mid-20s in recent years, but the Mag 7's gain over similar periods have dwarfed that.\n\nEven though everyday investors have been doing just fine, it's normal to have a bit of FOMO about a trade that's doing even better. And although the S&P 500 is naturally weighted towards the Mag 7, why not aspire for more?\n\nThis all begs the question: When will the other 493 companies in the S&P finally feel the same love that the Mag 7 has enjoyed these last couple of years?\n\nThe answer is: potentially soon! At least if the likes of HSBC are to be believed.\n\nWhile HSBC's S&P 500 price target of 7,500 — and its reasons for bullishness — are largely in line with consensus, the firm's view that the S&P 493 could start catching up to the Mag 7 commands attention.\n\nThe main argument is that continued heavy capital spending will slow Mag 7 earnings growth (except for Nvidia, from which the other companies will be buying).\n\nThis is reflected in the chart below, which shows Mag 7 earnings growth (gray line) converging with S&P 493 profit expansion (black line) throughout 2026 after years of outpacing it.\n\n\"That could open the door for companies outside the Magnificent 7 to outperform,\" HSBC's strategists wrote, noting that outsized earnings growth has been key for the tech elite.\n\nThis expansion of returns — known as breadth — will be particularly key for stock-pickers who make their hay when there are more gains to go around. It will also be a key sign of health for skeptics wary of heavy tech concentration.\n\nIf it pans out, it should be enough to placate investors hungry for more.

The reality is a lot more complicated.\n\nScale AI has faced a turbulent five months since Meta purchased a 49% stake in the startup, write BI's Charles Rollet and Ben Bergman. Once a leader in the field of stress testing and perfecting AI models for Big Tech, Scale AI has faced pay cuts, poaching, and pivots since the Meta deal.\n\nIt's representative of how dealmaking with big players can be a double-edged sword in the age of AI.\n\nFor some, like Scale AI cofounder Alexandr Wang, who's now a high-level Meta exec, the deal was a windfall. However, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by BI, Scale AI has faced some inner turmoil following the Meta deal.\n\nJoe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, strongly disputed that the startup's business has been in trouble since the Meta investment and said this quarter is on track to be the company's biggest of the year.\n\nNot all of Scale AI's issues are related to the Meta deal. A BI investigation this June found Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs for work with its Big Tech clients. (There was no indication of a breach, and Scale did lock down the documents after BI's report about the issue.) It also faced litigation over claims it misclassified and underpaid contract workers.\n\nBut one of the larger problems stems from some Big Tech companies pausing work with Scale now that one of their competitors — Meta — is its biggest backer.\n\nThe AI environment means more startups could encounter similar issues.\n\nThe Scale AI-Meta deal was unique in many ways, but there are still lessons to be learned from the aftermath.\n\nThe top-heavy ecosystem of the AI marketplace means there are a limited number of landing spots for startups looking for exit opportunities. Add in the ultra-competitive nature of the space, and a deal with one company could mean the end of business with the others.\n\nOf course, not every startup will get acquired by a tech giant. And yes, some startups will have products that companies will need to use regardless of their backers. But for the vast majority of young AI companies, that's not a reality.\n\nSo, if the industry faces a bit of turmoil and funding dries up, startups may have some difficult decisions about who they cut deals with and which doors could close to them.",

You can install different apps and agents in order to do the job for you,\" Shapes cofounder and CEO Arnon Nir told Business Insider.\n\nFor example, an AI agent can proactively notify a member of HR that an employee is at risk of leaving, based on data points such as low salary, high performance, and recent absences.\n\nThe startup's AI agents can automate other workflows, such as payroll or contract drafting, based on prompts from HR staff. Employees can use the platform for HR tasks such as booking time off and also ask AI agents for information, including details about company policies.\n\nShapes, which has rebranded from DreamTeam, was founded in 2020 by Nir and Shirley Baumer, who were previously founding members of HR tech company Monday.com.\n\nIn addition to the app store-like structure, which the startup calls \"PeopleOS,\" customers can build their own bespoke applications on the platform using prompts, similar to vibe coding.\n\nShapes says its modular design can help companies scale up and down as the size of workforces fluctuates in the AI era.\n\n\"Every company needs to rethink its structure, its people, its culture. And every company needs to kind of find itself from scratch,\" Baumer told Business Insider.\n\nThe HR tech market is highly competitive, with an increasing number of players — such as Workday and HiBob — integrating AI into their solutions. Nir said the modular nature of its software is one of its competitive advantages.\n\n\"Every company works differently. You want to give them the power to decide what they want to use,\" Nir said.\n\nShapes says it has \"hundreds of customers\" located in 79 countries and spanning 14 industries, including retail, manufacturing, and technology. Its customers include Quantum Machines, NextSilicon, Healthee, Arena Entertainment, and Imagen, according to Shapes. It operates as a software-as-a-service business model, charging a flat rate per employee at the company.\n\nThe funding consists of $15 million in Series A, closed in October, and a previously unannounced $4.5 million seed investment, as well as a $4.5 million seed extension. The Series A round was led by Entrée Capital, with participation from NFX and F2 Venture Capital, which led the seed round.\n\nShapes said it would use the funding to more than double its head count over the next year and expand into new markets.\n\nHere's an exclusive look at the 10-page pitch deck Shapes used to raise $24 million.",

    "description": "Researchers say that overrelying on AI can dull critical thinking, distort expertise, and disrupt how workers learn and advance.",
    "fullText": "Have you caught yourself feeling unusually confident at work — or unsure about errors slipping through your workflow?\n\nA new report from the Work AI Institute, produced with researchers from universities including Notre Dame, Harvard, and UC Santa Barbara, and released on Wednesday, said that AI is turning ordinary office workers into people who feel smarter and more productive while their underlying skills slowly erode.\n\n\"AI is putting expertise into our hands in a way that's not always predictable,\" Rebecca Hinds, head of the Work AI Institute at workplace search company Glean and the report's coauthor, told Business Insider.\n\n\"There's often this illusion that you have more expertise, more skills than you actually do,\" she said. \"Even if you're very well aware you're using the technology, it's often unclear where your knowledge ends and where the technology begins.\"\n\nHinds drew a parallel to the rise of search engines, when people began to mistake easy access to information for genuine understanding.\n\nWith generative AI, she said, that illusion is even more powerful — and the risks are higher.\n\nHinds said these risks are most obvious in creative and knowledge-intensive roles.\n\nWorkers are increasingly using AI to beat the \"blank page,\" she said, and generate first drafts of writing.\n\nThat speeds things up, she said, but it also strips away the messy, time-consuming work of wrestling with ideas.\n\n\"The more you poke holes in it, the more it feels yours and the more you commit to it, and the more you're able to fight for it in a meeting if someone pushes back,\" she said.\n\n\"That process is highly inefficient,\" she added, \"but it's also really healthy.\" And if workers lean too heavily on AI to skip it, \"your skills are going to atrophy.\"\n\nThe report suggested that AI can create either a \"cognitive dividend\" or \"cognitive debt.\"\n\nUsed intentionally, as a partner in domains where you already have expertise, it can free up time and sharpen judgment. However, used as a reflexive shortcut, it leads to weaker skills and misplaced confidence, it said.\n\nHinds said that the roles with the highest exposure are early-career jobs.\n\nThose are the roles that traditionally function as apprenticeships: junior developers learning from senior engineers, entry-level marketers learning how to build campaigns, and young analysts learning how to structure a model from scratch, she said.\n\nIf those tasks are automated away or if juniors rely entirely on AI to do them, they may never develop the underlying skills they need to advance, she said.\n\nHinds said leaders are often unintentionally exacerbating the illusion-of-expertise problem.\n\nA big red flag, she said, is \"organizations stack-ranking employees based on how many times they're clicking an AI tool as a marker of AI adoption or AI productivity or AI success.\"\n\nIn some companies, usage metrics are tied directly to performance reviews.\n\nEmployees \"are incentivized to click the tool more rather than invest in a deep understanding of the tool,\" she added.\n\nInstead, she said, companies should tie AI to existing business goals — quality, customer satisfaction, innovation — and measure whether it actually improves those, not just how often it's used.\n\nHinds doesn't think the solution is to shun AI. She thinks it's to be far more deliberate about its use.\n\nShe recommended three questions for workers and leaders:\n\nAI \"does not magically transform you as a leader,\" Hinds said. \"More often, it amplifies what already exists within the organization.\"",

    "description": "Howard Marks, cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management, said AI could strip people of the structure, purpose, and self-worth they gain from work.",
    "fullText": "That's one of the words legendary investor Howard Marks used to describe the impacts of AI on the workforce.\n\n\"I find the resulting outlook for employment terrifying. I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can't find jobs because of it,\" Marks wrote in his latest blog post on Tuesday.\n\nThe billionaire and cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management has been writing memos for 35 years; in one recent post, he experimented with using AI to assist him in writing.\n\nTech leaders such as Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have called for versions of a universal basic income — a guaranteed income paid regularly to all adults if jobs become obsolete — as a solution to AI-related job and pay loss.\n\nBut Mark said that even if governments find a way to fund universal basic incomes, it doesn't account for a key issue: That people get a lot more from jobs than just a paycheck.\n\n\"A job gives them a reason to get up in the morning, imparts structure to their day, gives them a productive role in society and self-respect,\" he said.\n\n\"How will these things be replaced? I worry about large numbers of people receiving subsistence checks and sitting around idle all day,\" he added.\n\nThe estimates on how many jobs will be affected by AI vary. An IMF analysis from 2024 suggested that around 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected by AI, with half benefiting from the technology and the other being negatively impacted by it.\n\nA McKinsey Global Institute report released last month found that technologies could automate more than half of US work hours.\n\nBut Marks isn't alone in worrying about what happens to meaning when work vanishes.\n\nKate O'Neill, a tech advisor who helps companies navigate AI ethics and digital transformation, said in a recent TED Talk that as we hand more decisions and language over to AI, we risk surrendering a fundamentally human capacity — creating meaning from lived experience — not just losing tasks to machines.\n\nJames Barrat, author of \"The Intelligence Explosion: When AI Beats Humans at Everything,\" told Business Insider he believes people can find new purpose in a universal basic income world through volunteering and community service work — but only after a long, painful transition in which many lose jobs before rebuilding meaning somewhere else.\n\nIf AI is set to reshape work as profoundly as some people expect, tech leaders say young people will need to develop skill sets machines can't easily mimic.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, the so-called godfather of AI, has said that \"mundane intellectual labor\" roles are most at risk because of AI.\n\n\"I'd say it's going to be a long time before it's as good at physical manipulation,\" Hinton said of AI earlier this year. \"So a good bet would be to be a plumber.\"\n\nOpenAI's chief economist, Ronnie Chatterji, said he is teaching his kids the importance of critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and flexibility — preparing them for a world in which job titles shift faster than curricula can keep pace.\n\nElon Musk recently said that while some of his older children recognize how quickly their skills could be overtaken by AI, he still supports them going to college.\n\n\"If you want to go to college for social reasons, I think that's a reason to go — to be around people your own age in a learning environment,\" he said.\n\n\"If you do, just try to learn as much as possible across a wide range of subjects,\" he added.",

    "description": "We’re on a journey to advance and democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.",
    "fullText": "We gave Claude the ability to fine-tune language models using a new tool called Hugging Face Skills. Not just write training scripts, but to actually submit jobs to cloud GPUs, monitor progress, and push finished models to the Hugging Face Hub. This tutorial shows you how it works and how to use it yourself.\n\nClaude Code can use \"skills\"—packaged instructions, scripts, and domain knowledge—to accomplish specialized tasks. The hf-llm-trainer skill teaches Claude everything it needs to know about training: which GPU to pick for your model size, how to configure Hub authentication, when to use LoRA versus full fine-tuning, and how to handle the dozens of other decisions that go into a successful training run.\n\nWith this skill, you can tell Claude things like:\n\nThe model trains on Hugging Face GPUs while you do other things. When it's done, your fine-tuned model appears on the Hub, ready to use.\n\nThis isn't a toy demo. The skill supports the same training methods used in production: supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. You can train models from 0.5B to 70B parameters, convert them to GGUF for local deployment, and run multi-stage pipelines that combine different techniques.\n\nHugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI. With integrations on the way for Cursor, Windsurf, and Continue.\n\nThis repo includes gemini-extension.json to integrate with the Gemini CLI.\n\nYou have to authenticate to your Hugging Face account with a write-access token so that the job can create a model repo.\n\nConfigure Hugging Face MCP Server to use your write token by sending it in either the HF_TOKEN or Authorization: Bearer HTTP Headers.\n\nFor Claude Code : claude mcp add --transport http hf-skills https://huggingface.co/mcp?bouquet=skills --header \"Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN\"\n\nLet's walk through a complete example. We'll fine-tune a small model to see the full workflow, then explore more advanced capabilities.\n\nStart with a simple and clear instruction to fine tune a specific model\n\nThe coding agent analyzes your request and prepares a training configuration. For a 0.6B model on a demo dataset, it selects t4-small—enough GPU for this model size and the cheapest option available.\n\nThe open-r1/codeforces-cots dataset is a dataset of codeforces problems and solutions. It is a good dataset for instruction tuning a model to solve hard coding problems.\n\nBefore your coding agent submits anything, you'll see the configuration:\n\nThis is your chance to adjust anything. Change the output repo name, pick different hardware, or ask Claude to modify training parameters. Once you approve, the agent submits the job.\n\nFor example, you can ask the agent to try a test run:\n\nAfter submission, you get job details:\n\nThe skill includes Trackio integration, so you can watch training loss decrease in real-time. Jobs run asynchronously so you can close your terminal and come back later. When you want an update:\n\nThen the agent fetches the logs and summarizes progress.\n\nClick here for an example Trackio dashboard with some completed runs.\n\nWhen training completes, your model is on the Hub:\n\nThat's the full loop. You described what you wanted in plain English, and the agent handled GPU selection, script generation, job submission, authentication, and persistence. The whole thing cost about thirty cents.\n\nThe skill supports three training approaches. Understanding when to use each one helps you get better results.\n\nSFT is where most projects start. You provide demonstration data—examples of inputs and desired outputs—and training adjusts the model to match those patterns.\n\nUse SFT when you have high-quality examples of the behavior you want. Customer support conversations, code generation pairs, domain-specific Q&A—anything where you can show the model what good looks like.\n\nThe agent validates the dataset, selects hardware (a10g-large with LoRA for a 7B model), and configures training with checkpoints and monitoring.\n\nFor models larger than 3B parameters, the agent automatically uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to reduce memory requirements. This makes training 7B or 13B models feasible on single GPUs while preserving most of the quality of full fine-tuning.\n\nDPO trains on preference pairs—responses where one is \"chosen\" and another is \"rejected.\" This aligns model outputs with human preferences, typically after an initial SFT stage.\n\nUse DPO when you have preference annotations from human labelers or automated comparisons. DPO optimizes directly for the preferred response without needing a separate reward model.\n\nDPO is sensitive to dataset format. It requires columns named exactly chosen and rejected, or a prompt column with the input. The agent validates this first and shows you how to map columns if your dataset uses different names.\n\nGRPO is a reinforcement learning task that is proven to be effective on verifiable tasks like solving math problems, writing code, or any task with a programmatic success criterion.\n\nThe model generates responses, receives rewards based on correctness, and learns from the outcomes. This is more complex than SFT or DPO, but the configuration is similar.\n\nThe agent selects hardware based on your model size, but understanding the tradeoffs helps you make better decisions.\n\nFor tiny models under 1B parameters, t4-small works well. These models train quickly—expect $1-2 for a full run. This is perfect for educational or experimental runs.\n\nFor small models (1-3B), step up to t4-medium or a10g-small. Training takes a few hours and costs $5-15.\n\nFor medium models (3-7B), you need a10g-large or a100-large with LoRA. Full fine-tuning doesn't fit, but LoRA makes these very trainable. Budget $15-40 for production.\n\nFor large models (7B+), this HF skills job is not suitable.\n\nWhen testing a workflow, start small:\n\nTh coding agent configures minimal training—enough to verify your pipeline works without real cost.\n\nAlways run a demo before committing to a multi-hour production job. A $0.50 demo that catches a format error saves a $30 failed run.\n\nDataset format is the most common source of training failures. The agent can validate datasets before you spend GPU time.\n\nThe agent runs a quick inspection on CPU (fractions of a penny) and reports:\n\nIf your dataset needs transformation, the agent can show you how:\n\nThe agent provides mapping code and can incorporate it directly into your training script.\n\nReal-time monitoring helps you catch problems early. The skill configures Trackio by default—after submitting a job, you can watch metrics at:\n\nThis shows training loss, learning rate, and validation metrics. A healthy run shows steadily decreasing loss.\n\nAsk the agent about status anytime:\n\nIf something goes wrong, the agent helps diagnose. Out of memory? the agent suggests reducing batch size or upgrading hardware. Dataset error? The agent identifies the mismatch. Timeout? The agent recommends longer duration or faster training settings.\n\nAfter training, you might want to run your model locally. The GGUF format works with llama.cpp and dependent tools like LM Studio, Ollama, etc.\n\nThe agent submits a conversion job that merges LoRA adapters, converts to GGUF, applies quantization, and pushes to Hub.\n\nWe've shown that coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI can handle the full lifecycle of model fine-tuning: validating data, selecting hardware, generating scripts, submitting jobs, monitoring progress, and converting outputs. This turns what used to be a specialized skill into something you can do through conversation.\n\nThe skill is open source. You can extend it, customize it for your workflows, or use it as a starting point for other training scenarios.\n\nIs this still usable without a Pro account? Will it be able to output everything up to \"Submit the job to Hugging Face Jobs\"?\n\nIs there data privacy when doing this?\n\nIs it posted privately to a personal/team hub?\n\nCould this be done locally without the push to the repo?\n\nAnother agentic way of wasting tokens\n\nis it possible to use this inside vscode's copilot extension ?\n\nSkill documentation is not available at the provided link - https://github.com/huggingface/skills/blob/main/hf-llm-trainer/SKILL.md\n\nAh, we moved a couple of bits around in the repo -- link for that is here: https://github.com/huggingface/skills/blob/main/hf-llm-trainer/skills/model-trainer/SKILL.md -- I'll update the article 👍.\n\n\"Really fascinating read! I found the explanation of Hugging Face’s “Skills Training” initiative — how it lets you use a coding‑agent (like Claude Code or other supported agents) to fine‑tune large language models, submit GPU jobs, monitor progress and push trained models to the Hub — particularly eye‑opening. The combination of high‑level instructions, hardware selection, monitoring, and automation makes the complex process of model training much more approachable, even for developers who may not be ML‑infrastructure experts.\n\nI also recently read a related guide: https://mobisoftinfotech.com/resources/blog/ai‑development/llm‑api‑pricing‑guide\n — which gives practical advice on LLM API usage, token‑based pricing, and how to plan costs when working with LLMs.\n\nPutting your article’s look into empowering accessible LLM fine‑tuning together with the cost‑management strategies from that guide gives a well‑rounded perspective: it helps developers understand not just what is possible now with modern tools, but also how to build and deploy responsibly, balancing capability and cost.\"\n\nGreat work and great article!\nRegarding the maximum models size we can train using this approach, at the beginning of the article it's mentioned \"models from 0.5B to 70B parameters\" but at the end you write that \"For large models (7B+), this HF skills job is not suitable\", which order of magnitude is correct?\nI suspect the max range is 7B, if it's the case, do you plan to support training of larger models?\nThanks!\n\nis the trained model now open source and / or available to the public?\n\n·\n Sign up or\n log in to comment",

    "description": "AI's rapid growth is driving demand for computing power and silver-rich chips like GPUs and TPUs that rely on high-performance semiconductors.",
    "fullText": "Silver blew past $60 per troy ounce for the first time on Tuesday, extending its blistering rally as traders race into a metal increasingly linked to the build-out of AI infrastructure.\n\nThe milestone caps a stunning run in 2025: silver has more than doubled this year, far outpacing gold's roughly 60% gain and leaving many traditional commodity forecasts in the dust.\n\nWhile expectations of further Federal Reserve easing have helped fuel the move, surging industrial demand and persistent supply tightness are also powering silver's fierce price gains.\n\nVeteran Wall Street strategist Ed Yardeni wrote on Tuesday that silver's explosive rally can't be understood without acknowledging its growing importance to the AI economy.\n\nAs AI data-center construction accelerates and chip demand rises, he argues the metal has effectively become \"another AI play.\"\n\nIndustry association The Silver Institute and Oxford Economics reinforced that view in a report released on Tuesday, saying AI's rapid expansion is helping drive growing demand for silver across digital economy applications.\n\n\"As digitalisation and AI adoption accelerate, so too does the demand for critical materials involved in their applications — silver a critical one among them,\" they wrote.\n\nData centers increasingly rely on next-generation chips such as GPUs and TPUs equipped with high-performance semiconductors that use silver in their internal connections and packaging, the association wrote.\n\nAnd as AI moves into autonomous vehicles, robotics, and edge devices, the broader electronics ecosystem is set to draw even more heavily on silver-rich components.\n\nBeyond AI demand, silver remains entrenched in a tight market, with inventories strained and borrowing rates still high despite some easing after October's historic squeeze.\n\n\"This is unquestionably a tight market, stocks are falling, and traders want whatever scraps of silver they can get their hands on,\" wrote Chris Weston, the head of research at Pepperstone, in a Tuesday note.\n\nHe added that retail traders are taking sharp notice of silver's surge, and for good reason.\n\n\"It is an emphatic move, with trend and momentum accounts absolutely bossing the show,\" wrote Weston.\n\nDespite its red-hot rally, the silver trade remains a risky one, Goldman Sachs cautioned in October.\n\nSilver is far more cyclical because of its heavy industrial use, making it a less reliable hedge than gold, the bank said. It also lacks the support of central-bank buying that underpins the yellow metal, Goldman added.",

    "description": "MIT researchers at the School of Architecture and Planning developed a speech-to-reality system that combines generative AI, natural language processing, and robotic assembly to fabricate physical objects from spoken prompts.",
    "fullText": "Generative AI and robotics are moving us ever closer to the day when we can ask for an object and have it created within a few minutes. In fact, MIT researchers have developed a speech-to-reality system, an AI-driven workflow that allows them to provide input to a robotic arm and “speak objects into existence,” creating things like furniture in as little as five minutes.\n\nWith the speech-to-reality system, a robotic arm mounted on a table is able to receive spoken input from a human, such as “I want a simple stool,” and then construct the objects out of modular components. To date, the researchers have used the system to create stools, shelves, chairs, a small table, and even decorative items such as a dog statue.\n\n“We’re connecting natural language processing, 3D generative AI, and robotic assembly,” says Alexander Htet Kyaw, an MIT graduate student and Morningside Academy for Design (MAD) fellow. “These are rapidly advancing areas of research that haven’t been brought together before in a way that you can actually make physical objects just from a simple speech prompt.”\n\nThe idea started when Kyaw — a graduate student in the departments of Architecture and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science — took Professor Neil Gershenfeld’s course, “How to Make Almost Anything.” In that class, he built the speech-to-reality system. He continued working on the project at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), directed by Gershenfeld, collaborating with graduate students Se Hwan Jeon of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Miana Smith of CBA.\n\nThe speech-to-reality system begins with speech recognition that processes the user’s request using a large language model, followed by 3D generative AI that creates a digital mesh representation of the object, and a voxelization algorithm that breaks down the 3D mesh into assembly components.\n\nAfter that, geometric processing modifies the AI-generated assembly to account for fabrication and physical constraints associated with the real world, such as the number of components, overhangs, and connectivity of the geometry. This is followed by creation of a feasible assembly sequence and automated path planning for the robotic arm to assemble physical objects from user prompts.\n\n“This project is an interface between humans, AI, and robots to co-create the world around us,” Kyaw says. “Imagine a scenario where you say ‘I want a chair,’ and within five minutes a physical chair materializes in front of you.”\n\nThe team has immediate plans to improve the weight-bearing capability of the furniture by changing the means of connecting the cubes from magnets to more robust connections.\n\n“We’ve also developed pipelines for converting voxel structures into feasible assembly sequences for small, distributed mobile robots, which could help translate this work to structures at any size scale,” Smith says.\n\nThe purpose of using modular components is to eliminate the waste that goes into making physical objects by disassembling and then reassembling them into something different, for instance turning a sofa into a bed when you no longer need the sofa.\n\nBecause Kyaw also has experience using gesture recognition and augmented reality to interact with robots in the fabrication process, he is currently working on incorporating both speech and gestural control into the speech-to-reality system.\n\nLeaning into his memories of the replicator in the “Star Trek” franchise and the robots in the animated film “Big Hero 6,” Kyaw explains his vision.\n\n“I want to increase access for people to make physical objects in a fast, accessible, and sustainable manner,” he says. “I’m working toward a future where the very essence of matter is truly in your control. One where reality can be generated on demand.”\n\nThe team presented their paper “Speech to Reality: On-Demand Production using Natural Language, 3D Generative AI, and Discrete Robotic Assembly” at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Symposium on Computational Fabrication (SCF ’25) held at MIT on Nov. 21.",

    "title": "Canadian accused in plot to export Nvidia's AI chips from US to China",
    "description": "Export-controlled technology worth US$30 million with fake brand labels was allegedly addressed to a facility near Toronto’s Pearson airport",
    "fullText": "A Chinese-born Canadian citizen who lives in Mississauga, Ont., was arrested in Virginia by the FBI and charged with trying to smuggle restricted high-tech Nvidia computer chips used in AI processing to China\n\nU.S. authorities seized export-controlled technology worth about $30 million that was addressed to an air freight facility in Mississauga, close to Toronto Pearson International Airport, according to allegations filed in court.\n\nNvidia labels on the components had been removed and replaced with labels for a fake company, authorities said.\n\nThe arrest of Benlin Yuan, of Mississauga, immediately west of Toronto, and the large shipment destined for Toronto are part of Operation Gatekeeper, described by U.S. authorities as targeting “a sophisticated illicit procurement conspiracy and smuggling network that orchestrates buying and exporting controlled high-tech computer chips to China.”\n\nYuan is described in U.S. prosecution documents as president of an information technology company based in Virginia that provides data centre services and IT support and consulting in Canada and the United States. The documents say it is a subsidiary of a Chinese company based in Beijing.\n\nHe was arrested in Sterling, Virginia, on Nov. 28 and charged with conspiring to violate export control acts.\n\nThe network is accused of purchasing at least US$50 million worth of GPUs from a large U.S. technology company.\n\nThe computer products Yuan is alleged to be involved in exporting are Nvidia A100, H100, and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units, known as GPUs, and HGX baseboards. The equipment is used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and in high-performance computing. The chips can handle huge amounts of data that is needed in AI applications, an exploding field that is revolutionizing technology.\n\nThe GPUs can perform calculations at higher speeds than most previous computers.\n\nSince about November 2023, a Chinese company has worked to import these chips from the United States, prosecutors allege. The entire plot is alleged to have involved US$160 million in tech goods.\n\nYuan is accused of joining the conspiracy this spring.\n\nIn a criminal complaint sworn by a special agent in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Yuan helped buy the technology using straw purchasers and intermediaries, meaning in the name of a person or company that is not the real end buyer.\n\nThe buyers allegedly declared the goods were for use by customers within the United States or in countries that do not require an export licence, including Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nAt various U.S. warehouses, Nvidia labels were allegedly removed from the computer circuits and relabeled with a fake manufacturing brand of SANDKYAN, according to the criminal complaint against Yuan.\n\nWhen preparing the items for export, the shipping paperwork misclassified the products as harmless and unrestricted pieces of tech: “adapters,” “adapter modules,” and “computer controllers,” authorities claim.\n\nThey were then shipped, directly or indirectly, to China.\n\nInvestigators received a tip about pallets of suspicious GPUs at a New Jersey warehouse that were addressed to companies in China.\n\nAn undercover agent was sent inside, where he spent an hour.\n\nThe agent allegedly saw two engineers who appeared to be of Chinese origin unboxing Nvidia components. One of the engineers spoke to the undercover agent in Mandarin, documents say. The engineers said they had to cover up all of the Nvidia branding on the equipment for “export purposes,” court filings allege.\n\nThe agent watched Nvidia labels being pulled off and new ones for the fake firm put in their place. The next day the agent returned and found the boxes had been resealed. The products were now labeled as having been “Made in Taiwan.”\n\nNot only were those packages addressed for shipping to Toronto, but warehouse employees told agents they recently had several similar tech exports to Canada.\n\nThe packages were removed and secured in a government warehouse. That sparked a flow of complaint calls and demand letters about the missing GPUs. The people expecting the goods believed the undercover officer had stolen the products and started negotiating to have them returned, authorities allege.\n\nThey offered $1 million to get their packages back, but insisted the equipment be inspected before payment was made.\n\nYuan is accused of organizing the “inspection.”\n\nHe is accused of recruiting and arranging the group of inspectors and of being one of the six who arrived to examine the packages, about two weeks after the seizure, court filings allege.\n\nThe inspection arrangements were allegedly planned in a group chat using an encrypted communication app and confirmed later over a video conferencing app.\n\nYuan was told by a high-level representative of the buyer in China to make sure no one said the items were destined for China, according to the criminal complaint. He is accused of helping them develop an elaborate “compliance backstory” to justify the products based on false information.\n\nThey also allegedly discussed how to make the million-dollar payment and Yuan was told to send copies of the driver’s licences of everyone on the inspection team. Three trucks were arranged for the pick up.\n\nHe is also accused of handling the storage of a different shipment of Nvidia products destined for China. A cooperating witness for U.S. prosecutors alleged that Yuan told him not to put fake labels on this one as he thought they looked suspicious; he would rather the Nvidia labels just be removed.\n\nAlexander Blanchard, a Virginia-based lawyer for Yuan, declined to comment about Yuan or the case when asked by National Post.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Nicholas Ganjei, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas.\n\n“These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future.”\n\nU.S. regulation restricts the export of items that could make a significant contribution to the military potential of other nations or could be detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States.\n\nAdvanced computing integrated circuits, including certain Nvidia-manufactured GPUs were added to the export restriction list in 2022. Some of the latest Nvidia chips have been classed by the U.S. as “critical technologies” that China could use to “modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies,” according to export regulations.\n\nThe chips require a special licence to export to China.\n\nOn Monday, the same day Operation Gatekeeper was announced, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors to be exported to China with a 25 per cent fee.\n\nAlan Hao Hsu, also known as Haochun Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities in October as part of Operation Gatekeeper.\n\nNewly unsealed court documents say Hsu received more than US$50 million in wire transfers from China to help fund the scheme. He is scheduled for sentencing in February.\n\nFanyue Gong, also known as Tom Gong, 43, a citizen of China who lives in Brooklyn, New York, was also charged in the probe. He is described as the owner of a New York technology company. He was arrested in New York on Dec. 3, and charged with conspiring to smuggle goods out of the United States.\n\nFive unnamed co-conspirators are linked to IT companies based in Hong Kong or Shenzhen, a city on the Pearl River that acts as a bridge between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\n• Email: ahumphreys@postmedia.com | X: AD_Humphreys\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

The framework evaluates six key dimensions—aesthetic quality, background consistency, dynamic degree, imaging quality, motion smoothness, and subject consistency—producing both aggregate scores and detailed diagnostic insights.\n\nAs AI-generated video rapidly transforms advertising, entertainment, and social media, the real challenge for businesses is identifying which models deliver reliable, high-quality results at scale.\n\nVideo generation is moving into commercial applications, from content creation to personalized media. With access to a large-scale generated video dataset, GMI Cloud provides a unique platform to benchmark models under realistic, production-level conditions.\n\nEvaluating video generation remains challenging:\n\nOur goal is to build the first commercial-grade, multi-dimensional evaluation pipeline for AI video generation. This framework delivers robust, multi-aspect metrics and actionable insights, enabling model selection and customer-specific optimization.\n\nAll evaluations were conducted using GMI Cloud’s elastic GPU clusters and inference pipelines—the same infrastructure available to customers for real-time video AI deployment. This ensures that benchmark results directly reflect the performance businesses can achieve in production.\n\nThis benchmark provides tangible benefits across the AI video ecosystem:\n\nGMI Cloud provides next-generation AI infrastructure for builders, offering scalable GPU clusters, inference engines, and model evaluation pipelines. Our platform enables anyone to build, evaluate, and deploy AI at scale, removing technical barriers and accelerating commercial adoption.\n\nWe collected a large-scale dataset of generated videos along with their corresponding prompts from GMI Cloud. The dataset is representative of real-world generation scenarios, providing a solid foundation for evaluating model performance under practical conditions.\n\nWe annotated video samples using two AI-assisted tools: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and DeepSeek.\n\nTogether, these tools allow us to efficiently annotate large datasets while maintaining diverse coverage and reliable dimension-level evaluations, without needing to manually watch and score thousands of videos.\n\nTakeaway: This hybrid approach combines the strengths of reference-based retrieval (RAG) and direct video analysis (DeepSeek), giving us a scalable, automated way to annotate and evaluate generated video content.\n\nOur evaluation builds on VBench/F-Bench/VM-Bench, with extensions designed for commercial-scale video generation:\n\nWe assess video quality along six key dimensions:\n\nNote: using vllm(tarsier-7b) is also applicable, new benchmarks in ICCV 2025 coming soon.\n\nScoring and Aggregation Methodology\n\nWe evaluated 271 videos generated by five major model families on GMI Cloud infrastructure, scoring them across six key dimensions: background consistency, aesthetic quality, subject consistency, dynamic degree, imaging quality, and motion smoothness. Each dimension was normalized between 0–1 and weighted (dynamic degree=0.1, others=1.0) to produce an overall ranking that informs practical decision-making.\n\nTakeaway: Seedance-1-0-pro-250528 delivers peak performance for high-motion and technically demanding videos, while Veo3 offers a balanced, reliable choice for a broad range of applications.\n\nBreaking down performance by dimension highlights which models excel for specific business needs:\n\nTakeaway: Multi-dimensional evaluation reveals complementary strengths, guiding clients to choose models based on specific priorities—motion, stability, or overall polish.\n\nConsistent performance across diverse prompts is critical for production reliability and scalability:\n\nA correlation heatmap was generated across the six evaluation dimensions to examine interdependencies between metrics. Preliminary observations include:\n\nTakeaway: Addressing these limitations will enhance evaluation fidelity, alignment with human perception, and practical deployment, positioning this benchmark as a foundation for next-generation AI video tools.\n\nOur evaluation of 271 videos across five major model families reveals several practical insights for model selection:\n\nOverall Performance vs. Dimension-Specific Strengths\n\nPerformance Consistency Matters\n\nPerformance Patterns Across Dimensions\n\nModel Recommendations by Use Case\n\nTakeaway: Selecting the right model depends on specific business needs, and multi-dimensional evaluation enables task-driven, customer-specific recommendations.\n\nFuture iterations will incorporate human perceptual scoring, prompt-style diversity tests, and support for multiple new benchmarks presented at ICCV 2025, establishing a foundation for the world’s first end-to-end commercial Video AI Benchmark. This roadmap enables continuous improvements in model design, evaluation methodology, and business-tailored AI video solutions, while keeping GMI Cloud at the forefront of commercial video AI evaluation and deployment.",

    "title": "Instagram May Be Quietly Adding AI-Generated Headlines to Your Posts",
    "description": "No one asked for this.",
    "fullText": "Few of us are under the illusion that we own the content that we post on Instagram, but we do get a say in how that content is presented—w can choose which photos and videos we share, what captions appear (or don't appear) on each post, as well as whether or not we include where the image was taken or shared from. We might not control the platform, but we do control the content of our posts—unless those posts are found on search engines like Google.\n\nAs reported by 404 Media, it appears that Instagram is experimenting with AI-generated SEO titles for users' posts—without those users' input or permission. Take this post for example: Author Jeff VanderMeer uploaded a short video of rabbits eating a banana to his Instagram. The video was posted as-is: There was no caption, location tag, or any other public-facing information. It's just a couple of rabbits having a bite.\n\nA post shared by Jeff VanderMeer (@jeff_vandermeer123)\n\nInstagram, however, took it upon itself to add a headline to the post—at least when you stumble upon it on via Google. Rather than display a link featuring Jeff's Instagram handle and some metadata about the video, the Google entry comes back with the following headline: \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas, A Nutritious Snack for...\" (the rest of the headline cuts off here).\n\nVanderMeer was less than pleased with the discovery. He posted a screenshot of the headline to Bluesky, writing, \"now [Instagram] appears to generate titles [and] headlines via AI for stuff I post...to create [clickbait] for [Google] wtf do not like.\"\n\nThis was not the only AI-generated headline VanderMeer was roped into. This post from the Groton Public Library in Massachusetts, which advertises VanderMeer's novel Annihilation as the library's December book group pick, was also given the \"clickbait\" treatment on Google. Just as with VanderMeer's post, the Groton Public Library didn't include any text in its Instagram post—just an image showing off the book. But if you see the post within a Google search, you'll see the following partial headline: \"Join Jeff VanderMeer on a Thrilling Beachside Adventure with Mesta...\"\n\n404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg says that they've confirmed that Instagram is also generating headlines for other users on the platform, all without permission or knowledge. Meta did not return 404 Media's request for comment. (I have also reached out for comment.) Google, on the other hand, did return 404 Media's messages, and confirmed the headlines are not coming from its AI generators—though it has been using deceptive AI-generated headlines of its own on Google Discover. In fact, the company says its search engine is simply pulling the text from Instagram itself. Maiberg found that these headlines do appear under title tags for Instagram posts when using Google's Rich Result Test tool. When digging through the code, Maiberg also discovered AI-generated descriptions for each post, which could be what Instagram is ultimately using to generate the headlines.\n\nI'll update this post if I hear back from Instagram regarding these AI-generated headlines. Until then, I can only speculate on their intended purpose (assuming Instagram is the one generating these headlines in the first place). And the likeliest reason is to boost engagement: Instagram probably wants to increase the visibility of its users' posts in search, which means giving Google more information to work with. If the user doesn't provide their own details about the image, Instagram's AI appears to be filling in the blanks, first generating a description, and from there, sticking a \"clicky\" headline onto it.\n\nThe results aren't actually all that appealing, though. Just because Meta AI may be capable of generating headlines, doesn't mean it is good at it, or even that it should—especially when users never consented to this practice in the first place. It'd be one thing if Instagram had an option before you post—something like \"Generate a headline for me using Meta AI that will appear in search engines for my post.\" Most of us would opt out of that, but it'd at least be a choice. However, it appears that Instagram decided that users like VanderMeer weren't capable of writing a headline as clever as \"Meet the Bunny Who Loves Eating Bananas.\"\n\nThe worst part is, the AI doesn't even accurately describe the posts. That Groton Public Library post was only about a book club meeting featuring VanderMeer's novel, but the headline says \"Join Jeff VanderMeer,\" as if he'd be making an appearance. Not only did Instagram add a headline without VanderMeer's consent, it spread misinformation about his whereabouts. And for what? Some extra engagement on Google?\n\nIf Instagram wants its posts to appear as headlines on search engines, it should include the actual posters in the conversation. As VanderMeer told 404 Media: \"If I post content, I want to be the one contextualizing it, not some third party.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's top AI advisor is seeking to clear up any confusion about the administration's AI preemption plans.\n\nIn a lengthy post on X on Monday, White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks said that a forthcoming executive order to restrict states' ability to regulate AI is \"an attempt to settle a question of jurisdiction.\"\n\nSacks, a venture capitalist and a co-host of the \"All In\" podcast, sought to address various concerns about AI preemption, which has proved to be a controversial topic even within Trump's coalition.\n\nHe called those concerns the four Cs — child safety, communities, creators, and censorship.\n\nRegarding communities, Sacks said that AI preemption has little to do with the construction of data centers, which have become a political flashpoint in states around the country due to those centers' heavy water and energy demands.\n\n\"AI preemption would not apply to local infrastructure. That's a separate issue,\" Sacks wrote. \"In short, preemption would not force communities to host data centers they don't want.\"\n\nHe also said that state laws requiring platforms to protect against online predators and child sexual abuse material would remain in effect, because AI preemption wouldn't apply to \"generally applicable state laws.\"\n\nONE RULEBOOK FOR AI\n\nI wanted to share a few thoughts on AI preemption and address some of the concerns.\n\nFirst, this is not an “AI amnesty” or “AI moratorium.” It is an attempt to settle a question of jurisdiction.\n\nWhen an AI model is developed in state A, trained in state B,… pic.twitter.com/tO3yyc0A8M\n\nThe administration appears to be moving forward with an effort to curtail state power to regulate AI, arguing that forcing companies to comply with competing regulations across 50 states will hamper the US's competitiveness in the AI race with China.\n\nWhile it's unclear exactly what's in the forthcoming executive order, a draft seen by Business Insider last month would direct the Department of Justice to sue states over \"onerous\" AI laws.\n\nIt comes after multiple attempts to enact AI preemption via Congress, most notably in the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" That provision was ultimately struck from the bill before passage due to opposition from several Republicans.\n\nSacks wrote on X that the administration will \"continue to work with Congress to define a federal framework that can be enacted through legislation.\" But that hasn't stopped the pushback from other Republicans.\n\n\"Nice framework,\" replied Republican Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio. \"This should be a law, not an executive order.\"",

    "description": "The chief strategist at Alpine Macro says that fears around big capex spending, GPU depreciation, and competitive threats from abroad are overdone.",
    "fullText": "Bloated valuations, rapidly depreciating chips, and threats from abroad round out the bear case for AI in the waning days of 2025, but the top threats may be overblown for the time being.\n\nThat's according to investment research firm Alpine Macro, which argues that investors can put aside worst fears about how the AI craze could be derailed.\n\nThe firm said on Monday that GPU depreciation, capex spending, and leadership changes won't spoil the party just yet, and chief quantitative strategist Henry Wu, said the market should climb the lastest AI wall of worry.\n\n\"These risks are, so far, contained and should not derail the AI story,\" Wu said. \"We continue to see outperformance from the AI tech stack's bottleneck layers, which are irreplaceable supply-chain components with strong technology moats and high market concentration.\"\n\nThe three questions examined by the researchers are as follows:\n\nAccording to Wu and his team, the answer to all three is \"no.\" The strategist said that AI capex has increased significantly over the past year. While this may create some fears of excessive spending, he maintained that it likely doesn't mean the market is nearing a peak.\n\n\"Major hyperscalers like Google and Nvidia compete to set industry standards and steer the direction of AI progress,\" Wu added. \"Investing in clients and suppliers ensures closer integration of technology roadmaps with their ecosystems.\"\n\nWu also noted that while concern of AI chip depreciation remains widespread, he sees it as similarly overblown. He highlighted growing demand both in the US and abroad, specifically from China's booming AI market.\n\nHe noted that older AI chips don't decline in utility simply because newer ones are rolled out, but prices fall as the supply increases. In his view, the increasing AI chip supply means faster-than-expected productivity gains, which investors should regard as a positive.\n\n\"A faster product cycle also implies accelerated productivity gains. New chips appear only with major improvements,\" he said.\n\nWu's final question centers on threats from abroad, pointing specifically to China's DeekSeek AI model that rattled US markets in January. Ever since, investors have been concerned about a repeat of a cheaper AI model scrambling the thesis for US investors, but Wu says this, too, should be set aside for now.\n\n\"We view these unexpected technological leaps as a net positive for AI progress, and the ensuing shakeouts are buying opportunities,\" he said. \"These advances will be imitated quickly by competitors, boosting productivity for the whole ecosystem.\"\n\nWu concluded that his team expects to see the AI trade to overcome these concerns in the coming year. They recommend that investors prioritize pick-and-shovel plays for AI exposure in 2026, citing areas such as lithography and advanced logic fabrication.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says his most famous product has helped him manage life as an actual parent.\n\n\"I cannot imagine having gone through, figuring out how to raise a newborn without ChatGPT,\" Altman told Jimmy Fallon during an interview on NBC's flagship late-night talk show. \"Clearly, people did it for a long time — no problem.\"\n\nAltman said he feels \"kind of bad\" asking a technology that boasts such wide-knowledge questions like, \"Why does my kid stop dropping pizza on the floor and laughing?\"\n\nAnother example, Altman said, was a couple of months ago when he was at a party talking to someone who was also raising a newborn. Altman recalled that the parents said their six-month-old was \"crawling everywhere.\" Altman said he grew concerned that his son was not at the same stage.\n\n\"I ran to the bathroom, and I was like, do I need to take my kid to the doctor tomorrow morning?\" Altman said, describing what he typed into ChatGPT: \"Is this okay?\"\n\nAltman said OpenAI's chatbot responded \"with a great answer, which was of course,\" his son's development was \"normal.\"\n\n\"It is personalized, like ChatGPT gets to know you, and by the way, you're the CEO of OpenAI, you probably are around all these high-achieving people, maybe you don't want to project that onto your kid, and you should just relax, and he'll be fine, whatever,\" Altman told Fallon of the answer.\n\nFallon didn't touch on OpenAI's recent struggles.
