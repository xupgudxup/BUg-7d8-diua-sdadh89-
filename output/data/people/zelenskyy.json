    "fullText": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of targeted terror against the people of his country following heavy airstrikes during the past week.\n\nZelensky posted on social media on Sunday that within the past week the Russian military had used against Ukraine around 1,100 drones, 890 guided bombs and 50 rockets and cruise missiles, including the medium-range ballistic missile Oreshnik.\n\nThe weapons were fired \"at targets that have no military significance: energy facilities and residential buildings,\" Zelensky said.\n\nMoscow had deliberately waited for the frosty weather to make life as hard as possible for ordinary Ukrainians, Zelensky argued. \"This is deliberate, cynical Russian terror against the people,\" he wrote.\n\nHe illustrated his words with video clips of drone damage to civilian objects in Kiev and the surrounding area, as well as in the regions of Kharkiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Odessa, Zaporizhzhya and Chernihiv. Images from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where the Oreshnik missile struck, were not shown.\n\nThe Kremlin portrays the ongoing bombardment of Ukraine as strikes against exclusively military targets, even though the destruction of power plants affects the civilian population.\n\nMoscow has recently raised its own accusations of terror against Kiev, claiming that Ukraine allegedly launched a drone attack on one of the residences of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nZelensky vehemently denied this and the US foreign intelligence service, the CIA, concluded that Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences, according to US media reports.\n\nPutin ordered the war against Ukraine nearly four years ago.",

    "fullText": "FILE – President Donald Trump, right, shakes the hand of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin during a joint press conference at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Aug. 15, 2025. \n\nOn Tuesday, Russian broadcaster and propagandist Vladimir Solovyov said on his show that Russian President Vladimir Putin “achieved a knockout victory” prior to the latest meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian leadership, claiming that a phone call that took place between President Donald Trump and Putin “completely destroyed [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky’s plans.”\n\nTrump met with Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, where he said they were “very close” to a peace deal in the four-year Russia-Ukraine war, adding that there are still “1-2 thorny issues,” one of which is land that remains ”up for grabs.”\n\nZelensky agreed, saying the two leaders agreed on 90% of his 20-point peace plan.\n\nOn Tuesday night’s episode of Evening with Vladimir Solovyov, the Kremlin promoter said, “We have achieved a knockout victory. We prepared on a grandmaster’s level on all the main points, and it worked.”\n\n“Everything was extremely precise, and of course, Zelensky started to melt,” Solovyov added. “He melted down… The mood just wasn’t there.”\n\nAs Trump mentioned on Sunday, he and Putin were on the phone for more than two hours shortly before Zelensky arrived at Mar-a-Lago. He told reporters, “Russia wants it ended, everybody wants it ended,” and that the Russian president “wants to see” a peace deal finalized soon.\n\nTrump also added that he planned to call Putin again after Zelensky’s departure.\n\nAccording to Solovyov’s Tuesday commentary, the phone call between Moscow and Palm Beach “completely destroyed Zelensky’s plans.” He went as far as to insinuate that there was no point in the Ukrainian president even getting off the plane.\n\nJust last Saturday, in a move that directly counters Putin’s alleged willingness to move towards peace, Russia hammered Ukraine’s capital city with missiles and attack drones, injuring at least 11 people and leaving almost a third of Kyiv without heat.\n\nThe post ‘Knockout Victory’: Russian Broadcaster Says Trump-Putin Call ‘Completely Destroyed Zelensky’s Plans’ Before Meeting first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump struggled to offer much sympathy for the families of about 100 Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAn estimated several thousand Americans have volunteered to fight for Ukraine since Russian dictator Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, with at least 92 Americans killed as of September, The New York Times reported.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a peace deal to end the war, Trump was asked about his message to the families of the fallen Americans.\n\n“The message is so obvious,” he replied. “What a shame. They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbor’s land by force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace settlement.\n\nNegotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",
