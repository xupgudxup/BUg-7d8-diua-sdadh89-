    "fullText": "MOSCOW (AP) — The young journalist in a red bow tie stood during President Vladimir Putin's annual news conference Friday and displayed a sign saying he wanted to get married. But his main question wasn't directed at Putin — it was to his girlfriend, Olga, proposing marriage.\n\nPutin complimented Kirill Bazhanov of Yekaterinburg’s Channel 4 on his snazzy tie, saying, \"You’re ready to go to the registry office!” Bazhanov told Putin “we’d be very glad to see you at the wedding.”\n\nThe Russian leader’s year-end media session had serious questions, of course, about late pension payments, construction projects gone wrong, and the fighting in Ukraine, where Putin sent troops nearly four years ago.\n\nBut every year — amid the weighty questions from the domestic and international media — there are also odd and lighter moments, like this year when people asked Putin what his license plate number was and whether love at first sight existed.\n\nIt’s all part of the spectacle of the tightly orchestrated event — an opportunity for Putin, who has ruled Russia for 25 years, to expound on a wide array of subjects as well as to burnish his image as a fatherly figure to address the concerns of ordinary Russians who submit questions in advance.\n\nBazhanov did actually have a question for Putin — about greater support for young families. Later in the 4 1/2-hour news conference, one of the anchors passed along the news that Bazhanov's girlfriend had said yes. Putin promptly quipped about collecting money for the wedding.\n\nFor those inside Moscow’s Gostinny Dvor amphitheater, the most important task was to get Putin's attention. Most brought signs and some wore national dress. One reporter brought a clutch of Labubu dolls personalized to look like Russian officials and one in the form of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nOne reporter asked whether a comet approaching Earth could be a UFO, and reassured Putin that the city of Tyumen would be ready to welcome any extraterrestrial guests.\n\nPutin seemed unfazed throughout, although Tajik journalist Shamsudin Boboyev caused a brief commotion when he tried to give Putin a book. Two security officials quickly stopped him from going onstage, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested Boboyev should simply describe the gift, which would be given to him later.\n\nToward the end of the session, a journalist who noted that Putin had said earlier he believed in love at first sight asked him if he was in love. The Russian leader, whose private life remains closely guarded, answered simply, “Yes.”\n\nDavies reported from Manchester, England.",

    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for his annual televised Q&A session, and a new poll shows Russians remain focused on two issues: the war and the economy.\n\nAccording to a poll of 1,608 Russians conducted by the independent Levada Center, the top two concerns Russians want to raise with Putin are when the war will end and how they're supposed to cope with a deteriorating economy.\n\nAbout a fifth of respondents said they would ask Putin when the war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a \"special military operation,\" would end.\n\nRight behind the war is the economy, as another 16% say their top question is about living standards — salaries, pensions, and benefits.\n\nThese two concerns have topped Levada's polls ahead of Putin's annual Q&A for three years.\n\nBeyond the top concerns, Levada found that 8% of respondents want to ask Putin about price growth and tax hikes, 6% about utilities and social services, and 5% about the healthcare system.\n\nThe anxiety comes as Russia's inflation remains high, and the country's massive defense spending jostles with social spending.\n\nPutin's televised \"Direct Line\" Q&A session, scheduled for Friday, comes nearly four years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering sweeping Western sanctions.\n\nSince the invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country onto a wartime economic footing.\n\nHeavy defense spending and state-directed investment have helped sustain headline economic growth, even as sanctions and export restrictions have reshaped trade flows.\n\nBut strains are showing: Energy export revenues have dropped in a softer oil-price environment, while high inflation continues to sap consumer demand.\n\nPrevious hourslong \"Direct Line\" broadcasts offer a preview of how Putin may handle the questions the Kremlin allows.\n\nLast year, Putin acknowledged that Russia's economy was overheating amid high inflation and warned citizens to brace for continued pressure.\n\nHowever, he deflected blame, suggesting that both the central bank and the Russian federal government — formally headed by the prime minister — could have acted more decisively to prevent the surge in prices and credit growth.\n\nPutin is also expected to hold an end-of-year news conference on Friday, where the spotlight will be on any signals he offers about the direction of the war.",
