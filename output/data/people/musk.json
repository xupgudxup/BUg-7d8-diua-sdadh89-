    "fullText": "Katie Miller lavished Elon Musk with praise during a fawning interview with the billionaire businessman in which she described how “inspirational” it was to work for him.\n\nThe podcast host, who previously worked at the White House with her husband, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, quit the administration in May to go into the private sector and work directly for Musk.\n\nOn the latest episode of The Katie Miller Podcast, the unusually animated host gushed over her previous boss months after unconfirmed rumors of a relationship between the pair outside the workplace.\n\n“Everyone always thinks you’re a very difficult person to work for,” Miller said, before adding, “I think you’re very kind,” prompting Musk to thank her for the compliment.\n\n“People think, which you are, like, a very demanding boss,” Miller continued. “I’ve never heard you yell at any employee,” she said.\n\n“Yeah, I don’t yell,” Musk replied.\n\nMiller worked as a spokesperson for Musk as he oversaw the so-called Department of Government Efficiency between January and May this year, before leaving with him to work for the billionaire personally, prior to launching her podcast.\n\nThe podcast love-in continued with Miller telling Musk that “every employee who works at every single one of your companies is incredibly mission-driven,” noting that fact was “unlike any other workplace I’ve seen.”\n\nShe went on to single out Musk’s Starbase compound in South Texas, which was created around SpaceX’s rocket development and launch site.\n\n“Like Starbase is the most inspirational place you’ll ever go to, right?” Miller said, before claiming that all his employees are “fiercely loyal.”\n\nShe added, “You are a very good employer to work for and I think people assume you are not.”\n\n“Well, why would they think anyone would work at the companies?” Musk pondered out loud.\n\n“Talented people can go work anywhere they want... if they’re mistreated in some way, they would leave and go work somewhere else.”\n\nMiller’s podcast has struggled to find an audience after three months. Her first interview, with Vice President JD Vance, remains the most popular on YouTube with 85,000 views. Her lowest-viewed episode has been viewed a dismal 2,700 times.\n\nThe Musk interview has already scored more views in six hours than last week’s episode with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his third wife, Jen, has clocked up in an entire week.\n\nWhen news of Miller’s resignation from her husband’s place of work first emerged, the Democrats taunted Trump’s deputy chief of staff with an image of an empty chair in a hotel room, appearing to suggest there was trouble in the marriage.\n\n.@StephenM: https://t.co/IjFdietRgU pic.twitter.com/ndcIsPHWFd\n\n— Democrats (@TheDemocrats) May 30, 2025\n\nDuring the podcast, the pair avoided discussion of a mishap in June on Musk’s social media platform, X, where a fake screenshot of Musk bragging that he “took” Miller’s wife went viral online, forcing the billionaire to correct his own AI assistant, Grok.\n\nThe AI assistant claimed, “The post from Elon Musk likely existed and was deleted,” noting that the “metrics and context align with Musk’s behavior.”\n\n“The evidence leans toward the post being real but removed, consistent with Musk’s pattern of deleting controversial posts.”\n\nMusk then intervened, replying “No, it’s fake ffs… I never posted this.” Miller never directly commented on the whispers.",

    "description": "Elon Musk said he wouldn't participate in the DOGE office again, adding that it was only \"somewhat\" successful in saving taxpayer money.",
    "fullText": "If he could do it all over again, Elon Musk says he wouldn't have participated in DOGE.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, a new office created at the beginning of President Donald Trump's second term, was only \"somewhat successful\" at saving taxpayer money, and Musk believes he could have better spent his time focused on his various business ventures.\n\n\"I guess I couldn't believe I was there for the most part. It's like — it all seemed extremely surreal at the time,\" Musk told Miller, who is married to Stephen Miller, who currently serves as White House deputy chief of staff.\n\nThe name DOGE itself, Musk said, was made up \"based on internet suggestions,\" and, while he still agrees that it's a worthwhile cause to try to slow government spending, he doesn't see his efforts as particularly effective during the months he worked alongside the Trump administration.\n\n\"We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful,\" Musk said. \"I mean, we stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was just entirely wasteful. For example, there was probably $100, maybe $200 billion worth of zombie payments per year, which simply by enforcing that there be a payment code and an explanation for the payment, the payment would not go out.\"\n\nWhile Musk had initially projected DOGE would save an estimated $2 trillion, he later revised his estimate to project nearly $150 billion in spending cuts for the 2026 fiscal year before he stepped back from the office in April, Business Insider has previously reported.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how much the office ultimately saved before it quietly disbanded in July, an August analysis by Politico verified $1.4 billion in confirmed contract cancellations and a decrease in federal spending.\n\nWhen asked directly by Miller whether he'd participate in the DOGE office if he could repeat history, Musk thought for just a moment before sighing and saying he would not.\n\n\"No, I don't think so. Would I do it? I think I probably — I don't know,\" Musk said. \"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically built, you know, worked on my companies, essentially, and the cars — they wouldn't have been burning the cars.\"\n\nMusk faced intense public backlash and was the subject of numerous protests, including vandalism against Tesla, as a result of his work with the Trump administration. Musk described the backlash as \"a very strong reaction\" to his attempt to stop \"political corruption.\"\n\nThe fallout was also concerning to Tesla investors, some of whom worried Musk was spending too much time at the White House and not enough on the electric-vehicle maker.\n\n\"We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin, and it's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else,\" Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider in March.\n\nTesla's stock plummeted in the first half of the year but began to rally after Musk announced he'd be leaving DOGE and officially stepped away in May. As of market close Tuesday, Tesla's stock was up over 17% this year.\n\nMusk's relationship with Trump soured in June after Musk criticized the president's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" The pair publicly feuded for months, but Business Insider reported in November that the tension between the two had eased recently, and Musk was invited to Trump's White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
