    "fullText": "In 10 years, there might not be many jobs, but there sure will be a lot of spin bikes. (At least, if you believe this ad.)\n\nThe Belgian AI startup AiCandy released a new advertisement for their company, mocking AI's skyrocketing demand for energy. It imagines a 2036 in which humans now power AI through group workouts — and features AI-aged versions of Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe video is a spoof ad for a company called \"Energym,\" which uses human cycling and rowing classes to generate the energy needed for AI.\n\n\"What if we could use the energy of humans to power the machines that took away their jobs,\" AI Musk said.\n\nA post shared by AiCandy (@aicandy.be)\n\nIt's a doomsday scenario, of course. (It's not clear that any AI job apocalypse is coming soon.) But it's one that resonated: The Instagram Reel has over 4 million views, while accounts continue to repost it on X, including one with nearly 2 million views.\n\n\"Doesn't feel like a parody of anything really,\" Sen. Chris Murphy wrote.\n\nAiCandy's Hans Buyse isn't such a fan of those reposts: \"They're making profit off of it,\" he said.\n\nBuyse and his cofounder, Jan De Loore, told Business Insider that they were thrilled with the reach of their videos. They expected some virality, but not the millions of views it would bring to their account.\n\nThe duo founded their AI video company in 2025. Buyse spent two decades working in commercials. De Loore is a motion designer and paints on the side. He has started using AI to model his paintings.\n\nInitially, clients gave them lots of pushback. Their feedback was mainly that \"it's polluting, it's consuming so much energy,\" De Loore said. Buyse then came up with the idea of making a video to showcase clean, human-made energy.\n\nThe idea was back-burnered until a couple of weeks ago, when De Loore thought to bring it back and frame it around aged US tech moguls.\n\n\"It's a combination also with the fitness hype, and young men that don't know what to do anymore with their lives,\" Buyse said. \"It's all coming together in one 40-second video.\"\n\nThe founders said they now have an inbox filled with collaboration requests. The Dor Brothers, a popular AI video production company, offered them a job, Buyse said.\n\nStill, they're holding out for one email in particular.\n\n\"We're just awaiting Elon,\" De Loore said.",

    "fullText": "Hillary Clinton on Thursday said she has no knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and urged lawmakers to focus their energies on other people associated with the convicted sex offender, including Elon Musk.\n\nIn a combative four-page opening statement, the former secretary of state blasted the House Oversight Committee for calling her to testify as part of their probe into Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The well-connected financier died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial.\n\nClinton on Thursday called the committee's probe \"partisan political theatre,\" saying she doesn't recall ever having met Epstein.\n\n\"I do not recall ever encountering Mr. Epstein. I never flew on his plane or visited his island, homes, or offices,\" she said.\n\nHere is my opening statement to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee today. pic.twitter.com/NZSF2epcI5\n\nShe proceeded to rip into the committee's members, accusing them of not doing more to end human trafficking or seek justice for Epstein's victims.\n\n\"A committee endeavoring to stop human trafficking would seek to understand what specific steps are needed to fix a system that allowed Epstein to get away with his crimes in 2008,\" she said.\n\n\"It would ensure that the lawful reductions of those files protected the victims and survivors, not powerful men in political allies,\" she added.\n\n\"It would subpoena anyone who asked on which night there would be the 'wildest party' on Epstein Island,\" she said in a not-so-veiled reference to Musk.\n\nEmails released by the Department of Justice on January 30 showed Musk asking that very question while discussing plans to visit Epstein's Caribbean island in 2012.\n\n\"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\" Musk asked in the November 2012 email chain.\n\nThe question was in response to an email from Epstein offering to send a helicopter to whisk the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to his private island in the Caribbean.\n\n\"how many people will you be for the heli to island,\" Epstein asked Musk in an email exchange. Musk said he'd need just two seats — for himself and his then-partner, Tallulah Riley.\n\nThe DOJ's files have not revealed any communications suggesting that Musk knew about Epstein's crimes. Musk has denied visiting the island. A representative for the Tesla CEO didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nClinton's husband, former President of the United States Bill Clinton, has been prominently featured in the DOJ's Epstein files, including numerous photos of the two men together.\n\nBill Clinton is expected to testify before the committee in Chappaqua, NY, where the Clintons live, on Friday. He has previously said he travelled on Epstein's plane four times, in 2002 and 2003, while on trips for the Clinton Foundation.\n\nHillary Clinton has previously acknowledged a relationship with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for participating in Epstein's trafficking of young women.\n\nOn Thursday, she said she had no knowledge of Maxwell's crimes.\n\n\"The committee justified its subpoena to me, based on its assumptions that I have information regarding the investigations into the criminal activities of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\" she said. \"Let me be as clear as I can. I do not.\"",

    "description": "When SpaceX decided to shut down access to Starlink satellite-internet terminals earlier this month, it caused immediate chaos among Russian forces.",
    "fullText": "This story originally ran in Welt and appears on Business Insider through the Axel Springer Global Reporters Network.\n\n\"All we've got left now,\" the Russian soldier said, \"are radios, cables and pigeons.\"\n\nA decision earlier this month by SpaceX to shut down access to Starlink satellite-internet terminals caused immediate chaos among Russian forces who had become increasingly reliant upon the Elon Musk-owned company's technology to sustain their occupation of Ukraine, according to radio transmissions intercepted by a Ukrainian reconnaissance unit and shared with the Axel Springer Global Reporters Network, to which POLITICO and Business Insider belong.\n\nThe communications breakdown significantly constrained Russian military capabilities, creating new opportunities for Ukrainian forces. In the days following the shutdown, Ukraine recaptured roughly 77 square miles in the country's southeast, according to calculations by the news agency Agence France-Presse based on data from the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.\n\nSpaceX began requiring verification of Starlink terminals on Feb. 4, blocking unverified Russian units from accessing its services. Almost immediately, Ukrainian eavesdroppers heard Russian soldiers complaining about the failure of \"Kosmos\" and \"Sinka\" — apparently code names for Starlink satellite internet and the messaging service Telegram.\n\n\"Damn it! Looks like they've switched off all the Starlinks,\" one Russian soldier exclaimed. \"The connection is gone, completely gone. The images aren't being transmitted,\" another shouted.\n\nDozens of the recordings were played for Axel Springer Global Reporter Network reporters in an underground listening post maintained by the Bureviy Brigade in northeastern Ukraine. Neither SpaceX nor the Russian Foreign Ministry responded to requests for comment.\n\n\"On the Russian side, we observed on the very day Starlink was shut down that artillery and mortar fire dropped drastically. Drone drops and FPV attacks also suddenly decreased,\" said a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance operator from the Bureviy Brigade who would agree to be identified only by the call sign Mustang, referring to first-person view drones. \"Coordination between their units has also become more difficult since then.\"\n\nThe satellite internet network has become a crucial tool on the battlefield, sustaining high-tech drone operations and replacing walkie-talkies in low-tech combat. Since Russia's February 2022 invasion, which destroyed much of Ukraine's traditional communications infrastructure, Western governments have provided thousands of the Starlink units to Kyiv.\n\nWith the portable terminals, there is no need to lay kilometers of cable that can be damaged by shelling or drone strikes. Drone footage can be transmitted in real time to command posts, artillery and mortar fire can be corrected with precision, and operational information can be shared instantly via encrypted messaging apps such as Signal or Telegram.\n\nAt the outset of the Russian invasion, Starlink access gave Ukraine's defenders a decisive operational advantage. Those in besieged Mariupol sent signs of life in spring 2022 via the backpack-size white dishes, and army units used them to coordinate during brutal house-to-house fighting in Bakhmut in 2023.\n\nSatellite internet became \"one of, if not the most important components\" of Ukraine's way of war, according to military analyst Franz-Stefan Gady, an adviser to European governments and security agencies who regularly visits Ukrainian units. \"Starlink constituted the backbone of connectivity that enabled accelerated kill chains by helping create a semi-transparent battlefield.\"\n\nThe operational advantages of Starlink did not go unnoticed by Russian forces. By the third year of the war, Starlink terminals were increasingly turning up in Russian-occupied territory. One of the first documented cases surfaced in January 2024 in the Serebryansky forest. Month by month, Ukrainian reconnaissance drones spotted more of the devices.\n\nThe Ukrainian government subsequently contacted Musk's company, urging it to block Russian access to the network. Mykhailo Fedorov, then digital minister and now defense minister, alleged Russian forces were acquiring the devices via third countries. \"Ukraine will continue using Starlink, and Russian use will be restricted to the maximum extent possible,\" Fedorov pledged in spring 2024.\n\nYet Russian use of the terminals continued to grow throughout 2025, and their use was not limited to artillery or drone units. Even Russian infantry soldiers were carrying mini Starlink terminals in their backpacks.\n\n\"We found Starlink terminals at virtually every Russian position along the contact line,\" said Mustang. \"At some point, it felt like the Russians had more devices than we did.\"\n\nIn the listening post this month, he scrolled through more than a dozen images from late 2025 showing Russian Starlink terminals set up between trees or beside the entrances to their positions.\n\n\"We targeted their positions deliberately,\" Mustang continued. \"But even if we destroyed a terminal in the morning or evening, a new one was already installed by the next morning.\"\n\nIn the Russian-occupied eastern Ukrainian city of Kreminna, there was even a shop where soldiers could buy Starlink terminals starting in 2024. According to Ukrainian officials, these devices were not registered in Russia.\n\nSpaceX's move in early February to enforce a stricter verification system effectively cut off unregistered Starlink terminals operating in Russian-occupied areas. Only devices approved and placed on a Ukrainian Ministry of Defense \"whitelist\" remained active, while terminals used by Russian forces were remotely deactivated.\n\n\"That's it, basically no one has internet at all,\" a Russian soldier said in one of the messages played for Axel Springer reporters. \"Everything's off, everything's off.\"\n\nThe temporary shutdown allowed Ukraine to slow the momentum of Vladimir Putin's forces, although the localized counteroffensives do not represent a fundamental shift along the front. Soldiers from other Ukrainian units, including the Black Arrow battalion, confirmed the military consequences of the Starlink outage for Russian forces in their sectors in interviews with the Axel Springer Global Reporters Network.\n\nNow, analysts from the Bureviy Brigade say Russian forces are scrambling for alternatives. They have been forced to rely far more heavily on radio communication, according to Mustang, which creates additional opportunities for interception.\n\nRussian units will likely attempt to switch to their own satellite terminals. But their speed and connection quality are significantly lower, Mustang says. And because of their size, the devices are difficult to conceal.\"The shutdown of Starlink, even if only of limited effect for now, highlights the limited ability of the Russian armed forces to rapidly implement ongoing cycles of innovation,\" said Col. Markus Reisner of the Austrian Armed Forces. \"This could represent a potential point of leverage for Western supporters to provide swift and sustainable support to Ukraine at this stage.\"\n\nIbrahim Naber is a chief reporter at Welt.",

    "fullText": "He was at the heart of 1960s counterculture, then paved the way for the libertarian mindset of Silicon Valley. At 87, Brand is still keen to ensure the world is maintained properly – not just today, but for the next 10,000 years\n\nStewart Brand thinks big and long. He thinks on a planetary scale – as suggested by the title of his celebrated Whole Earth Catalog – and on the longest of timeframes, as with his Long Now Foundation, which looks forward to the next 10,000 years of human civilisation. He has had a lifelong fascination with the future, and anything that could get us there faster, from space travel to psychedelic drugs to computing. In fact, he was arguably the bridge between the San Francisco counterculture of the 60s and present-day Silicon Valley: in his commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005, Steve Jobs eulogised the Whole Earth Catalog and Brand’s philosophy, and echoed its farewell mantra: “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.”\n\nYou could say that Brand has also lived big and long. He is now 87 years old, in the final chapters of an eventful and adventurous life that has crossed paths with some of the most consequential events and figures of his era. He has been a writer, an editor, a publisher, a soldier, a photojournalist, an LSD evangelist, an events organiser, a future-planning consultant, even a government adviser (to the California governor Jerry Brown in the late 70s). “There was a time when people asked me, ‘What do you do?’ I said, ‘I find things and I found things,’” says Brand, as in he is a founder. He is speaking from a library where he likes to work in Petaluma, California, not far from his houseboat in Sausalito. “I’m always searching for good stuff to recommend, and good people.”\n\nIn light of his epic life, Brand’s latest project hinges on what sounds like the most mundane topic imaginable: maintenance. It is “not automatically an exciting concept,” Brand readily admits, but once he started thinking about it, he realised you could view just about everything in terms of it, and a lot could be revealed by doing so: “Maintenance is what keeps everything going. It’s what keeps life going.”\n\nHis new book is titled Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One. It is the first of a planned 13 instalments, Brand explains, and it deals with the most literal, material forms of maintenance. Subsequent instalments will investigate everything from buildings to communities, institutions to the human body, plus planetary and environmental maintenance. So perhaps not such a departure after all in terms of long, big thinking. “I fell into it realising it was a tremendously ambitious thing, because I was going to be writing about a range of things I know nothing about,” he jokes.\n\nIn this first instalment, Brand’s magpie curiosity roves freely across industrial history, from round-the-world yacht racing to vehicle manufacturing to encyclopedias to the refurbishment of the Statue of Liberty. The military comes up a lot, “because the military is so maintenance-dependent and maintenance-aware”, he says, pointing out that he served in the US army himself for two years in the early 60s.\n\nWars have been won and lost on the strength of maintenance, Brand notes. In the Vietnam war, for example, the US army’s M16 rifle was lighter, more accurate and more precisely machined; the Viet-Cong’s AK-47s were more crudely made but therefore easier to fix and less likely to go wrong. Many American GIs lost their lives as a result of jammed M16s. Similarly, Russia’s attempted full-scale invasion of Ukraine faltered in its first days in part due to poorly maintained tyres on its long-mothballed trucks, which reflected a broader Russian doctrine of “treating equipment and soldiers as expendable”, as opposed to Ukraine’s flexible, Nato-influenced maintenance culture.\n\nSurprisingly, perhaps, Brand expresses approval for Elon Musk. “What I find so admirable about Musk is that he keeps pushing the envelope of the possible in manufacturing,” he says. Just as Henry Ford revolutionised car manufacturing in the early 20th century with his Model T (which broke down a lot but was relatively easy to fix), so Musk’s Tesla has been a quantum leap, Brand argues. It catalysed the electric vehicle revolution, which has had an invaluable environmental impact. But Tesla also devised an ingenious way to make the entire underbody of its Model Y cars out of just two pieces of cast aluminium, whereas conventional cars used hundreds of parts that had to be welded, bonded, riveted together. Electric motors also have far fewer parts than internal combustion engines. Fewer parts means less to go wrong, which means less maintenance. This is how technology gets better, he says.\n\nThe flipside is, we now expect things to work all the time. “Most consumer products pretty much don’t require maintenance. You get an electric clock and plug it into the wall or change the batteries from time to time, and it’ll tell perfectly good time. You don’t have to do anything else. So there’s a getting out of the habit of expecting to do maintenance, and then when the thing has a problem, we’re offended: ‘Well, it’s not supposed to do that.’” For this reason Brand is also a huge fan of YouTube, where you can find lessons and instructions on how to fix just about anything. “We have higher expectations of not needing to maintain things, and lots of good ways to find out how to maintain them when we encounter a problem. So that’s basically progress, as far as I’m concerned.”\n\nBrand is now thinking about institutions in terms of maintenance, he says, and he has plenty of material. We’re speaking shortly after the Davos economic forum, where Donald Trump’s attempts to “acquire” Greenland came to a head, and the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, declared that there was a “rupture” in the “rules-based international order”. Rather than progress, we seem to be going in reverse here.\n\nLike the electronic clock, perhaps we’ve become so accustomed to the global order working (at least for powerful western nations), when it starts breaking we don’t know how to fix it. Brand is relatively relaxed, though. Some institutions might falter, others might prevail, or come back in a different form, he says. Davos is a good example of both: “Carney could say: ‘We’re having a rupture. And here’s a way to rethink ordering for the middle-level nations.’ So that was a great case of acknowledging an institution that’s in trouble – at an institution that was not in trouble: Davos.”\n\nBrand has been trying to foster a similar vein of long-term thinking with the Long Now Foundation. He co-founded it 30 years ago “to get people comfortable with thinking about not just the next 10,000 years, but more importantly, the last 10,000 years: we’ve come a long way, baby. How did that happen?” The idea began with an email conversation with the computer scientist and inventor Danny Hillis in 1994. They were discussing the year 2000, which had long been considered “the future”, but was then just six years away. The plan became to create an artwork “that would help pop through this membrane of the year 2000 for people, and let them take on various degrees and sizes of future, and not just the next decade”. Hillis conceived the Clock of the Long Now – a mechanical timepiece that would chronicle the next 10,000 years (the name came from Brian Eno, another collaborator). He had approached a lot of people with the idea, but, typically, it was Brand who responded and said: “OK. Let’s build the clock.”\n\nImprobable as it sounds, the clock is almost finished, buried a few hundred feet into a mountaintop in Texas. The land and the money were donated by the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos. It’s really a giant work of land art, Brand explains. “There’s a statue of liberty in New York, and this is kind of a statue of responsibility. It’s beautifully engineered and beautifully constructed and designed as an experience … it’s going to be a day in your life you’ll never forget.” And maybe it will inspire visitors to think as big and long as Brand does. “It would be nice to have an institution of thinkers and explainers that can last as long as the clock does.” The foundation’s other initiatives have included a series of seminars on long-term thinking (hosted by Brand), a library of “books you would want to restart civilisation from scratch”, and a project to preserve all the world’s languages.\n\nThis benign global scope has always been a hallmark of Brand’s brand, combined, paradoxically, with a sense of entrepreneurship and individualism. The opening words of the first Whole Earth Catalog, for example, were: “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.” Born in Illinois, in relative privilege, he came of age in a postwar America that felt it had largely figured out the “operating manual for spaceship Earth”, as the forward-looking designer Richard Buckminster Fuller put it at the time. Atom bombs, computers, vaccines, space travel – anything seemed possible.\n\nBrand combined these grand ambitions with a human-scaled ethos of empowerment. The strapline of the Whole Earth Catalog was “access to tools”, and it was meant in the broadest sense. The huge, thick directory, first published in 1968, listed all kinds of literal tools for the budding commune-dweller – from seed drills to footwear, kayaks to macrame kits – but it also championed books on all manner of hippy-era interests: esoteric religions, sociology, architecture, philosophy, science, the occult, how to talk to dolphins, you name it. Ideas are tools too, Brand points out. As such, the Whole Earth Catalog offered access to a multitude of alternative lifestyles. “It opened doors for people in a way that invited them to consider, ‘maybe I could just build a guitar, or live off the grid.’ And so it had the impact of conferring agency,” he says.\n\nThe Whole Earth Catalog became a huge bestseller in the late 60s and 70s, which made Brand a lot of money – too much for his liking, in fact. In the early 70s he wound the publication down and founded the Point Foundation, which gave grants to worthy causes, though he continued to publish books and periodicals in a Whole Earth spirit until the early 2000s.\n\nOne of the key schisms of the counterculture was a tension between the technologists and the environmentalists. The former embraced space exploration and computing; the latter condemned industrial civilisation and consumer society as inherently destructive. Brand straddled both camps. He saw how they could complement each other. That Nasa image of the whole Earth, for example, he points out, galvanised conservation movements such as Earth Day and Greenpeace, but it “was a direct result of something that environmentalists hated, which was the space programme”.\n\nPredictably, Brand was in on the ground floor when it came to computers. In 1968 he was a camera operator at what is now known as “the mother of all demos” – a seismic event put on by the Stanford Research Institute showcasing what we would recognise today as the foundations of personal computing: windows, hypertext links, video conferencing, even navigation using a then-unheard-of “mouse”. In a 1972 article for Rolling Stone, Brand declared personal computing to be “good news, maybe the best since psychedelics”. “Actually quite a lot better,” he says today. “Because one of the things that soon became apparent was that psychedelics kind of levelled off”, whereas computers have been “an exponential takeoff”: Moore’s law (the doubling of processing power every two years), the internet, and now artificial intelligence – we’re still on that path.\n\nHaving lived through the rapid rise and fall of the commune movement, Brand saw the potential of online community early on. In 1984 he organised the Hackers Conference (these were the days when “hacking” simply meant “doing cool stuff with computing”), at which he coined the now-familiar maxim “information wants to be free”. A year later he co-founded the Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link (Well) as a sort of proto social media platform, with discussion forums on various topics. Meanwhile, many of Brand’s Whole Earth crew went on to found Wired magazine in 1993 (Brand features in the first issue, interviewing Camille Paglia).\n\nTo his critics, Brand paved the way for the neoliberal, libertarian mindset of today’s Silicon Valley. But he was also a community-focused idealist and a lifelong environmentalist. That technology v nature tension persists – hence his apparent affinity with tech figures such as Bezos and Musk. He’s still ambivalent: “Finding anything that is an absolutely unmitigated benefit is pretty rare,” he says. But “I would say the benefits of personal computers and smartphones and the internet vastly reached beyond, in good terms, what we imagined at the time.”\n\nIn terms of physical maintenance, Brand has always been a healthy, active, outdoorsy person – he was a keen sailor, he was hiking up mountains with rocks in his backpack in his 60s, and he started going to CrossFit when he was 75 – “that built a pretty strong constitution”. Now, though, he has a respiratory illness, he says, “which is progressive, incurable and fatal”. He’s in a stable condition, and still exercises, but uses supplementary oxygen as well. “I’d be very surprised by making it into my 90s,” he says, seemingly without regret: “Imagine the luck, to get to be 87 – it’s just fantastic!”\n\nBrand has always been an optimist, he says, and taking the long view, he still is. “I find optimism in terms of being able to find a way to not only continue but keep getting better.” It might be hard to see a positive way forward right now, but that’s always been the way, he says. Brand brings up yet another of his incarnations, the Global Business Network, a consultancy he was part of in the 90s that mapped out future scenarios to help clients plan ahead. “It’s harder to imagine how something might go well than go badly,” he says. But we do not need to passively accept our fate as if we have no control over it. “If you like some scenarios better than others, you can be aware of the ones you don’t like and look for signs of them, and also look at signs of the ones you want to have come to pass, and lean differentially toward them. That’s how you negotiate your way into a future you were glad of. It’s done incrementally by, among other things, lots of individuals and some institutions, and that’s how we grapple our way, muddle our way forward.”",

    "description": "Elon Musk's AI startup alleged in the lawsuit that Sam Altman's OpenAI recruited former xAI employees to steal trade secrets.",
    "fullText": "A California federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Elon Musk's AI startup xAI, accusing OpenAI of poaching staff to steal trade secrets.\n\nIn a ruling released on Tuesday, US District Judge Rita Lin sided with a request to dismiss the case filed by the Sam Altman-led AI company behind ChatGPT, citing the lack of evidence against it.\n\n\"Notably absent are allegations about the conduct of OpenAI itself,\" Lin wrote in her order. \"xAI does not allege any facts indicating that OpenAI induced xAI's former employees to steal xAI's trade secrets or that these former xAI employees used any stolen trade secrets once employed by OpenAI.\"\n\nInstead of pointing to \"misconduct\" by OpenAI, xAI cited \"eight former xAI employees who left for OpenAI at around the same time,\" the judge said.\n\nLin gave xAI until March 17 to file an amended complaint \"correcting the deficiencies\" outlined in her order — giving Musk's company a chance to try again.\n\nThe ruling is the latest in an escalating feud between tech billionaires Musk and Altman.\n\nLast year, xAI sued Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of monopolistic behavior. Musk has also separately sued Altman and OpenAI — the company the two men cofounded in 2015 — over claims that it betrayed its nonprofit mission by shifting into a for-profit structure. OpenAI countersued, accusing Musk of a \"years-long campaign of harassment.\" That case is scheduled to go to trial in April.\n\nIn a statement in social media platform X, OpenAI said it welcomed the court's decision and called the lawsuit \"yet another front in Mr. Musk's ongoing campaign of harassment.\" Lawyers for x.AI didn't immediately return Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nIn the lawsuit that was dismissed on Tuesday, Musk's company alleged that OpenAI engaged in a \"deeply troubling pattern\" of recruiting former xAI employees to gain access to confidential information related to Grok, xAI's flagship chatbot.\n\nIn an amended complaint filed last year, xAI accused rival OpenAI of violating California and federal law by \"inducing\" several ex-employees to \"steal and share xAI's trade secrets.\"\n\n\"Threatened by xAI's innovations, OpenAI is not merely soliciting or hiring a competitor's employees,\" the lawsuit said. \"OpenAI is waging a coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign: OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI's key technologies and business plans.\"\n\nThe complaint alleged that, in just a few months, OpenAI poached at least eight xAI employees, including early xAI engineer Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance executive. Two former employees, the lawsuit said, have admitted to stealing xAI's trade secrets.\n\nAltman's OpenAI has denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit the \"latest chapter\" in Musk's \"ongoing harassment\" against the company.\n\nIn OpenAI's motion to dismiss the complaint, the company alleged that Musk and xAI have \"lobbed baseless claims of trade secret misappropriation\" to \"intimidate current and former xAI employees from working at their place of choice.\"\n\n\"XAI's federal trade secret misappropriation claim fails as a matter of law,\" OpenAI's attorneys argued in the motion. \"Remarkably, xAI never alleges that OpenAI actually acquired or disclosed xAI's trade secrets.\"",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been one to hold back on social media, and his latest outburst has the internet buzzing. The Tesla CEO took to X, the platform he owns, to blast The New York Times over a decade-old opinion piece that recently popped back into the spotlight.\n\nThe article in question suggested viewing pedophilia through a mental health lens rather than purely as criminal behavior. Musk's sharp words have reignited debates about media responsibility and child safety, drawing in politicians, influencers, and everyday users. Let's break down what happened, why it matters, and the wave of reactions it sparked.\n\nBack in October 2014, The New York Times published an op-ed by Margo Kaplan, a law professor at Rutgers University. Titled \"Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime,\" the piece argued that attractions to children should be treated as a psychiatric issue.\n\nKaplan pointed out that the DSM-5, the manual used by mental health professionals, classifies pedophilia as a paraphilic disorder when it causes distress or leads to harmful actions. She stressed that while any abuse of children remains illegal, recognizing the attraction as a disorder could help people get therapy before they act on impulses.\n\nThis wasn't a news story from the paper's reporters; it was an opinion column meant to spark discussion. Kaplan used examples from other mental health conditions, like substance abuse disorders, where treatment focuses on prevention rather than punishment for thoughts alone. At the time, it drew some criticism, but it faded from headlines.\n\nFast forward to early 2025, and the piece resurfaced amid broader talks about child exploitation cases, including references to high-profile figures like Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. Senator Mike Lee from Utah shared a screenshot of the headline on X, calling the idea \"delusional\" and insisting, \"No, it's a crime.\" His post quickly gained traction, setting the stage for Musk's involvement.\n\nMusk didn't hesitate to jump in. Replying to Lee's post, he labeled The New York Times \"utterly disgusting\" for running the op-ed. In another related comment, he went further, calling the outlet \"evil propaganda.\"\n\nThis fits Musk's pattern of clashing with mainstream media; he has accused them of bias and sensationalism on multiple occasions. For instance, he has previously criticized The Times for their coverage of Tesla and his personal life, once even tweeting that he might create a site to rate journalists' credibility.\n\nWhat made this slam stand out was the timing. Musk has positioned himself as a vocal advocate for child protection online. He has pushed for stricter content moderation on X to combat child exploitation material, and he often shares posts highlighting threats to kids. Users on the platform amplified his words, with his response racking up millions of views in hours.\n\nOne X user echoed Musk by saying the framing was \"dangerous\" and eroded trust in legacy media. Musk's history adds layers here; he once faced a defamation lawsuit after calling a British cave explorer \"pedo guy\" during the 2018 Thai cave rescue drama. A jury cleared him in 2019, ruling the term was an insult, not a factual claim.\n\nKaplan's piece wasn't defending child abuse; it made clear that actions like molestation are crimes deserving punishment. Instead, she highlighted how stigma prevents people with these attractions from seeking help.\n\nShe cited studies showing that many pedophiles never offend, but fear of legal repercussions keeps them silent. For example, she referenced Germany's Dunkelfeld project, which offers confidential therapy to non-offenders and has reportedly reduced risks.\n\nCritics, however, argue this approach blurs lines. They say labeling it a disorder risks normalizing something society views as morally wrong. Senator Lee's post captured this sentiment, rejecting any nuance and focusing on protection.\n\nThe op-ed also discussed legal barriers, like mandatory reporting laws that might deter therapy seekers. Kaplan suggested reforms to balance help with safety, such as better access to treatment without automatic criminalization for attractions alone. Despite these points, the headline's stark phrasing has fueled misinterpretations, leading some to claim The Times was soft on pedophilia.\n\nThe online response split sharply, with many echoing Musk's disgust. One X user wrote, \"Elon calling out NYT’s disgusting 2014 piece loud & clear — pedophilia is a CRIME, not a disorder to normalize. No debate. No excuses. Protect kids first, always.\"\n\nNot all agreed, though; some defended the op-ed's intent to promote treatment and reduce harm. A commenter noted, \"If The New York Times thought they were publishing nuance, they ended up serving nonsense. Elon calling them 'utterly disgusting' is blunt but when the subject is pedophilia, there’s no room for clever spin.\"\n\nOthers brought up unrelated scandals, like Epstein files, to question media priorities. The debate spilled into broader talks on U.K. policies releasing offenders for space, with Musk previously saying, \"I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.\"\n\nThis episode highlights ongoing tensions between free speech, mental health advocacy, and zero-tolerance for child harm. Musk's platform amplified the debate, showing how old content can fuel new fires in today's fast-paced online world. As discussions continue, one thing is clear: topics like this touch deep nerves, prompting calls for accountability from all sides.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk has weighed in on the risks of handing AI agents sweeping control.\n\nOn Monday night, Musk posted an image of a monkey being handed a rifle on X, captioned: \"People giving OpenClaw root access to their entire life.\"\n\nThe image was originally shared by X user @DEVOUR_ in response to a post from Meta's director of AI alignment and safety, Summer Yue.\n\n\"Nothing humbles you like telling your OpenClaw 'confirm before acting' and watching it speedrun deleting your inbox,\" Yue wrote on X Monday. \"I couldn't stop it from my phone. I had to RUN to my Mac mini like I was defusing a bomb.\"\n\nYue had given OpenClaw full access to her work inbox and told the agent to \"suggest what you would archive or delete.\" Screenshots she shared showed the agent continuing to \"clear everything\" in her inbox even after she told it to stop.\n\nMusk took a swipe at Yue in a reply to another user on X.\n\n\"Someone who got p0wned by OpenClaw is definitely gonna solve AI safety,\" Musk wrote.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, also chimed in. He wrote on X in reply to Yue's post: \"/stop does the trick.\"\n\nOpenClaw and its agent-only social platform, Moltbook, went viral earlier this year as developers shared videos of AI agents posting, debating, and networking autonomously.\n\nLast week, OpenAI's Sam Altman announced he had hired Steinberger to work on the \"next generation\" of personal AI agents — an effort he said would \"quickly become core to our product offerings.\"\n\nMusk's comments about OpenClaw come amid his long-running, increasingly heated rivalry with Altman.\n\nLast month, Musk escalated tensions by posting on X: \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT,\" responding to a post that said OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to multiple deaths since its 2022 release.\n\nAltman pushed back, defending ChatGPT and OpenAI's safety efforts before turning his fire on Tesla's Autopilot system, calling it unsafe.\n\nEarlier this month, Altman said in a post on X that he's \"really excited\" to take the fight with Musk into court.\n\n\"Really excited to get Elon under oath in a few months, Christmas in April!\" the OpenAI CEO wrote.\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman in February 2024, accusing the company of abandoning its nonprofit mission. He said he had contributed $38 million to OpenAI in its early days under the understanding that it would remain nonprofit. Musk was among the company's original founders, alongside Altman and others.\n\nThe jabs have extended beyond safety debates and lawsuits. Speaking during a live interview with local media in New Delhi on Friday, Altman dismissed Musk's proposal to put data centers in space.\n\n\"I honestly think the idea with the current landscape of putting data centers in space is ridiculous,\" Altman said, drawing laughter from the audience.",

    "fullText": "Last Week Tonight host delved into the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in relation to the Epstein files and Musk’s poisonous ownership of X\n\nOn his new episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver wasted no time digging into the files related to late pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, which have once again ensnared former prince Andrew.\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known after being stripped of his royal titles for his connection to Epstein, was arrested last week – the first arrest of a senior member of the royal family in modern history – on allegations that that he had shared confidential material with Epstein while serving as a UK trade envoy.\n\n“It’s true, they arrested former prince Andrew, and I don’t know why they’re still going with ‘alleged’ connections to Epstein there, while also running a photo that makes them look like the two closest friends I’ve ever seen,” Oliver laughed. “It looks like they’re brainstorming a new podcast. It looks like Andrew’s soft-launching: ‘Hey, would it be crazy if we moved in together?’ I’m just saying, maybe drop the ‘alleged’ part when you’re dealing with two guys that look so close they could finish each other’s prison sentences.\n\n“And if you’re thinking: ‘Well, what was the new revelation that did it? Was it the grotesque new photo of Andrew on all fours over a young woman?’ Incredibly, no, it was apparently this.”\n\nEmails released by the US justice department appear to show that Mountbatten-Windsor shared reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore, as well as confidential investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Afghanistan’s Helmand province.\n\n“Yeah, they got him on forwarding documents, which is a little underwhelming,” said Oliver. “Though, to be honest, when it comes to bringing down monsters, I don’t really care if it’s for a boring computer crime, the same way I’m not that mad if what finally ends a toddler throwing a tantrum is a cardboard box [on his head]. The method doesn’t matter. What’s important is you have been stopped.\n\n“Now, Andrew has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing and has been released, although that does not mean he’s been found not guilty,” Oliver added, next to the now widely circulated photo of Mountbatten-Windsor upon release, slumped in the backseat of a car. “All we really have to go on right now is this fantastic picture of him leaving custody, and you can draw your own conclusions there. Reasonable people can disagree on whether this makes him look guilty – or dead.”\n\nIn his main segment, Oliver pivoted to another man caught up in the Epstein scandal: Elon Musk, and specifically the many problems with Musk’s role as the owner of Twitter, the social media site he bought (and renamed X) for $44bn in October 2022. Oliver recalled how Musk arrived at Twitter HQ on his first day carrying a sink, then posted “let that sink in”. – “a joke so funny, I’m still laughing right now”, he deadpanned.\n\n“No one is saying Twitter was perfect before Elon arrived,” Oliver continued. “It helped platform a lot of ugliness, including but not limited to our first shit-poster president.\n\n“But it is genuinely worse now” as a “a sewer of misinformation” with “verified” blue checks for sale. Since taking over Twitter, Musk slashed its global trust and safety staff, reduced its full-time content moderators by over 50% and reinstated the accounts of several white supremacists. Oliver cited several independent studies that found Musk’s X boosted rightwing accounts, as well as tweets from Musk himself. “At this point, it seems like there’s one option if you never want to hear anything from Elon Musk, and that’s to be his coolest child,” Oliver joked, referring to Musk’s estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is transgender.\n\n“Twitter thumbing the scale toward Elon’s interests is bad for multiple reasons, not limited to his godawful jokes, his history of invoking extreme ideas like the antisemitic ‘great replacement theory’ and the fact that he was apparently a driver of US election misinformation in 2024,” he added. “But perhaps the biggest cause for concern is the fact that our current government is troublingly dependent on Elon’s platform. The Trump administration is painfully online, and particularly on Twitter.” JD Vance has described himself as a “Grok guy”, referring to Musk’s much-maligned AI bot. The FBI director, Kash Patel, has fumbled investigations by prematurely announcing arrests on X. And an infamous photo of the situation room from the US operation in Venezuela showed Pete Hegseth navigating a Twitter search for “Venezuela”.\n\nAs one White House staffer told the New Yorker: “If we have something that’s popular in rightwing Twitter, the White House is acting on it 90-plus percent of the time.”\n\n“The fact is, a massive media platform has been shaped in the image of its poisonous owner,” Oliver said. “And it doesn’t seem like Elon’s gonna see the error of his ways anytime soon, seeing his brain seems to be thoroughly cooked by the garbage he consumes on his own site. To be honest, he still doesn’t seem to have a vision of what Twitter should be.” Asked in a recent interview why his vision of “a collective consciousness” was important, Musk fumbled for several seconds, eventually coming up with “the why of it I guess is that so … we can increase our understanding of the universe.”\n\n“It seems like the odds of Elon fixing this are pretty slim, meaning all we can really control is how we each interact with Twitter,” Oliver surmised. His personal advice? Don’t post at all.\n\n“There are certain areas, like news in particular, where Twitter is now worse than useless,” he said. “In fact, for breaking news, it is an active liability, as people routinely push out false information in the wake of tragedies and crises, often for money, and there don’t seem to be many guardrails to stop them.\n\n“All of which is really a long way of saying that the Twitter that we may have once relied on and the Twitter that was fun and occasionally useful is just well and truly gone,” he concluded. “And collectively, while it might be sad, it might be past time for all of us to, if I may borrow a truly poisoned phrase, let that sink in.”",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk’s supposed interest in buying the Seattle Seahawks has been trending on social media.\n\nThe speculation gained traction after a viral post claimed the billionaire was interested in purchasing the NFL franchise from the Estate of Paul G. Allen.\n\nHowever, the real story centres on the Seahawks’ formal sale process rather than unverified fan conjecture.\n\nIn a post widely shared across platforms, as posted by TheNFLDrop, it was claimed, “Elon Musk says he is interested in purchasing the Seattle Seahawks from the Estate of Paul G. Allen.\n\n“Musk has a net worth of $850 billion, and the Seahawks are looking to sell for over $10 billion.”\n\nThat post mixed true elements, namely that the Seahawks are entering the market, with speculation about Musk’s intentions that is not supported by credible reporting.\n\nNo major sports news outlet has confirmed Musk is in advanced talks or formally pursuing the franchise. Ideas about Musk as a suitor remain fan discussion rather than a verified fact.\n\nIt is also worth noting that reported net worth figures for individuals like Musk often vary significantly over time and are routinely updated by financial outlets, not fixed figures reported by NFL sources.\n\nWhat is verified is that the Seattle Seahawks are being put up for sale by the Paul G. Allen Estate following the team’s Super Bowl LX victory.\n\nThe potential price tag is likely to be in the multi-billion dollar range, reflecting the franchise’s strong performance, market value, and recent championship success.\n\nWhile speculation about specific prospective buyers, including national billionaires, is a frequent by-product of such high-value sales, these remain conjecture until official offers are publicly disclosed and verified.\n\nIn short, while the Seahawks are indeed on the market, there is currently no credible evidence that Elon Musk is formally pursuing the purchase.\n\nSeattle Seahawks yet to receive Donald Trump invite to White House after Super Bowl LX win\n\nNFL insider sets $7 billion as the floor for Seattle Seahawks’ sale after Super Bowl 60\n\nSeattle Seahawks unlikely to franchise tag Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III",

    "description": "The state board of elections found Musk’s PAC sent prefilled ballot applications.",
    "fullText": "If Donald Trump’s administration really wants to find evidence of foreign interference in Georgia’s elections, then they need look no further than the president’s old friend Elon Musk and his shady super PAC.\n\nMembers of the Georgia State Elections Board voted Wednesday to issue a formal letter of reprimand to Musk’s America PAC over the billionaire technocrat’s illegal scheme to get Trump elected. Georgia, a key battleground state in 2024, was the target of aggressive campaigning by Trump’s team.\n\nIn October 2024, the Georgia secretary of state’s office launched an investigation after receiving numerous reports from residents across several counties saying they’d received partially prefilled absentee ballot applications from Musk’s America PAC, according to John Fervier, the State Elections Board’s chairman.\n\nThere was evidence to suggest America PAC had violated a state law that prohibits any person or entity, other than an authorized relative, to send an elector an absentee ballot application prefilled with the elector’s required information, according to Janice Johnston, the SEB’s vice chairman.\n\nAmerica PAC had also failed to display in a conspicuous location that this was not an official government publication, was not provided by the government, and was not a ballot, Johnston added.\n\nThe board swiftly voted to issue a letter of reprimand to America PAC.\n\nThis letter comes weeks after Trump suggested that his Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was spotted lurking around a federal raid at the election office in Fulton County, Georgia, because she was investigating foreign interference in elections.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the only evidence of meddling with people’s votes came from Trump’s own camp—the same thing happened in the 2020 election too.\n\nFox News doesn’t want a war with Iran and is trying to persuade its most famous viewer, Donald Trump, that it’s a bad idea.\n\nOn Fox & Friends Friday morning, host Rachel Campos-Duffy urged Trump to “make a better case” for “potentially going into another war.” Campos-Duffy is the wife of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and was filling in for Ainsley Earhardt.\n\n“I don’t think the case has been made sufficiently for me,” Campos-Duffy said. “You read The New York Times. There’s a lot of people who also feel that way. If you’re going to get us potentially into a war, you have to explain why it matters to us.”\n\nCampos-Duffy added that she didn’t think that military action would aid protesters within Iran against the ruling clerical regime.\n\n“I just want to mention, you know, I do feel sorry for the protesters. Again, it’s not clear to me that doing this move, potentially going to war is necessarily going to help the protesters,” Campos-Duffy said. “I’d like to think that was true. Explain to me why. Explain to me why I should risk my military-aged boys potentially going into another war in the Middle East. I thought we were done with that.”\n\nBrian Kilmeade looks like he’s going to have a stroke as Rachel Campos Duffy goes way off script on the subject of Trump’s new Middle East war of choice which Fox has been working overtime to sell pic.twitter.com/Z3O8fxc0eP\n\nA Fox host openly questioning Trump’s rationale for military action, let alone one who happens to be the wife of a Cabinet secretary, suggests that there is dissension among MAGA and right-wing media over the prospect of attacking Iran. Trump told reporters Friday morning that he was considering a limited military strike to pressure Iran into a deal, and Reuters reports that the United States is in the advanced stages of planning such an attack, looking into targeting individuals and even regime change.\n\nWill Trump listen to his supporters who have doubts or even outright oppose military action? Right now, the military buildup around Iran is almost unprecedented, and a bombing campaign could start a dangerous and deadly war for all sides.\n\nPresident Trump said that he had a backup plan after the Supreme Court struck down his tariffs on Friday morning.\n\n“President Trump commented on the Supreme Court ruling striking down his tariffs while inside the White House breakfast with governors this morning, calling it a ‘disgrace,’ I’m told,” CNN’s Kaitlan Collins wrote on X. “He told those gathered that he has a backup plan.”\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 6–3 Friday that Trump could not use a law meant for national emergencies to invoke global, sweeping tariffs.\n\nCNN’s Kristen Holmes reported that Trump became enraged when he learned about the decision, at one point ranting about “these f—king courts.”\n\n“Trump was speaking to a room full of U.S. governors at the White House when he was handed a note from an aide informing him of the Supreme Court decision, a source tells me,” wrote Reuters’s Jarrett Renshaw. “Trump was visibly frustrated and told the crowd that he had to do something about the courts, the source said.”\n\n“There is no exception to the major questions doctrine for emergency statutes. Nor does the fact that tariffs implicate foreign affairs render the doctrine inapplicable. The Framers gave ‘Congress alone’ the power to impose tariffs during peacetime,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “And the foreign affairs implications of tariffs do not make it any more likely that Congress would relinquish its tariff power through vague language, or without careful limits.”\n\nThere really isn’t any legal “backup plan” to a Supreme Court ruling, as that’s the entire point of the highest court in the land. We can only speculate as to what kind of extrajudicial last-ditch efforts Trump might take here.\n\nThis is how the Trump administration treats its veterans: Raid them, detain them, and leave them without any way to legally defend themselves.\n\nThat’s what happened to George Retes, a 26-year-old Army veteran who was arrested by ICE officials while commuting to his job in July, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday.\n\nRetes, a U.S. citizen and father of two, was driving to a farm in Ventura County, California, where he was supposed to work as a security guard on July 10. As he approached the farm, droves of protesters and federal agents were blocking the road. He tried to explain that he needed to get through for work, but the message—and his legal residency—did not matter.\n\nICE agents followed him back to his vehicle, where they proceeded to bang on his doors and give him conflicting information. One agent told him to “reverse,” while another agent told him to “​​pull over to the side,” according to an op-ed Retes penned for the San Francisco Chronicle in September.\n\nAs the situation escalated, officers lobbed tear gas at nearby protesters. The chemical irritant filled Retes’s car, causing him to choke.\n\n“Suddenly, an agent smashed my window and pepper-sprayed me,” Retes wrote. “I was pulled from the car, and one agent knelt on my neck while another knelt on my back.”\n\nThe veteran was zip-tied and left in the dirt for several hours before the agency sent him to Los Angeles’s Metropolitan Detention Center. They never bothered to check his identification.\n\nRetes was detained for three days, during which he was deprived of basic rights that are granted to suspected criminals, according to his attorneys. “He was not allowed a phone call, access to counsel, or a hearing. He was also subjected to inhumane treatment, not being allowed a shower to wash chemical irritants off his body,” the lawsuit reads.\n\nIn addition, the unwarranted and violent fiasco caused Retes to miss his daughter’s third birthday, and “exacerbated injuries he had sustained during his military service.”\n\nTo make matters worse, Retes never received an explanation for his arrest or for his continued detention at MDC, according to the lawsuit.\n\n“The officers, for their part, showed no interest in confirming George’s story,” the lawsuit reads. “No officer suggested he had broken any law, either. And no officer perceived him as a threat.”\n\nThe lawsuit was filed against the U.S. government, specifying unnamed individuals with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Navy, the FBI, and Customs and Border Protection.\n\n“George’s rights were violated, and he is filing this lawsuit, not only to protect his own rights, but to have the rights of others be protected too,” Andrew Wimer, director of media relations at the Institute for Justice, told The Guardian. “What happened to George is clearly wrong. No one can be held for three days without being told what they’ve done wrong, without being charged with a crime. Americans deserve justice when their rights have been violated.”\n\nDonald Trump is losing the MAHA moms.\n\nThe New York Times reports that women who flocked to the president in the 2024 election and embraced his promise to tackle “toxins in our environments and pesticides in our food” feel betrayed after Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to boost U.S. production of glyphosate, the pesticide used in the weedkiller Roundup that is possibly linked to cancer and is the subject of numerous lawsuits, including one brought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n“Ensuring an adequate supply of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides is thus crucial to the national security and defense, including food-supply security,” Trump’s order read.\n\nAs a result, these women, some of whom embraced the moniker “MAHA moms” after Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” slogan, are now rethinking their support for the president.\n\n“Women feel like they were lied to, that MAHA movement is a sham,” health and wellness podcaster Alex Clark, who works for the Trump-allied group Turning Point USA, told the Times. “How am I supposed to rally these women to vote red in the midterms? How can we win their trust back? I am unsure if we can.”\n\nSome MAHA moms have directed their anger at the president, but others question why Kennedy is backing production of a chemical he has criticized. On the Instagram page of Vani Hari, who promotes healthy eating and advises the White House on food policy, several commenters were upset with Kennedy.\n\n“This begs the question why didn’t sec Kennedy have a say and stop it,” wrote one person, while another asked “Where is RFK Jr.?” Neither Kennedy’s office nor the Trump administration has addressed whether Kennedy was part of any discussions about the order before it was issued.\n\nThe founder of Moms Across America, Zen Honeycutt, has led a campaign against glyphosate, petitioning stores not to sell it and supporting testing for pesticide residue. She called Trump’s order “an egregious offense to what he promised,” in an interview with the Times.\n\nTrump’s order also has pushback from Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who posted on X Thursday that he would introduce legislation to overturn the order. It seems that Trump has started a fight between MAGA and MAHA.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Friday to undo Donald Trump’s illegal Liberation Day tariffs, taking away the president’s favorite toy after he used it to hit his allies.\n\nIn the court’s 6–3 majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that Trump’s invocation of an emergency in order to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was a massive overreach of Congress’s authority and flew in the face of decades of precedent.\n\n“There is no exception to the major questions doctrine for emergency statutes. Nor does the fact that tariffs implicate foreign affairs render the doctrine inapplicable. The Framers gave ‘Congress alone’ the power to impose tariffs during peacetime,” Roberts wrote. “And the foreign affairs implications of tariffs do not make it any more likely that Congress would relinquish its tariff power through vague language, or without careful limits.\n\n“Accordingly, the President must ‘point to clear congressional authorization’ to justify his extraordinary assertion of that power,” Roberts wrote. “He cannot.”\n\nRoberts was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Kentanji Brown Jackson, and Amy Coney Barrett. In his concurring opinion, Gorsuch wrote, “Whatever else might be said about Congress’s work in IEEPA, it did not clearly surrender to the President the sweeping tariff power he seeks to wield.”\n\nConservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh both wrote dissenting opinions, and Justice Samuel Alito and Thomas joined Kavanaugh’s.\n\nTrump imposed his so-called “reciprocal tariffs” in April 2025 using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a rule that allows the president to regulate commerce in case of a national emergency—but doesn’t actually include the word “tariff.”\n\nThe Trump administration initially claimed that the “reciprocal tariffs” were simply a tool to negotiate improved trade deals with other countries in order to promote domestic manufacturing and thwart drug trafficking.\n\nBut it quickly became clear that the deals were neither binding nor permanent. In reality, Trump’s tariffs were intended to be ever-changing, a whip to extend across the world at his whim. The results? Trump has hurt U.S. manufacturing, driven up prices, and strained relationships with U.S. allies.\n\nTrump claimed in mid-January that should the Supreme Court rule against his tariff policy, the U.S. would be forced to “pay back … Hundreds of Billions of Dollars” in investments made by companies and countries hoping to avoid his steep tariffs.\n\n“When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars!” Trump wrote. “It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our country to pay.”\n\nTrade Representative Jamieson Greer told The New York Times on January 19 that in the case of an unfavorable decision, Trump planned to simply ignore the ruling. He would impose a new set of tariffs that will “start the next day” in order “to respond to the problems the president has identified.”\n\nThe FBI conducted four interviews with a woman who accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her as a child, and Trump’s Justice Department gave all four of those interviews to Ghislaine Maxwell before her trial, as reported by Roger Sollenberger. Only one of those interviews is in the publicly searchable Epstein files—and it was removed and put back earlier this week.\n\n“By choosing not to release three FBI interviews with an underage Trump accuser—interviews the DOJ gave to Maxwell at trial—Trump’s DOJ allowed Maxwell to retain potential blackmail over the president,” Sollenberger wrote Friday on X. “But that leverage over Trump vanishes if DOJ made them public, as law requires.”\n\nThe woman sat down for the interviews with the FBI after filing a lawsuit against the Epstein estate. In the publicly available interview, she claims that she was “brutally and forcibly battered, assaulted, and raped by these other men she met through Epstein. On one occasion, one of these prominent men forcibly slapped Jane Doe 4 in the face after she was forced to perform oral sex on him. This same man forcibly raped her, penetrating her both vaginally and anally. On information and belief, Epstein was aware of and, indeed encouraged, the assault of Jane Doe 4 by these other men.”\n\nThis lawsuit matches the FBI’s lone public interview with her, in which she names Trump.\n\n“[REDACTED] stated Epstein introduced her to Trump who subsequently forced her head down to his exposed penis which she subsequently bit,” the FBI said. “In response, Trump punched her in the head and kicked her out.” This allegedly occurred in the mid-1980s when she was “approximately 13-15 years old.”\n\nTrump has of course denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThere are three more interviews that this woman has with the FBI, and we don’t know what else she says or who else she names. But Maxwell does.\n\nLabor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s husband has been banned from the department’s headquarters in Washington after he allegedly sexually assaulted two female staffers, The New York Times reported Thursday.\n\nDr. Shawn DeRemer, a 57-year-old anesthesiologist from Portland, Oregon, will no longer be able to visit his wife at work, after at least two female staffers told officials that he touched them inappropriately. A building restriction notice viewed by the Times put it gently: “If Mr. DeRemer attempts to enter, he is to be asked to leave.”\n\nOne of the incidents, which occurred during working hours, was caught by security cameras, people familiar with the matter told the Times. The footage showed DeRemer giving a female staffer an extended embrace, and it was reviewed as part of a criminal investigation, one of the people told the paper.\n\nA police report documenting a December incident of forced sexual conduct at the Labor Department was filed by Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department in late January.\n\nConcerns about DeRemer were initially raised in January, as part of an internal investigation into alleged misconduct by his wife. In an explosive complaint to the Inspector General’s Office, Chavez-DeRemer was accused of abusing her position by having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a member of her security detail.\n\nShe was also accused of drinking during the workday and of committing travel fraud by making her chief of staff schedule official taxpayer-funded trips she could use to see friends and family. Her lawyer has denied these allegations.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken more than a year to roll out a fraction of the Epstein files, but literally overnight, Donald Trump decided that it would be no problem at all to dump everything the government has on alien life.\n\nThe president announced late Thursday that he would direct agencies to “begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.”\n\nTrump noted the spontaneous release was due to the public’s “tremendous interest,” though that’s not the entire story.\n\nHours earlier, Trump was caught off guard by a reporter’s question relating to Barack Obama’s recent revelation that aliens are real.\n\n“Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to earth?” Fox News’s Peter Doocy asked Trump on Air Force One.\n\n“Well, he gave classified information, he’s not supposed to be doing that,” said Trump, who was charged for mishandling and illegally keeping classified documents after losing the 2020 election.\n\n“So aliens are real?” Doocy pressed.\n\n“Well I don’t know if they’re real or not, I can tell you he gave classified information; he’s not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake,” Trump replied, cracking that the only aliens he was aware of in the U.S. were “illegals.”\n\nObama casually fessed to his belief in aliens during a speed round of playful questions on the No Lie With Brian Tyler Cohen podcast Saturday, informing listeners that “they’re real, but I haven’t seen them.” The former president added that there was no facility storing aliens at Area 51, “unless there’s this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.”\n\nHe clarified his comments the following day, writing on social media that the universe is so vast that the likelihood of extraterrestrial life is “statistically” probable.\n\n“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Obama posted.\n\nTrump’s eagerness to satiate apparent public demand on the existence of aliens only further underscores the absurdity of the endless delays holding back the full, legally mandated release of the Epstein files.\n\nRecent reports indicate that the DOJ has only released a fraction of the Epstein files, potentially holding on to upward of 50 terabytes that the agency has not yet disclosed. The recent releases, which include millions of pages of documents, amount to roughly 300 gigabytes, or 2 percent of the estimated total.\n\nPresident Trump is continuing his crusade against voting rights, claiming that mail-in ballots are “crooked as hell” and that eliminating them will guarantee Republican dominance of elections for the next half-century.\n\n“Mail-in ballots are crooked as hell. We’re the only country in the world that use this type of mail-in ballot, the only country in the world,” Trump said at a rally in Rome, Georgia, on Thursday. “I’ll tell you what, Republicans have to win this one. We’ll never lose a race for fifty years, we won’t lose a race.”\n\nHe then launched into his broader attack on voting rights, which many see as a last-ditch attempt to salvage the GOP’s chances in the November midterm elections, which are predicted to go poorly for them.\n\n“We want voter ID, we want proof of citizenship, and we don’t want mail-in ballots except for the military far away, except for people that are ill, disabled, or people that are away. Even for a vacation! We’ll be generous,” Trump added.\n\nTrump: \"Mail in ballots are crooked as hell. Republicans have to win this one. We'll never lose a race for 50 years.\" pic.twitter.com/5c3X98vW7g\n\nTrump had no complaints about mail-in ballots when he won the presidency in 2024. And the U.S. is not the only country to use them: 34 countries and territories use some kind of postal voting. Twelve even allow all voters to vote by mail, including the U.K., Germany, Poland, Greece, and Canada.",

    "description": "Famous people from Elon Musk to Glen Powell have moved to Texas recently, many from the comparatively more expensive state of California. Here's why.",
    "fullText": "Roseanne Barr's son, Jake Pentland, told Us Weekly in June 2025 that his famous mother had traded the Hollywood Hills for Texas Hill Country, a region in central Texas that includes cities like Austin and New Braunfels.\n\n\"My mom lives with me, my wife, and my two daughters — she's the best grandma,\" Pentland told the magazine.\n\nIn a separate June interview with Fox News Digital, Barr said living in Texas is a \"dream come true\" and described what her new life looks like.\n\n\"I'm doing a lot of mowing. I've got a really fantastic tractor out here, and I'm mowing,\" Barr said. \"The only problem is I don't clear the trees quite as good as I should, and I'm always hitting a tree and knocking it over, and it always hits me in the head.\"\n\nA native of Texas, Duff decided with her fiancé Matt Rosenberg to pack up the kids and leave California once the pandemic hit.\n\nAt first, she was nervous that the move would hurt her career.\n\n\"I think so much of my fear of moving out of Los Angeles was that my career was there and that I would never work again or something like that,\" she told Fox News Digital in 2022. \"And, you know, I think this has all taught us that Zoom certainly can be a very powerful tool. And we can, you know, very luckily for me, get to continue to work from here, and I get to live near my dad. I haven't lived, here, near my dad in a really long time.\"\n\nThe son of Clint Eastwood, Scott has been methodically building his own career, showing up in the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and Guy Ritchie movies.\n\nDuring his downtime in Texas, he does everything from fishing to hunting.\n\n\"I think that's why people who come to Texas really can fall in love with it,\" he told Flaunt in 2021 from his home in Austin. \"There's more community, people are more neighborly, people are nice. It slows life down a little bit. It's not this fast-paced living in a big city like New York or Los Angeles.\"\n\nAfter spending most of her life jet-setting around the world trying to conquer the modeling industry, Hadid decided recently to take some time away from the spotlight.\n\nIn early 2024, she spoke to Allure about moving to Texas to focus on her mental and physical health (she was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in 2013), and be with her cowboy boyfriend Adan Banuelos.\n\n\"Just as I have styled myself for years now — which I still do — I love being able to do my own hair and makeup, be happy with how I look, and get ready with my girlfriends here in Texas,\" Hadid told Allure. \"We have the best time, and I never feel like I need to do too much.\"\n\n\"For the first time now, I'm not putting on a fake face. If I don't feel good, I won't go. If I don't feel good, I take time for myself. And I've never had the opportunity to do that or say that before,\" Hadid added. \"Now when anybody sees me in pictures and they say I look happy, I genuinely am. I am feeling better; my bad days now were my old good days.\"\n\nHarrelson lived in Hawaii for many years before moving back to his home state of Texas in 2023.\n\nNow in the Lone Star State and living just outside Austin, the actor has lobbied alongside longtime friend Matthew McConaughey to make Texas a hub for film and television production.\n\nIn 2025, the Texas House approved Senate Bill 22, which provides $300 million every two years through 2035 to support the local film industry.\n\nIn 2021, the rapper-turned-television producer and entrepreneur announced on X that he was living in Houston.\n\nThe star has enjoyed visiting Austin for decades but finally decided to live there in 2020.\n\n\"I love it. I've been coming here for 20 years,\" he told \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" in 2020. \"I'm much closer to my mom and everybody. I love it. It's great.\"\n\nThe former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter turned TikTok food critic has set up shop in Texas.\n\nAfter living in Las Vegas, Lee relocated to Texas in November 2024. In a December video reviewing the downtown Dallas restaurant The Wicked Butcher, he revealed that he now lives in Dallas.\n\n\"One thing I do love about the Dallas food scene — we've been here a month, a month and a half — they do have some nice fine dining restaurants,\" Lee said.\n\nOscar-winner Matthew McConaughey and wife Camila Alves settled in Austin in 2012 after buying a 10,800-square-foot mansion.\n\nAccording to a 2024 profile in Southern Living, the move to Texas was initially because of a \"family crisis,\" when he needed to help his mother and two brothers. The couple decided to stay put and raise their three children there.\n\n\"Ritual came back,\" McConaughey said of being back in Texas. \"Whether that was Sunday church, sports, dinner together as a family every night, or staying up after that telling stories in the kitchen, sitting at the island pouring drinks and nibbling while retelling them all in different ways than we told them before.\"\n\nIn July, Elon Musk vowed to move two of his companies, X and SpaceX, out of California and into Texas. He already moved Telsa to Texas in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, Musk announced that he had already moved to Texas himself at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council summit.\n\nMusk has claimed to own a tiny home in Texas, and records show he bought a house in Austin in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, O'Neal bought a 5,269-square-foot home in Carrollton listed at $1,224,000 and sold it in 2024 for an undisclosed amount, though it was listed for $1.7 million, according to Realtor.com.\n\nThat year, Chexy Trust, tied to the Carrollton purchase, bought a 4,670-square-foot home in Rockwall County. In 2024, O'Neal opened a branch of his Big Chicken chain restaurant in Fort Worth.\n\nAs his footprint in the region grows, he told WFAA he plans to make the area his home base.\n\n\"I'm 75% going to move here full time,\" O'Neal said in June. \"I have to see what's going on with TNT next year, but based on that, you'll probably be seeing a lot more of me.\"\n\nThe \"Twisters\" star, who is also a native Texan, moved back to Austin from Los Angeles recently to be close to his family and for his own mental health.\n\n\"When all you do is consume movies and entertainment, you could become a little self-aware and maybe derivative of yourself,\" Powell told USA Today. \"Your personal life, there's no sort of freedom there, there's storytelling around that, and I feel like that's just not good for you on the long term.\"\n\nPadalecki ditched Hollywood for Texas before it was a trend. The \"Supernatural\" star, a San Antonio native, relocated from Los Angeles to Austin with his wife, Genevieve, in 2012.\n\nIn an Instagram video taken on Austin's 24th Street in 2020, he explained why he loves the city so much.\n\n\"Austin brings me a warmth and a happiness and a peace that I have been unable to find anywhere else in my travels,\" Padalecki said. \"I love being here.\"\n\nIn 2025, former \"Selling Sunset\" star Christine Quinn relocated to her home state of Texas after splitting from her ex-husband, tech entrepreneur Christian Dumontet.\n\nQuinn now lives in a suburb outside Dallas with her young son, Christian.\n\n\"I am really, really grateful to be living here,\" Quinn told People in January, adding that she's happy to be closer to family. \"I have a sister who lives really close to me, and my son has a cousin. So it's really something that I needed as opposed to the chaos when I was in Los Angeles.\"\n\nLike many other celebs, Rogan left Los Angeles once the pandemic hit.\n\nIn a 2023 episode of his popular podcast, \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" he explained why he ended up in Texas.\n\n\"Then we went to the lake, and people are playing music and jumping in the water,\" said Rogan, adding that his kids \"were like, 'We want to live here!'\"\n\n\"That was it. Two months later, I lived here,\" he said in the podcast episode.\n\n\"The Sopranos\" star moved to Austin in 2021 with her family, husband Cutter Dykstra, and sons Beau and Jack.\n\n\"I almost feel more connected to my craft and why I love acting,\" Sigler told The New York Times in 2021. \"When the calls come in, it's a beautiful surprise. I'm still on things and I'm still a businesswoman and it's still my career, but I don't feel the pressure around it because we took a stand for ourselves and we made decisions for our families.\"",

    "title": "War rooms, group chats, and video games: Inside Elon Musk's AI startup",
    "description": "In the wake of cofounder exits, Elon Musk's hands-on management is reshaping the startup.",
    "fullText": "At xAI's Palo Alto headquarters, engineers cheered.\n\nIt was February 2, and they'd just received a memo from Elon Musk, informing them the AI startup would be acquired by his rocket company, SpaceX. In a Slack channel for the team that trains the company's chatbot Grok, memes flowed, and a few changed their profile pictures to depict themselves as astronauts.\n\nThe excitement was quickly overshadowed by the pressure building inside the startup racing to catch up with rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic, while preparing for an expected IPO.\n\nOver the past six months, Musk has become deeply involved in day-to-day operations. He's run a massive group chat that's active at all hours, directed product changes, reassigned engineers, cut staff on key teams, and launched intensive \"war rooms\" to accelerate development. Several current and former employees said that the level of involvement has altered how the company functions. Leadership roles have narrowed, projects have shifted quickly, and teams have been pushed into what one described as a constant \"fire drill.\"\n\nMusk said that the changes are necessary as the company scales and the team's lean structure will be the secret to its success. Discussing xAI's restructure following the SpaceX acquisition, he posted on X:\n\n\"As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism.\"\n\nMusk's memo about the SpaceX acquisition talked of building a \"sentient sun\" and data centers in space. Separately, the company reassured staff that little would change in their day-to-day work as the company geared up for an initial public offering that could value it at $1.5 trillion.\n\nWithin a week, however, the tone in the office had shifted. Two of the company's cofounders, Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu, announced they'd resigned as Musk restructured the company and narrowed their responsibilities. The leadership departures increase risk at \"a sensitive stage\" ahead of the company's IPO, said Dimitri Zabelin, a senior AI analyst at PitchBook.\n\nOne employee described co-founder Ba's departure as \"incredibly disheartening,\" saying Ba, who studied under \"Godfather of AI\" Geoffrey Hinton, was one of the most respected researchers at the company.\n\nIn the following days, nearly a dozen employees took to Musk's social media site to say they had also left the company. Some had departed weeks earlier. A few left of their own volition. Others were affected by a restructuring following the SpaceX merger, in which Musk cut some members of the teams working on Grok Imagine, the chatbot's image and video generation feature, and the Macrohard team, which was developed last fall to help automate white-collar work, four people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.\n\nEmployees say the structural changes — coupled with an increasingly intense work culture since Musk wound down his involvement in President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency and began focusing more on the AI startup — have significantly increased the pace and pressure inside the company.\n\nMusk is a common sight at the office. Though he's heavily involved in the day-to-day, Musk does not use the company's Slack workspace, several people said. Instead, he communicates frequently through X, including in a direct message group of more than 300 engineers. Often, researchers will drop ongoing work to address the concerns that Musk flags.\n\nIn that chat, according to people familiar with it, Musk shares screenshots of his conversations with other tech executives and points out criticisms of Grok's performance he wants addressed. Late last year, Musk told staff that in conversations with his friends, he had been embarrassed by Grok Imagine's performance. As a result, some workers on the project were called to task, two people said.\n\nInternally, Musk has expressed frustration with the pace of Grok's development. XAI released Grok 4.2 this week. Separately, releases of at least two other products were pushed back by several weeks, according to people familiar with the timelines.\n\nIn one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game \"Baldur's Gate,\" according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.\n\nAcross his companies, Musk has long been known for his intensity. He's said he slept on Tesla's factory floor during the \"production hell\" for the Tesla Model 3 in 2017. The company is now the world's most valuable automaker. Now, xAI is getting the same treatment. Several workers told Business Insider that 12- and sometimes 16-hour workdays are common. Two said managers told them they are expected to respond to Slack messages within 30 minutes, regardless of the time of day.\n\n\"Because the company is so small, everything is a fire drill,\" one former worker said.\n\nAt any given time, multiple \"war rooms\" operate out of conference rooms at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, employees said. When researchers are \"war-rooming,\" teams temporarily relocate to a shared space to work side by side on specific problems — sometimes for months. At the end of 2025, at least five war rooms were running simultaneously, according to three people. One, they said, was dedicated to teaching Grok how to play one of Musk's favorite video games, \"League of Legends.\"\n\nLast year, Musk made it clear within the company that xAI would prioritize improving Ani, a hyper-sexualized, anime-inspired AI companion, people with knowledge of the issue said. He characterized Ani, a virtual companion who is capable of sexual role-play, as a way to set xAI apart from other AI companies.\n\nSome employees told Business Insider they were unsettled by the company's focus on the product. Today, the character is displayed prominently at the company's headquarters. At a company holiday party, paid actors dressed as Ani and another character hosted a robot fight club-style event, according to videos shared on social media.\n\nROBOT CAGE MATCHES & GROK'S ANI COSPLAY AT xAI HOLIDAY PARTY\n\nThe Dec 21 bash wasn’t your average tech mixer... xAI went full spectacle with dancing bots and live Optimus cage matches.\n\nAnd a cosplayer stole the spotlight dressed as Grok’s goth 3D persona “Ani,” doubling as a… pic.twitter.com/llhKdLPjsA\n\nSeveral employees said they had joined the company hoping to work on systems that would push the boundaries of science and were discouraged to find significant resources devoted to Ani.\n\nGrok's behavior on social media has also been a source of tension inside the company. Musk has characterized xAI and its chatbot as the \"anti-woke\" counterpart to ChatGPT. Public backlash against the chatbot, including for Grok's series of antisemitic rants and instances in which it digitally undressed people on social media without their consent, has put strain on employees, who have expressed concern about how their place of employment is viewed in the AI space.\n\nUntil last year, the company did not have a team of researchers specifically geared toward working on safety concerns associated with its large language model. It hired its first dedicated safety researcher in February of last year, around the same time that the Human Data team — which trains the chatbot — began reporting issues with reviewing large amounts of X user-generated requests for child sexual abuse material. One person with knowledge of the team said it was known within the company that a large portion of Grok usage was adult role-play, and the use case was discussed in several meetings with researchers.\n\nThe safety team grew to roughly half a dozen employees before three people left in December, shortly before users on X began reporting instances of the chatbot creating non-consensual sexual images of people, including some minors.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the team, xAI's safety teams lacked the authority to formally block product launches and were focused primarily on adjusting model outputs after training rather than conducting broad pre-launch risk reviews.\n\nMusk said on X last week that \"everyone's job is safety\" at xAI.\n\n\"It is not some fake department with no power to assuage the concerns of outsiders,\" he said.\n\nXAI still has a handful of workers in safety roles and was hiring for additional safety staff in January, according to posts viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSome former workers say the backlash and pace of work prompted their exit. Last summer, xAI shortened its vesting period from the industry standard of one year to six months, making it easier for workers to leave without forfeiting large portions of their equity.\n\nEmployee retention challenges are not unique to xAI; OpenAI and Anthropic have faced waves of departures in recent months. Across the industry, AI companies are competing fiercely for a limited pool of top researchers, some of whom have begun voicing concern about the narrowing space for exploratory work as companies increasingly orient themselves toward product over research in the competition to build ever larger models — a dynamic that poses a particular problem for xAI, which is younger and smaller than its main competitors.\n\nStill, some analysts say the race is far from settled. Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, compared the current AI landscape to the early days of the internet.\n\n\"I don't think Grok is that far behind, and it's still early in this race,\" Rocco told Business Insider.\n\nMusk has publicly signaled confidence. He told staff last week during the all-hands, referencing xAI's moment of transition: \"There's some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.\"\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "fullText": "One of Elon Musk's lieutenants at X is sharing what it's like to work in the trenches with him.\n\nThere are some trademarks of a Musk company, whether it be Tesla, SpaceX, or xAI. His teams are flat, his schedule is jam-packed, and his expectations are high. In the lead-up to a big launch, expect to grind out some long hours.\n\nX's head of product, Nikita Bier, recently opened up about working under Musk on the \"Out of Office\" podcast, contrasting it with his past work at Silicon Valley staples like Discord and Meta.\n\nBier described a \"very flat organization\" with lots of individual contributors reporting directly to Musk himself. There are very few managers, Bier said.\n\n\"Everyone has an incredible amount of agency,\" Bier said. \"We come up with an idea, we build it in a week, and it's out.\"\n\nBier also said that Musk was \"deep in the weeds.\" That's a feat for an executive who runs multiple companies (and once a government agency) at the same time.\n\n\"He does weekly reviews basically with every engineer at the company,\" Bier said. \"You have one or two slides, you present what you got done that week, he gives feedback.\"\n\nWhile some social media commenters expressed skepticism that every engineer received a weekly review, Musk is clearly hands-on — as evidenced by another xAI employee's podcast appearance.\n\nSulaiman Ghori worked on xAI's Macrohard team. He described flat teams, few managers — and a wager between Musk and an employee on how quickly he could set up a rack of GPUs. The employee won himself a Cybertruck. (Ghori, who also talked about the company's \"carnival company\" permit workaround for building data centers, announced he was no longer at xAI four days after the podcast was published.)\n\nBier also described a lean but efficient team that had \"like 30 core product engineers.\"\n\n\"The size of the engineering team is equivalent to a feature when I worked at Facebook,\" Bier said. \"It's essentially operating like a startup.\"\n\nOn X, one user asked whether these 30 employees were on the product or design team. Bier responded: \"Engineers, 2 designers, 1.5 product managers and me.\"\n\nIt's difficult to compare engineering team sizes to the pre-Musk Twitter days — or even discern which \"core\" team Bier is referencing. After six months of ownership, Musk cut Twitter's staff by 90%. Five hundred engineers remained at the time.\n\nWhat Bier didn't realize before working with Musk, he said, was that the executive will \"always do the hard things.\" Consumer product builders are often looking for quick wins, Bier said. Musk chooses the most important — and difficult — thing to do, he said, from rebuilding the algorithm to building data centers.\n\nThat also means: Don't expect a lazy Friday at X.\n\n\"Every morning, every day, there's a new crisis,\" Bier said. \"I'll just open my phone and be like: 'Oh my god.'\"",

    "fullText": "The rivalry between xAI and OpenAI is heating up again — this time, over wood-fired pizza.\n\nOver the weekend, Elon Musk and an OpenAI engineer jockeyed on X about wood-fired crusts, dough fermentation, and campus chefs.\n\nOn its face, it was a lighthearted back-and-forth about free pizza for lunch. Underneath, it encapsulates a trend playing out in Silicon Valley: rival AI companies are publicly pitching culture — and perks like free lunch — in the talent war for top engineers.\n\nThe exchange began when Musk reposted a video of an xAI engineer calling his job the \"opportunity of a lifetime.\"\n\nJoin @xAI https://t.co/Fo3kjhaTXA\n\nThe post quickly drew a response from xAI's competitor, OpenAI.\n\n\"Or join Codex,\" said Thibault Sottiaux, an engineering lead working on OpenAI's Codex software agent, who is also hiring. OpenAI operates \"with much of the same principles,\" he wrote — before adding an increasingly common recruitment pitch.\n\n\"Join the bright side, we have pizza,\" Sottiaux wrote.\n\nJoin the bright side, we have pizza\n\nMusk fired back: \"But how good is your wood oven pizza?\"\n\nThe pizza posturing then shifted to ingredients — and the corporate chefs preparing them.\n\n\"But how about the dough?\" he wrote back. \"Can't take shortcuts, needs 24 hours at least. And our chef is 🔥.\"\n\nOur chef is so good that God looked down at the food from heaven and said you my most delicious creation 👼\n\n\"Our chef is so good that God looked down at the food from heaven and said you my most delicious creation,\" Musk replied.\n\n\"And after having a bite, he wasn't 100% satisfied and asked our chef to improve upon the SoTA,\" Sottiaux said. \"Our chef delivered, and created a recipe now universally credited to accelerating the AGI timeline.\"\n\nThe tomato pie-based banter was sweet — but the subtext was spicier.\n\nAI labs are locked in a high-stakes dash for elite engineers, with high-end compensation packages stretching into the nine-figure territory.\n\nCompanies including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Musk's xAI are competing for a relatively small pool of researchers capable of building the next generation of models and infrastructure.\n\nAside from money, two key perks have emerged in the AI talent wars, according to professional AI poacher Mark Zuckerberg: access to GPUs and fewer direct reports.\n\n\"People say, 'I want the fewest number of people reporting to me and the most GPUs,'\" Zuckerberg said in 2025 TITV interview.\n\nAt the same time, the broader tech industry has pulled back on many of the pre-pandemic perks amid cost-cutting. Remote work has narrowed, layoffs have gathered steam, and perks like pet care stipends and expansive wellness benefits are becoming less common for new hires.\n\nBut there's one perk that has remained: the fancy lunch spread.\n\nMight as well throw in wood-fired pizza, too.",

    "fullText": "Anthropic famously employs a Scottish philosopher named Amanda Askell.\n\nHer job is to imbue its chatbot, Claude, with a personality and a set of moral guardrails. She is essentially teaching it to be cool and good.\n\nElon Musk, however, doesn't think she's qualified.\n\n\"Those without children lack a stake in the future,\" Musk posted on X in response to a profile of Askell published by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Journal profile does not say whether Askell has kids. Musk, who has imbued his own chatbot, Grok, with a distinct personality, has 14 of them. Musk is known for promoting a brand of pronatalism that's become popular among Silicon Valley elites.\n\nAskell responded with her trademark dry intellectualism.\n\n\"I think it depends on how much you care about people in general vs. your own kin,\" Askell wrote. \"I do intend to have kids, but I still feel like I have a strong personal stake in the future because I care a lot about people thriving, even if they're not related to me.\"\n\n\"I think caring about your children can make you feel invested in the future in a new and very profound way, and I do understand people wanting to convey that,\" she added.\n\nThe responses to their short back-and-forth were as varied as you might expect on Musk's social media network. A day later, Askell posted again.\n\n\"I'm too right wing for the left and I'm too left wing for the right,\" she said. \"I'm too into humanities for those in tech and I'm too into tech for those in the humanities.

    "fullText": "Tech titans had a Thursday to forget this week.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, and Michael Dell saw a combined $26 billion wiped off their net worths in one day, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nTheir fortunes shrank because their respective stakes in Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and Dell slid in value. The stock prices of those first four companies fell by around 2% on Thursday, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the immense costs of building out AI infrastructure and whether they'd see a return on their spending.\n\nDell shares tumbled 9% after rival Lenovo warned a memory-chip shortage was driving up costs, raising concerns on Wall Street that other hardware manufacturers would also see their profits contract. The sell-off triggered a $5 billion drop in its founder's personal fortune to $135 billion.\n\nMusk saw an unmatched $8 billion wealth decline on Thursday. But the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is still up about $57 billion at $676 billion this year, thanks to the soaring valuations of SpaceX and another of his companies, xAI.\n\nZuckerberg took an almost $7 billion blow to his net worth, fueling a year-to-date decline for the Meta CEO of a little over $3 billion, to $230 billion.\n\nBezos' fortune fell by $4 billion, extending the Amazon founder's wealth decline this year to around $27 billion.\n\nHuang rounded out the tech quintet with a $2.5 billion reduction in the Nvidia CEO's net worth, according to Bloomberg's rich list.\n\nOther tech bosses also saw some of their wealth erased. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin took roughly $1.5 billion hits to their net worths on Thursday as shares of Google's parent company slipped by less than 1%.\n\nIn contrast, Walmart stock climbed nearly 4% to a record high on Thursday, as fears eased over tariffs and investors rotated out of tech.\n\nThe retailer's stock jump added more than $4 billion to the respective net worths of founder Sam Walton's three surviving children: Jim, Rob, and Alice.\n\nThe trio was worth more than $150 billion each at Thursday's close. They only trail Musk in wealth gain this year after notching increases of more than $20 billion apiece.\n\nThe world's 10 wealthiest people together grew nearly $600 billion richer last year, catapulting their combined fortunes above $2.5 trillion — more than Amazon is worth.",

    "fullText": "Many social media posts by Tesla CEO on his platform are indiscernible from those of white supremacists, say experts\n\nElon Musk’s longtime fixation on a white racial majority is intensifying. The richest man in the world posted about how the white race was under threat, made allusions to race science or promoted anti-immigrant conspiracy content on 26 out of 31 days in January, according to the Guardian’s analysis of his social media output. The posts, made on his platform X, reflect a renewed embrace of what extremism experts describe as white supremacist material.\n\n“Whites are a rapidly dying minority,” Musk said on 22 January, a short time before taking the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, while reposting an Irish anti-immigrant influencer’s video about demographic change.\n\nMusk’s posts included him repeatedly claiming white people face systemic discrimination, endorsing the conspiracy that there is an ongoing genocide against white people in countries around the world and promoting a claim that white people would be “slaughtered” by non-whites if they become a demographic minority.\n\n“If you stripped Elon Musk’s name off of these things and showed them to me, I would think that this was a white supremacist,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Extremism, who reviewed a selection of the posts.\n\nMusk has for years promoted anti-immigrant and far-right content in his posts, as well as endorsed rightwing activists and political parties around the globe. The Tesla CEO’s most recent output displays a more consistent and explicit engagement with white supremacist content and nativist activists than in the past, however, lending them the imprimatur of the world’s richest person and spreading their ideas to his audience of over 200 million followers. Beirich said he appeared “deep into the world of white nationalism”.\n\n“The White ‘liberal’ standard for behavior is extremely strict, but is only applied to Whites,” Musk said on 26 January, commenting on a post that claimed there was discrimination against white conservatives.\n\nMusk’s posts repeatedly echoed prominent white supremacist narratives and ideologies, said William Braniff, the former director of the Department of Homeland Security’s office for prevention of terrorism and extremism. Several of Musk’s posts included what Braniff described as “textbook examples” of white supremacist conspiracy theories such as “the great replacement” – a belief that liberal elites or Jewish people are conspiring to use immigration to replace white populations.\n\nThe danger of Musk’s obsession lies in mainstreaming ideas that are deeply tied to violence and discrimination, according to Braniff, who is now executive director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (Peril) at American University. “The great replacement has been an especially important mobilizing narrative for highly lethal white supremacist attacks in the United States and elsewhere,” he said.\n\nMusk has repeatedly denied he is racist or antisemitic, stated that he condemns terrorism and said he does not advocate for violence. He asserted in a 2024 interview with Don Lemon that he does not He also told Joe Rogan in March last year that he is not a Nazi, weeks after facing condemnations from Jewish groups and the chairman of the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel over his speech to Germany’s far-right AfD party in which he told Germans to move beyond their “past guilt”.\n\nAlthough Musk wrote a number of posts on race and immigration himself last month, much of his output involved reposting far-right activist accounts or replying to them with brief endorsements such as a bullseye emoji, implying agreement. On 10 January, Musk replied “yes” in reply to a post from a white nationalist account that claimed “race communism that destroyed Rhodesia and South Africa are the same things they are bringing to America and the rest of the Occident to turn us into the Global Favela”. The author of the post previously published a blog titled How To Build An American Orania – a reference to the privately owned, whites-only town of Orania in South Africa.\n\nSimilar interactions took place throughout the month. After a far-right influencer posted “they just want to eradicate White people it’s that simple” in reference to the New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration speech, Musk replied on 7 January “some people really do”. On 9 January, he wrote “true” in a quote-tweet of a post that claimed white people would be “slaughtered” as a minority and that “White solidarity is the only way to survive”. On 16 January, Musk reposted a rightwing influencer’s post claiming “white genocide is the official Democrat party platform”. The same day, he promoted another rightwing influencer’s anti-diversity post that used an AI-generated image of tattooed black women on Yale’s rowing team.\n\nWhile some of the accounts Musk interacted with are fringe social media influencers, several others are prominent far-right activists whose extremist views have been well-documented. On 17 January, Musk reposted a screed against “ethno-cultural upheaval” in Europe from Martin Sellner, far-right Austrian activist, who is the founder of the ethno-nationalist Identitarian Movement. Musk, who reinstated Sellner’s banned X account in 2024, replied to the anti-immigration post that “this is simply a statement of fact”.\n\n“Martin Sellner is probably the most significant global white supremacist right now,” Beirich said. “He’s the one who pushed the great replacement, and has now pushed the idea of remigration – ethnically cleansing western countries of non-whites.”\n\nSellner gave a presentation in 2024 at an event in Germany on the logistics of carrying out mass deportations that was attended by neo-Nazis and other extremists. The event sparked immense backlash and protests against the far-right across the northern European nation. Lawmakers attempted to ban him from the country. The Austrian activist also received a €1,500 donation from and communicated with white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, who would later go on to commit a terrorist attack in 2019 that killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\n Sellner rejected being described as a white supremacist and said he respects “the dignity of all others” in a statement to the Guardian, while taking credit for politically mainstreaming the concepts of the great replacement and remigration. “Now, from Trump to Musk, everyone is talking about replacement migration, the ethnic vote and remigration,” Sellner said. He additionally claimed that the Potsdam event was “misrepresented” by media and that he rejected any form of terrorism. Sellner described his interactions with Tarrant, which included offering to get a drink with Tarrant if he ever visited Austria, as limited to standard thank-you emails to a donor.\n\nExtremism experts said the ideas Musk has publicized are deeply tied to some of the most notorious, violent extremist attacks of the past decade, including the 2018 antisemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the 2022 racist mass killing of 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket. The shooter in Buffalo left a 180-page manifesto filled with mentions of white supremacist replacement theory.\n\nMusk’s posts also reflect an increasing embrace of white supremacist figures and talking points among prominent Republicans and government agencies in the past year. Some of that shift has played out on X, where Musk reinstated a number of formerly banned accounts such as prominent antisemite Nick Fuentes. Federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security have meanwhile posted content that aligns with white supremacist propaganda. Earlier this month, Donald Trump also drew widespread backlash after posting a racist video to his Truth Social platform that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nMusk has repeatedly mocked those who have criticized his comments as far-right or racist, framing his views as common sense or simply reiterating facts and statistics. His rhetoric reflects a widespread tactic among people on the far-right, experts say, when extremists attempt to defend their worldview of an in-group of white people against everyone else.\n\n“That reductionist worldview breaks down when people in your in-group say you’re full of it, that what you’re saying is wrong,” Braniff said. “So now the main requirement is to attack the dissenting in-group, to delegitimize them as race traitors and as woke.”\n\nAs February began, Musk was still posting about race and immigration on a consistent basis. He replied to an anti-immigrant activist this week who claimed that Ireland’s civilization would end “because Irish men are afraid of being called racist and upsetting people from the 3rd world”.\n\n“Such men are pathetic traitors,” Musk responded.",

The all-hands was later posted on X on Wednesday.\n\nFrom a plan to build a catapult, or mass driver, on the moon to soothing nerves after the restructuring, here are the main takeaways from xAI's latest all-hands meeting.\n\nThere are now only six members left of an original founding team of 12 at xAI, following two more exits earlier this week.\n\nMusk addressed the new restructuring.\n\n\"Because we've reached a certain scale, we're organizing the company to be more effective at this scale,\" said Musk. \"Now, naturally, when this happens, there are some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.\"\n\nOn Monday, Tony Wu announced his resignation in a post on X, writing that it was \"time for my next chapter.\" Less than 24 hours later, fellow cofounder Jimmy Ba followed suit, posting that Tuesday was his last day and thanking Musk for \"bringing us together on this incredible journey.\"\n\nMusk is promising the moon, literally.\n\n\"Ultimately, we see a path to maybe launching as much as a terawatt per year of compute from earth, but what if you want to go beyond a mere terawatt per year?\" said Musk. \"In order to do that, you have to go to the moon.\"\n\nHis goal is to launch AI sattelites from the moon, he told employees.\n\n\"I can't imagine anything more epic than a mass driver on the moon and a self-sustaining city on the moon, and then going beyond the moon to Mars, going throughout our solar system, and ultimately being out there among the stars and visiting all these star systems,\" Musk added. \"Maybe we'll meet aliens.\"\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai is also researching the feasability of data centers in space, citing limited resources on Earth, such as water and electricity. Data centers are already facing backlash for driving up utility costs for average households.\n\nA stand-alone app for XChat and a new transaction app called X Money are coming in the next few months, according to Musk.\n\nDuring the all-hands meeting, Musk said that users who only want to use the messaging function could use the standalone XChat app without visiting the X platform. He said the app will also be on desktop and can handle multi-user video calls.\n\n\"For XMoney, we actually had XMoney live in closed beta within the company, and we expect in the next month or two to go to a limited external beta and then to go worldwide to all X users,\" said Musk.\n\n\"And this is really intended to be the place where all the money is, the central source of all monetary transactions,\" Musk added. \"So it's really going to be a game changer.\"",

IMO, all AI labs are building the exact same thing, and it's boring. I think there's room for more creativity,\" he wrote, adding that he was starting \"something new.\"\n\nKazemi joined xAI last year and, before that, worked at OpenAI.

    "description": "Last year, Musk said \"the moon is a distraction.\" Now, he's talking about building a city there. The shift may be more strategic than it sounds.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has long framed SpaceX's mission in sweeping terms: to send humans to Mars and make humans interplanetary.\n\nAlong the way, the moon has played an inconsistent supporting role.\n\nSpaceX is under contract with NASA, for example, to send people to the moon, and that funding plays a key role in some of SpaceX's major projects. However, Musk's main messaging for years has been to build cities on Mars, not the moon.\n\nOn Sunday, that messaging seemed to take a hard 180.\n\n\"For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,\" Musk wrote on X. \"The mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to the stars.\"\n\n\"The overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster,\" Musk added.\n\nThe latest from Musk has sparked debate on forums about whether he has changed his mind about the moon. A closer look at his statements over the years suggests a more nuanced picture.\n\nMusk has simultaneously had his eyes on missions to both the moon and Mars, but has treated lunar missions as a shorter-term objective within his broader push toward Mars.\n\nThat reframing was most explicit in the Sunday post on X, where Musk said SpaceX would prioritize building lunar infrastructure before sending people to Mars.\n\n\"It is only possible to travel to Mars when the planets align every 26 months (six month trip time), whereas we can launch to the Moon every 10 days (2 day trip time). This means we can iterate much faster to complete a Moon city than a Mars city,\" Musk wrote. \"That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years.\"\n\nFor those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years. \n\nThe mission of SpaceX remains the same: extend consciousness and life as we know it to…\n\nThe message also echoed language from an internal SpaceX memo on February 2 that announced the company's acquisition of Musk's AI startup, xAI.\n\nThe science nerd-coded memo described futuristic plans such as extending \"the light of consciousness to the stars,\" floating AI-generating data centers — and permanent lunar bases that weren't on Earth.\n\nBoth the memo and Musk's recent post came roughly a year after he appeared to dismiss some lunar missions as a \"distraction,\" writing that SpaceX was \"going straight to Mars.\"\n\nNo, we’re going straight to Mars. The Moon is a distraction.\n\nMass to orbit is the key metric, thereafter mass to Mars surface. The former needs to be in the megaton to orbit per year range to build a self-sustaining colony on Mars.\n\nIn his 2025 post, Musk said the key constraint to building on Mars is how much payload you can routinely launch into orbit.\n\nHe has repeatedly argued that long-term moon exploration could help. But ultimately, Musk's past quotes suggest he wants moon missions to push momentum toward the peak goal of establishing a Mars colony.\n\nPublic statements dating back to at least 2017 also show Musk making a distinction between limited activity on the moon and a full-scale human civilization on Mars.\n\nIt is high time that humanity went beyond Earth. Should have a moon base by now and sent astronauts to Mars. The future needs to inspire. https://t.co/6HjDQnRSA5\n\nWhat has seemingly changed is SpaceX's timeline for reaching the red planet.\n\nThe company has repeatedly missed self-imposed deadlines for reaching Mars. Now, the intra-planetary timeline appears bound to be even more prolonged.\n\nMusk — who has admitted he can be overly optimistic when it comes to timelines — initially said SpaceX would fly humans to the red planet by 2024. In 2021, he pushed that timeline back to 2026. Now, he's saying SpaceX would have to wait until at least 2030 for its first Mars mission — if the lunar city is successful.\n\nAt the same time, SpaceX is under contractual pressure from the government to reach the moon.\n\nIn 2021, NASA hired the company to develop a reusable version of its Starship vehicle capable of ferrying astronauts to the moon as part of the Artemis program. Those contracts, worth billions of dollars, helped fund Starship's development.\n\nNASA expects the SpaceX-built rocket will take off for the moon's South Pole in 2028, according to the agency's website.\n\nStarship can enable a permanently crewed science station on the Moon, which would be super cool!\n\nMoonbase Alpha!!\n\nOverall, what looks like a change in philosophy might actually be a doubling down on SpaceX's initial plans to fly to the moon and Mars. Details for those missions may just be coming years later than initially expected.\n\nMusk, who plans to launch data centers in space, has also talked about the manufacturing opportunity that the moon represents.\n\n\"The biggest opportunity on the moon is to make solar cells and radiators, and then, you're manufacturing on the moon anything that weighs a lot, chips maybe still come from Earth, they weigh very little,\" Musk said during a December 30 X Spaces conversation.\n\n\"And then you can use a mass driver to put a billion tons of AI powered satellites into orbit per year. You could set a scale to 100 terawatts of AI compute per year from the moon,\" he added.\n\nSpaceX, which is preparing for a possible 2026 IPO and recently acquired Musk's AI company, xAI, is looking to scale up its compute resources to power increasingly powerful AI models. Musk has argued that space offers a more attractive medium to build out data centers than the Earth.\n\nMusk also suggested earlier this week that SpaceX would build a \"system that allows anyone to travel to the moon,\" without providing more details.\n\nMusk has previously said he'd like to travel to Mars — and possibly die on the planet. \"Just not on impact,\" he joked.",

The post on Monday appeared to be a nod to the tortoise-and-hare fable, framing Blue Origin as the slow-and-steady contender and SpaceX as the faster but more distracted rival.\n\nMusk and Bezos have been rivals for years, frequently clashing over their space ambitions at SpaceX and Blue Origin, as well as over their fortunes.\n\nAfter long touting Mars as SpaceX's main destination, Musk said on Sunday that the company has shifted its focus to the moon.\n\n\"For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,\" he wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the moon is faster,\" he added.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that SpaceX told investors it is targeting March 2027 for an uncrewed landing on the moon.\n\nIn a separate post on X, Musk said on Sunday that SpaceX would \"continue to launch directly from Earth to Mars while possible, rather than moon to Mars.\"\n\n\"Fuel is relatively scarce on the moon,\" Musk added.\n\nMusk previously said SpaceX would send an uncrewed mission to Mars by the end of 2026.\n\n\"No, we're going straight to Mars. The moon is a distraction,\" he said in January last year in response to a post on X.\n\nMusk is known for rolling out bold timelines for projects such as electric vehicles — only to revise or abandon them later.\n\nBezos has long emphasised the moon as humanity's next destination, and has taken aim at Musk's push to colonize Mars.\n\n\"Go live on the top of Mount Everest for a year first and see if you like it, because it's a garden paradise compared to Mars,\" Bezos said in 2019.\n\nDuring a presentation for project Blue Moon, Bezos included a slide about Mars with the title \"FAR, FAR AWAY,\" referencing SpaceX's Mars ambition.\n\nBlue Origin said previously it aimed to reach the moon by 2023 — a target it did not meet.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk fired back after an X user said the US government \"throws money at him\" and his companies while receiving little in return.\n\nThe funny part about that clown’s analysis is that even if every bit of bullshit he says is true, it still amounts to less than 1% of the value of Tesla and SpaceX 🤣🤣\n\nThe X user shared a chart from a Washington Post investigation last year, which found that Musk's companies have received upward of $38 billion in government contracts, loans, subsidies, and tax credits since 2003. Musk did not respond to the investigation at the time.\n\n\"The funny part about that clown's analysis is that even if every bit of bullshit he says is true, it still amounts to less than 1% of the value of Tesla and SpaceX,\" Musk responded on X on Sunday, followed by two crying-laughing emojis. \"Where did the other 99% come from?\"\n\nTesla has a market capitalization of around $1.5 trillion. SpaceX is reportedly planning to go public at a similar valuation later this year.\n\nMusk's retort comes at a time of intense scrutiny of the tech billionaire, his companies, and their reliance on government support. Tesla is facing fresh questions over the feasibility of Musk's vision of self-driving cars and humanoid robots as its core auto business continues to slow. Meanwhile, SpaceX has moved to acquire Musk's AI company, xAI.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Musk replied to another user who wrote that Starlink \"already produces massive cash\" and \"Elon doesn't need military money.\"\n\n\"True. I love NASA, but they will only be ~5% of SpaceX revenue this year,\" Musk wrote. \"Vast majority of SpaceX revenue is the commercial Starlink system.\"\n\nThe world's richest man later replied \"yes\" to a post saying the US government contracts with Musk because he's the \"most efficient vendor\" and saves the government money.\n\n\"SpaceX won the NASA contracts by doing a better job for less money,\" Musk said in a X post last July. \"Moving those contracts to other aerospace companies would leave astronauts stranded and taxpayers on the hook for twice as much!\"\n\nNASA relies heavily on SpaceX for transport to the International Space Station and for key elements of its moon-exploration program, Artemis. The Department of Defense taps Musk's rocket company for tasks such as satellite launches.\n\nAs an electric-vehicle manufacturer, Tesla earns regulatory credits that it sells to other automakers so they can comply with emissions standards and other requirements. Revenue from those accounted for about $2 billion last year.\n\nIn recent years, Musk has taken aim at government subsidies, saying that mature companies shouldn't receive them and public funds are better used elsewhere. His Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cut support programs such as renewable energy incentives last year.",

    "fullText": "Raj Jegannathan, who was once tasked with managing Tesla's sales and service team in North America, announced his departure from the company on Monday.\n\nJegannathan, Tesla's vice president of IT, took over the sales organization shortly after Troy Jones, the former vice president of North America sales and service, left the company in July. During his time on the team, Jegannathan worked to incorporate more AI tools in sales and service team workflows, five people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.\n\n\"A comprehensive end-to-end understanding of the business has been essential—enabling the team to harness AI effectively to achieve meaningful outcomes across products and customer support,\" Jegannathan wrote on LinkedIn on Monday.\n\nThe executive, who reported directly to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, left the company over the weekend, a person with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider. Jegannathan has not been active on internal company systems since late January, and he has not worked closely with the sales team for a few months, people with knowledge of the issue said.\n\nPrior to taking over leadership of the sales team, Jegannathan worked in engineering and IT, rather than sales. He has worked at Tesla for over 13 years. Shortly after he took the reins, he became known for responding to sales and service requests on X.\n\nJegannathan has led the company through a tumultuous sales period. Tesla reported in January that its delivery numbers fell for the second year in a row. The carmaker reported a 16% year-over-year decline in deliveries during the quarter. Jegannathan led the sales efforts while Musk worked with the federal government as a part of the Department of Government Efficiency, before the organization was dismantled.\n\nSeveral of Musk's direct reports have left the company over the past year. One of Musk's top lieutenants, Omead Afshar, parted ways with the carmaker in June, and Milan Kovac, the head of Tesla's robotics division, left the company that same month.\n\nTesla and Jegannathan did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "fullText": "California still has it over Texas in at least one key way, Elon Musk says: Hiring.\n\nAfter moving the headquarters of SpaceX and Tesla Inc. to Texas in recent years because of politics, he said it’s still easier to recruit employees to work in California. With one exception.\n\n“Austin, it helps,” Musk said — while noting that Tesla still has most of its engineering capacity in California. “Getting engineers to move … I call it the significant other problem.”\n\nThat’s what makes engineering recruiting toughest at Starbase, the remote South Texas outpost where SpaceX is developing its Starship mega-rocket.\n\n“For Starbase that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low,” Musk said. “It’s quite difficult. It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”\n\nSpouses, he said, are often unwilling to relocate to the isolated area.\n\nMusk companies also have operations in Robstown McGregor, Bastrop and elsewhere across the state.\n\nHe disclosed the issues on the Cheeky Pint podcast during a chat in which he also accused tech giant Apple Inc. of trying to poach Tesla’s talent when that company was working on its own self-driving electric car, a project it later scrapped.\n\n“They were carpet bombing Tesla with recruiting calls,” Musk said. He claimed their opening offer would be roughly double the compensation at Tesla, indicating what he referred to as a “Tesla pixie dust” factor, in which other companies assume if they could hire someone from Tesla, the employee would put them on track to success.\n\n“When we had the pixie dust problem, we would get relentlessly recruited from,” Musk said. “Also, Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it’s easier for people to just… They don’t have to change their life very much. Their commute’s going to be the same.”\n\nREAD NEXT: Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein had closer ties than disclosed, newly released files show\n\nJohn Collison, co-founder of Stripe and podcast host, asked Musk how he guards against poachers. Musk said there’s not much that can stop it.\n\nMusk has long been trying to draw tech talent to Texas, with a renewed push after last week’s announcement that SpaceX acquired xAI. Days after giving notice of the plan, Michael Nicolls, vice president of Starlink engineering, said the SpaceX-owned satellite company is hiring for critical engineering roles to develop technologies for AI satellites in space at the company’s facilities in Austin and Seattle.",

    "fullText": "SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI creates business worth $1.25tn but whether premise behind deal will work is questioned\n\nThe acquisition of xAI by SpaceX is a typical Elon Musk deal: big numbers backed by big ambition.\n\nAs well as extending “the light of consciousness to the stars”, as Musk described it, the transaction creates a business worth $1.25tn (£920bn) by combining Musk’s rocket company with his artificial intelligence startup. It values SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, with a stock market flotation expected in June to time with Musk’s birthday and a planetary alignment.\n\nHowever, there are questions over the deal, such as whether it is good for SpaceX’s non-Musk shareholders and whether the technological premise behind it can succeed.\n\nFor Musk, a key part of the deal’s rationale is to move datacentres – the central nervous system of AI tools – into space.\n\nAI companies are too dependent on earth-bound datacentres that carry immense energy demands, Musk argued this week. The solution, he says, is to put as many as a million satellites into orbit to form vast, solar-powered datacentres.\n\nProf Julie McCann and Prof Matthew Santer, the co-directors of the school of convergence science in space, security and telecoms at Imperial College London, say solar-powered datacentres could be a future option for AI companies. However, there are limits to how much compute power can be mustered by current satellites, they say, so it would need a “planet-wide distributed computer composed of many satellites” – as envisioned by Musk.\n\nBut even executing the concept might be affected by the quality of connection between the orbiting devices, which will need to operate in tandem in order to replicate terrestrial datacentres as they beam their outputs down to Earth.\n\nThere are other problems to be ironed out, they add, including solar radiation and maintenance. “Datacentres on earth are constantly maintained – component failure is normal. Shipping components to space is complex and expensive, and you would have to be innovative regarding how components are fitted.”\n\nMusk talks of these datacentres adding 100 gigawatts of AI capacity annually – current global datacentre capacity is about 59GW – so his vision is ambitious. The world’s richest person believes a merger of rocket hardware and AI software is a winning combination and, in a message to employees, said it would create the “most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth”.\n\n“This merger is aimed at creating a new path to generate a low cost of generating AI compute within the next two to three years by bringing together the top internet/space exploration company with top datacentre builders,” says Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial services company Wedbush Securities.\n\nMusk’s artificial intelligence company, xAi, is competing with rivals who are spending, and raising, huge sums on the infrastructure – datacentres, computer chips – needed for their products. The company, which has developed the Grok AI tool and also owns the social media network X, reportedly burned through $13bn last year and, unlike Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, does not have a cash-generating legacy business to fund its efforts.\n\nCombining with SpaceX will give xAI better access to cash and investors, according to Ross Gerber, an investor in Tesla and SpaceX.\n\n“Musk is already running low on capital for xAI and it is competing with companies putting hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI investments. If you merge SpaceX and xAI you can support xAi because SpaceX is an extremely attractive prospect to a lot of investors,” he says.\n\nSpaceX’s technology is complex but it is a straightforward business. It generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service. SpaceX made about $8bn in profit on $15bn to $16bn of revenue ​last year, according to Reuters.\n\nThe addition of xAI adds narrative complexity to the SpaceX story, says Michael Sobel, the president and co-founder of Scenic Management, which buys secondary stakes in privately held companies and has invested in the AI company Anthropic.\n\nSobel, who speaks to SpaceX investors regularly, says: “By folding in xAI, which carries a significant monthly cash burn, you change the financial profile of the company overnight. In the secondary market, ‘simple’ is usually rewarded. This merger requires investors to do a lot more homework on how xAI’s cash burn impacts SpaceX’s overall valuation and IPO timeline.”\n\nThere is also the added burden of X, a social media platform that is a regular subject of regulatory scrutiny and political ire.\n\nNonetheless, Sobel adds, the argument in favour of the deal is compelling.\n\n“For a long-term investor, this secures the most advanced AI ‘brain’ for the most advanced hardware ‘body’ in existence. The upside is a $1.25tn entity that controls the entire stack, from the launchpad to the neural network.”\n\nGerber, who invested in Musk’s original buyout of X in 2022 when the platform was better known as Twitter, says he welcomes the deal but is less sure about SpaceX investors.\n\n“For me as a Twitter shareholder, I could not be happier. I pretty much figured I had lost my money but that has now been parlayed into owning SpaceX shares. It’s awesome for me but if I was a SpaceX shareholder I would be pissed.”\n\nMusk owns about 44% of the newly enlarged SpaceX business and 17% of Tesla, where he is the chief executive. Is the next step a combination of the two?\n\nIves believes there is a “growing chance” that a one-stop shop for investing in Musk businesses will be created.  “Musk wants to own and control more of the AI ecosystem and step by step the holy grail could be combining SpaceX and Tesla,” he says.\n\nGerber believes the timing is right, with both companies currently worth $1.25tn. “This is the time to create a multitrillion-dollar company. I know Elon. It’s going to happen,” he says.",

    "title": "SpaceX is hiring to turn Elon Musk's plan for data centers in space a reality",
    "description": "Elon Musk believes that space is the answer to the AI data center energy problem. SpaceX says it is hiring \"many engineers\" to make it happen.",
    "fullText": "To the world's richest man, all things eventually end in outer space.\n\nAs countries pour billions into new Earth-bound data centers in a global race for AI dominance, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk thinks the best way to conserve energy, money, and space is to put data centers in, well, space.\n\n\"In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,\" Musk wrote in a memo announcing that SpaceX would acquire his AI company, xAI, earlier this month.\n\nSpaceX says its goal is to launch a \"constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers,\" and it's now hiring to make it happen. Each will generate about 100 kW of compute power per ton and would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, the company says.\n\nLike many of Musk's ambitious ideas, some have questioned the viability of this one. Musk, typically, is undeterred. He doubled down on the plan this week on the Dwarkesh Podcast.\n\n\"You can mark my words. In 36 months, but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,\" Musk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said. \"It will then get ridiculously better to be in space.\"\n\nDwarkesh Patel, the host of the eponymous long-form tech podcast (he interviewed Musk for nearly three hours), challenged the SpaceX CEO on his plan to build data centers in space.\n\nPatel said energy use is only about 10% to 15% of the total cost of operating a data center, so while planting data centers in space would solve the cost-of-energy problem, the cost of maintenance and servicing them would presumably erase any savings.\n\nMusk said the plan was not about saving money on energy consumption, but about ensuring energy availability.\n\n\"If you look at electrical output outside of China, everywhere outside of China, it's more or less flat,\" Musk replied. \"If you're putting data centers anywhere except China, where are you going to get your electricity?\"\n\nData centers are resource-intensive.\n\nThe largest can consume as much power as a city and up to several million gallons of water a day. Collectively, Business Insider estimated in an investigation published last year, that US data centers could soon consume more electricity than Poland, with a population of 36.6 million, used in 2023.\n\nBusiness Insider's investigation found that companies had filed permits to build 311 data centers nationwide as of 2010. By the end of 2024, that number had nearly quadrupled to 1,240.\n\nAs of 2023, about 4.4% of total US electricity consumption came from data centers, according to the Department of Energy. Globally, data centers accounted for about 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nMcKinsey and Company estimates that by 2030, data centers will require $6.7 trillion in investment worldwide to keep pace with demand for computing power.\n\nThe need for data centers is driving enormous spending among the big AI companies. Capital expenditures for Big Tech are expected to reach some $600 billion in 2026, with Amazon alone planning to spend $200 billion.\n\nSpaceX has already started hiring for its space-based data center project.\n\nMichael Nicolls, the vice president of Starlink Engineering, wrote in a post on X on Friday that the company is hiring for \"many critical engineering roles\" to develop space-bound data centers. One of them is for a \"Space Lasers Engineer\" based out of Redmond, Washington.\n\nLocating data centers in space might appeal to the communities, like Northern Virginia, where electricity costs are growing and housing developments are vying with data centers for land.\n\nFor Musk, the idea is simple. \"I mean, space is called 'space' for a reason,\" he wrote in SpaceX's memo.\n\nSpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

In a November appearance on Nikhil Kamath's \"People by WTF\" podcast, he said the pursuit of money alone was unlikely to bring fulfillment.\n\n\"Aim to make more than you take. Be a net contributor to society,\" Musk said, adding that wealth tends to follow naturally when people focus on building useful products and services — rather than chasing money for its own sake.",

Just believe your interaction. The résumé may seem very impressive, and it's like, 'Wow, the résumé looks good.' But if the conversation after 20 minutes is not \"Wow,\" you should believe the conversation, not the paper,\" he said.\n\nHe said he's made other mistakes, too. \"My batting average is still not perfect, but it's very high,\" he said. That includes the times he's discounted certain personality traits.\n\n\"I think it's a good idea to hire for talent and drive and trustworthiness,\" he said. \"And I think goodness of heart is important. I underweighted that at one point. So, are they a good person? Trustworthy? Smart and talented and hard working? If so, you can add domain knowledge.\"\n\nMusk said that it takes a lot to truly impress him.\n\n\"The things I ask for are bullet points for evidence of exceptional ability.\"\n\nThe examples \"can be pretty off the wall,\" but he's looking for evidence of something truly great.\n\n\"If somebody can cite even one thing, but let's say three things, where you go, 'Wow, wow, wow,' then that's a good sign,\" he said.\n\nWhen companies like Tesla are successful, Musk said, their competitors take notice and do everything they can to poach top talent.\n\n\"Tesla had a further challenge where when Tesla had very successful periods, we would be relentlessly recruited from,\" he said. \"Like, relentlessly.\"\n\nMusk said when Apple had its own electric car program, recruiters for the tech giant were \"carpet bombing\" Tesla employees to the point that some engineers just unplugged their phones. (In 2024, Apple reportedly abandoned its secretive car program.)\n\n\"Their opening offer without any interview would be like double the compensation at Tesla. So we had a bit of the 'Tesla pixie dust' thing where it's like, 'Oh, if you hire a Tesla executive, suddenly everything's going to be successful,'\" he said.\n\nSome former employees have complained about Musk's management style. During the interview, the Tesla CEO joked about his reputation as a micro manager, insisting that it be called \"Nano management, please.\" Musk said that, in reality, he now doesn't have enough time to oversee every aspect of his sprawling empire.\n\nUltimately, though, Musk said he just wants one thing.\n\n\"If somebody gets things done, I love them, and if they don't, I hate them,\" he said. \"So it's pretty straightforward.

The problem is most acute at SpaceX's south Texas launch site and headquarters, known as Starbase.\n\n\"I call it the 'significant other' problem,\" Musk said during a nearly three-hour interview with tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel and Stripe's cofounder John Collison that was posted on Thursday. \"For Starbase, that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low.\"\n\nStarbase — where SpaceX has built and tested its rockets since 2019 — is situated in a sparsely populated area of Texas, close to the US‑Mexico border. It's located across from the largely undeveloped Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThe campus is roughly a 40‑minute drive from Brownsville, the nearest city, according to Google Maps. Brownsville has a population of around 187,000, based on the most recent US Census data.\n\nThat remoteness marks a sharp contrast with SpaceX's former headquarters in El Segundo, California, which is minutes from Los Angeles and part of one of the country's largest job markets.\n\n\"It's like a technology monastery thing,\" Musk said about Starbase. \n\"Remote and mostly dudes.\"\n\nTesla, which moved its headquarters from California to Austin in 2021, faces a similar — though less severe — challenge, Musk said.\n\nThe automaker's campus, called Giga Texas, is a roughly 30-minute drive from downtown Austin, where nearly 1 million people live. Plus, while Tesla's top executives have largely moved to Texas, the electric car company still maintains several robotics, energy, and manufacturing operations in California.\n\n\"Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it's easier for people to just... They don't have to change their life very much. Their commutes are going to be the same,\" he said. \"Tesla still has a majority of its engineering in California.\"\n\nMusk, who has predicted Austin will be \"the biggest boomtown that America has seen in 50 years,\" has made moves to build out his company campuses, including a company town called \"Snailbrook\" near The Boring Company and SpaceX.",

    "description": "In a recent interview, Elon Musk says that in a world of mass-produced AI and robotics, money and saving for retirement will be pointless.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is now openly questioning whether saving for retirement will even make sense in the future, and he’s tying that view directly to how fast he believes AI and robotics will dismantle today’s labor market.\n\nIn a wide-ranging discussion about artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX/xAI CEO Musk laid out a timeline that would upend decades of economic assumptions. In his view, the first wave is already underway: white-collar work. Lawyers, accountants, analysts, marketers, coders, and other jobs long considered “safe” because they were cognitive rather than physical, are, he argues, the most immediately vulnerable to AI systems that can reason, write, analyze, and iterate at superhuman speed.\n\nNvidia May Not Invest $100 Billion in OpenAI After All. Is That a Bad Sign for NVDA Stock?\n\nA Potential Sentiment Mismatch Makes Rocket Lab (RKLB) Stock Options an Enticing Proposition\n\nWhy Needham Warns That Meta Platforms Stock Could Be Headed for 10%-15% Downside\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. \n\nBlue-collar work comes next. Musk believes humanoid robots, paired with increasingly capable AI models, will replace much of physical labor shortly after. Manufacturing, logistics, construction, and even service work would eventually follow. His estimate for this transition is strikingly aggressive: three to seven years.\n\nThe end result, Musk argues, isn’t mass deprivation, but abundance. If AI and robots can produce goods and services at near-zero marginal cost, then scarcity collapses. Food, housing, transportation, energy, and manufactured goods all become dramatically cheaper. Productivity explodes, not because humans are working harder, but because machines are doing nearly all of the work.\n\nThat’s where Musk’s idea of “universal high income” comes in, a phrase he’s used before to distinguish his view from traditional universal basic income. This isn’t a modest government stipend meant to keep people afloat. It’s a world where the cost of living drops so sharply that most people can afford a high standard of living regardless of whether they hold a conventional job.\n\nIn that context, he made a statement that cuts directly against decades of financial planning orthodoxy.\n\n“One side recommendation I have,” Musk said, “is don’t worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years. It won’t matter. You won’t need to save for retirement. If any of the things we’ve said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant.”",

    "fullText": "A number of countries including Australia are investigating X over Grok-produced sexualised deepfakes\n\nFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updates\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nThe eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, says global regulatory focus on Elon Musk’s X has reached a “tipping point” after a raid of the company’s offices in France this week.\n\nThe raid on Tuesday was part of an investigation that included alleged offences of complicity in the possession and organised distribution of child abuse images, violation of image rights through sexualised deepfakes, and denial of crimes against humanity.\n\nA number of other countries – including the UK and Australia – and the EU have launched investigations in the past few weeks into X after its AI chatbot, Grok, was used to mass-produce sexualised images of women and children in response to user requests.\n\nInman Grant told Guardian Australia: “It’s nice to no longer be a soloist, and be part of a choir.\n\n“We’ve been having so many productive discussions with other regulators around the globe and researchers that are doing important work in this space,” she said.\n\n“I think this really represents a tipping point. This is global condemnation of carelessly developed technology that could be generating child sexual abuse material and non-consensual, sexual imagery at scale.”\n\nAfter the outcry, X turned off Grok image-generation for all but paid users, and vowed to make changes to prevent users from declothing real people.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe moves against X came ahead of the eSafety commissioner’s latest report, released on Thursday, which examines how tech platforms are preventing child sexual abuse and exploitation on their platforms.\n\nNotices were issued to Apple, Discord, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Skype and WhatsApp in July 2024 that required six-monthly updates from the platforms. The Microsoft-owned Skype no longer exists.\n\nInman Grant said there had been some improvements from the platforms, including detection of known child abuse material and prevention of livestreaming of abuse outside messaging apps, but the platforms still fell short.\n\nApple, which Inman Grant said had previously viewed privacy and safety as being mutually exclusive, had come the farthest.\n\n“[Apple is] really putting an investment … and engaging and developing their communication safety features and evolving those.”\n\nIn 2024 the company began rolling out features to allow children to report nude images and video being sent to them directly to Apple, which could then report the messages to police.\n\nBut Inman Grant said there was still inadequate detection on FaceTime for live child abuse or exploitation. She levelled similar criticisms at Meta for Messenger, Google Meet, Snapchat, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp and Discord.\n\nA number of the services were not using language analysis to proactively detect sexual extortion, she said.\n\n“It’s surprising to me that they’re not attending to the services where the most egregious and devastating harms are happening to kids. It’s like they’re not totally weatherproofing the entire house. They’re putting up spackle on the walls and maybe taping the windows, but not fixing the roof.\n\n“It’s interesting to me to see how patchy their deployment of these safety technologies are.”\n\nImprovements included: Microsoft detecting known child abuse material on OneDrive and in email attachments in Outlook; Snap reducing the time to process reports of child abuse material from 90 minutes to 11 minutes; and Google launching sensitive content warnings that blur images of nudity before viewing.\n\nThe companies will be required to report to eSafety two more times – in March and August this year. Inman Grant said the transparency reports had opened the “black box” on what the companies were doing and would help with future investigations.\n\nX was not included in the notices, and challenged eSafety’s issuing of a similar notice in March 2024 in a case that is still ongoing.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk will have to sit for a deposition for lawyers to examine his role in dismantling USAID, a Maryland judge ruled.\n\nIn an eight-page order released on Tuesday, US District Judge Theodore Chuang rejected a request from Musk and officials linked to the Department of Government Efficiency to forgo a deposition.\n\nIt ordered him, along with former acting USAID director Peter Marocco and Department of State official Jeremy Lewin, to be deposed. Musk's legal team had tried to use the \"apex doctrine\" to avoid the deposition, a rule that allows high-ranking government officials to avoid depositions in some situations.\n\nThe deposition is part of a lawsuit against Musk and DOGE officials, filed by current and terminated USAID employees, who remain anonymous.\n\nChuang said that it was unclear whether Musk, Marocco, and Lewin were \"properly deemed to be high-ranking government officials.\"\n\nHe said most of the designated heads of the project were operating in informal or acting roles during the time when USAID was dismantled.\n\nIn the filing, Chuang added that Musk and the other officials failed to provide evidence as to why they chose to shut down the USAID headquarters and website, another reason the deposition was necessary.\n\nThe filing also listed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Kenneth Jackson, a state department official, and Amy Gleason, a DOGE administrator, as defendants in the case.\n\nUSAID, the US Agency for International Development, distributes foreign aid and supports humanitarian causes globally. It was the top target for Musk-led DOGE at the start of President Donald Trump's second term last January.\n\nUSAID cuts were part of Musk's efforts to slash spending on government agencies that DOGE deemed wasteful. In February last year, USAID officials announced that the agency would cut its staff from 10,000 to just 300, furloughing the rest.\n\nMusk stepped back from DOGE in May.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk, USAID, and the Department of State did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

His office did not respond to a request for clarification.\n\nLegislation to ban children under 15 from social media is passing through France’s parliament. Britain is also considering similar measures.\n\nSpain’s proposed regulation would give parents clear backing to set limits and would ease social pressure for children worried about missing out, said Diana Diaz, director of the ANAR Foundation for at-risk children and adolescents.\n\nThe recent explosion of AI-generated content, and public outcry over reports of Musk’s Grok AI chatbot generating non-consensual sexual images, including of minors, has fuelled debate over the risks of such online content.\n\nBut there was no unanimous agreement that social media harms adolescents, said Jose Cesar Perales, a professor in experimental psychology at the University of Granada.\n\nSanchez said prosecutors would explore ways to investigate possible legal infractions by Grok, as well as by TikTok and Instagram, part of Meta.\n\nThe proposed ban would be implemented as part of a change to an existing bill on digital protection for minors being debated in parliament, a government spokesperson said.\n\nAbout 82% of people in Spain said they believed children under 14 should be banned from social media, according to an Ipsos poll on education published in August last year. That was up from 73% in 2024.",

    "description": "Musk's memo announcing SpaceX and xAI's merger is full of space jargon. Here's your cheat sheet to bring the wonky language back down to Earth.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been shy about his inner nerd — just look at his SpaceX merger memo.\n\nOver the years, the billionaire has peppered his company communications with sci-fi culture Easter eggs, physics nerd jargon, and enough dad-joke flair to make comedian Nate Bargatze blush.\n\nSo it was no surprise that Musk's latest internal memo — announcing that SpaceX would merge with xAI — leaned into the kind of words and phrases that might cause you to scratch your head.\n\nIt reads less like a conventional corporate M&A announcement and more like a sci-fi manifesto, invoking \"sentient suns,\" orbital data centers, and humanity's destiny among the stars.\n\nForget \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" here is your hitchhiker's guide to Musk's memo.\n\nThe memo opens with a sci-fi banger, the kind of premise you'd find in a Hollywood script: Musk says his new vision for the combined company is to build a \"sentient sun.\"\n\nThe phrase is meant to convey scale. Musk is imagining an AI system so large, energy-hungry, and centralized that it metaphorically resembles a star. Except instead of radiating light and heat, this \"sun\" would beam computer-generated intelligence back to Earth.\n\nIt's a piece of sci-fi shorthand for extremely powerful, solar-fed AI.\n\nThis is where the memo goes full-on science nerd: \"Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization,\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk is referencing the Kardashev scale, a '60s framework created by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev that ranks civilizations by the amount of energy they can harness. A Type I civilization can use all the energy available on its home planet. A Type II civilization can capture the full power output of its star.\n\nHumanity today is generally thought to sit somewhere below Type I.\n\nHere, Musk is proposing to move massive computing infrastructure — the power-hungry data centers popping up in rural America to fuel modern AI — off Earth and into orbit. In other words, data centers in space.\n\nIn space, he argues, those systems could rely on near-constant solar energy. As Musk put it elsewhere in the memo: \"It's always sunny in space.\"\n\nSpaceX essentially wants to build a floating gas station. Here, Musk describes a dedicated tanker-to-ship bot expected to roll out in 2026, per SpaceNews.\n\nRight now, rockets carry all of their fuel right from takeoff. This system would allow the company's spacecraft to optimize for other storage cabins.\n\nMusk is essentially a giant railgun designed to launch cargo into space using electricity instead of rocket fuel. It's reminiscent of an instrument in the 1937 science fiction novel \"Zero to Eighty.\"\n\nSpaceX is imagining building one on Earth's Moon, where lower gravity and the lack of an atmosphere would make it easier to fling materials into space.\n\nMusk ends the memo with a linguistic flourish.\n\nIt isn't the first time Musk has used the phrase. In 2014, he launched a Montessori-style school for children from 3 to 9 with the same name. The school's curriculum focused on STEM learning and problem-solving, according to its mission statement.",

    "description": "Prosecutors’ announcement comes amid a hardening of European attitudes to social media...",
    "fullText": "Prosecutors’ announcement comes amid a hardening of European attitudes to social media firms\n\nProsecutors have raided the French headquarters of Elon Musk’s social media platform X and summoned the tech billionaire and the company’s former chief executive for questioning as part of an investigation into alleged cybercrime.\n\n“A search is under way by the cybercrime unit of the Paris prosecutor’s office, the national police cyber unit and Europol,” the Paris prosecutors’ office said in a post on X on Tuesday, adding that it would no longer be publishing on the network.\n\nIt said in a statement that Musk and Linda Yaccarino had been summoned for “voluntary questioning” in April in their capacity as “de facto and de jure managers of the X platform at the time of the events”. Yaccarino resigned as chief executive of X in July last year.\n\nThe French prosecutors’ announcement comes amid a hardening of European attitudes to social media giants. A senior source in the Greek government told Reuters on Tuesday the country was “very close” to announcing a social media ban for children aged under 15.\n\nIn Spain, where the government is preparing a series of measures including a social media ban for under-16s, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, promised to protect children from the “digital wild west” and hold tech companies responsible for hateful and harmful content.\n\nSánchez said on Tuesday that urgent action was needed because social media was a “failed state where laws are ignored and crimes are tolerated”.\n\nThe Paris raid is part of an investigation launched in January last year into the suspected abuse of algorithms and fraudulent data extraction, which the prosecutor’s office said it had widened to cover complaints about X’s artificial intelligence tool, Grok.\n\nIt said the alleged offences it was investigating now included complicity in the possession and organised distribution of child abuse images, violation of image rights through sexualised deepfakes, and denial of crimes against humanity.\n\nOther possible charges included fraudulent data extraction from, and falsified operation of, an automated data processing system by an organised group, and operation of an illegal online platform by an organised group, the statement said.\n\nFrench authorities launched the investigation after the centre-right MP Éric Bothorel filed a complaint alleging that biased algorithms on the platform were likely to have distorted its data processing system and affected the kind of content it recommended.\n\nBothorel complained of a “reduced diversity of voices” and Musk’s “personal interventions” in X’s management since he bought it in 2022. Another complaint said the changes had led to a surge in “nauseating political content”.\n\nProsecutors said in November that they were expanding the investigation to include the behaviour of Grok, which allegedly engaged in Holocaust denial, advancing false claims commonly made by people who deny Nazi Germany murdered 6 million Jews.\n\nThe chatbot has since caused outrage by allowing users to “strip” clothed people, including children, in photos through AI image generation and editing. The EU has launched an investigation into its production and dissemination of sexualised deepfakes of women and minors.\n\nX has been approached for comment on Tuesday’s raid. The company said last summer it did not intend to comply with French prosecutors’ demands, which it described as “politically motivated”, and denied all allegations against it.\n\nX said it believed the investigation was “distorting French law to serve a political agenda, and ultimately restrict free speech”. It said it was committed to “defending its fundamental rights, protecting user data and resisting political censorship”.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday that the investigation was being conducted as “part of a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French laws, insofar as it operates on national territory”.\n\nDespite being described as voluntary, the summonses issued to Musk and Yaccarino are mandatory, but they are hard to enforce on people outside France. Afterwards, authorities can potentially place suspects in custody.\n\nEuropol said it supported the investigation through its European cybercrime centre and deployed a specialist to Paris for the raid. “The investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offences linked to the functioning and use of the platform,” it said.\n\nThose included “the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity”, the pan-European policing organisation said, adding that it “stands ready to continue supporting the French authorities as the investigation progresses”.",

    "description": "“My estimate is that within two to three years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space,” Musk wrote in a post on SpaceX’s website on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX has acquired xAI, the artificial intelligence firm founded by Musk three years ago, in a massive, and unconventional, deal that combines the two privately held firms into a company with an astounding $1.25 trillion reported valuation and plans for a historic IPO this year.\n\nHow does Musk justify the $1.25 trillion valuation?\n\nHow do Tesla's investments complicate this deal?\n\nWhat are the space-based data center plans?\n\nWhat companies are involved in this SpaceX-xAI merger?\n\nMusk, who is the CEO of both companies as well as publicly traded electric vehicle and robotics company Tesla, described the combination as one that will “form the most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile-device communications, and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” he wrote in a blog post on SpaceX’s website.\n\nMusk cited the potential for space-based data centers, the energy-intensive computing facilities necessary to power AI services, as one of the most important benefits of the combination, even though the concept is still unproven and largely theoretical. “Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term,” Musk wrote in the blog post.\n\n“By directly harnessing near-constant solar power with little operating or maintenance costs, these satellites will transform our ability to scale compute,” Musk wrote.\n\nWhile reports of a potential deal emerged last week, the stratospheric value of the transaction and the swiftness with which it closed left many industry observers in awe, underscoring the massive expectations around AI as well as fears of an overheated market that could be due for a reckoning.\n\nAccording to reporting in Bloomberg, the deal between SpaceX and xAI will lead to a combined enterprise value of $1.25 trillion, with shares of xAI valued at $526.59 apiece. Musk has reportedly been hashing out the potential terms of a SpaceX IPO this year that would value the company at $800 billion, setting the stage for what could be the largest initial public offering of all time.\n\nRepresentatives from SpaceX and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk, the richest person in the world, has a documented history of mingling the financial interests of his businesses. In 2015, Tesla acquired Solar City, a solar energy company founded by Musk’s cousins and on whose board Musk served as chairman.\n\nAnd in March 2025, xAI acquired X, the Musk-owned social platform formerly known as Twitter, in a $33 billion, all-stock deal. “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk said at the time.\n\nMore recently, Tesla surprised shareholders just last month when it revealed that it had invested $2 billion in xAI in exchange for a batch of preferred stock as part of xAI’s $20 billion Series E funding round. That investment means Tesla shareholders now own preferred stock in a company that has become a subsidiary of SpaceX, which could raise questions from investors about Tesla’s role in funding xAI’s growth. In addition to the $2 billion investment, Tesla disclosed it sold $430 million of Megapack battery storage and systems to xAI in 2025, costing it $285 million, exhibiting the circular nature of Musk’s businesses.",

    "fullText": "Aerospace business and artificial intelligence firm to unite for IPO as world’s most valuable private company\n\nElon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence business xAI, in a $1.25tn (£910bn) merger that consolidates part of Musk’s empire as SpaceX prepares to go public later this year.\n\nThe two companies announced the deal on Monday in a statement on SpaceX’s website, saying the merger would form “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform”.\n\nSpaceX, one of the world’s most valuable private companies, will gain xAI properties such as its Grok chatbot and the social media platform X. The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to put datacenters and solar-powered satellites in space as a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.\n\nThe deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float is expected to be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.\n\nMusk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.\n\nThe announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.\n\n“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.\n\n“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”\n\nMusk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platform X in an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.\n\nBoth SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed an expected value of $800bn for the company.\n\nDespite widespread backlash to xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.\n\nSpeculation and leaks about the deal, first reported by Reuters, have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.\n\nThe news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week that showed declining revenues and a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showed Musk exchanging numerous friendly emails with the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.\n\nHe called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.",

The platform has faced huge backlash in recent months from politicians and regulators over the spread of sexual images of real people generated by xAI's chatbot Grok on the platform.\n\nLast month, the European Union said it had opened an investigation into the spread of illegal images, including possible child sexual abuse material, generated by Grok on X. The UK's media regulator announced a similar investigation earlier in January.\n\nX said last month that it had implemented technological measures to stop Grok from editing images of real people into revealing clothing.\n\nIn July last year, xAI apologized after Grok made antisemitic comments on X and praised Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe EU also hit X with a $140 million fine in December 2025 over the platform's infamous blue checkmark system, with the bloc said exposed users to scams.\n\nThe Paris Prosecutor's Office also said it would leave X and instead communicate on LinkedIn and Instagram.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Reid Hoffman are once again trading blows online after the latest release of the Epstein files.\n\nThe new round of bickering between Musk and the LinkedIn cofounder kicked off on Friday and lasted throughout the weekend, with the billionaires each lobbing criticism at each other over their inclusion in the Epstein files.\n\nNeither Musk nor Hoffman has been implicated in any wrongdoing related to their past ties to Epstein, who looms large in their social-media spat.\n\nTheir latest back-and-forth — the two have publicly criticized each other in recent years — appears to have started on Friday, when Musk reshared a post from Katie Miller that was critical of Hoffman. Hoffman fired back at Musk, posting a screenshot of his past remarks about Trump and the Epstein files.\n\nFrom there, the two have been duking it out on X over the documents released by the Justice Department on Friday related to Jeffrey Epstein — which revealed that Musk made plans to visit Epstein on multiple occasions, including on his infamous private island. (Musk has said he never visited the island).\n\n\"This is how I knew so long ago that Reid Hoffman went to Epstein's island,\" Musk captioned a screenshot of an email he received from Epstein in 2014.\n\n\"Epstein used Reid being there to try to get me to go, not realizing that it would have the opposite effect,\" he added.\n\nHoffman responded by criticizing Musk for \"making false accusations\" and lying about his involvement with Epstein instead of working to get justice for Epstein's victims.\n\n\"You lied about this to everyone for over a decade, and now your excuse (it's disgusting, by the way) is that you could get young girls without Epstein?\" Hoffman wrote. (Musk had written on Sunday that \"if I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein.\")\n\nGive us a break: If you cared about the victims as you say, you’d stop making false accusations to cover your ass and start using your $220m of influence with President Trump to get justice for the victims.\n\nInstead, you’re focused on comparing my visit fundraising for MIT to… https://t.co/51VgQ9Q9SY\n\nHoffman reshared X posts with documents that showed Musk's past email conversations with the disgraced financier. One post labeled Musk the \"surprise breakout star of the Epstein files.\"\n\nOne of the screenshots from the Epstein files that Hoffman shared showed a 2012 email where Musk asked Epstein, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"\n\nMusk pointed the finger back at Hoffman for his past correspondence with Epstein.\n\n\"Epstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. Not you though. You actually went,\" Musk said. \"What 'gifts' did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island?\"\n\nHoffman previously acknowledged he had visited Epstein's island, which he said was a part of fundraising efforts for MIT.\n\nEpstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. \n\nNot you though. You actually went. \n\nWhat “gifts” did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island? pic.twitter.com/0ATSIl3ojn\n\nMusk and Hoffman's feud dates back years.\n\nHoffman has previously characterized the beef as one-sided, starting in the years after Musk left OpenAI's board. Hoffman, who was an early donor to OpenAI, has said Musk has sour grapes over OpenAI's success after his departure.\n\n\"Well, so actually, it's more his beef with me for having made OpenAI successful with his departure,\" Hoffman said. \"Because he left saying, you know, 'You're all a bunch of jackasses and you'll fail,' and I helped them succeed.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO, who previously worked with Hoffman at PayPal, said Hoffman was among the billionaires who were \"terrified\" about Epstein's client list coming out in 2024.\n\nHoffman has since said that he'd faced threats after Musk's claims that resulted in him hiring security.\n\nAfter the latest release of the Epstein files detailed multiple emails between the Tesla CEO and Epstein, including Musk's assistant trying to coordinate a meeting with Epstein at SpaceX, Musk took to social media to say that he never \"set foot on his creepy island.\"",

    "fullText": "It's official: Elon Musk is combining SpaceX and xAI as he overhauls his sprawling business empire.\n\nMusk told workers in a Monday memo that SpaceX has acquired xAI, his AI company, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nSpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value the Starship maker at $1.5 trillion.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff, which the company later posted online, Musk also said that that the acquisition would allow the combined entity to launch data centers in space.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk expressed similar sentiments about building data centers in space during an all hands with xAI staff late last year.\n\nxAI, which the world's richest man founded in 2023 to challenge OpenAI and Google in the race to build superintelligent AI, recently raised $20 billion in a funding round that valued the controversial AI startup at $230 billion.\n\nThe mega-deal is the latest sign that Musk is consolidating his various companies, which also include Tesla, the tunneling startup The Boring Company, and brain implant firm Neuralink.\n\nIn March 2025, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter he bought in 2022. Meanwhile, SpaceX and Tesla have each invested $2 billion in xAI in recent months.\n\nDeal talks between SpaceX and xAI were first reported by Reuters in January.\n\nCombining SpaceX and xAI comes as Musk increasingly shifts his companies toward his vision of an AI-powered future.\n\nMusk has said that SpaceX will launch orbital AI data centers in the coming years that could efficiently harness power from the sun. Last Friday, SpaceX filed a request with the FCC to launch as many as one million satellites to serve as orbital data centers.\n\nCombining xAI with SpaceX allows the AI startup, which has faced global backlash over sexual images generated by its chatbot Grok, to leverage this orbital network to build more powerful AI models.\n\nIt also gives xAI access to significant capital. The OpenAI rival reportedly burned through billions of dollars in 2024, while SpaceX is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion in its IPO later this year.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "A handful of billionaires and prominent companies urged corporations to leave Delaware. According to the numbers, the opposite happened.",
    "fullText": "A handful of billionaires and prominent companies have tried to cement a new, less-than-ideal narrative about Delaware: The glory days are over.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Elon Musk, who previously had two companies incorporated in the state, wrote on X in 2024.\n\nHowever, dozens of X posts and interviews disparaging the state over its handling of certain legal cases haven't moved the needle. In fact, the opposite has happened: The number of companies incorporated in Delaware has increased.\n\n\"Amid fears of decline, 2025 was a period of monumental growth for Delaware,\" Andrew Verstein, the author of the Corporate Census, wrote in a recent report.\n\nThe Corporate Census is a database of nearly all entity formations in the United States, including traditional corporate registrations and alternative options such as LLCs.\n\nVerstein has spent almost two years collecting data on corporations and published an update to his research earlier this month.\n\nAlthough Delaware has a reputation as a business-friendly state, it faced a storm of bad press in 2024 and 2025 when some companies began to ditch the state for what they considered greener legal pastures. Musk, most prominently, removed Tesla and SpaceX's corporate registrations from Delaware after a judge voided his multibillion-dollar Tesla pay package.\n\nHe and some other prominent CEOs have criticized Delaware's courts over what they consider subjective rulings. Delaware's Supreme Court reinstated Musk's pay package in December, but not before some of Musk's peers joined his unofficial campaign.\n\nCompanies like the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and the leading crypto-exchange Coinbase followed suit, also citing uncertainty around Delaware's legal system as a factor in their departures, going so far as to urge others to do the same. The alleged exodus has been dubbed \"Dexit,\" a play on the words \"Delaware\" and \"exit.\"\n\nDespite the departures, Delaware is doing just fine.\n\n\"The short answer is that 'Dexit' isn't happening,\" Verstein told Business Insider.\n\nIn his report, Verstein wrote that Delaware's share of corporate formations increased sharply at the beginning of 2025. Delaware experienced an \"absolute increase,\" he wrote, meaning the growth was driven by new formations in Delaware rather than a decline in formations in other states.\n\n\"Instead, there is a clear increase in Delaware's relative popularity beginning in 2025, making it a singular leader in a period otherwise lacking corporate growth,\" Verstein wrote in the report. \"About 30% more Delaware corporations formed in 2025 than in 2024, greatly exceeding the prior trendline. This, while national incorporation levels remained flat.\"\n\nAt the moment, Verstein said the official cause of the formation boost isn't clear, but speculated on two theories. For one, Delaware implemented new laws to address some of the complaints from Musk and others. They strengthened corporate management's authority and altered shareholder rights.\n\n\"These laws were intended to restore confidence in Delaware law after several 2024 judicial opinions arguably upset market expectations. Yet the jump in incorporations begins prior to the late February 2025 announcement of SB 21. And it begins substantially after the March 2024 passage of SB 313,\" Verstein wrote. \"While it is certainly possible that the increase reflects a lagged response to SB 313, or perhaps a preemptive response to the legislative currents that led to SB 21, the timing does not immediately commend itself to that explanation.\"\n\nHe also pointed toward external factors outside Delaware's control.\n\n\"For example, President Donald J. Trump won the general election on November 5, 2024 and took office on January 20, 2025,\" he wrote. \"Perhaps Delaware corporations were expected to be especially useful under his administration.\"\n\nVerstein said, despite the cause being unclear, \"the data are plainly incompatible with the most alarmist theories of Dexit.\"\n\nFor its part, Delaware's government is unfazed.\n\n\"Delaware continues to lead the world as the preeminent home for business,\" a spokesperson for Delaware's Secretary of State, which oversees corporations, said in a statement. \"The data speaks for itself — Delaware's corporate franchise remains strong thanks in large part to the unmatched expertise and efficiency of the Delaware Division of Corporations.\"\n\nDuring a 2024 interview with Business Insider, Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez brushed off concerns that they were struggling due to \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way,\" Patibanda-Sanchez said. \"We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "description": "Elon Musk admitted on Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings call today that the company doesn’t have any Optimus robots doing useful...",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk admitted on Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings call today that the company doesn’t have any Optimus robots doing useful work in its factories right now.\n\nThis is a striking admission, given that Musk has spent the past two years claiming the opposite.\n\nLet’s take a walk through memory lane.\n\nJune 2024: Tesla’s official account claimed the company had “2 Optimus bots performing tasks in the factory autonomously.”\n\nJune 2024: At Tesla’s shareholder meeting, Musk said he expected “a thousand to a couple thousand robots working in its factories” by 2025.\n\nJanuary 2025: On Tesla’s Q4 2024 earnings call, Musk raised the stakes even higher:\n\n“The normal internal plan calls for roughly 10,000 Optimus robots to be built this year.”\n\n“Will those several thousand Optimus robots be doing useful things by the end of the year? Yes, I’m confident they will do useful things.”\n\nToday (January 2026): Musk admitted that no Optimus robots are currently doing useful work in Tesla’s factories.\n\n“Well, we are still very much at the early stages of Optimus. It’s still in the R&D phase. We have had Optimus do some basic tasks in the factory. But as we iterate on new versions of Optimus, we deprecate the old versions. It’s not in usage in our factories in a material way. It’s more so that the robot can learn. We wouldn’t expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably the end of this year.”\n\nThis follows a now-familiar pattern with Musk’s predictions.\n\nWe documented last month that Tesla never came close to producing thousands of Optimus robots in 2025. There was no evidence of even hundreds being built.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Musk was specifically asked about how many Optimus robots Tesla has, and he didn’t answer.\n\nWhat Tesla has demonstrated publicly are robots performing simple tasks like handing out water bottles, and even then, they relied heavily on teleoperation (humans remotely controlling the robots) rather than true autonomy.\n\nMultiple supply chain reports throughout 2025 indicated that Tesla’s Optimus program was in “shambles,” with the head of the program departing and production being delayed.\n\nIn today’s shareholder update, Tesla did mention progress on Optimus:\n\n“In Q1 of this year, we plan to unveil the Gen 3 version of Optimus, which will include major upgrades from version 2.5, including our latest hand design. The Gen 3 is our first design meant for mass production.”\n\nTesla also said it’s preparing production lines with “start of production planned before the end of 2026 and eventual planned capacity of 1 million robots per year.”\n\nBut the admission that no robots are currently doing useful work directly contradicts years of claims from both Musk and Tesla’s official communications.\n\nI want to be clear: I’m actually bullish on humanoid robots. The technology is advancing rapidly, and Tesla does have advantages in compute efficiency and AI development.\n\nBut Tesla is running full speed ($20 billion capex worth) into the same problem it had with autonomous vehicles: it builds the hardware before the software is ready.\n\nOn top of this, even though I’m bullish on humanoid (to a degree, I’m not saying its a multi-trillion dollar industry), I don’t really trust Musk leading this effort with this real credibility problem.\n\nWhen Musk claimed in January 2025 that “several thousand Optimus robots will be doing useful things by the end of the year,” he wasn’t making a long-term prediction about uncertain technology. He was making a near-term operational claim about his own company.\n\nTesla does have advantages in compute efficiency and AI development.\n\nFred, I'm gonna need a source on this. For all we know, Musk just claims to have an advantage. I'm guessing those other companies which have been building robots for decades may have a better handle on some of this stuff.\n\nNow, a year later, he’s admitting that the number is zero.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla claimed had Optimus robots were doing “real work” in factories almost two years ago now.\n\nIt’s fairly clear for anyone who has been following the program closely that Tesla is still years away from a useful product that will be able to perform work at an efficient level beyond just demos.\n\nEven Musk appeared to somewhat admits that he the first part of his response where he said that the robot is “still very much at the early stages of Optimus. It’s still in the R&D phase.”",

    "description": "The five companies led by Elon Musk have increasingly become intertwined, even before Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI or merger chatter.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is running some of the world's most valuable companies. But they've been doing business with each other long before recent merger chatter around Elon Inc.\n\nThe billionaire leads five major companies: Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company, Neuralink, and xAI, which recently absorbed his social media company, X.\n\nOver the last three years, those companies have stepped up their internal dealings, buying one another's products, exchanging software and materials, and announcing investments worth billions of dollars.\n\nThe result is a tightly knit corporate ecosystem with Musk at its center.\n\nFor consumers and Tesla's many fans, that kind of vertical integration can look like a strength. Musk has argued that closer ties between his companies make them more resilient to geopolitical risk and supply-chain shocks.\n\n\"Done correctly, inter-company connections make a lot of sense,\" Lou Whiteman, a contributing analyst at The Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"The important thing is to ensure good governance is in place, so that, for example, Boring is paying a fair price for Tesla vehicles.\"\n\nOther analysts and investors say the arrangement concentrates too much power in Musk's hands. Tesla's eight-member board includes longtime allies of the billionaire — including his brother.\n\nNone of Musk's companies responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere are some of the recent sharing agreements, purchases, and investments between Musk's companies:\n\nMusk has repeatedly drawn on employees from one company to support others in his portfolio.\n\nIn 2022, about a month after Musk bought Twitter — now known as X — he sent roughly 50 Tesla employees to the social-media company's headquarters to help overhaul its code-review systems, according to court filings.\n\nMusk later argued in court that the Tesla employees had \"volunteered\" to do the work and that their temporary reassignment should not concern Tesla's board.\n\nExecutives share overlapping functions on several of Musk's companies, too, according to insider org charts obtained by Business Insider.\n\nFor example, Charlie Kuehmann, the vice president of materials and engineering at Tesla, also holds the same title at SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX is a major customer of Tesla's energy business, purchasing batteries for robotics power and Megapack energy-storage systems.\n\nIt also reportedly invested $2 billion into xAI as a part of a previous funding round.\n\nMusk has also said that Tesla's long-awaited next-generation Roadster will be a \"Tesla/SpaceX collab\" and feature SpaceX-built cold-gas thrusters. The hyper-powered sports car's launch event is penciled in for April 1.\n\n\"It's gonna be really cool, and it's gonna have some rocket technology in it,\" Musk also said during a 2024 sit-down with Don Lemon.\n\nPerhaps the most public example of Musk's companies coordinating is Tesla's vehicle sales to his tunnel-building start-up.\n\nThe Boring Company, which operates tunnels in Las Vegas and Texas, uses fleets of Tesla vehicles to transport passengers through its underground systems. The tunnel builder has also constructed tunnels around Tesla's Gigafactory in Austin, Texas.\n\nIt isn't alone. SpaceX also purchased an unspecified number of Musk's Cybertrucks.\n\nTesla's earnings on Wednesday disclosed that it had agree to invest $2 billion in xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence startup, with a related \"framework agreement\" to explore additional collaboration opportunities.\n\nTesla has already integrated xAI's Grok into its vehicles, allowing drivers to chat with the AI and use it to add and edit navigation destinations.\n\nVideos have shown early versions of Tesla's in-development Optimus robot using xAI's Grok AI chatbot for its voice.\n\nElon’s Tesla Optimus 🤖🔥 is here! Dawn of the physical Agentforce revolution, tackling human work for $200K–$500K. Productivity game-changer! Congrats @elonmusk, and thank you for always being so kind to me! 🚀 #Tesla #Optimus pic.twitter.com/bA5IYIylE1\n\nxAI has also reportedly told investors that it's working on AI that could power Tesla's forthcoming Optimus humanoid robots.\n\nTesla executives said the $2 billion investment supports the automaker's push into self-driving technology. For example, the earnings deck explained that xAI-developed software will analyze vehicle interiors and assist with route planning, including adding high-occupancy-vehicle lanes when the car is full.\n\nFor xAI, the investment adds capital to the cash-hungry buildout of data centers and their energy needs.\n\nThe deal marked one of the clearest examples of capital flowing from Musk's public company into a privately held firm he controls.\n\nThe growing web of internal deals has fueled discussion among investors and analysts about whether Musk's companies are evolving into something closer to a single, vertically integrated enterprise.\n\nThere's also been recent reports that some of Musk's companies could merge — including potential combinations of Tesla and xAI or SpaceX and xAI.\n\nWhiteman said many Tesla investors appear comfortable with that direction.\n\n\"In Tesla's case, an important factor to consider is that investors are buying into Elon Musk's vision for the future as much as they are buying into an automaker or clean energy company,\" he said.\n\n\"Since this group of companies, public and private, combine to represent Elon Musk's full vision of the future, I'd bet that many investors are happy to see Tesla involved in all aspects of 'Elon Inc.'\"",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) revised its Starlink privacy policy to allow the use of customer data for AI training, a shift that ​could bolster Elon Musk's AI ambitions.\n\nAhead of a blockbuster IPO planned for later this year, ‌SpaceX is in talks to merge with Musk’s AI company, xAI (XAAI.PVT), a deal first reported by Reuters on Thursday. SpaceX, already the ‌world’s most valuable private company, could reach a value of more than $1 trillion after the IPO.\n\nWhat are privacy experts' concerns about Starlink's policy changes?\n\nWhat changes did SpaceX make to Starlink's privacy policy?\n\nHow could the SpaceX-xAI merger impact AI development?\n\nWhat data does Starlink collect from its users?\n\nStarlink updated its Global Privacy Policy on January 15, according to the Starlink website. The policy includes new details stating that unless a user opts out, Starlink data may be used “to train our machine learning or artificial intelligence ⁠models” and could be shared with ‌the company’s service providers and “third-party collaborators,” without providing further details.\n\nA previous version of the privacy policy, an archived version from November and reviewed by Reuters, did not ‍contain language about AI training on Starlink data.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStarlink collects vast amounts of user data, spanning location information, credit card information, contact information and user IP ​addresses. It also collects so-called communication data, which includes audio and visual information, data in shared ‌files, and “inferences we may make from other personal information we collect,” according to its global privacy policy.\n\nThe policy did not make clear exactly what data would be used to train AI. The move has raised concerns among privacy advocates and consumer rights groups, which argue that using personal data to train AI risks expanding surveillance and creates new avenues for misuse.\n\n“It certainly raises my eyebrow and would make ⁠me concerned if I was a Starlink user,” said Anupam ​Chander, a technology law professor at Georgetown University. “Often there's perfectly ​legitimate uses of your data, but it doesn’t have a clear limit to what kind of uses it will be put to.”\n\nMusk's xAI, most recently valued at $230 billion ‍after a recent funding round, ⁠is currently developing its Grok LLM chatbot and also owns X, the social media platform.\n\nThe potential merger with xAI would turbocharge the space company’s deployment of AI-powered services, while giving xAI ⁠vast new data sets to train its models on, including communication data. Starlink, a network of more than 9,000 satellites, ‌currently provides internet connection to more than 9 million users.",

    "title": "Elon Musk discussed plans to party with Jeffrey Epstein on his Caribbean island, newly released emails show",
    "description": "Elon Musk planned visits to Jeffrey Epstein's island, DOJ emails show. Epstein repeatedly sought meetings with Musk, who previously denied visiting.",
    "fullText": "In November 2012, Jeffrey Epstein emailed Elon Musk about sending a helicopter to whisk the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to his private island in the Caribbean.\n\n\"how many people will you be for the heli to island,\" Epstein asked Musk in an email exchange, which was made public Friday by the Justice Department.\n\nMusk said he'd need just two seats — for himself and his then-partner, Tallulah Riley.\n\n\"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\" Musk asked.\n\nThe emails, released Friday, were part of a cache of 3 million files the Justice Department released from its yearslong investigation into the convicted sex offender. They include several exchanges between Epstein, Musk, and their assistants.\n\nIt's unclear whether Musk ever made the trip, and a representative didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nEpstein — who counted President Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and various other prominent politicians and businessmen among his acquaintances — killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He had registered as a pedophile in 2008, after pleading guilty to less severe sex offenses.\n\nShortly after Epstein's arrest in July 2019, Musk said he had declined invitations to Epstein's island in the US Virgin Islands and recounted only one meeting with him. Musk has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Several years ago, I was at his house in Manhattan for about 30 minutes in the middle of the afternoon with Talulah [Riley], as she was curious about meeting this strange person for a novel she was writing,\" he told Vanity Fair at the time. \"We did not see anything inappropriate at all, apart from weird art. He tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island. I declined.\"\n\nMusk has since said in social media posts that he \"refused\" to visit Epstein's island despite multiple attempts from Epstein.\n\nThe emails released Friday appear to show him planning to visit Epstein's island at least twice.\n\nIn addition to the November 2012 planned visit, Musk indicated he would visit Epstein's island in January 2014.\n\n\"Will be in the BVI/St Bart's area over the holidays,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in December 2013, referring to the British Virgin Islands. \"Is there a good time to visit?\"\n\nEpstein said he'd be available for the first week of January.\n\n\"always space for you,\" Epstein told Musk.\n\nAfter some back-and-forth about their schedules, Musk appeared to confirm that he would visit Epstein on January 2 of 2014.\n\n\"When should we head to your island on the 2nd?\" Musk wrote.\n\nThe emails show Epstein planning to meet Musk on other occasions as well.\n\nIn February of 2013, Musk's personal assistant tried to nail down plans for a meeting at SpaceX's offices in California. Epstein's assistant said Musk had suggested the location.\n\n\"Shall we organize a lunch for Elon and Jeffrey to get together at SpaceX in the coming weeks?\" Musk's assistant wrote. \"Elon is generally available at SpaceX on Mon, Thurs and Fri each week.\"\n\nIt isn't clear from the emails reviewed by Business Insider if that meeting took place. Musk has previously said that Epstein never \"toured\" SpaceX's facilities.\n\nIn early March of that year, Epstein directly asked Musk about his availability.\n\n\"now its time for fun,\" Epstein told Musk.\n\nIn the emails, Musk told Epstein he was busy with work at Tesla and SpaceX. Epstein suggested he get more sleep.\n\n\"benefit analysis would probably show , tesla doing better with you getting more sleep,\" he said.\n\n\"Normally I would agree, as I have found that my total daily productivity is optimal at around 6 to 6.5 hours of sleep.\"\n\nThe two may have met later that spring. In another email exchange, dated April 2013, Epstein's assistant said he planned to meet Musk at the Milken Institute economic conference.\n\nThe Justice Department emails also show Epstein inquiring with Musk about Solar City, a solar electricity company that was later acquired by Tesla. Epstein said in September 2012 that he wanted to use its services for his properties in the US Virgin Islands and New Mexico.\n\n\"is there any one at Solar City that my guys can talk to about electriying the caribean island?\" Epstein asked. \"or the new mexico ranch\"",

    "description": "Tesla's car sales dropped 11% while Elon Musk pivots to unproven robots, losing the EV crown to BYD as investors question the risky strategy.",
    "fullText": "Tesla’s car business just posted its first-ever annual revenue decline, but Elon Musk claims salvation lies in robots that don’t exist yet. The company’s Q4 2025 earnings revealed a brutal reality: automotive revenues plummeted 11% year-over-year to $69.53 billion, while total vehicle deliveries dropped 8.6% to 1.636 million units. Meanwhile, BYD cruised past Tesla as the world’s top EV maker, selling 2.26 million vehicles compared to Tesla’s shrinking numbers.\n\nThe most telling stat? Europe, where Tesla’s sales cratered 37.2%—the worst performance among all automakers, even as the broader EV market grew. Your Tesla stock might have rebounded 4% post-earnings, but that’s mainly because Musk spent the call talking about anything except cars.\n\nMusk positions Tesla as a “physical AI company” banking on unproven robotics technology.\n\nInstead of addressing why customers increasingly choose cheaper alternatives, Musk doubled down on his AI pivot. Tesla pumped $2 billion into his separate venture xAI, promising mysterious “collaboration frameworks.” The star of this show? Optimus humanoid robots, which Musk claims will enter production before 2026 ends and reach public sales by 2027.\n\nHe’s calling it the “biggest product ever” with poverty-ending potential—basically the tech equivalent of promising world peace through household appliances. The Robotaxi program, once Tesla’s golden ticket to autonomy riches, has quietly stalled. Those “unsupervised” tests that generated headlines? They’ve vanished faster than a TikTok trend.\n\nDeclining sales across all markets expose the risks of chasing sci-fi dreams over current products.\n\nYour Cybertruck enthusiasm apparently wasn’t shared—sales dropped 48% as the angular pickup failed to capture mainstream appeal. “2025 marks the year Tesla lost the BEV crown to BYD… a 620,000-unit gap,” noted Howard Yu from IMD Business School.\n\nThis pivot represents Silicon Valley’s ultimate moonshot mentality: when your core business falters, promise revolutionary technology that’s perpetually “just around the corner.” Tesla’s betting shareholders will stay patient while competitors like BYD offer reliable, affordable EVs today. Whether Musk’s robot army materializes or becomes another Hyperloop-level distraction remains the trillion-dollar question keeping investors awake at night.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know.

    "fullText": "It looks like 2026 could be a banger year for IPOs.\n\nAfter a slowdown in blockbuster public debuts, two of the most closely watched private tech companies are expected to go public this year: SpaceX and OpenAI.\n\nWhile reports last year suggested both companies would go public in 2026, recent developments have fueled speculation about when and how it could happen.\n\nAlso on Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported OpenAI was planning for an IPO in the fourth quarter as it races to beat Anthropic, an AI competitor, to market.\n\nHere's what smart people in tech and business are saying about the potential IPOs of two of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nChamath Palihapitiya, a prominent venture capitalist and former Facebook exec, said, \"A merger between SpaceX and Tesla would instantly create the Berkshire Hathaway of the modern century.\"\n\n\"The capital raising and operational efficiencies if both were together are obvious,\" Palihapitiya wrote on X. \"If this were to happen, it would also bring us one step closer to having one equity instrument for all things Elon, which many would want to buy.\"\n\nA merger between SpaceX and Tesla would instantly create the Berkshire Hathaway of the modern century.The capital raising and operational efficiencies if both were together are obvious. If this were to happen, it would also bring us one step closer to having one equity…\n\nEric Berger, the senior space editor at Ars Technica, said talks of a merger between SpaceX and xAI shouldn't be a \"huge surprise.\"\n\n\"If you believe AI is the future; and that compute is the major problem to solve; and orbital data centers are feasible—then the combined company would be a vertically integrated AI colossus,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe reported merger talks between SpaceX and xAI should not come as a huge surprise. If you believe AI is the future; and that compute is the major problem to solve; and orbital data centers are feasible—then the combined company would be a vertically integrated AI colossus.\n\nNoah Smith, a former Bloomberg journalist who now writes a popular economics substack, shared his concerns over OpenAI's future success in a post titled \"What if AI succeeds but OpenAI fails?\"\n\nAn OpenAI IPO will raise \"many more billions in cash, this time from regular investors,\" said Smith, but Sam Altman's company could be \"an early leader that flames out.\"\n\n\"Even if AI technology and the AI industry as a whole succeed wildly, OpenAI might not be the company that wins the race. That could leave a lot of investors holding the bag,\" he said.\n\n\"It could also cause a temporary — but unwarranted — chill in AI investment in the US, allowing Chinese companies to take the lead.\"\n\nRoss Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told The Information that he would not purchase SpaceX stock if the company goes public.\n\nSpaceX is \"not really a great business in the sense of profitability,\" said Gerber. \"To pay a trillion and a half dollars for a space company that does $15 billion in revenue is just insanity.\"\n\n\"If you're going to pay 2x or 3x just because it's Elon's company, I wish you the best of luck, and it's not something I am going to do,\" he said.",

    "title": "Here's what a potential SpaceX mega-merger could mean for Elon Musk's business empire",
    "description": "SpaceX is gearing up for a massive IPO this year, and multiple reports suggested the rocket giant is considering mergers with Tesla or xAI.",
    "fullText": "The \"Muskonomy\" might be about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up for a potential $1.5 trillion IPO this year, and multiple reports on Thursday night suggested the rocket company is considering blockbuster mergers with Tesla, Elon Musk's carmaker, or his AI startup, xAI.\n\nThe three companies have already been moving closer together in recent months. Tesla said on Wednesday that it had invested $2 billion in xAI, after SpaceX reportedly made a similar investment last year.\n\nThe electric carmaker also told investors it would evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with xAI, following its addition of the startup's Grok chatbot to its vehicles last July.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Musk has combined parts of his sprawling business empire. Last March, he announced that xAI had purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk bought for $44 billion in 2022.\n\nMerging xAI with one of Tesla or SpaceX would mark a dramatic escalation of the so-called \"Muskonomy,\" however. Here's what it could mean for the future of Elon Musk's business empire.\n\nAt first glance, bringing social media site X, the controversial chatbot Grok, and the reusable rocket Starship under one roof seems like a strange mix. But merging SpaceX and xAI does fit with Musk's long-term vision for an AI-powered future.\n\nThe world's richest man has suggested that the logical conclusion of the AI infrastructure boom is to build data centres in the freezing vacuum of space, where they can access plentiful solar power and operate without the huge amounts of water needed to cool them on Earth.\n\nSpeaking at Davos last week, Musk suggested that space will become the \"lowest cost\" place to train AI, and said that SpaceX will launch solar-powered AI satellites in the next few years that will ultimately scale up to \"hundreds of terawatts\" of energy consumption a year.\n\nMusk has also said that SpaceX's Starship rocket and growing network of Starlink satellites could form the basis of a massive network of orbital AI compute.\n\nAccess to this infrastructure could give xAI an advantage over rivals OpenAI and Google, who are scrambling for computing power and exploring space-based data centers themselves as they look to build ever more powerful AI models.\n\nAnother consideration is funding. Training AI is notoriously expensive, with xAI reportedly burning through billions of dollars in cash and regularly taking on new funding. SpaceX, meanwhile, has seen revenue grow in recent years and is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion.\n\nMerging SpaceX with Tesla, which has been a public company since 2010, would be more complicated — and the payoff less obvious.\n\nThe two companies already enjoy close links, having shared board members and executives in the past. And, in 2018, Musk used SpaceX for some out-of-this-world marketing by blasting his Tesla Roadster into space on a Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nTheir current businesses, however, have less obvious areas of overlap.\n\nTesla is shifting from a carmaker to an AI and robotics company, with Musk saying on Wednesday that Tesla would scrap the Model X and S and use their production lines to build its Optimus robot.\n\nThe company also has a thriving energy storage business, and at Davos last week, Musk said that both Tesla and SpaceX were separately working to build up to \"a hundred gigawatts a year\" of solar power in the US.\n\nCombining the two could be a step toward Musk's more grandiose dreams of massively expanding humanity's energy production.\n\nMusk also reiterated on Wednesday that he believes Tesla needs to build a \"terafab\" to build advanced AI chips, and in an X post in November suggested that Tesla's terafab could produce chips for SpaceX's solar-powered AI satellites.\n\nOne throughline that connects all of Musk's enterprises is his obsession with settling Mars, which the billionaire has described as critical to humanity's long-term survival.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up to use Starship to launch uncrewed missions to Mars in the coming years, and the billionaire has previously said that these missions would carry Tesla's Optimus to the red planet.\n\nOne thing that's clear is that combining his various companies has been on Musk's mind for a while. Way back in 2020, he responded to a Twitter post suggesting he merge SpaceX, Tesla, and the Boring Company.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Elon Musk is a true visionary — but the future he's building is much further away than he thinks.\n\n\"Elon is an American treasure but also a desperately incentivized futurist even earlier than me,\" the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame posted on X late Thursday.\n\nBurry, known for making premature but ultimately correct predictions, likely meant the Tesla and SpaceX CEO stands to profit enormously from his vision becoming reality, so he's highly motivated to hype it as much as he can.\n\n\"I am glad he is here in America,\" Burry wrote on his Substack. \"He will go down in history like PT Barnum and Thomas Edison,\" he added, referring to the legendary showman and founder of the Barnum & Bailey Circus, and the iconic inventor who helped refine the electric light bulb.\n\nFuturists are \"always decades early, even earlier than I am,\" Burry continued. \"And since they sell self-evident futures with indefinite timelines, they can raise capital.\"\n\nBurry attached a link to an article about Musk reportedly exploring a merger between SpaceX and either or both of his other main companies, Tesla and xAI.\n\nSpaceX was valued at $800 billion in a private share sale in December, Tesla has a $1.3 trillion market capitalization, and xAI was valued at $230 billion in a November fundraising round.\n\nBurry said it \"did not take a futurist to know this was coming,\" and the market had already priced in a potential combination. He added that $1.6 trillion \"more than encompasses\" what the trio are worth today, even accounting for their future value.\n\nThe value investor, who recently shifted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, wrote that Tesla was \"ridiculously overvalued\" in a December post. He also warned that Musk's $1 trillion pay package would continue to dilute the company's shares.\n\nThat historic compensation deal underpins why Musk is so driven to market his vision and work toward realizing it. He's required to hit several milestones by 2035 to receive the full share allotment; those include raising Tesla's market value to $8.5 trillion, delivering 1 million robots, and bringing 1 million robotaxis into commercial service.\n\nAs for Musk's grand vision, he's repeatedly said he intends for humanity to colonize Mars in his lifetime. Moreover, he recently recommended people not save for retirement in 10 or 20 years, as he expects advances in AI, energy, and robotics to generate so many resources for all that nobody will need a nest egg.\n\nBurry has butted heads with Musk over the years. In 2021, he took aim at Tesla for its reliance on government subsidies and Musk for paring his stake in the EV maker.\n\nMusk responded by writing: \"Burry is a broken clock.\" He also teased Burry in 2022 about his previous short bet against Tesla.\n\nMusk hasn't responded to any of Burry's recent X posts, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Tesla is giving the Model S and Model X the ax. Recent sales figures help explain why.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is taking its Model S and Model X to pasture.\n\nThe automaker will end production of the $94,990 sedan and $99,990 SUV next quarter, CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\nBased on recent delivery numbers, the decision isn't particularly surprising.\n\nTesla does not break out Model S and Model X sales individually; instead, it groups them with the Cybertruck under \"other models.\" Still, earnings presentations suggest demand for the category has been declining for years.\n\nIn 2025, Tesla sold 50,850 \"other model\" units worldwide — accounting for just over 3% of the automaker's 1,636,129 sales.\n\nThe \"other model\" figures are also down sharply from prior years. Tesla sold 85,133 vehicles in the category in 2024 — the first full year of Cybertruck deliveries.\n\nThat means sales fell about 40% in 2025, far steeper than the roughly 7% declines for the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nThe soon-to-be-discontinued cars will remain an important part of Tesla's history. The Model S, launched in 2012, was the automaker's first car built from the ground up. The Model X came three years later, giving the company a foothold in America's best-selling vehicle category, the SUV.\n\nThe Model X has faced reliability issues from the jump. The car's sweeping gullwing doors were difficult to mass assemble, Musk said, calling the vehicle a \"Fabergé egg\" during a 2019 earnings call.\n\nAnd while Tesla refreshed much of its lineup in 2025, the Model S and Model X received comparatively modest design updates — a contrast with the more aggressive changes to the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nInstead of chasing a revival of the aging car's sales, Tesla said it is discontinuing the program's production in favor of its Optimus humanoid robot. Musk projects building one million bots a year.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said, adding that the decision was \"slightly sad.\"\n\nThe move underscores how far Tesla has shifted away from its legacy luxury models as growth slows and Musk pushes the company toward robotics and autonomy.\n\nStill, analysts aren't fully sold on the idea that Tesla's manufacturing switch-up will lead to immediate profits or sales results.\n\n\"The company appears to be on track with the rollout of Robotaxi service in nine US cities, alongside the start of production for the Cybercab and Semi,\" Steve Man, the senior auto industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider. \"But we believe a commercially ready Optimus robot remains at least a couple of years away.\"\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business a request for comment from Business Insider.",

That attack killed five people, and was denounced ‍by Kyiv as an act ⁠of terrorism.\n\nOn Thursday, Beskrestnov said there had been \"hundreds\" of cases where Starlink-enabled Russian drones had attacked Ukraine.\n\n\"The complexity of this process lies in the fact that Starlink cannot be suppressed by means of ⁠electronic warfare, and even their position in flight cannot be detected by reconnaissance equipment,\" he wrote, adding that the way to solve ‌the issue was therefore through SpaceX.",

    "fullText": "\"Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?\"\n\nElon Musk made the plea in the final moments of Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, sounding a bit fired up.\n\nMusk had just finished giving a blunt warning to American companies: build more battery-making infrastructure in the US or risk falling behind.\n\nThe Tesla CEO argued that too many companies are underestimating their exposure to geopolitical risks posed by fragile supply chains, particularly for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\n\"There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen,\" Musk said. \"I'm way more paranoid than that.\"\n\nHe added that his concern has pushed Tesla to take unusual — and expensive — steps to protect its future, including building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas.\n\nIn December 2024, the company began processing lithium from its $1 billion Robstown, Texas, refinery. This month, Tesla announced it is producing dry-electrode 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin, which will end up in \"certain Model Ys.\"\n\nOn the call, Musk described those facilities as \"more advanced than anything else in the world,\" but stressed that Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.\n\n\"Why do we have to build these things? Why can others not also please build these things? I mean, it's very hard to build these things, and we're building them out of desperation, because nobody else is building lithium refineries and cathode refineries,\" Musk said.\n\n\"You know, we're pretty much the largest, but also the only lithium refinery and cathode refinery in America,\" he added. \"So, yeah. So. We're making moves to make sure that, no matter what happens, Tesla will prosper.\"\n\nIndependent research suggests Musk's worries are not unfounded.\n\nAn October analysis by the Dallas Federal Reserve identified 66 lithium projects across the US, but found that many remain in early development stages and face long timelines, high costs, and volatile lithium prices. Many projects could take a decade or more to reach commercial production, if they get there at all, the study found.\n\nA few other American automakers are beginning to invest as well.\n\nIn 2024, General Motors invested $625 million in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas Corporation's plans to build a lithium mine in Nevada. The facility is expected to become America's largest mine and plans to open between late 2026 and early 2027. In 2025, the US government took a minority stake in the project.\n\nTesla argues that its investments in battery infrastructure and energy storage have helped offset auto revenue pressure as its car business declines.\n\nTesla's lithium-based energy storage batteries — called Megapacks — reported Q4 revenue of over $3.8 billion, a 25% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nAnalysts express some concern that Tesla is committing tens of billions of dollars to long-term industrial projects, even as the company is openly uncertain about near-term returns.\n\n\"What we learned from the earnings call is that a whole bunch of billions of dollars will be flowing out of the company in the form of capital expenditures: more than $20 billion,\" David Meier, a senior analyst at Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"That's a massive investment, but it's necessary as the plan is to raise 6 production plants, continue to develop AI infrastructure, and upgrade current manufacturing facilities.\"\n\nMusk warned that companies that fail to insulate against geopolitical risks could pay a steep price.\n\n\"Companies that don't do that,\" he said, \"a bunch of them will cease to exist.\"",

    "description": "Elon Musk's companies already share employees, resources and investors. Maybe a possible merger of SpaceX and xAI  — or Tesla — would simplify things.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk starts and owns lots of companies. Maybe he's going to change that, a bit: The world's richest man is reportedly working on a plan to merge two of his most valuable companies into one megacompany.\n\nWhich one of his companies is a question: Reuters reports that Musk wants to merge xAI — his very valuable AI company that has already merged with the company that used to be called Twitter — into SpaceX, his very valuable rocket company. And Bloomberg reports that SpaceX is also considering a merger with Tesla, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe SpaceX-xAI tie-up could help Musk build data centers in space. \"The combination would bring Musk's rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and ​Grok AI chatbot under one roof,\" the Reuters report says. Then again, Reuters also says it doesn't know several key details about the theoretical deal, including \"its ‌primary rationale.\"\n\nAnd to be honest, the rationale seems a little obscure to me, too.\n\nThe main reason I can think of to merge one private company with another private company that's about to go public would be to make it easier for the smaller private company to finance itself.\n\nIn this case, that would mean that xAI wouldn't have to rely on the private markets as it races after the likes of OpenAI, Google, and Meta in the competition for AI talent and chips. It could tap the public market instead.\n\nThe problem with that theory: People in the private market are lining up to throw money at xAI, which just raised $20 billion. The company boasted that it was only going to raise $15 billion, but people kept throwing money at it, so it had to go and raise more.\n\nAnd, Muskian boasting aside, that makes lots of sense: Despite all the AI bubble chat, people are eager to put money into big, privately owned AI companies, as OpenAI and Anthropic prove every time they raise a ton of money, which happens to be all the time.\n\nJust as important: People are eager to give Elon Musk money because he's made a lot of people a lot of money from Tesla, and they're eager to give him another chance. (That's why the people who helped him fund his value-destroying Twitter deal never once complained about it in public: They wanted a chance to invest in his next deal.)\n\nI've asked Musk, SpaceX, and xAI for comment. It may be worth noting that Musk, who complains about coverage of his companies all the time, did not complain when someone retweeted the Reuters story Thursday afternoon.\n\nI suppose you could also try to argue that SpaceX and xAI make sense together because a bunch of their work overlaps, like the theoretical xAI space data centers that could get built with SpaceX rockets.\n\nBut Elon Musk has always treated his various companies as one big company when it suits him. He moves engineering and managing talent from one company to another when he wants — even when those employees work for Tesla, which is publicly owned, and theoretically should have a problem with lending its staff to other people's companies.\n\nSometimes there are complaints about Musk using resources from one company to help another — or, perhaps, himself. But Musk has pretty much ignored all of those complaints. I can't believe he's interested in moving xAI into SpaceX because he cares about corporate governance.\n\nAnother reason to mash the companies together might be to reward investors who bet on one private company by giving them publicly traded shares in the combined company. But, again, that doesn't really track here: Musk has a bunch of loyal backers, like Fidelity and Valor Equity Partners, which try to get into all his deals, and are already in both companies.\n\nSo maybe there will be a big galaxy-brained rationale for mushing xAI or Tesla and SpaceX together, and we just have to wait for Musk to unveil it. In the absence of that, here's my last guess: Musk, who is already reportedly trying to time his SpaceX IPO to \"coincide with a rare planetary alignment and his birthday,\" per Financial Times reports, just wants his giant SpaceX IPO to be even bigger. Prior to Thursday's report, SpaceX was supposed to go public at a $1.5 trillion valuation — the largest IPO in history. So maybe he's just trying to boost that valuation by a half trillion more.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk took the final moments of Tesla's earnings call to warn American companies about global battery supply risks.\n\nTesla has built its own lithium refinery and battery facility to avoid disruptions: \"We wish others would build this,\" Musk said.\n\nRecent studies show renewed interest in building the facilities — but construction has slowed.\n\n\"Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?\"\n\nElon Musk made the plea in the final moments of Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, sounding a bit fired up.\n\nMusk had just finished giving a blunt warning to American companies: build more battery-making infrastructure in the US or risk falling behind.\n\nThe Tesla CEO argued that too many companies are underestimating their exposure to geopolitical risks posed by fragile supply chains, particularly for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\n\"There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen,\" Musk said. \"I'm way more paranoid than that.\"\n\nHe added that his concern has pushed Tesla to take unusual — and expensive — steps to protect its future, including building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas.\n\nIn December 2024, the company began processing lithium from its $1 billion Robstown, Texas, refinery. This month, Tesla announced it is producing dry-electrode 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin, which will end up in \"certain Model Ys.\"\n\nOn the call, Musk described those facilities as \"more advanced than anything else in the world,\" but stressed that Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.\n\n\"Why do we have to build these things? Why can others not also please build these things? I mean, it's very hard to build these things, and we're building them out of desperation, because nobody else is building lithium refineries and cathode refineries,\" Musk said.\n\n\"You know, we're pretty much the largest, but also the only lithium refinery and cathode refinery in America,\" he added. \"So, yeah. So. We're making moves to make sure that, no matter what happens, Tesla will prosper.\"\n\nIndependent research suggests Musk's worries are not unfounded.\n\nAn October analysis by the Dallas Federal Reserve identified 66 lithium projects across the US, but found that many remain in early development stages and face long timelines, high costs, and volatile lithium prices. Many projects could take a decade or more to reach commercial production, if they get there at all, the study found.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX and xAI are in discussions to merge ahead of a blockbuster public offering planned for later this year. The combination would bring Musk’s rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and Grok AI chatbot under one roof, according to a person briefed on the matter and two ​recent company filings seen by Reuters.\n\nHow could space-based data centers reduce AI costs?\n\nWhat would the proposed SpaceX-xAI merger involve?\n\nWhat defense applications are planned for merged companies?\n\nWhy is Musk combining his different business ventures?\n\nThe plan, which Reuters is reporting exclusively, would give fresh momentum to SpaceX’s effort to launch data centers into orbit as Musk battles for supremacy in the rapidly ‌escalating AI race against tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI.\n\nMusk, the world's richest man, is the CEO of both the private space company SpaceX and the artificial intelligence company xAI, which controls his social media platform X. He also runs electric automaker Tesla, tunnel ‌company The Boring Co. and neurotechnology company Neuralink.\n\nMusk, SpaceX, and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnder the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX. Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction, the person said.\n\nCorporate filings in Nevada show that those entities were set up on January 21. One of them, a limited liability company, lists SpaceX and Bret Johnsen, the company's chief financial officer, as managing members, while the other lists Johnsen as the company's only officer, the filings show.\n\nThe filings don't contain additional information about the purpose of the companies ⁠or their role in any deal.\n\nJohnsen did not respond to a Reuters ‌request for comment.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential, said that some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal. A final agreement, however, hasn't been signed, and the timing and structure of the transaction remain fluid, the person cautioned.\n\nSpaceX is already the world's most ‍valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reuters and other media have reported that SpaceX plans to go public some time this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion.\n\nThrough xAI, Musk is building out a massive supercomputer for AI training in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI as part of the startup’s $5 billion equity ​fundraising, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.",

    "description": "In its quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Tesla said fourth-quarter profits were down by 61% year-over-year, and annual profit cratered by 46% in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Everything is going great over at Tesla. Wait, sorry, no. Everything is going bad over at Tesla. The automaker held its quarterly earnings call on Thursday, announcing that fourth-quarter profits were down by 61% year-over-year, and annual profit cratered by 46% in 2025. Beyond posting its lowest profits in years, Tesla's revenue from car sales was down 11% year-over-year, and it was the second year in a row that sales declined.\n\nIt gets worse. As reported by TechCrunch, on the call, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla is killing off the Model S sedan and Model X SUV. This isn't exactly a surprise, as the two EVs are Tesla's oldest models, with the Model S launching in 2012 and the Model X following three years later. It's been years since either have been strong sellers; while Tesla no longer breaks out their sales, in 2025 it delivered 50,850 units of the Cybertruck, Model S and Model X combined (a 40.2% decrease compared to 2024), with the latter two likely making up 30,000 of those. Honestly, this should've happened a long time ago, ideally followed by next-generation versions of both, but that was never gonna happen. Instead, Tesla gave both models a couple of enshittifying facelifts over the past few years, the most recent of which came just a few months ago.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said on the call, \"so if you're interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.\" The last units of both cars will be built at some point next quarter. Musk said their discontinuation \"is slightly sad.\" Boo hoo. He added that Tesla will support Model S and Model X owners \"for as long as people have the vehicles,\" whatever that means.\n\nTaking their place on the assembly lines of Tesla's Fremont, California, factory will allegedly be the Optimus robot. As The Verge reports, Musk said the \"mass production\" version of the Optimus will be shown later this quarter, and the first one will allegedly be built before the end of the year. We've heard how those promises usually turn out. Previously, Musk has said he aims for Tesla to build a million of them per year. Uh huh. He's also focused on getting the Tesla Cybercab out. We're not holding our breath for that one, either.\n\nPutting everything else Tesla and Elon-related aside, it is a shame to see the Model S get snuffed out like this. It did revolutionize the car industry, and while newer versions have been suckier, the early years of the Model S were truly great. Too bad their creator is focused on making the automotive world, and the world as a whole, a worse place.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk recently said that saving for retirement could become \"irrelevant\" in the next decade, as new technologies promise to create such an abundance of resources that nobody will need a nest egg.\n\nDario Amodei warned this week that achieving a plentiful future won't be easy. The CEO of Anthropic, the AI startup behind ChatGPT-rival Claude, wrote in an essay that AI promises to \"raise the quality of life for everyone\" — but there will be a brutal \"rite of passage\" to get there.\n\nAmodei said that at the current rate of progress, \"it cannot possibly be more than a few years before AI is better than humans at essentially everything.\"\n\nReplacing human labor with AI could supercharge economic growth and productivity, but the \"short-term shock will be unprecedented in size,\" he wrote.\n\nAmodei said he was worried that workers displaced by AI \"could form an unemployed or very-low-wage 'underclass,'\" and a tiny minority could capture most of the financial gains from AI, creating a \"level of wealth concentration that will break society.\"\n\nHe described those potential impacts on labor and equality as \"grave problems\" that AI companies, employers, philanthropists, and governments would have to work together to solve.\n\nAmodei noted that he and Anthropic's other cofounders have pledged to donate 80% of their wealth to good causes, and the company will match individual donations from its staff worth billions of dollars at its current valuation.\n\nAnthropic's boss shared a similar vision to Musk in a 2024 essay. He wrote that AI will eventually become \"so broadly effective and so cheap\" that the current economic system will \"no longer make sense.\"\n\nIt could be replaced by a \"large universal basic income for everyone,\" or a \"capitalist economy of AI systems\" that distributes \"huge amounts\" of resources to people as the \"overall economic pie will be gigantic,\" he added.\n\nBut he also flagged the risk of \"exploitative or dystopian directions\" and said, \"We will likely have to fight to get a good outcome here.\"\n\nBusiness Insider recently spoke to seven AI and personal finance gurus about Musk's vision, and they shared several of Amodei's concerns.\n\nThey urged Americans to keep saving for retirement just in case Musk is wrong — and said that even if he's right, making sure everyone reaps the rewards of AI will require immense planning and coordination.",

    "description": "Hiking subscriptions, making robots, and selling fewer cars? Tesla is acting like a tech company in more ways than one.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has long insisted Tesla isn't a car company. After its latest earnings, it looks less like one than ever.\n\nThe billionaire told investors that Tesla would scrap its Model S and X EVs and convert their production lines to build the company's Optimus humanoid robot, as it continues to shift toward AI and robotics.\n\nTesla also said it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI and to evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with Musk's AI startup.\n\nIt came as the company's financial disclosures painted a stark picture of the troubles facing its EV business, which saw sales decline for the second year in a row in 2025.\n\nTesla beat Wall Street's expectations, but reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue and said profits fell by 46% last year, while revenue from car sales fell by 11% year-over-year in the last quarter.\n\nExecutives largely shrugged off the headwinds, with Musk and other top employees reiterating in the analyst Q&A their belief that autonomous vehicles will shortly render traditional forms of transport obsolete.\n\n\"The vast majority of miles traveled will be autonomous in the future,\" said Musk, in response to an investor question asking about Tesla's plans to launch new models.\n\n\"I'm just guessing, but probably less than 5% of miles driven will be where somebody's actually driving the car themselves in the future, maybe as low as 1%,\" he added.\n\nInvestors reacted positively, with Tesla shares rising around 3% after hours following earnings.\n\nThe reaction is another sign of how, for many investors, vehicle sales have become a sidenote to Tesla's future, as the company executes an ambitious shift toward a new business model built on robotics, AI, and software services.\n\n\"They're definitely moving away from an automotive-oriented company to a tech-oriented company,\" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, told Business Insider prior to Tesla's earnings. '\"This is a company that's looking to get away from vehicle sales as the focus of their revenue.\"\n\nElon Musk has long said that Tesla should be thought of as an AI and robotics company, not a carmaker. Investors have agreed, driving Tesla's market cap to $1.35 trillion, more than every other US carmaker combined.\n\nEven before Tesla's latest AI-focused earnings, there were signs that the company had begun to act more like the tech giant Musk dreams of.\n\nThe company overhauled its autonomy offerings in recent weeks, removing the option to buy its premium Full Self-Driving software for a one-off fee of $8,000 and making it subscription-only.\n\nTesla also killed its basic Autopilot tier, which previously came free on almost all its vehicles, instead replacing it with a more limited form of cruise control. Musk also indicated in a post on X that Tesla owners can expect FSD prices to rise beyond the $99-per-month subscription fee as the technology improves.\n\nPhasing out free features and hiking subscription prices is classic tech giant behavior, and the moves quickly sparked backlash from Tesla fans and customers on social media. Analysts told Business Insider the changes were likely aimed at driving adoption of FSD and monetizing the existing user base.\n\n\"I think it's about monetizing FSD. I think they're going to look at more ways to monetize what I view as services, autonomous, and really disruptive technology within their installments,\" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities and a longtime Tesla Bull, told Business Insider ahead of earnings.\n\nMusk has described FSD as crucial to Tesla's future, but the company has struggled to get drivers to pay for it. In October, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja told investors that just 12% of Tesla owners have bought FSD.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taneja said that 1.1 million customers had bought FSD, but added that nearly 70% of those purchases were upfront rather than subscription.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key milestone for Musk's $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to hit 10 million active FSD subscriptions by 2035 for the Tesla CEO to unlock the full payout.\n\nThe most critical part of Tesla's transition to a tech company is its robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot initiatives, which Musk has said will eventually make Tesla the world's most valuable company.\n\nTom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Business Insider that nearly 75% of his long-term valuation of the company was based on robotics and autonomous vehicles, with just 8% coming from car sales. Ives put that figure at 80-90%, adding that he viewed Tesla as an \"autonomous and robotics company\" moving forward.\n\n\"That's why this is such a key transition year for Musk and Tesla. Any delays in autonomous or robotaxis are going to be heavily scrutinized because that's the key to the valuation,\" Ives added.\n\nTesla launched its robotaxi service in Austin last June, and recently began offering some public rides without a safety driver. However, its service in the Texan city is still small, with around 50 active vehicles, according to a community tracker run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna.\n\nMusk said on Wednesday that Tesla would have robotaxis operating in \"somewhere between a quarter and half\" of the US by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval, and the company is set to begin production on its dedicated Cybercab robotaxi in April.\n\nIves added that Tesla's focus this year would be on building out its robotaxi service, noting he didn't expect the company to begin collecting \"meaningful revenue\" from autonomous ride-hailing until 2027.\n\n\"It's important that they get into what I believe will probably be roughly about 30 cities this year. 2026 is the build-out of robotaxis, 2027 is where you'll start to see more monetization,\" Ives said.\n\nOnce Tesla's robotaxi service reaches escape velocity, Narayan said he expects it to transform the company's business model from a traditional carmaker into a high-margin services business more akin to Uber.\n\n\"It dramatically transforms the current auto business, which is a capital-intensive, low-margin business, into a high-margin, much higher revenue business,\" he said. \"The market is bigger and the economics are far better.\"\n\nExecuting that transition will be expensive. Taneja, Tesla's CFO, said on Wednesday that the company expects to spend more than $20 billion this year on new production lines and AI compute infrastructure.\n\nFor Tesla's beleaguered EV business, things look unlikely to improve anytime soon.\n\nAlthough Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market in the US, the end of the $7,500 tax credit in September has caused that market to slow dramatically, with rivals Ford and GM canceling electric models and taking billions of dollars in charges amid warnings of an EV winter.\n\nOutside of the US, Tesla is losing market share to Chinese carmakers such as BYD, which now dominate China's booming EV market and are growing rapidly in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nAutoForecast Solutions' Fiorani said that Tesla ran the risk of a bumpy transition period if its carmaking business declined faster than its robotaxi and services businesses could grow. However, he added that the company may have no choice but to make the leap.\n\nHe pointed to the competition from China and declining income from the regulatory credits that Tesla sells to automakers who have failed to sell enough EVs as evidence that the company's automotive business was running out of road.\n\n\"Musk sees the future of this business as robots and autonomous vehicles,\" Fiorani said.\n\n\"The physical products themselves, the cars and the automotive side, are all legacy products,\" he added. \"We're going to see them going forward to autonomous software, autonomous hardware, things that will move them into the next generation.\"",

    "title": "Tesla takes another leap toward becoming a physical AI company: Here are the 6 biggest takeaways from its Q4 earnings call.",
    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a $2B investment into xAI and the discontinuation of Model S and Model X in order to support Optimus robot production.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is making another leap to shed its EV maker title and transform into a full-fledged physical AI outfit.\n\nThe theme of Wednesday's fourth-quarter earnings call heavily centered on how Tesla is investing in its future as an AI and robotics company — a narrative CEO Elon Musk has pushed for some time now.\n\nThe bets included: a major investment in Musk's xAI, updates on the Optimus humanoid robot, and a renewed push for in-house chipmaking. Musk projected that Tesla's future will require a $20 billion investment, which dwarfs the company's $8.5 billion in capex reported for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's automotive segment took a back seat: Musk said he's killing the Model S and Model X to free up room for humanoid robot production. And while Tesla's energy and \"services\" revenue jumped 25% and 18%, respectively, auto revenue fell 11% year-over-year — a clear indication that the quarter's growth came from everywhere but its core EV business.\n\n\"We've updated the Tesla mission to amazing abundance, and this is an attempt to send a message of optimism about the future,\" Musk said during the call.\n\nThe company's stock rose 1.7% after the market closed on Wednesday evening.\n\nHere are 6 biggest takeaways from the earnings call.\n\nTesla made good on its pledge to investors and announced a $2 billion investment into xAI, the startup behind Grok. It's part of a larger $20 billion Series E funding round from January.\n\nThe expectation of the investment is a deeper collaboration between the two companies. xAI, which has been expanding its data center footprint, could provide the compute and other technical capabilities to further advance Tesla's autonomous vehicle and robotics agenda.\n\nVaibhav Taneja, Tesla's chief financial officer, said during the call that the agreement with xAI is in the spirit of finding \"efficient ways for others to help us.\"\n\nIn a surprise move, Musk announced that production of the Model S and Model X would be discontinued by the next quarter, closing a chapter on the company's premium SUV and sedan.\n\nThat leaves the EV maker with four cars: the Cybertruck, the more popular Model 3 and Model Y, and the yet-to-be-released Cybercab.\n\nThe CEO said during the call that the move will provide more production space in Tesla's Fremont factory for Optimus robots.\n\nThe \"long-term goal\" is to produce a million units a year with the freed-up space, Musk said.\n\nThe CEO added that killing the Model S and Model X is part of Tesla's \"overall shift to an autonomous future,\" which includes the company's ride-hailing service, Tesla Robotaxi, and autonomy in personally owned vehicles through Full Self-Driving, an advanced driver assistance system.\n\nTesla expects to start production of the Cybercab, a two-seater coupe, in April for eventual integration into its Robotaxi fleet.\n\nTesla revealed where it aims to expand the Robotaxi ride-hailing service in the first half of 2026 — Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas — but has yet to announce when it will remove the safety monitors inside the cars for public riders across Austin and San Francisco Bay Area, where the service now operates.\n\nMusk said that FSD — the technology that Tesla says will make personally owned vehicles fully autonomous — is already \"100% unsupervised\" and operating without humans inside. The difference, he said, is that Tesla is being \"very cautious\" with rolling out unsupervised service to the public, though Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides in Austin this month.\n\n\"There's like some pretty nutty intersections, where there are a lot of humans who make mistakes and have accidents in various cities,\" Musk said. \"So we want to make sure that FSD can handle those unusual intersections.\"\n\nThere wasn't much of a progress report on Tesla's AI5 chip, but the CEO said he's spending part of his weekends working on it.\n\n\"If I'm spending my Saturdays on something, it's going to be something pretty important,\" Musk said, adding that chip procurement is \"existential\" for Tesla's future, going so far as to bring up the Tesla \"Terafab\" — his aspirational idea of building an in-house chip manufacturing plant.\n\nMusk said he wants to build a factory that integrates \"logic, memory, and packaging\" because Tesla will be \"fundamentally limited by supply chain\" if it doesn't.\n\nMusk said he expects to unveil an Optimus 3 robot in a \"few months,\" but don't expect it to be working the assembly lines just yet.\n\nThe CEO said Optimus isn't contributing to Tesla's manufacturing work in any \"material way\" and that the humanoid robot is only in the factory for training purposes.\n\nMusk talked a lot about Tesla's future, but the company's fourth-quarter performance still hinged on its tangible businesses, such as its energy segment, which includes the Megapack, a utility-scale battery system, and the Powerwall, the home battery system.\n\n\"On the energy front, we achieved yet another record in terms of gross profits for the quarter and ended the year with nearly $12.8 billion in revenue,\" Taneja, the Tesla CFO, said.\n\nTesla also announced this month that it will pivot FSD to a subscription-based only model starting in February. Customers previously had the option to buy FSD upfront for $8,000.\n\nThe move is a clear signal that Tesla sees FSD as a key future revenue generator.\n\nAutomakers are increasingly betting that software subscription services will be a critical source of recurring revenue with higher margins. General Motors revealed that its vehicle software generated $2 billion in the past nine months.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker will discontinue the Model S and X, Tesla's premium sedan and SUV offerings, in the next quarter.",
    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the company will be discontinuing the Model S and X in the next quarter, bringing an end to the EV maker's more premium SUV and sedan models.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" the CEO said during Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nMusk said Tesla is replacing the Model S and Model X production lines in its Fremont Factory in California with an Optimus factory, with the long-term goal being to produce one million robots a year.\n\nTesla will continue to support the Model S and Model X vehicles for as long as people have them, Musk said, adding that for people interested in owning one, \"now would be the time to order it.\"\n\nThe CEO said the shift was \"slightly sad\" but part of the company's \"overall shift to an autonomous future.\"\n\nTesla's stock was up on Wednesday after the company beat earnings expectations and announced it would invest $2 billion into xAI, Musk's AI company. Tesla also announced it plans to release the third generation of its Optimus robot later this quarter.\n\nThe Model S and Model X are some of Tesla's oldest models, as well as its priciest.\n\nTesla unveiled a prototype for the Model S, a sedan, in 2009 and began deliveries to customers in 2012. The Model X, an SUV, was announced in 2012, with first deliveries going out in 2015.\n\nBoth models received upgrades in 2025, including an increase in driving range, better noise cancellation, and smoother suspension, as well as a price increase of $4,500. However, the upgrades did not include some of the more innovative technologies that were introduced with Tesla's Cybertruck.\n\nThe starting price on Tesla's site for the Model S was $94,990 as of Wednesday, or $109,990 for the more premium Plaid version. The Model X was $99,990, or $114,990 for Plaid.",

    "fullText": "World’s richest person targeting symbolic date in June for flotation of rocket company\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is considering a flotation valuing the rocket company at $1.5tn (£1.1tn) that will reportedly be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and the multibillionaire’s birthday.\n\nThe world’s richest person is targeting a symbolic date of mid-June for the initial public offering, according to the Financial Times. This would be around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other and shortly before Musk turns 55 on 28 June.\n\nThe FT also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $50bn – valuing it at $1.5tn – compared with previous reports that it was looking for $25bn at an $800bn valuation. Last week, it was reported that the rocket company was considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in the share sale.\n\nMusk, whose $680bn fortune would be turbo-boosted by a SpaceX flotation, said last year the company’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa. The billionaire owns about 42% of SpaceX, as well as nearly 17% of the electric carmaker Tesla, where he is chief executive. He also owns more than three-quarters of the social media platform X.\n\nSpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service.\n\nIf the flotation goes ahead it would involve a bigger initial fundraising than the IPO of the oil company Saudi Aramco, which raised $29bn in 2019, although for a larger total valuation of $1.7tn.\n\nThe chief financial officer of SpaceX, Bret Johnsen, has held talks and video conference calls with existing private investors since December to explore a mid-2026 IPO, the FT added.\n\nMusk has reportedly been swayed by the idea of a SpaceX float because of its growing valuation and the success of Starlink.\n\nGlobal financial markets are anticipating a year of significant US listings, with the artificial intelligence companies Anthropic and OpenAI also laying early groundwork for potential IPOs.\n\nA rebound in the US equity capital market activity began in 2025 after three years of limited activity, partly as the result of volatility and geopolitical tensions. Space technology is a tightly held sector but is sought after by investors keen for exposure in light of rapid development prospects, analysts have said.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said the mooted $1.5tn price tag was a “monster premium”.\n\nHe added: “A valuation that big reflects not just a tech and AI premium but Elon Musk’s stardust and a frothy market, plus a heck of a lot of media narrative around this. It is to some degree a kind of bet on the future space economy.”\n\nSpaceX has been approached for comment.",

Khosla has fought for years against public access to Martins Beach, which runs through his $37 million estate, and has filed multiple lawsuits over the issue.\n\nKhosla and Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe two billionaires have clashed before.

    "fullText": "Free and fast in-flight WiFi could be available on every plane within five years, according to the airline boss who argued with Elon Musk over Starlink.\n\n\"I think as the WiFi technology improves over the next four or five years, we'll all be offering free WiFi access,\" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said during an earnings call on Monday.\n\n\"Customers will use it if it's free, but if they have to pay for it, they won't use it.\"\n\nThe Irish budget airline is known for its no-frills offering and dedication to keeping costs low. In the last quarter, it had an average airfare of 44 euros — about $52 — while reporting after-tax profits of 115 million euros ($137 million) before an exceptional charge for a fine.\n\nIn recent months, many airlines have signed deals with Starlink, which can provide in-flight internet speeds of over 200 Mbps — faster than many home WiFi connections.\n\nHowever, for Ryanair and O'Leary, cheap tickets are more important for winning customers.\n\n\"I have no doubt in my mind that a low fare will beat free WiFi on board every single time,\" the CEO told investors.\n\nHis weeklong quarrel with Musk was sparked by questions about the extra fuel costs incurred by installing a Starlink terminal on an airplane.\n\nO'Leary said the aerodynamic drag would lead to a 2% increase, costing over $200 million a year and raising ticket prices. However, a SpaceX executive said in an X post that the increase was only 0.3%.\n\nEither way, O'Leary said on Monday, any extra fuel costs would be unacceptable.\n\nHe said that Ryanair would add in-flight WiFI \"in a heartbeat\" if the technology improves so that antennae don't need to be installed outside an airplane's fuselage.\n\nO'Leary suggested that, in the next few years, such antennae could instead be installed in the hold.\n\nRyanair is continuing discussions with Starlink, Amazon, and the British telecoms firm Vodafone, he said.\n\nSome of these operators believe that at least half of passengers would pay for in-flight WiFi, O'Leary said on the call, but he thinks no more than 10% would do so.\n\nEvery Starlink-airline deal so far has included free access for all passengers, although many mandate signing up for loyalty programs.\n\nRyanair's spat with Musk also garnered \"lots of free publicity,\" O'Leary said. The outspoken boss and the airline's social media team are known for making provocative comments to get attention.\n\nThe airline's press conference last week, promoting a sale in the wake of the argument, was covered by some 1,500 news articles across nearly 60 countries, O'Leary said on the call.",

    "description": "My front camera had problems with condensation, especially in direct, low sunlight. Tesla cleaned it, but this could be a challenge for full autonomy.",
    "fullText": "Tesla offered a free trial of its FSD system in December. I was driven autonomously for most of the month and came away with new insights.\n\nThe latest software was impressive, but my experience revealed a glaring problem that could hamper Tesla's path toward a full, unsupervised Robotaxi service.\n\nFirst, the good stuff. I have a Model 3 Performance with HW4 hardware. It doesn't have a camera near the front bumper, but otherwise it's modern hardware. I also have an up-to-date version of FSD.\n\nThis combination resulted in an amazing FSD experience. I drove from Silicon Valley to Lake Tahoe in supervised autonomous mode and had no issues. I drove into SF and back several times, trouble-free.\n\nI estimate 90% to 95% of my driving was in FSD mode during December. It's a new state of driving that I think is safer than human driving. I spend less time worrying about where I'm going and which turn to make. Instead, my eyes are on the road and my hands are ready near the wheel, just in case.\n\nDespite the ability to text while being driven now, I pay more attention to the road in FSD mode, not less.\n\nA surprise bonus: I argue (OK, debate!) less with my wife about directions when we are on FSD-powered trips together. There's no discussion about whether this or that route is better. FSD just does it. This reduces the potential for marital spats. That's probably worth the entire $100-a-month FSD subscription cost.\n\nWhen Tesla told me my month-long trial was ending, I was genuinely disappointed. Do I pay monthly now? No. But I don't drive enough at the moment. If my wife's or my commute becomes much longer, we would certainly pay.\n\nThis was all supervised autonomous driving. That means Tesla requires human owners to be at the wheel and alert at all times.\n\nUnsupervised autonomy is the next frontier. That's when cars drive themselves with no human at the wheel. Waymo already does this in Silicon Valley and a few other urban areas in the US. Tesla's Robotaxi service started doing this in Austin recently, but elsewhere, these Robotaxis still have safety drivers behind the wheel.\n\nMaking this leap is a huge feat. And Tesla is trying to do this with a purely camera-based system, while Waymo uses cameras, Lidar, and other sensors that are not just vision-based.\n\nThis is the big schism in the industry. Backers of the multi-sensor approach say their systems are better and safer because components such as Lidar collect data without \"seeing,\" so they work in more environments. However, this is more expensive than camera-only systems.\n\nTesla's approach is cheaper, so that's good for efficiently mass-producing millions of robotaxis, such as the upcoming Cybercab. But, can camera-only systems actually work as well in unsupervised situations?\n\nThis is where my December FSD experience sowed some seeds of doubt in my mind. To be clear, I'm not an expert. I'm a huge fan of my Tesla vehicle, and I hope both autonomous approaches work and make roads safer. Still, here's what happened last month.\n\nThe main front camera at the top of my windshield sometimes gets condensation, dust, or dirt inside the glass and plastic compartment.\n\nA couple of times, when I was in FSD mode and being driven into the low sun, I got a loud, red warning sign on the screen of my Tesla telling me to take over immediately or the system would pull over. I took the wheel quickly with no further issues and restarted FSD soon after.\n\nBut these incidents were slightly unsettling. My interpretation is that sunlight was streaming into the front camera compartment, and the glare was combining with condensation and/or dust to degrade the quality of the images being collected.\n\nA week or so later, I got an alert from Tesla to bring my vehicle in for a service. The goal was to clean the inside of the front camera. I set up an appointment, which the Tesla app told me would cost $60.\n\nI took it to a nearby Tesla location, and the cleaning lasted about an hour. Tesla didn't charge me. After that, I didn't get any red warning signs for the rest of December while using FSD.\n\nThis front camera is not easy to clean because it has a housing around it, which might also trap moisture that could otherwise dissipate more easily from the car's interior.\n\nIf Tesla wants its cars to be fully unsupervised Robotaxis, a front interior camera that fogs up and needs to be professionally cleaned seems like a potentially big problem. With a million Robotaxis on the road, how many times might Tesla service employees have to clean these cameras?\n\nThis also suggests that a multi-sensor approach — that doesn't 100% rely on cameras that need cleaning — might be a better way to attain full autonomy at scale.\n\nThere are signs that Tesla may already be responding to this issue, as it gets more experience running its Robotaxi service.\n\nIn September, Elon Musk wrote on X that keeping the front camera clean is \"a major area of focus.\"\n\nAbout a month later, the company rolled out a software update that enabled the windshield wipers to do extra wiping around the front camera. You can see it in action here. That only addressed exterior dirt and moisture, though.\n\nMore recently, Tesla Robotaxis have been spotted with new cleaning systems that squirt water onto the outside cameras to clean them.\n\nMore importantly, there's a new setup for the front camera behind the windshield, according to photos posted on X recently by Tesla investor and owner Sawyer Merritt.\n\n\"Black lines surrounding the entire front camera housing, which could mean improved sealing to prevent off-gassing inside the car from fogging the cameras, potentially eliminating the need for Tesla to perform front camera cleanings (just speculation),\" he wrote.\n\nAnother Tesla owner posted a photo this week of a new Model Y with an updated front camera housing.\n\nTesla also has a patent for a new way of preventing front camera glare, for use in autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles.\n\n\"The glare shield features a textured surface composed of an array of micro-cones, or cone-shaped formations, which serve to scatter incident light in various directions, thereby reducing glare and improving camera vision,\" Tesla wrote in the patent filing.\n\nIt's unclear how well these fixes will work. But Tesla is obviously trying hard to address these challenges. Its camera-only approach depends on it.\n\nI asked Tesla and Elon Musk all about this on Monday in a detailed email. They didn't respond by publication time on Tuesday morning.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Michael Strnad, 33, has scored a bigger wealth gain than anyone except Elon Musk this year after his defense company went public on Friday.",
    "fullText": "A millennial defense chief has racked up more wealth in the first few weeks of 2026 than anyone except Elon Musk.\n\nMichal Strnad, 33, has grown $22 billion richer since the start of January, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Only the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who is up $70 billion year to date, has built more wealth over that period.\n\nStrnad's net worth has soared 150% to $37 billion in less than a month, vaulting him into 64th place on the rich list. He's now wealthier than Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin, SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son, and steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal.\n\nHis wealth surge was sparked by the listing of his company, Czechoslovak Group, in Amsterdam on Friday. CSG secured a public valuation north of $30 billion with Strnad selling about $3 billion worth of his shares in the IPO, paring his ownership from virtually 100% to 85%.\n\nAs a defense executive in his 30s, Strnad stands out among the 10 greatest wealth gainers this year, many of whom are much older and have software fortunes. That list includes Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy, 81, and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both 52.\n\nBloomberg updated Strnad's net worth based on his CSG stake. It previously relied on CSG's financials and its defense peers' valuation multiples.\n\nCSG's website shows it started as Excalibur Army, a company founded by Strnad's father in 1995 to manufacture land equipment for military, police, and emergency services.\n\nStrnad joined the business in 2011, became CEO in 2013, and took ownership in 2018. He has broadened CSG's focus and footprint: it now employs over 14,000 people across eight countries and operates in the auto, aerospace, railway, and defense industries.\n\nCSG has expanded largely through acquisitions, including Tatra Trucks, shotgun-maker Perazzi, and The Kinetic Group, which owns the Federal and Remington ammo brands.\n\nStrnad's company also owns a training academy for helicopter pilots and ground personnel in Slovakia, runs a munitions plant in Spain, and holds a license from General Dynamics' European arm to build Pandur armored vehicles.\n\nDefense stocks have outperformed in recent years thanks to greater defense-spending commitments from governments, and the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza conflicts boosting demand for military equipment.",
