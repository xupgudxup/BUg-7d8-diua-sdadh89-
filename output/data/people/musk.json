    "description": "A video circulating online appeared to show a Tesla Model Y robotaxi with no safety monitor inside driving on Austin streets.",
    "fullText": "An X user recorded a Tesla Model Y driving through Austin's streets on Sunday that appears to show no one, not even a safety monitor, inside.\n\nSince Tesla launched its robotaxi in Austin in June, the driverless cars have always included a human in the passenger seat.\n\nThe video generated a fair amount of excitement online from Tesla watchers, some of whom immediately went to their app to order a robotaxi to see whether it would include a safety monitor (they did).\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk later said on Sunday that the company is now testing driverless taxis without human safety operators, though it appears not yet on actual paying customers.\n\n\"Testing is underway with no occupants in the car,\" Musk wrote in response to the X user who posted the original video.\n\nTesla itself responded to the video with \"Just saying.\"\n\nTesla's AI chief, Ashok Elluswamy, also responded. \"And so it begins!\" he wrote on X on Sunday.\n\nA driverless Tesla Robotaxi was spotted on the roads of Austin, Texas today.No one in the car. No safety driver.Fully autonomous.This is actually happening. pic.twitter.com/MSmRaeyJwj\n\nAccording to Robotaxi Tracker — run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna — there are 31 active vehicles in Austin, up from 29 in November. Speaking on the \"All-In\" podcast in October, Musk said that Tesla was aiming to increase its robotaxi fleet to 500 cars in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nMusk said in a video call at an xAI \"hackathon\" event last week that Tesla would remove human safety monitors from its robotaxi cars by the end of the year, according to Teslarati, a news site focused on Musk-run companies.\n\n\"There will be Tesla robotaxis operating in Austin with no one in them, not even anyone in the passenger seat, in about three weeks,\" Musk said, the outlet reported.\n\nWhen Business Insider tested a robotaxi in Austin in July, it required multiple interventions from the safety monitor in the passenger seat, including at one point when the car went the wrong way on a one-way street.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Tesla-investor-turned-bear Ross Gerber says that Elon Musk needs to show results on the company's biggest initiatives in 2026 or face investor backlash.",
    "fullText": "Ross Gerber, an early backer of Tesla, is worried about the future of Elon Musk's car company.\n\nGerber doesn't hold back about what he thinks is the EV maker's biggest issue: its autonomous driving technology. Failure to live up to expectations would be a blow to investors' bull thesis for Tesla, which is pegged in large part to the success of its self-driving cars.\n\nGerber, the founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, has been a vocal Tesla bear all year. His perspective hasn't changed as Musk's company has rolled out driverless cars in cities across the US, and what he's seen has actually made him more concerned.\n\nGerber told Business Insider why he thinks 2026 will be a pivotal year for the EV maker, in which Musk will be forced to show real progress on the lofty goals he's set for Tesla.\n\nAnyone who follows Gerber knows that he has gone from a Musk supporter to an outspoken Tesla bear in recent years. He's publicly called for Musk to resign and criticized his focus on other ventures, such as his time leading the Department of Government Efficiency and his efforts to buy X before that.\n\nMusk stepped away from government months ago, but Gerber maintains that the time he spent away from his companies is still hurting Tesla stock, particularly as the it dukes it out with competitors in the self-driving car market.\n\n\"The year that Elon took off from Tesla really cost Tesla a year,\" Gerber told Business Insider.\n\nIn that time, Tesla's chief competitor, Waymo, has continued to dominate the self-driving car market. Gerber attributes this to Musk's refusal to use LidAR technology in Tesla's vehicles, a remote sensing method that has helped Waymo increase the safety of its cars on the road.\n\n\"Waymo has expanded rapidly in our area,\" he said. \"So Tesla has to accept, if they just throw a couple sensors on and improve their hardware system, they can solve full self-driving next month.\"\n\nHowever, Gerber thinks that Musk will continue to favor the use of AI and cameras. And since Musk has staked much of Tesla's future on its self-driving car technology, he thinks this approach is about to start costing the company.\n\nOverall, Gerber thinks that 2026 will be the year Musk needs to show investors results of Tesla's many initiatives or face backlash from the market.\n\n\"I've been saying this for some time, next year is kind of like the come-to-Jesus year for Tesla,\" he said.\n\nMusk has said that self-driving technology is Tesla's future, but so far, the company has struggled to get drivers to actually pay for it.\n\nGerber added that he sees Google and Waymo's parent company, Alphabet, as the best stock to buy for gaining exposure to the self-driving car market, due to Waymo's edge over Tesla and Alphabet's resources.\n\nHis bullish thesis on Waymo centers on the company's strong presence in major US cities, which is expanding while Tesla has only just begun its rollout this year.\n\n\"Google has the money and they're not going to wait,\" Gerber said. \"They know they can scale, so for Tesla to catch them, they would need this to work right away, basically, and then they need to start building infrastructure.\"\n\nAnother problem Gerber sees is one he's brought up before, which is Musk's public perception. That might be a problem even if Tesla catches up to competitors in key areas like autonomous driving. Gerber thinks the image of Musk has yet to recover since his foray into politics sparked divisive views among consumers earlier this year.\n\n\"The image of the company is so negative in people's minds that even if they had cabs everywhere, people would just choose another cab company, because there's plenty to choose,\" he speculated.\n\nGerber noted that he also has strong doubts about the demand for the humanoid robots that Tesla is building, despite Musk's claims that they'll eliminate poverty and be able to perform surgery.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "OpenAI overtook SpaceX as the most valuable private company. SpaceX could soon reclaim the title. It's the latest in the rivalry between Musk and Altman.",
    "fullText": "If Elon Musk and Sam Altman like each other, they hide it well.\n\nIn the latest turn in the rivalry, the two are battling over the top spot on the list of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nWhile the two cofounded OpenAI together back in 2015, the partnership has frayed spectacularly since.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018 and later founded rival startup, xAI. Musk or his company, xAI, has filed lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI held a secondary share sale in October that valued it at $500 billion, taking the lead from Musk's SpaceX by a cool $100 billion.\n\nNot one to cede ground to a rival, Musk is now planning his own secondary share sale at SpaceX, according to an internal letter to employees seen by multiple outlets. It would value the company at a whopping $800 billion. If that happens soon, it means Musk would have only let Altman hold the mantle for a couple of months.\n\nMusk also confirmed on X this week that the company is exploring a blockbuster initial public offering, which might be the only way OpenAI can regain its lead as a private company. OpenAI this year restructured its business, which would allow it to also pursue its own eye-watering IPO in the future.\n\nWhile this valuation battle between the two billionaires is maybe cringeworthy theater for the average earner, it underscores a significant shift: investors are pouring unprecedented money into technologies once viewed as speculative science projects.\n\nSpaceX, which aims to make life multi-planetary and colonize Mars, and OpenAI, which seeks to develop a theoretical AI that can reason like humans, are two of the most visible examples, but they are part of a broader surge in frontier-tech valuations. AI, robotics, and defense tech startups have all notched multibillion-dollar valuations in the past year — bubble be damned.",

    "fullText": "Tesla is piling on incentives for buyers as it aims to end a rocky year on a high.\n\nElon Musk's automaker has introduced a smorgasbord of discounts and deals in the US, with Tesla facing a race against time to avoid a second consecutive year of declining sales.\n\nTesla is offering 0% APR financing for up to 72 months on select Model Y Standard purchases and is also advertising the option to lease a Model Y without a down payment on its website.\n\nBuyers can also trade in a gas car to receive 2,000 miles of free supercharging, and Tesla is offering complimentary upgrades, including premium paint jobs, tow hitches, and 19-inch \"Nova\" wheels valued at up to $1,500 on select inventory vehicles.\n\nTesla often offers more incentives toward the end of the year. But this time, the company is racing to avoid another year of declining sales, following Tesla's first-ever year-over-year fall in sales in 2024.\n\nRepeating that pattern would provide more evidence that Tesla's momentum is stalling after years of rapid growth.\n\nIn October last year, Musk predicted Tesla sales would grow 20-30% in 2025. Tesla needs to sell 555,000 EVs in the final three months of the year — more than it's ever sold in a quarter — just to match its sales figures from last year.\n\nThat's a tall order, with Tesla facing difficulties in all its main markets. The Cybertruck maker's sales have cratered in Europe amid backlash over Musk's politics. In China, Tesla has been squeezed by a wave of competition from local rivals.\n\nTesla also faces major headwinds in the US after the Trump administration scrapped the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September. Tesla's US sales fell 35% between September and October after the tax credit disappeared, according to data from Cox Automotive.\n\nIt comes as Musk has increasingly shifted Tesla's focus toward AI and robotics. The billionaire has described the steering wheel-less Cybercab and Tesla's Optimus robot as the future of the company, with both set to enter production next year.",

    "description": "\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known in part for saying controversial or \"careless\" things, but as the Guardian reported, he recently made a sincerely shocking admission.\n\nOn Dec. 9, Musk appeared on a podcast hosted by Katie Miller, the wife of deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller. During that appearance, the Tesla CEO made a highly unusual set of statements, describing the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was previously run by him, as only \"a little bit successful.\" Miller asked Musk if he would do it all again, and he said he wouldn't.\n\n\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" Musk said, referencing Tesla vandalism.\n\nIn 2025, Musk's involvement in American politics moved beyond funding and into an active government role.\n\nMusk first floated the idea of a \"government efficiency\" division in August 2024, and on Jan. 20, the concept formally became the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nWhat followed was, by all accounts, an immediate frenzy of government cuts. Staffed by individuals as young as 19, none older than 25, DOGE was likened to a \"wrecking ball.\"\n\nWithin a week, more than two million federal civil servants received an email pressuring them to resign from their positions and transition \"to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.\"\n\nMusk repeatedly pledged to cut $1 trillion worth of what he insisted was \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" in Washington, despite scant evidence of the purported problem. One of DOGE's first high-profile actions was to decommission USAID, a humanitarian aid agency.\n\nDOGE \"spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper. Could gone to some great parties. Did that instead,\" Musk posted to X on Feb. 3.\n\nBacklash was swift as food aid was incinerated rather than distributed, and in the spring, Microsoft founder Bill Gates characterized DOGE's targeting of USAID as \"the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children.\"\n\nWould you buy an EV if it only took you five minutes to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nVital funds appropriated by Congress were frozen, in-progress projects were canceled, and DOGE's activity at the Social Security Administration affected disbursements and potentially compromised Americans' data.\n\nAs scenes of chaos unfolded, Musk emphasized his public-facing role, even as critical agencies like the National Weather Service had their funding slashed. Backlash was swift and not limited to the United States.\n\nMusk's role as CEO of Tesla was equally prominent, and the electric vehicle manufacturer's dealerships were protested, with cars and charging stations vandalized.\n\nSales slumped immediately in the U.S. and Europe, and a subsequent NBER study quantified the enormous economic impact Musk's actions inflicted on the Tesla brand.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Over the next two years, the plan is to “deploy” the chatbot to more than 5,000 public schools in an “AI-powered education program”.\n\nxAI’s Grok is more known for referring to itself as “MechaHitler” and espousing far-right conspiracy theories than it is for public education. Over the past year, the chatbot has spewed various antisemitic content, decried “white genocide” and claimed Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nNayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, is now entrusting the chatbot to create curricula in classrooms across the country. Bukele has long embraced technology, making El Salvador the first county in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, and being one of the first Central American presidents to use Twitter, now X, as a platform. He is also known for ruling with an iron fist and working with Trump to incarcerate deportees to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot prison.\n\n“El Salvador doesn’t just wait for the future to happen; we build it,” Bukele said in a statement about the partnership with xAI. “This partnership is destined to deliver something rather extraordinary for all of humanity.”\n\nMusk touted his partnership with Bukele on Thursday. On X, between posts about “white genocide” and blaming asylum seekers for crime, Musk posted comments about Grok being spread throughout El Salvador’s schools.\n\nHe reposted positively to a comment from Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller, in which she wrote: “If we are serious about restoring education to math, science and English – why would we allow left leaning liberal [sic] AI our kids? This unlocks non-woke educational tools for our kids.”\n\nxAI is not the first artificial intelligence company to introduce chatbots to public schools. OpenAI announced a partnership with Estonia in February where it could provide all students and teachers in the country’s secondary school system with a customized ChatGPT. Students in rural Colombia also started using Meta’s AI chatbots in 2023 and within a year, teachers began blaming the tech for low grades and failing exams, according to Rest of World.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, the social media platform, X — and he's also a father of at least 14 children.\n\nAccording to Forbes, he's amassed a fortune worth $491 billion, making him the world's richest person. Musk has said he didn't get there by working a typical 40-hour week, and is instead known to have a strenuous schedule that he said has demanded 120-hour workweeks in the past.\n\nStill, the South African mogul shares similarities with the average person in his typical daily routine. Like many of us, Musk enjoys a sweet treat in the morning and spends time scrolling social media.\n\nHere's how his days usually go, according to interviews and posts by Musk himself over the years.\n\nMusk told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 that he usually goes to bed around 3 a.m. and sleeps for six hours. So, he's typically waking up around 9 a.m. each day.\n\nHe might've been trolling when he wrote a response to a doctor that same year on X saying he eats \"a donut every morning,\" but a quick search of Musk's posts reveals he's quite a fan of the pastry.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in December 2025, he gave an updated glimpse into his morning routine, saying his typical breakfast is \"steak and eggs and coffee.\"\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he was trying to break the cycle of checking his phone as soon as he woke up. While on the Full Send Podcast, Musk described it as \"a terrible habit\" he hoped to escape.\n\nBut, as of 2023, he still wakes up and immediately looks at his phone for emergencies, the Journal reported.\n\nIf his posts on X are any indication, the habit persists. He has been active on the platform since before he acquired it in a $44 billion deal in 2022, often posting at odd hours and in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's unclear if Musk slots in time to post and respond to others each day, but it certainly looks like he rarely takes a day off from the app.\n\n\"Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it's still working,\" Musk told Walter Isaacson in the \"Elon Musk\" biography.\n\nMusk previously credited showering with having the biggest positive effect on his daily life.\n\nDuring an AMA session on Reddit in 2015, a user asked which of his daily habits impacted his life the most.\n\nAs the CEO of one of the leading EV makers in the US, it's no surprise that Musk has more than one option for his daily commute.\n\nWhen an X user posted a meme about deciding between driving a Cybertruck without autopilot or a Tesla Model S with self-driving technology, Musk responded that it's a choice he faces \"every day.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck has been in the backdrop of many celebrity paparazzi shots and Instagram posts since its official launch in November.\n\nLike many, Musk appears to have had ups and downs in his relationship with physical exercise over the years. In 2021, he told Joe Rogan that he'd avoid it altogether if he could.\n\n\"I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air,\" he said on X in June 2023.\n\nBut less than two months later, he said he was \"lifting hard almost every day.\" Around the same time, talk of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg going head-to-head in a fight swirled online.\n\nMusk told Miller during his December 2025 podcast appearance that he often skips lunch or eats something \"small\" for his midday meal.\n\nDinner, though, can be \"anywhere,\" he told the podcast host, who is married to White House advisor Stephen Miller.\n\n\"I like the wide range of cuisine,\" Musk said, with \"American\" food like cheeseburgers and pizza being his favorites.\n\nHe added, \"If I had to say, like, there's only one thing you can ever have for the rest of time, which admittedly would be a bit monotonous, but it would probably be a cheeseburger, because cheeseburgers are amazing. It's a genius invention.\"\n\nNo wonder his Tesla Diner in Hollywood features burgers prominently on the menu.\n\nMusk has admitted on several occasions that running more than one company isn't easy. He splits time between his companies depending on the \"crisis of the moment,\" the 54-year-old said in 2021.\n\nOne X user pointed out in January 2023 that Musk had testified in a lawsuit in the morning, attended an event at a Nevada Tesla factory in the evening, and worked with Tesla on AI at night — all in one day.\n\nMusk responded that he'd also spent time at \"Twitter HQ past midnight.\"\n\nAnd then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.\n\n\"I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work—do that seven days a week,\" Musk told the Journal in 2023. \"I'll have to do that for a while — no choice — but I think once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.\"\n\nOn the Tesla earnings call in April 2024, Musk said: \"Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.\"\n\nAlthough he's not getting eight hours a night, Musk has upped his sleeping schedule from being nearly nonexistent in the past.\n\nIn May 2023, Musk told CNBC that he's no longer pulling all-nighters. Instead, he said he tries to get at least six hours of sleep.\n\nAccording to Isaacson's biography of Musk, the billionaire has spent many nights awake and pondering the issues his companies face. His former partner Claire Boucher — known by her stage name Grimes — also told Isaacson that Musk once stayed up all night playing the \"Elden Ring\" video game when it first came out.\n\nHe has a history of sleeping on the floors of his offices and the Tesla factory.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk all but moved into its San Francisco headquarters. He said there's a couch in the library that he would crash on from time to time.",

    "fullText": "Asked who was the funniest person he knew in real life, Elon Musk had a somewhat surprising answer.\n\n\"You know, President Trump is very funny. He's got a great sense of humor,\" Musk said on an episode of The Katie Miller Podcast released on Tuesday. \"He's very funny, he's like naturally funny. It's somewhat effortless.\"\n\nMusk pointed to President Donald Trump's meeting with New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani last month, when a reporter asked Mamdani if he stood by his opinion that Trump is a \"fascist.\"\n\n\"And the president said, 'Just say yes. It's easier that way,\"' Musk said, breaking into laughter. \"'Don't worry about it. Just say yes.'\"\n\n\"How silly,\" Musk added after further laughter.\n\nElon Musk, who is a South African immigrant who votes in the US, is upset that Somali Americans in Minnesota get to vote. He's also saying that Zohran Mamdani won because the majority of people who voted for him weren't born in America. pic.twitter.com/6mToXTNV8y\n\nMusk's comments marked yet another turn in his evolving relationship with Trump. The two men appear to have mostly put their differences behind them, with Musk even visiting the White House for a dinner last month.\n\nStill, Musk said in that same interview that he wouldn't have led the DOGE effort if he could go back in time, despite believing the effort to be a \"little bit successful.\"\n\n\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically built, you know, worked on my companies, essentially, and the cars — they wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" Musk said.",

    "fullText": "Katie Miller lavished Elon Musk with praise during a fawning interview with the billionaire businessman in which she described how “inspirational” it was to work for him.\n\nThe podcast host, who previously worked at the White House with her husband, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, quit the administration in May to go into the private sector and work directly for Musk.\n\nOn the latest episode of The Katie Miller Podcast, the unusually animated host gushed over her previous boss months after unconfirmed rumors of a relationship between the pair outside the workplace.\n\n“Everyone always thinks you’re a very difficult person to work for,” Miller said, before adding, “I think you’re very kind,” prompting Musk to thank her for the compliment.\n\n“People think, which you are, like, a very demanding boss,” Miller continued. “I’ve never heard you yell at any employee,” she said.\n\n“Yeah, I don’t yell,” Musk replied.\n\nMiller worked as a spokesperson for Musk as he oversaw the so-called Department of Government Efficiency between January and May this year, before leaving with him to work for the billionaire personally, prior to launching her podcast.\n\nThe podcast love-in continued with Miller telling Musk that “every employee who works at every single one of your companies is incredibly mission-driven,” noting that fact was “unlike any other workplace I’ve seen.”\n\nShe went on to single out Musk’s Starbase compound in South Texas, which was created around SpaceX’s rocket development and launch site.\n\n“Like Starbase is the most inspirational place you’ll ever go to, right?” Miller said, before claiming that all his employees are “fiercely loyal.”\n\nShe added, “You are a very good employer to work for and I think people assume you are not.”\n\n“Well, why would they think anyone would work at the companies?” Musk pondered out loud.\n\n“Talented people can go work anywhere they want... if they’re mistreated in some way, they would leave and go work somewhere else.”\n\nMiller’s podcast has struggled to find an audience after three months. Her first interview, with Vice President JD Vance, remains the most popular on YouTube with 85,000 views. Her lowest-viewed episode has been viewed a dismal 2,700 times.\n\nThe Musk interview has already scored more views in six hours than last week’s episode with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his third wife, Jen, has clocked up in an entire week.\n\nWhen news of Miller’s resignation from her husband’s place of work first emerged, the Democrats taunted Trump’s deputy chief of staff with an image of an empty chair in a hotel room, appearing to suggest there was trouble in the marriage.\n\n.@StephenM: https://t.co/IjFdietRgU pic.twitter.com/ndcIsPHWFd\n\n— Democrats (@TheDemocrats) May 30, 2025\n\nDuring the podcast, the pair avoided discussion of a mishap in June on Musk’s social media platform, X, where a fake screenshot of Musk bragging that he “took” Miller’s wife went viral online, forcing the billionaire to correct his own AI assistant, Grok.\n\nThe AI assistant claimed, “The post from Elon Musk likely existed and was deleted,” noting that the “metrics and context align with Musk’s behavior.”\n\n“The evidence leans toward the post being real but removed, consistent with Musk’s pattern of deleting controversial posts.”\n\nMusk then intervened, replying “No, it’s fake ffs… I never posted this.” Miller never directly commented on the whispers.",

    "description": "Elon Musk said he wouldn't participate in the DOGE office again, adding that it was only \"somewhat\" successful in saving taxpayer money.",
    "fullText": "If he could do it all over again, Elon Musk says he wouldn't have participated in DOGE.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, a new office created at the beginning of President Donald Trump's second term, was only \"somewhat successful\" at saving taxpayer money, and Musk believes he could have better spent his time focused on his various business ventures.\n\n\"I guess I couldn't believe I was there for the most part. It's like — it all seemed extremely surreal at the time,\" Musk told Miller, who is married to Stephen Miller, who currently serves as White House deputy chief of staff.\n\nThe name DOGE itself, Musk said, was made up \"based on internet suggestions,\" and, while he still agrees that it's a worthwhile cause to try to slow government spending, he doesn't see his efforts as particularly effective during the months he worked alongside the Trump administration.\n\n\"We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful,\" Musk said. \"I mean, we stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was just entirely wasteful. For example, there was probably $100, maybe $200 billion worth of zombie payments per year, which simply by enforcing that there be a payment code and an explanation for the payment, the payment would not go out.\"\n\nWhile Musk had initially projected DOGE would save an estimated $2 trillion, he later revised his estimate to project nearly $150 billion in spending cuts for the 2026 fiscal year before he stepped back from the office in April, Business Insider has previously reported.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how much the office ultimately saved before it quietly disbanded in July, an August analysis by Politico verified $1.4 billion in confirmed contract cancellations and a decrease in federal spending.\n\nWhen asked directly by Miller whether he'd participate in the DOGE office if he could repeat history, Musk thought for just a moment before sighing and saying he would not.\n\n\"No, I don't think so. Would I do it? I think I probably — I don't know,\" Musk said. \"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically built, you know, worked on my companies, essentially, and the cars — they wouldn't have been burning the cars.\"\n\nMusk faced intense public backlash and was the subject of numerous protests, including vandalism against Tesla, as a result of his work with the Trump administration. Musk described the backlash as \"a very strong reaction\" to his attempt to stop \"political corruption.\"\n\nThe fallout was also concerning to Tesla investors, some of whom worried Musk was spending too much time at the White House and not enough on the electric-vehicle maker.\n\n\"We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin, and it's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else,\" Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider in March.\n\nTesla's stock plummeted in the first half of the year but began to rally after Musk announced he'd be leaving DOGE and officially stepped away in May. As of market close Tuesday, Tesla's stock was up over 17% this year.\n\nMusk's relationship with Trump soured in June after Musk criticized the president's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" The pair publicly feuded for months, but Business Insider reported in November that the tension between the two had eased recently, and Musk was invited to Trump's White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
