    "description": "Michael Strnad, 33, has scored a bigger wealth gain than anyone except Elon Musk this year after his defense company went public on Friday.",
    "fullText": "A millennial defense chief has racked up more wealth in the first few weeks of 2026 than anyone except Elon Musk.\n\nMichal Strnad, 33, has grown $22 billion richer since the start of January, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Only the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who is up $70 billion year to date, has built more wealth over that period.\n\nStrnad's net worth has soared 150% to $37 billion in less than a month, vaulting him into 64th place on the rich list. He's now wealthier than Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin, SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son, and steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal.\n\nHis wealth surge was sparked by the listing of his company, Czechoslovak Group, in Amsterdam on Friday. CSG secured a public valuation north of $30 billion with Strnad selling about $3 billion worth of his shares in the IPO, paring his ownership from virtually 100% to 85%.\n\nAs a defense executive in his 30s, Strnad stands out among the 10 greatest wealth gainers this year, many of whom are much older and have software fortunes. That list includes Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy, 81, and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both 52.\n\nBloomberg updated Strnad's net worth based on his CSG stake. It previously relied on CSG's financials and its defense peers' valuation multiples.\n\nCSG's website shows it started as Excalibur Army, a company founded by Strnad's father in 1995 to manufacture land equipment for military, police, and emergency services.\n\nStrnad joined the business in 2011, became CEO in 2013, and took ownership in 2018. He has broadened CSG's focus and footprint: it now employs over 14,000 people across eight countries and operates in the auto, aerospace, railway, and defense industries.\n\nCSG has expanded largely through acquisitions, including Tatra Trucks, shotgun-maker Perazzi, and The Kinetic Group, which owns the Federal and Remington ammo brands.\n\nStrnad's company also owns a training academy for helicopter pilots and ground personnel in Slovakia, runs a munitions plant in Spain, and holds a license from General Dynamics' European arm to build Pandur armored vehicles.\n\nDefense stocks have outperformed in recent years thanks to greater defense-spending commitments from governments, and the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza conflicts boosting demand for military equipment.",

    "title": "Elon Musk's X Faces EU Inquiry over Sexualized AI Images Generated by Grok",
    "description": "Regulators said the company’s lack of controls had led to the widespread use of deepfakes created with the chatbot Grok.",
    "fullText": "European Union regulators on Monday announced an investigation of Elon Musk’s social media platform X after the authorities said that it had failed to stop the spread of sexualized images generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe inquiry is likely to escalate a confrontation between Europe and the United States over the regulation of online content. Mr. Musk and his allies in the Trump administration have sharply criticized European Union internet regulations as an attack on free speech and American companies.\n\nThe European authorities said that X was being investigated for possible violation of the Digital Services Act, alleging that the company had not properly addressed the “systemic risks” of integrating the A.I. chatbot Grok into its service. Starting in late December, sexually explicit images generated by Grok, including of children, flooded the service, drawing worldwide criticism from victims and regulators.\n\nMr. Musk was facing mounting scrutiny in Europe even before this latest Grok controversy. Last month, X was fined 120 million euros, or about $140 million, for violating Digital Services Act rules around deceptive design, advertising transparency and data sharing with outside researchers.\n\nThe European authorities have another investigation underway about X’s recommender algorithm and policies for preventing the spread of illicit content.\n\n“Nonconsensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,” Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission executive vice president who oversees enforcement of the Digital Service Act, said in a statement. “We will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the D.S.A., or whether it treated rights of European citizens — including those of women and children — as collateral damage of its service.”\n\nThe European Commission, the executive body for the 27-nation European Union, did not give a timeline for the investigation, but said that it had the authority to order X to make changes during the inquiry in the “absence of meaningful adjustments” to the service.\n\nA spokeswoman for X referred to a previous statement the company had made about Grok. “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity and unwanted sexual content,” the statement said.\n\nThe latest investigation illustrates a growing divide between the European Union and the United States over free speech and regulation of the internet. European officials argue that the lack of safeguards on platforms like X has allowed hate speech, misogyny and violent content to flourish online. Mr. Musk and the Trump administration have said efforts to force the companies to more proactively police the services amounts to censorship.\n\nThe Digital Services Act, passed in 2022, requires companies to meaningfully address the spread of illegal content, the definition of which varies from country to country in the European Union. It can include material that targets individuals based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or religion.\n\nEuropean regulators said that the integration of Grok into X exposed “citizens in the E.U. to serious harm.” The British authorities are also investigating the issue.\n\nThe problems began last month. In response to simple user prompts on X, the chatbot automatically created and publicly posted manipulated photographs of real people, including children, to remove their clothes, put them in skimpy clothing or pose them in sexualized situations.\n\nAs criticism grew, X limited Grok’s A.I. image creation to users who paid for premium features, which reduced the number of images. X later expanded those guardrails, saying that it would no longer allow anyone to prompt Grok’s X account for “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.”\n\nEuropean Union regulators said that they would take X’s policy changes into account during the investigation.",

    "fullText": "Investigation comes after Elon Musk’s firm sparked outrage by allowing users to ‘strip’ photos of women and children\n\nThe European Commission has launched an investigation into Elon Musk’s X over the production of sexually explicit images and the spreading of possible child sexual abuse material by the platform’s AI chatbot feature, Grok.\n\nThe formal inquiry, launched on Monday, also extends an investigation into X’s recommender systems, algorithms that help users discover new content.\n\nGrok has sparked international outrage by allowing users to digitally strip women and children and put them into provocative poses. Grok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appeared to depict children, according to researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate.\n\nThe commission said its new investigation would “assess whether the company properly assessed and mitigated risks” stemming from Grok’s functionalities in the EU, including risks on the sharing of illegal content such as manipulated sexually explicit images and “content that may amount to” child sexual abuse material.\n\nThe investigation is launched under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), a relatively new piece of legislation that is intended to protect internet users from a wide range of harms.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, an official said the commission had not been convinced by mitigating measures put in place by X to remedy the issue. EU officials are investigating whether X has systems to mitigate risks properly.\n\nAnnouncing the investigation, Henna Virkkunen, the commission’s top official for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said: “Non-consensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation. With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens – including those of women and children – as collateral damage of its service.”\n\nRegina Doherty, an Irish MEP, said she welcomed the formal investigation. “When credible reports emerge of AI systems being used in ways that harm women and children, it is essential that EU law is examined and enforced without delay,” Doherty said.\n\nIn response to the investigation, X provided a link to a statement it published on 14 January: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.”",

    "fullText": "Guardian found OpenAI’s platform cited Grokipedia on topics including Iran and Holocaust deniers\n\nThe latest model of ChatGPT has begun to cite Elon Musk’s Grokipedia as a source on a wide range of queries, including on Iranian conglomerates and Holocaust deniers, raising concerns about misinformation on the platform.\n\nIn tests done by the Guardian, GPT-5.2 cited Grokipedia nine times in response to more than a dozen different questions. These included queries on political structures in Iran, such as salaries of the Basij paramilitary force and the ownership of the Mostazafan Foundation, and questions on the biography of Sir Richard Evans, a British historian and expert witness against Holocaust denier David Irving in his libel trial.\n\nGrokipedia, launched in October, is an AI-generated online encyclopedia that aims to compete with Wikipedia, and which has been criticised for propagating rightwing narratives on topics including gay marriage and the 6 January insurrection in the US. Unlike Wikipedia, it does not allow direct human editing, instead an AI model writes content and responds to requests for changes.\n\nChatGPT did not cite Grokipedia when prompted directly to repeat misinformation about the insurrection, about media bias against Donald Trump, or about the HIV/Aids epidemic – areas where Grokipedia has been widely reported to promote falsehoods. Instead, Grokipedia’s information filtered into the model’s responses when it was prompted about more obscure topics.\n\nFor instance, ChatGPT, citing Grokipedia, repeated stronger claims about the Iranian government’s links to MTN-Irancell than are found on Wikipedia – such as asserting that the company has links to the office of Iran’s supreme leader.\n\nChatGPT also cited Grokipedia when repeating information that the Guardian has debunked, namely details about Sir Richard Evans’ work as an expert witness in David Irving’s trial.\n\nGPT-5.2 is not the only large language model (LLM) that appears to be citing Grokipedia; anecdotally, Anthropic’s Claude has also referenced Musk’s encyclopedia on topics from petroleum production to Scottish ales.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the model’s web search “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints”.\n\n“We apply safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms, and ChatGPT clearly shows which sources informed a response through citations,” they said, adding that they had ongoing programs to filter out low-credibility information and influence campaigns.\n\nAnthropic did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut the fact that Grokipedia’s information is filtering – at times very subtly – into LLM responses is a concern for disinformation researchers. Last spring, security experts raised concerns that malign actors, including Russian propaganda networks, were churning out massive volumes of disinformation in an effort to seed AI models with lies, a process called “LLM grooming”.\n\nIn June, concerns were raised in the US Congress that Google’s Gemini repeated the Chinese government’s position on human rights abuses in Xinjiang and China’s Covid-19 policies.\n\nNina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who has worked on LLM grooming, said ChatGPT’s citing Grokipedia raised similar concerns. While Musk may not have intended to influence LLMs, Grokipedia entries she and colleagues had reviewed were “relying on sources that are untrustworthy at best, poorly sourced and deliberate disinformation at worst”, she said.\n\nAnd the fact that LLMs cite sources such as Grokipedia or the Pravda network may, in turn, improve these sources’ credibility in the eyes of readers. “They might say, ‘oh, ChatGPT is citing it, these models are citing it, it must be a decent source, surely they’ve vetted it’ – and they might go there and look for news about Ukraine,” said Jankowicz.\n\nBad information, once it has filtered into an AI chatbot, can be challenging to remove. Jankowicz recently found that a large news outlet had included a made-up quote from her in a story about disinformation. She wrote to the news outlet asking for the quote to be removed, and posted about the incident on social media.\n\nThe news outlet removed the quote. However, AI models for some time continued to cite it as hers. “Most people won’t do the work necessary to figure out where the truth actually lies,” she said.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for xAI, the owner of Grokipedia, said: “Legacy media lies.”",

    "description": "Tesla removed its Autopilot basic self-driving software as a standard feature in the US on new Model Y and Model 3 purchases as the company pushes its more advanced FSD (full-self driving) subscriptions.",
    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) removed its Autopilot basic self-driving software as a standard feature in the US on new Model Y and Model 3 purchases as the company pushes its more advanced FSD (full self-driving) subscriptions.\n\nPer Tesla’s website, new orders for Tesla’s entry-level models no longer offer Autopilot as a standard option, now only offering a Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, essentially an adaptive cruise control that allows the vehicle to change speeds when following another car on the highway.\n\nPreviously, Autopilot offered Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and auto-steer, which allowed the car to stay centered in its lane and change lanes using the turn signals.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Tesla removed Autopilot as it faced a suspension of its dealer license in California stemming from a ruling that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing over claims about Autopilot and FSD. The ruling was stayed for 60 days to allow Tesla time to comply, namely to change marketing practices around the software.\n\nThe change comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last week the company would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for FSD, pushing instead to a monthly subscription offering of $99 per month, which was already an option.\n\nMusk said late Thursday night the price of FSD could rise as well.\n\n“I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve,” he said on X.com. “The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”\n\nPulling Autopilot from Tesla EVs is a notable move considering other automakers, including Toyota, offer such services as standard options in their vehicles. On the flip side, the move to focus on FSD may be the right one considering Autopilot was an older technology and, per Musk dictates, FSD was Tesla's autonomous future.\n\nInterestingly, one X.com user posited Tesla’s move to pull Autopilot was tied to Musk’s new compensation plan, one that required a milestone of 10 million paying FSD subscribers.\n\nYesterday, Tesla stock popped when Musk announced the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"",

    "description": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump were among the Davos attendees. The luxurious airplanes matched the grandeur of the high-flyers who  went to the WEF.",
    "fullText": "Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.\n\nThat meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too.\n\nBusiness Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week.\n\nOn Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents.\n\nThe majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. In a press release, the airport said it expected more than 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings due to the WEF.\n\nOthers landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance.\n\nFrom Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft.\n\nOn Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s.\n\nThroughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nGulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views.\n\nBusiness jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower.\n\nIt's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats.\n\nThese are pretty rare to see since they're so spacious compared to other business jets. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million.\n\nFlight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday.\n\nSome governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. In Switzerland this week, flight-tracking data showed such planes belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands.\n\nDue to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft.\n\nSometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too.\n\nBusiness Insider toured one in 2024, which had an on-board bar, two double bedrooms, and two showers.\n\nThe first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. It costs about $70 million to buy one.\n\nA handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer.\n\nIt's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. On the newest airliners, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the cabin altitude is more like 6,000 feet.\n\nAccording to data from JetSpy, the above jet is owned by Robert F. Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners. The private equity firm's logo is on the tail.\n\nFlight-tracking data shows this Global 7500 flew from Atlanta to Zurich, about 75 miles from Davos, last Saturday.\n\nJetSpy data showed that other Bombardier plans that landed in Switzerland this week include ones owned by: Avram Glazer, the Manchester United co-owner; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThis is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Several of its planes touched down in Switzerland during the week of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nEmmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris.\n\nHowever, it appears he left before Trump's speech.\n\nEven the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. \"Those beautiful sunglasses,\" Trump said. \"What the hell happened?\"\n\nMacron has worn them in public in recent days due to an eye problem.\n\nA Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed.\n\nIt costs about $60 million to buy a new one, or $14,000 an hour to charter.\n\nMore popular than the Falcon 8X in Switzerland this week was the smaller Falcon 2000 jet.\n\nTrump was supposed to fly to Zurich aboard the usual presidential jet, a Boeing VC-25A. It's a militarized version of the Boeing 747 airliner.\n\nHowever, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. He instead flew on a Boeing C-32A. It's not quite as fancy and is usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two. Any plane carrying the president is designated as Air Force One while he is on it.\n\nThis week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One.\n\nHis press secretary took the opportunity to mention the 747 that he was gifted by Qatar. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force.\n\nThe Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. They took about 40 minutes to fly from Zurich Airport to Davos on Wednesday.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year.\n\nHe flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday.\n\nCarney won plenty of attention for his speech in Davos about the change in world politics since Trump's election. \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" he said.\n\nThe above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO and SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) founder Elon Musk said at this year's World Economic Form (WEF) that humanoid robots will eventually outnumber humans.\n\nRobinhood chief investment officer Stephanie Guild, Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferré, and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma joins Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss Musk's bullish claims on robotics.\n\nCheck out Musk's comments on humanoid robots and Tesla's robotaxi, and watch his full WEF interview.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid.\n\nFor my question of the day, I am sticking with the man Elon Musk. I really enjoyed his talk at Davos and found what he said on humanoid robots quite interesting.\n\nMy prediction is there'll be there'll be more robots than people. Probably sometime next year. I'd say that by the by the end of next year, I I think uh we'd be selling humanoid robots uh to the public.\n\nA new Gartner report this week sheds light on what's coming on the humanoid front potentially. Through 2028, uh less than 100 companies will progress humanoid robot proofs of concept beyond experimentation with fewer than 20 companies going live in production for supply chain and manufacturing use cases. My question is this, should we believe humanoids will be the next great investment opportunity. After all, there is an AI component to these bots. Stephanie, what say you?\n\nAh, it's from a personal perspective, it's a little bit scary. I have to say, but um, it is something that we have been considering in Robin Hood strategies, for example, where we haven't necessarily been looking for companies to invest in that have humanoids in their, uh, you know, in their pipeline, but we have been investing in companies that will provide the eyes and the ears for robots because even if it doesn't end up being a humanoid, I do think this concept of automation replacing humans in some way shape\n\nor form is not going away. That's going to be a growing concept. Um, and so that's where we've been focusing.\n\nAnd as I don't know why I think this, but I think you'd be an earlier uh an early adopter of one of these humanoids in your house.\n\nI would definitely be an earlier adopter.\n\nSee, I know. See, you work with someone long enough, you kind of just know, you know.\n\nMaybe for the yard. But not right now. Oh, for sure, for for everything in the house. Uh, yeah, can the humanoid clean? Oh, sure.\n\nAnd your Costco pizzas. It can make those Costco pizzas for you.\n\nCan can they cook for me? Yeah, of course. Uh I'd be a huge early adopter for humanoid robots and also the robot taxis as well. Uh but look, this year and next year and going forward, it is uh we are starting to see sort of the merging of machinery which has been around, but also now you're adding on the AI layer, the intelligence layer. And that is what's most exciting when talking about humanoid robots in in the future.\n\nAll right, so I got it right with Ines. Brooke, I'm going to guess that you're a little skeptical on the on these humanoids.\n\nBrian, I'm the youngest here and I'm skeptical. I don't think I'd want one of these in my house.\n\nYeah, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.\n\nI think certainly for sure, when when you think about uh the future where this is going. Elon Musk is pretty convincing. He was saying that a lot of his parent- a lot of his friends rather have elderly parents. This was in the conversation at Davos with Larry Fink. A lot of his uh friends have elderly parents and he believes that these humanoid robots will help to take care of an aging population. I thought that was an interesting point. I personally, I love interpersonal relationships. I love, you know, talking to people. I love being the one to sort of\n\njump in. And so I I will say, I'm not bought yet, but if this is anything like uh how Disney Channel's uh The Smart House went, then we're in for something certainly that might be a little scary here. And so, I'm a bit skeptical here, Brian.\n\nAll right, well I will leave it on this. I know my mom is a big opening bid watcher each day. Mom, I will say this to you right to the camera. I'm going to buy one of these robots early to take care of you at some point because look, not to be mean, I I just don't have the time. Sorry mom.",

    "title": "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says he welcomes government ban on mass-firing people for AI: ‘We’re going to cure a lot of cancers’",
    "description": "As AI threatens jobs, Jamie Dimon joins Elon Musk and Sam Altman on the case for financially supporting workers who are at risk.",
    "fullText": "More than three years after the launch of ChatGPT, anxiety about artificial intelligence in the workplace remains high—especially among Gen Z—as corporate America pushes for higher productivity from leaner workforces. The U.S.’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, is no exception.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the company’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, admitted he’ll likely employ fewer workers in the next five years—but warned that rushing into AI-driven layoffs without safeguards could backfire, potentially triggering “civil unrest.”\n\nInstead, the 69-year-old said he’d even welcome government bans on replacing masses of workers with AI. But before it gets to that stage, he already has ideas up his sleeve to protect some of the 300,000-plus employees on his payroll.\n\n“I have a plan to retrain people, relocate people, income-assist people,” Dimon said.\n\nDimon pointed to the roughly 2-million-strong commercial trucking industry as an example. A sudden shift to fully autonomous trucking, he said, could displace workers who currently earn well into six figures, leaving them struggling to make ends meet.\n\n“Phase it in. Retrain.” he said. “You can’t lay off 2 million truckers tomorrow. You can phase it in over time.”\n\nAnd if that doesn’t suffice and government intervention is needed to prevent companies from cutting jobs too aggressively, Dimon said he would support it—especially if it comes from local incentives.\n\n“We would agree—if we have to do that to save society,” he said. “Society will have more production. We’re going to cure a lot of cancers. You’re not going to slow it down. How do you have plans in place to make it work better if it does something terrible?”\n\nSo far, job cuts directly tied to AI have been limited; in 2025, just 55,000 positions were eliminated as a result of automation—accounting for more than 75% of all AI-related cuts reported since 2023, according to analysis from recruiting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nHowever, AI leaders like pioneering computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said the worst is yet to come.\n\n“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” the “Godfather of AI” said last September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”\n\nDimon’s contrasting remarks are likely to offer some reassurance to workers, signaling that at least some business leaders recognize that replacing employees with AI—without policies to support those displaced—could have serious social consequences.",

    "description": "“The limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have.\n\nIn a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models.\n\n“I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.”\n\nThe U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech.\n\nTwo massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators.\n\n“We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.”\n\nDuring his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve.\n\nJust as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks.",

    "fullText": "US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over private share sale that values business at $800bn\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly lining up four Wall Street banks to help the company list on the stock market as investors prepare for an expected rush of US tech listings.\n\nSpaceX is considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in an initial public offering, according to the Financial Times and Reuters.\n\nThe US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over a private share sale that values the business at $800bn (£591bn), months after it was valued at $400bn. Reuters has also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $25bn from what would be one of the biggest ever global listings if it goes ahead.\n\nLast year Musk, the world’s richest man with a $690bn fortune, said SpaceX’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa, the US space agency. SpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink broadband service.\n\nReports of SpaceX’s flotation plans come amid expectations of a bumper year for US tech listings. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and AI rival Anthropic are among the startups that are the focus of IPO speculation, with reported valuations of $1tn and $350bn respectively. The potential IPOs have been dubbed “hectocorns” – businesses worth more than $100bn.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said Musk’s ambitions to colonise Mars were the “headline grabber” for SpaceX, but investors will pay more attention to growth plans, such as putting solar farms and datacentres into orbit.\n\nReferring to a potential OpenAI IPO, Wilson added: “SpaceX is going to garner a lot of attention but it’s going to be a real test for these AI IPOs. If OpenAI does IPO then it’s a litmus test for the entire sector – can we really hang our hats on a startup? Do the figures add up?\n\n“The stock market has been riding the AI wave for two years and faces a stern test of resilience with some monster IPOs that will define whether this was a bubble or not.”\n\nGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and SpaceX were approached for comment.",

    "title": "Elon Musk has met his match in Ryanair's finely-tuned trolling",
    "description": "Ryanair and Michael O'Leary have a long history of making provocative statements and insulting passengers as a promotional strategy.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk might have just walked straight into a trap.\n\nRyanair's marketing team and CEO Michael O'Leary have spent years courting controversy as a promotional strategy. Provoking the world's richest person might win them the most attention yet.\n\nWhat started as a critique of Musk's Starlink has proliferated into a weeklong war of words. The salvos included the pair calling each other idiots, before the airline launched a \"Big 'Idiot' Sale\" with $23 tickets.\n\nMusk may well be known for being outspoken and his attempts at humor, but in O'Leary, he's going up against a master who has played the role for decades.\n\nBirgir Jónsson, a former CEO of Icelandic budget airline Play, said he's a \"big admirer\" of O'Leary.\n\n\"He never misses an opportunity to stay on brand and remind customers that they are getting the best deal,\" he told Business Insider. \"Poor Elon Musk never knew what hit him and is now inadvertently helping Ryanair promote its January sale.\"\n\nO'Leary has been CEO for over 30 years, leading Ryanair to become Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers. His 4% stake is worth over $1 billion, but he's perhaps better known for his profanity and antics.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's doing when he says something outrageous or provocative,\" said Marc Cornelius, the founder and CEO of 8020 Communications. \"Annoyingly, it saves him millions in PR and advertising because he instantly creates must-write stories.\"\n\nUnlike US budget airlines, such as its inspiration, Southwest Airlines, Ryanair is turning a healthy profit with an average airfare of around 40 euros ($47).\n\nAs well as selling add-ons and being strict about luggage allowances, Ryanair keeps costs low by focusing on quick turnarounds between flights. Boeing builds planes for Ryanair with fold-out stairs so passengers can deplane without waiting for airport ground workers.\n\n\"You might not love them, but they know that and are fine with it,\" Cornelius told Business Insider.\n\n\"O'Leary has been a stuntman for decades,\" said Rob Britton, a former American Airlines executive and adjunct professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.\n\nThe best-known example came in 2009, when O'Leary told the BBC he was considering installing a coin slot on bathroom doors so passengers would have to spend £1 ($1.34) to use them.\n\n\"Was he serious? Was he kidding? The whole controversy stayed in the news for weeks, if not months,\" Britton told Business Insider.\n\nHe also pointed to how, in 2003, O'Leary was reported to have bought a taxi license, so he could drive it through Dublin's bus lanes and avoid traffic.\n\nOver the years, O'Leary has disparaged several nationalities and regularly derides politicians. According to The Guardian, he once said: \"The airline industry is full of bullshitters, liars and drunks. We excel at all three in Ireland.\"\n\nHowever, his blunt style doesn't seem to be a round-the-clock habit.\n\nHans Jørgen Elnæs, an aviation analyst and advisor who spent a year working at Ryanair between 2015 and 2016, told Business Insider, \"That is his personality when in business mode, and he gets away with it all the time.\"\n\nBut away from business, he said, O'Leary \"is not a gladiator but a really good fellow.\"\n\nIn the feud with Musk, the Irishman has made clear that — at least from his corner — it's lighthearted teasing.\n\n\"As long as it increases Ryanair bookings […] it's all good fun and entertainment,\" he said in a Wednesday press conference.\n\n\"I have four teenage children, so there is nothing that Elon Musk can say to me that my teenage kids haven't already said to me,\" he added. \"I'm well able to take my own medicine.\"\n\nO'Leary also said he's continuing discussions with Starlink and other in-flight WiFi providers.\n\nRyanair is not just a one-man show, though.\n\nElnæs said O'Leary is \"no longer alone,\" thanks to the airline's social media team.\n\nRyanair's X account helped egg on Musk. The billionaire replied to its posts undermining the efficacy of in-flight WiFi, and a press release announcing the sale.\n\nPosts mocking its own passengers often go viral, too. A frequent target is anyone who mentions leg room. Tag the airline, and you risk a flippant roast.\n\n\"By openly making fun of their customers, they reinforce that same value-for-money message in a way that cuts through the noise and stays unmistakably on brand,\" Jonsson said.\n\n2007 called, they want their jeans back https://t.co/T7Bn3MVEBc\n\nRyanair didn't respond to a request for comment on its marketing strategy.\n\nMusk's main quip came when he polled X users on whether he should purchase Ryanair and install a CEO named Ryan. But European Union regulations mean the bloc's airlines must be majority-owned by EU nationals.\n\nO'Leary's time at the helm might not last for much longer, anyway. He told the Financial Times last year that he plans to retire in the next five to 10 years.\n\n\"I don't want to hang around till 96 like Buffett,\" said the 64-year-old.\n\nCornelius, whose PR firm specializes in aviation and travel, said that Ryanair's style risks being \"a bit one-dimensional\" and misses some broader ways to engage passengers.\n\n\"They will need a different approach when Michael eventually steps down,\" he said. \"But I don't see him losing much sleep about that for now.\"",

    "description": "Musk said the subscription price, currently $99, will rise as the FSD's capabilities improve over time.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk said Tesla will raise subscription prices for its Full Self-Driving software as it gets better, and it could cost more than $100.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said in an early Friday X post, \"I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD's capabilities improve.\"\n\n\"The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD),\" he said.\n\nTesla's FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that aims to enable its cars to be fully self-driving.\n\nCustomers can currently buy the system for $8,000 on a one-time basis, per the vehicle's listing on Tesla's website. However, this option will no longer be available from February 14.\n\nThe executive was responding to a post about Tesla killing its separate Autopilot service in the US.\n\nMost of Tesla's vehicles previously came with Autopilot as standard. The software included traffic-aware cruise control, which maintains a set driving speed and slows down automatically in response to traffic, as well as features like Autosteer, which allowed Tesla's cars to automatically follow lane markings.\n\nAs of Friday, Tesla now only offers Traffic-Aware Cruise Control as standard, according to the company's website.\n\nThe move attracted backlash from some Tesla fans on X, with several pointing out that rival brands like Toyota offer lane centering technology as standard on many models.\n\nIt comes as Tesla pushes to drive subscriptions for FSD, which Musk has described as a critical part of the company's future.\n\nAdoption of the technology has been sluggish, with Tesla's CFO telling investors in October that only around 12% of Tesla owners are paying for the assisted-driving feature.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a crucial part of Musk's massive Tesla pay package. Getting to 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions is one of the key milestones the Tesla CEO needs to hit to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.\n\nTesla currently makes it clear that FSD requires driver supervision. The company announced Thursday that it had begun offering fully autonomous rides without a safety monitor in its robotaxi service in Austin, and Musk has said that he expects \"unsupervised\" FSD to massively boost demand for Tesla's vehicles.\n\nThe automaker has faced regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits over its rollout of FSD and Autopilot. The US's auto regulator launched an investigation in October following reports that Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD were running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nRepresentatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Do you want to read long essays on Elon Musk's X? I'm not sure it's the venue, but it's offering $1 milion — and the results so far are ... telling.",
    "fullText": "In the past few days on X, you haven't been able to escape a certain post that's gone viral. It offers to teach you \"How to fix your life in 1 day.\" It's an \"article,\" a newish feature that allows paid users to publish longer posts.\n\nWhat, exactly, are these new articles, and why are they everywhere?\n\nLet's start with the \"How to fix your life\" article, which has been retweeted more than 54,000 times. Its author, self-help writer Dan Koe, didn't respond to my DM asking to talk about his post. His article outlines steps to shifting your mindset to achieve goals. (This may be very appealing to people who have goals or strive for self-improvement, but as someone who is quite content to be stuck in my mediocre ways, this kind of self-help thing isn't really my jam.)\n\nI would say that, just from a content standpoint, it's sort of unusual for something like this to go super viral — it's long, it's sort of hard to read, it's not about something newsy or buzzy like, say, a Hollywood mom group fallout. I can't say for sure why this captured so much attention last week; perhaps it was just the right timing, with X wanting to push the new article format.\n\nWe’re trying something new: we’re giving $1 million to the Top Article of the next payout period.\n\nWe're doubling down on what creators on 𝕏 do best: writing.\n\nIn 2026, our goal is to recognize high-value, high-impact content that shapes conversation, breaks news and moves… pic.twitter.com/4hKBJNvNIg\n\nElon Musk's X is now offering a $1 million prize to whoever has the most viral article in the next week or so. As you might imagine, this has created a glut of articles, some of which are low-quality and likely generated by Grok or another AI.\n\nThe most interesting version of this so far is an article by a blogger who goes by \"ratlimit,\" who posted an article saying that if they win the prize, they'll split the winnings with the people who retweeted it. So far, it's been RT'd over 1,600 times. Clever!\n\nThere's also, of course, a backlash. One article went moderately viral with the headline, \"These ugly ass Articles have got to go,\" making the general point that these are unpleasant to come across in your timeline.\n\nAs someone who writes articles professionally, I suppose I have mixed feelings and a compromised perspective. I also enjoy reading lots of different kinds of articles. In fact, \"reading articles\" is one of my favorite pastimes! Not just news — I love a blog post! A review! A half-formed thought! Frankly, it feels like there aren't enough articles to read lately, and I welcome more.\n\nBut these X articles? I'm not sure this is it.\n\nThe problem is that articles written directly onto X are going to have a bit of a self-selection bias toward the kind of person who is really into X and wants to make money off X posts. That's probably … not someone I want to hear from a lot.\n\nAs X has gone deeper and deeper into a place that's somewhat unpleasant and potentially just kind of gross (the popular recent trend of asking Grok to undress people was, I think, a final straw for a lot of folks), is this really the place I want to read articles? Maybe! There's certainly still newsmakers on there, especially in certain niches like AI and tech, and hearing their thoughts is reason enough for me to stick around.\n\nBut is X a place I want to go for lengthy ideas about self-improvement? No, not even for a million dollars.",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move. This comes after Waymo announced another expansion of its robotaxi service in the US, hammering home its lead in the autonomous space — for now.\n\nMusk also claimed on Thursday that he expects the company’s self-driving service to get EU and China approval soon.\n\nTesla stock popped on the news, closing up over 4%.\n\nIn a post on X.com, Musk said Tesla \"started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!\" This post came in response to users on X posting videos of the Tesla robotaxi operating without a safety driver.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Waymo, part of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), said on its company blog that it is now operating in the Miami area, inviting its first public riders in the city. “With nearly 10,000 residents already signed up, we will be inviting new riders on a rolling basis to ensure a seamless experience across our initial 60-square-mile service area.”\n\nWaymo says plans for rides to Miami International Airport will be coming soon.\n\nBefore the Miami announcement, Waymo operated in five major US markets: Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the greater San Francisco area.\n\nThis year, Waymo has an aggressive plan to expand, with Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and Nashville targeted for public service.\n\nIt also has plans for densely populated cities, with testing ongoing in New York, Tokyo, and London.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's autonomous and robotaxis services are lagging. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Musk claimed the company’s full self-driving (FSD) autonomous service, a supervised product that requires users to pay attention while using it, would soon be coming to Europe and China.\n\n\"We hope to ​get Supervised Full Self-Driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month, and then maybe a similar timing for China,\" Musk ‍said.\n\nWhile Waymo currently is only testing internationally in the cities mentioned above, its service is level 4 autonomous, which is fully autonomous in certain geographic areas. Tesla’s FSD is considered level 2.\n\nTesla’s robotaxis, currently operating in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area, have grown in numbers but only modestly. The robotaxis still require a safety driver in each vehicle, owing to the fact that it is still a supervised service. The new video shared by Musk suggests the company has approval to operate without a safety driver in Austin, but the CEO didn't share whether that was the case.",

Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities.\n\nMuch of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months.\n\nMusk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space \"within a few years,\" adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth.\n\n\"The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,\" said Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a \"solvable problem,\" but warned that society could \"lack vibrancy\" if humans were able to live forever.\n\nMusk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements.\n\n\"I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right,\" he added.",

It's not a subtle thing,\" Musk said. \"The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body,\"\n\nBut Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives.\n\n\"You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society.

    "fullText": "Estimate made by Center for Countering Digital Hate after Elon Musk’s AI image generation tool sparked outrage\n\nGrok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appear to depict children, according to researchers who said it “became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material”.\n\nThe estimate has been made by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) after Elon Musk’s AI image generation tool sparked international outrage when it allowed users to upload photographs of strangers and celebrities, digitally strip them to their underwear or into bikinis, put them in provocative poses and post the images on X.\n\nThe trend went viral over the new year, peaking on 2 January with 199,612 individual requests, according to analysis conducted by Peryton Intelligence, a digital intelligence company specialising in online hate.\n\nA fuller assessment of the output from the feature, from its launch on 29 December 2025 until 8 January 2026, has now been made by the CCDH. It suggests the impact of the technology may have been broader than previously thought. Public figures identified in sexualised images it analysed include Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Ice Spice, Nicki Minaj, Christina Hendricks, Millie Bobby Brown, the Swedish deputy prime minister Ebba Busch, and the former US vice-president Kamala Harris.\n\nThe feature was restricted to paid users on 9 January and further restrictions followed after the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful”. Other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, announced blocks on the AI tool.\n\nCCDH estimated that over the 11-day period, Grok was helping create sexualised images of children every 41 seconds. These included a selfie uploaded by a schoolgirl undressed by Grok, turning a “before school selfie” into an image of her in a bikini.\n\n“What we found was clear and disturbing: in that period Grok became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material,” said Imran Ahmed, CCDH’s chief executive. “Stripping a woman without their permission is sexual abuse. Throughout that period Elon was hyping the product even when it was clear to the world it was being used in this way. What Elon was ginning up was controversy, eyeballs, engagement and users. It was deeply disturbing.”\n\nHe added: “This has become a standard playbook for Silicon Valley, and in particular for social media and AI platforms. The incentives are all misaligned. They profit from this outrage. It’s not about Musk personally. This is about a system [with] perverse incentives and no minimum safeguards prescribed in law. And until regulators and lawmakers do their jobs and create a minimum expectation of safety, this will continue to happen.”\n\nX announced it had stopped its Grok feature from editing pictures of real people to show them in revealing clothes, including for premium subscribers, on 14 January.\n\nX referred to its statement from last week, which said: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.\n\n“We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking child sexual exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”",

In 2023, he made a post that questioned the need for the WEF.\n\n\"Are they trying to be the boss of Earth!?\" he wrote at the time.\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he had declined an invitation to Davos, writing on social media that it was \"boring AF.\" The WEF said at the time that he hadn't been invited since 2015.\n\nMore recently, the billionaire has drawn attention for his public feud with Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, after the latter said he wasn't interested in installing Starlink on his airline's fleet due to several drawbacks.\n\nThe WEF has not said what's on Musk's speaking agenda for Thursday. A WEF spokesperson confirmed that Musk is attending the event, adding that the forum has \"an outstanding tech delegation attending this year's meeting — companies and individuals who are shaping the future of their industries.\"",

    "description": "Tesla's Elon Musk is asking job applicants to share their biggest tech wins via three simple bullet points.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk wants to see your results, not your résumé.\n\nThe Tesla CEO this week requested that people who want to work on the company's Dojo3 AI chip email three bullet points describing the \"toughest technical problems you've solved.\"\n\nMusk's just-the-facts approach, outlined in a post on X, reflects a focus on problem-solving over fancy résumés or cover letters.\n\n\"He's basically just trying to cut through the noise of the job market,\" said Michelle Volberg, a longtime recruiter who is the founder of Twill, a startup that pays tech workers to recommend peers for key jobs.\n\nShe said that résumés or LinkedIn profiles don't always make it clear to employers where a person's skills lie. Asking a job seeker to lay out a trio of battles won can help hiring managers get to the meat of someone's abilities, Volberg told Business Insider.\n\nIt's a way of thinking that she expects more employers will adopt.\n\n\"Elon is showing the way that the job market is going to go,\" she said.\n\nAlready, some tech companies are eager for job candidates to demonstrate their abilities by highlighting how they arrived at an answer. It's part of what appears to be a show-your-work ethos in Silicon Valley, where hefty spending on AI projects and a hangover from the pandemic-era staffing boom are driving hiring austerity in all but the hottest areas.\n\nVolberg said that hiring managers at large companies have told her that they're sick of relying on résumés so tailored to a job opening that they reveal little about candidates themselves. Asking job seekers to identify a small number of concrete problems they've solved can help overcome that challenge and help bring clarity for hiring managers, she said.\n\n\"They don't want to see fluffy résumés that have been written by ChatGPT,\" Volberg said.\n\nBullets over bona fides is, of course, a departure from the conventional approach of stuffing a résumé with bolded job titles, years of experience, and skills.\n\nAsking applicants to summarize the value they would bring by sharing vignettes of success can elevate technical accomplishment over pedigree or background, she said. It's an example of what some HR types call \"skills-based hiring.\"\n\nMusk's no-frills call for applicants appears to build on his prior statements about being open to candidates from nontraditional backgrounds. For years, the billionaire has said that people didn't need a college degree to work for Tesla. Musk has said that he's more focused on evidence of \"exceptional\" ability or achievement.\n\nHe also requested bullet points in 2025 when he oversaw efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency group to remake swaths of the US federal government. A nearly year-old post on X said that DOGE was seeking \"world-class\" software engineers, product managers, and data scientists, among other roles.\n\nAn application portal linked to the post contains a field instructing applicants to include two or three bullets \"showcasing exceptional ability,\" and to upload a résumé.\n\nVolberg said the bullet method is similar to guidance that her company already gives job seekers: Focus less on adjectives and more on outcomes.\n\nFrom a hiring manager's perspective, she said, the central question is whether a candidate can make their job easier by solving real problems.\n\nThe corollary, Volberg said, is fakers beware: \"If you say that you've solved these three things, you'd better be able to talk about them in detail.\"\n\nShe said that it's often immediately clear to tech recruiters whether someone has actually done the work they describe. Candidates who exaggerate or fabricate their accomplishments are likely to be found out — and potentially blacklisted, Volberg said.\n\nBeyond candidate chicanery, there could be other risks to Musk's strategy, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews.\n\nAsking people to submit summaries of their greatest tech wins could mean that an employer like Tesla misses out on the quiet contributors and introverts who might not do as good a job promoting themselves, he told Business Insider. Bullets of key achievements — even more than with a typical résumé — require people to make the case for their own work.\n\nMurray said that Musk's approach also overlooks the impacts of the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect, in which people who aren't great at something tend to overestimate their abilities, and those who are ace might assume a task is easy for anyone.\n\n\"What he is asking people to do is to market themselves,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

That speed, possible with the satellites’ planned optical communications, is extreme by consumer standards and would make the network key for data processing and large-scale government programs. Blue Origin said the network would be meant to serve a maximum of roughly 100,000 customers.\n\nThe reveal of TeraWave coincides with a space industry rush to build data centers in space that can meet the soaring demand for large-scale AI data processing, which on Earth requires immense energy and resources as adoption of the technology expands.\n\nThe planned network adds another satellite constellation linked to Bezos, executive chairperson of Amazon, which is in an early phase of deploying Leo – a network formerly called Project Kuiper – involving 3,200 satellites providing internet to consumers and businesses.\n\nMusk’s Starlink network of roughly 10,000 satellites is farthest ahead in a global push to put internet infrastructure in space, where swarms of low-orbiting satellites offer more security and higher connection speeds than traditional, unitary satellites farther out in space.\n\nThe SpaceX CEO has said he plans to build data centers in space, complementing the Starlink network, while Bezos has predicted such space-based centers will be commonplace in orbit within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nStarlink, which has reported more than 6 million customers across at least 140 countries, targets individual consumers, businesses, governments and, with its Starshield variant, US national security agencies. Amazon Leo, with 180 satellites in space so far, has a similar customer strategy.\n\nA handful of Chinese companies are swiftly deploying similar satellite networks to get up to pace with Starlink, which has proved key for remote communications and geopolitical conflicts. China is developing new reusable rockets that can loft thousands of these satellites over the next several years for lower costs, a playbook first written by Musk’s SpaceX and its reusable Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nBlue Origin’s reusable New Glenn rocket, which has launched twice but has been slow to achieve a rapid flight rate, will likely be a vital part of TeraWave’s deployment.\n\nUnlike Starlink, the planned network appears off-limits to individual consumers, according to Blue Origin’s statement.\n\nBlue Origin’s statement said: “TeraWave enterprise-grade user and gateway terminals can be rapidly deployed worldwide and interface with existing high-capacity infrastructure, providing additional route diversity and strengthening overall network resilience,” leaving unclear what types of existing infrastructure the network can work with.",

    "description": "Jeff Bezos' space venture, Blue Origin, has unveiled a satellite network aimed at challenging Elon Musk's SpaceX dominance in orbit.",
    "fullText": "Jeff Bezos has unveiled his plans for a massive satellite network, mounting a direct challenge to Elon Musk's grip on internet infrastructure in orbit.\n\nThe project, called TeraWave, would deploy 5,408 satellites into orbit to serve data centers, governments, and businesses worldwide, Bezos's space venture, Blue Origin, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nLaunches are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2027.\n\nTeraWave is designed to deliver \"data speeds of up to 6 terabits per second anywhere on Earth,\" enabled by advanced optical communications between satellites, the company said.\n\nThe network is \"optimized for enterprise, data center, and government customers\" and would serve up to 100,000 customers, it added.\n\nThe announcement comes after Bezos' other company, Amazon, rebranded its consumer satellite network Leo in November. Formerly known as Project Kuiper, the initial constellation design includes more than 3,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites providing standard broadband service.\n\nThe launch of TeraWave raises the stakes in a billionaire-led fight over space-based internet infrastructure. Starlink, led by Elon Musk, dominates the field with roughly 10,000 satellites in orbit. The subsidiary project of SpaceX targets consumers, businesses, and governments, and serves more than 6 million users globally.\n\nIn a reply to an X user on Monday, Musk said \"Starlink space to ground laser links will exceed this,\" referring to the data speeds touted by TeraWave.\n\nSpaceX has also begun laying the regulatory groundwork to scale its satellite operations. In a January filing with the US Federal Communications Commission, the company said satellite systems should be treated as essential infrastructure for future wireless networks as the US seeks to maintain leadership in next-generation space-based services.\n\nBeyond internet access, the satellite race is increasingly tied to the future of computing, as tech leaders point to satellite networks as potential infrastructure for future data centers in space.\n\nResponding on X to an article about building data centers in space, Musk said in October that \"simply scaling up Starlink V3 satellites, which have high speed laser links would work.\"\n\n\"SpaceX will be doing this,\" he added.\n\nMusk has also discussed the idea internally. During an xAI all-hands meeting in December, he said he sees data centers eventually moving off Earth, raising the possibility of space-based facilities that could be operated by Tesla Optimus robots, people with knowledge of the meeting told Business Insider.\n\nJeff Bezos has voiced a similar long-term view, predicting that data centers could shift to space within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in November that the concept may sound \"crazy,\" but \"when you truly step back and envision the amount of compute we're going to need, it starts making sense and it's a matter of time.\"",

    "fullText": "Ryanair is relishing its feud with Elon Musk.\n\nThe Irish airline is hand-delivering a free ticket to X's Dublin office for Musk, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a Wednesday press conference.\n\nRyanair has taken advantage of the feud by launching a \"Big 'Idiot' Sale\" with 100,000 tickets starting at £16.99, or about $23.\n\nMusk and O'Leary, arguably the world's most outspoken businessmen, have called each other idiots in a weeklong feud over Starlink in-flight WiFi.\n\n\"I've included myself and him in this 'Big Idiot' seat sale,\" O'Leary said Wednesday, referring to an ad that shows the pair brawling.\n\n\"I suspect he's a bigger idiot than me, but nevertheless, he probably thinks I'm a bigger idiot than him.\"\n\nAfter trading insults over the past days, Musk posted a poll on X on Monday asking if he should buy Ryanair and install a CEO named Ryan. About three-quarters of the roughly 950,000 voters said yes.\n\nHowever, European Union rules say that the bloc's airlines must be at least 50% owned by EU nationals.\n\nO'Leary has also been known to make provocative statements to help promote his airline.\n\nAfter Musk compared O'Leary to a chimpanzee on Tuesday, the Ryanair boss responded at the press conference, saying: \"I think it's somewhat unfair on the chimp community. But chimp chump, as long as it increases Ryanair bookings through January, February, and March, it's all good fun and entertainment.\"\n\n\"It is very good for our bookings,\" O'Leary also said. \"We love these PR spats that drive bookings on Ryanair.\"\n\nThe quarrel started last Wednesday after O'Leary told Reuters he wouldn't join other airlines installing Starlink. The following day, he told the Irish radio station Newstalk that it would cost the airline up to $250 million because adding the terminal to a plane would affect its aerodynamics and increase fuel costs.\n\nHe said this would amount to a 2% increase, but a SpaceX executive said in an X post that it was actually 0.2%.\n\nAs a budget airline, Ryanair focuses on keeping costs as low as possible to offer cheaper airfares. It turns a profit by keeping its planes flying frequently with low turnaround times at airports, and selling extras, including scratchcards.\n\nPlus, it only flies short-haul routes, so O'Leary doesn't think passengers would be too interested in in-flight WiFi.\n\n\"If it results in a fuel drag, it is something we would never go near,\" he added on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, in the press conference, he also called Starlink a \"terrific system.\"\n\nO'Leary said the airline is continuing discussions with Starlink and other providers, including Amazon, but it would adopt in-flight WiFi \"only in a way where it will lower our costs.\"",

    "description": "Billionaire tech CEOs promise shorter weeks thanks to AI—but IWG’s Mark Dixon says automation won’t free time, it’ll just create more work.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nvidia’s boss Jensen Huang and Elon Musk have all made the same prediction in recent years: The workweek is about to shrink. Automation will take over routine tasks, they argue, freeing workers’ time and pushing a four-day week toward becoming standard. Gates has even floated the idea of a two-day workweek.\n\nBut Mark Dixon, CEO and founder of International Workplace Group (IWG) CEO isn’t buying it. From his vantage point, running the world’s largest flexible office provider—with more than 8 million users across 122 countries and 85% of the Fortune 500 among its customers—the math doesn’t add up.\n\n“Everyone is focused on productivity, so no time soon,” Dixon says flatly.\n\n“It’s about the cost of labor,” Dixon explains to Fortune. The U.S. and U.K. are experiencing significant cost-of-living crises. At the same time, he says, businesses are experiencing a “cost of operating crisis.”\n\n“Everyone’s having to control their labor costs because all costs have gone up so much, and you can’t get any more money from customers, so therefore you have to get more out of people.”\n\nEssentially, companies can’t afford to pay the same wages for fewer hours, and they can’t pass the difference on to customers. So any time ‘freed’ by automation is far more likely to be filled with new tasks than handed back to workers.\n\nSilicon Valley’s loudest voices frame AI as a route to more leisure. The world’s richest person and the boss of Space X, Tesla and X, Elon Musk has gone as far as predicting work will be completely “optional” and more like a hobby, in as little as 10 years.\n\nIn reality, Dixon suggests that this scenario would only happen if there’s not enough work to go around, rather than bosses suddenly becoming benevolent. But in his eyes, AI will most likely create more—not less—work.\n\nEvery major technological shift, he argues, has followed a similar arc: fear of displacement, followed by an expansion of opportunity.\n\n“AI will speed up companies development, so there’ll be more work, it’ll just be different work,” he says.\n\nIn 19th-century Britain, Dixon recalls English textile workers protesting against new automated machinery, fearing it threatened their livelihoods, lowered wages, and de-skilled their craft during the Industrial Revolution. They were called Luddites.\n\n“They went around the country smashing up the looms to stop progress. But look, in the end, you’ve heard of the Industrial Revolution. That’s what came from those looms and factory production.” As mass production made goods more available, retail grew; More managers were needed to oversee the machines; The middle-class grew, and so on.",

    "description": "Sulaiman Ghori discussed xAI's internal culture, data center strategy, and AI agents days before departing Elon Musk's company without explanation.",
    "fullText": "Sulaiman Ghori gave a sweeping interview about his work at xAI. Four days later, he is no longer working at the company.\n\nThe interview on the \"Relentless\" podcast covered dozens of topics, from the internal company culture and work schedule to the eyebrow-raising way Elon Musk's AI company builds its data centers.\n\nElon Musk's companies are famously wary of the press and media. And while it's not clear whether Ghori's exit is related to the podcast interview — neither xAI nor Musk commented on the former employee's quotes or departure when contacted by Business Insider — some big names like MrBeast are speculating as much. Ghori hasn't commented publicly about the circumstances of his departure and did not respond when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nSo what exactly did the now-former xAI employee talk about?\n\nRead on for 10 of the most interesting things Ghori said on the podcast.\n\nHow is xAI building its data centers so quickly? Through temporary licenses, Ghori said.\n\n\"It was the fastest way to get the permitting through and actually start building things,\" Ghori said. \"I assume that it will be permanent at some point.\"\n\nGhori said that the temporary leases were an exception granted by the local government, one made for carnivals. The host, Ti Morse, laughed: \"So xAI is actually just a carnival company?\"\n\n\"It's a carnival company,\" Ghori responded.\n\nAI visionaries often talk about a world where managers run a team of agents, not employees. They seem to be there already at xAI.\n\nThe company is rebuilding its core production APIs, Ghori said. The team leading it is one person and 20 agents. \"They're very good, and they're capable of doing it,\" he said.\n\nAt another point in the podcast, Ghori described the confusion that AI employees can cause.\n\n\"Multiple times I've gotten a ping saying: 'Hey, this guy on the org chart reports to you. Is he not in today or something?'\" he said. \"It's an AI. It's a virtual employee.\"\n\nXAI teams are kept small, even without AI employees. The iOS team had three employees at the time of the Grok Imagine launch, Ghori said. He was the third.\n\nHow valuable is each commit to xAI's repository? They did the math, Ghori said: It's $2.5 million.\n\n\"I did five today,\" Ghori said. His work for the day would be valued at $12.5 million.\n\nOne of Elon Musk's key roles at xAI is as a fixer.\n\nGhori said that, when the company picks up new products from the likes of Nvidia, not everything works. That's when Musk gets on the phone, Ghori said.\n\n\"We would work side-by-side until that was resolved,\" Ghori said. \"Otherwise it would have taken weeks of back-and-forth.\"\n\nThe xAI CEO made an unusual offer when xAI's engineers were setting up new GPU racks.\n\n\"Elon's like, 'OK, you can get a Cybertruck tonight if you can get a training run on these GPUs in 24 hours,'\" Ghori said.\n\nThe engineer — whom Ghori only referred to by their first name, Tyler — won the bet. Now, Ghori said he sees Tyler's Cybertruck outside his lunch window.\n\nThe teams within xAI are limited and blurry, Ghori said.\n\nThat made onboarding a challenge, he added, as nobody told him what to do.\n\n\"My first day, they just gave me a laptop and a badge,\" Ghori said, adding that he wasn't assigned a desk.\n\nGhori sought out cofounder Greg Yang, who had been instrumental in his hiring. He soon started working on the Ask Grok feature in X.\n\nElon Musk's companies have a long history of overnighting at the office. Former Twitter director Esther Crawford generated headlines when she posted a \"cheeky\" photo of herself sleeping at the company's headquarters.\n\nXAI seems to have embraced this reputation. The company has sleeping pods and bunk beds, Ghori said.\n\n\"When the tent picture came out, everyone kept sending it to me,\" Ghori said. \"We have tents, but I've never seen that many out at once.\"\n\nWho responds when Musk spots a late-night problem with X? \"Whoever is awake,\" he said.\n\nGhori worked on the Macrohard team — a tongue-in-cheek play on the opposite of Microsoft — that is developing \"human emulators.\"\n\nThe xAI engineer explained the concept in reference to Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot. Just as Optimus performs physical human actions, these emulators will perform digital human actions.\n\nThe emulators will do anything that a human needs to look at a screen, use a keyboard and mouse, and make decisions, Ghori said.\n\nXAI wants to roll out the human emulators slowly, then all at once, Ghori said. The goal is to scale to one million emulators.\n\nThere are 4 million Tesla cars in North America alone, Ghori said. They're sitting idle for 70-80% of the time, he said. Why not pay owners to lease time off their cars and run the emulator on them?\n\n\"That's something without any build-out requirement,\" Ghori said.\n\nThis isn't the first time using dormant Teslas to power new ambitions has been mentioned. Elon Musk said at Tesla's November shareholder meeting that the vehicles could offer a \"massive distributed AI inference fleet.\"\n\nConsumers can currently use the Grok 4 model, which xAI released in July.\n\nXAI is working far ahead, Ghori said. He joined in March 2025, according to his LinkedIn profile. Grok-5 was planned even before he joined, Ghori said.\n\nThe model was \"planned out and designed\" far in advance, he said.",

    "description": "Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang attended or donated to President DonaldTrump's inauguration. All of them got richer last year.",
    "fullText": "It's been one year since President Donald Trump was sworn back into office — and four of the wealthiest tech billionaires who attended or donated to his inauguration have gotten richer.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Jensen Huang — all of whom are featured on Bloomberg's list of 500 wealthiest people in the world — were among the tech royalty who signaled support for the administration, either through attendance or a donation. Others included Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and Shou Zi Chew.\n\nThe tech billionaire with the largest increase in his net worth during Trump's first year is also the one who was closest to the Trump administration: Elon Musk. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the Tesla CEO's wealth increased by 52% over the past year.\n\nWhile Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Huang are all wealthier today than they were on Inauguration Day in 2025, there have been some ups and downs. Collectively, the group lost $194 billion in wealth during Trump's first 100 days as markets reacted to the administration's tariffs. They've since made up for those losses and then some. As of January 19, the group was cumulatively $288 billion wealthier than a year prior.\n\nHere's where all four stood as of Monday, January 19, 2026.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $449 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $681 billion\n\nAfter spending at least $277 million backing Trump and Republicans during the 2024 election, Musk attended the inauguration and worked closely with the White House as the public face of the White House DOGE Office. Following his departure in May, Musk and Trump had a very public falling out, though they later reconciled.\n\nMusk's work with DOGE resulted in backlash against Tesla, with the company's share price declining in the first few months of Trump's presidency. It has since recovered, and in the year since Trump was elected Musk has solidified his standing as the world's richest man. In November, Tesla shareholders approved a $1 trillion-dollar pay package for the Tesla CEO, if he hits a series of goals, and there are plans for a SpaceX IPO in 2026.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $245 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $261 billion\n\nBezos's wealth, most of which is tied to Amazon stock, has increased since Trump took office a second time. Bezos, the Amazon founder and chairman, attended the inauguration alongside his now-wife Lauren Sánchez. Amazon also donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee.\n\nAnalysts have said that Amazon was especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, and CEO Andy Jassy said this week prices on the platform are increasing as a result of tariffs. Amazon's share price is roughly the same as it was a year ago.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $217 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $220 billion\n\nZuckerberg and Trump once had a contentious relationship that went back several years prior to the 2024 election, with the latter at one time threatening to have the Meta CEO jailed over Facebook banning Trump's account in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nZuckerberg publicly warmed to Trump during the 2024 cycle, offering him praise and attending the inauguration. Zuckerberg was seated next to Trump at a White House dinner attended by tech leaders last year. Meta also donated $1 million to the inaugural committee.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $117 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $154 billion\n\nHuang did not attend the inauguration, but Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural committee. The Nvidia CEO also met with Trump shortly after he took office and the company has worked with the White House on AI policy.",

    "description": "The Tesla Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot are both set to enter production this year as Elon Musk bets Tesla's future on AI and robotics.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is bracing for another round of production hell.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said on Tuesday that the ramp-up of the company's Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot, both set to enter production this year, would be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\n\"The speed of the production ramp is inversely proportionate to how many new parts and steps there are,\" wrote Musk in a post on X.\n\n\"For Cybercab and Optimus, almost everything is new, so the early production rate will be agonizingly slow, but eventually end up being insanely fast,\" he added.\n\nTesla is set to begin production of the Cybercab, a sleek two-seater robotaxi that Musk has said will ship without a steering wheel or pedals, in April. The billionaire is targeting an eventual production goal of 2 million units a year.\n\nThe Cybercab, which Musk said in 2024 would cost around $25,000, is set to enter mass production as Tesla races to expand its robotaxi service after a sluggish start.\n\nThe company launched autonomous ride-hailing in Austin last June, but it only has a small number of Model Y robotaxis on the road in the city and has not yet removed human safety monitors from its vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, Optimus, its humanoid robot designed to help with everyday tasks, is set to enter production by the end of 2026, with Musk saying Tesla could eventually make one million a year.\n\nThe Tesla CEO told investors in October that it would take a while to reach that goal as the company was having to manufacture almost the entire supply chain from scratch, with production moving at the speed of the \"slowest, dumbest, least lucky thing out of 10,000 unique items.\"\n\nMusk's comments echo what Tesla is telling its employees. In an all-hands meeting in October, the company's VP of AI software told staff on Tesla's Autopilot and Optimus teams that 2026 would be the \"hardest year\" of their lives, Business Insider's Grace Kay exclusively reported.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Tesla has faced a rough road while scaling an ambitious new product.\n\nThe company endured a famously brutal period of what Musk called \"production hell\" while building its Model 3 EV in 2017. Musk and other employees resorted to sleeping on the factory floor as they struggled to scale the mass-market model.\n\nTesla also faced production challenges with the Cybertruck, the company's last new vehicle.\n\nThe electric pickup's unique design and stainless steel-clad structure made it highly challenging to produce at scale, and Musk acknowledged in 2023 that Tesla had \"dug its own grave\" with the Cybertruck's design.\n\nThe divisive electric truck also serves as a caveat for Musk's ambitious production goals.\n\nMusk's predictions that Tesla could produce 250,000 Cybertrucks a year have fallen short, with industry data showing the company sold just over 20,000 Cybertrucks in the US last year.",

    "fullText": "Feel like X's algorithm needs work? Elon Musk agrees.\n\nMusk isn't a fan of X's algorithm, and he's documenting the company's efforts to improve the technology that decides what you see in the platform's \"For You\" feed.\n\nMusk said he is overhauling the recommendation system that decides which user-generated posts and advertisements are shown when you open the app. He also pledged to make that system transparent in the process, with the underlying code getting published on GitHub every four weeks. Musk said any changes to the code will be explained with every post.\n\n\"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote on X. \"No other social media companies do this.\"\n\nX's engineering team has also said the new recommendation system is built on the same architecture as Grok, the chatbot developed by Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nWhile X has not said the two systems share training data or model weights, the comparison signals a shift toward more AI-driven content ranking, moving beyond the rules-based and engagement-heavy systems the app has historically relied on.\n\nKey questions remain about how the system operates in practice. X did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for more specifics on the algorithm.\n\nThe social media app, formerly known as Twitter, hasn't always relied on algorithms to serve its users.\n\nFrom its launch in 2006 through 2015, it presented posts in reverse chronological order, showing users the most recent tweets from accounts they followed.\n\nBut, in 2016, after several updates, a \"Show me the best tweets first\" option became the default for all users.\n\nOver time, the system grew more complex, incorporating engagement signals such as likes, replies, shares, and blocks to predict what content users were most likely to interact with or remove.\n\nMusk has long voiced frustrations with that algorithm.\n\nBefore acquiring Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he repeatedly described the platform's algorithm as a \"black box,\" arguing that it introduced political bias and failed to reflect users' true preferences — particularly for politically conservative users.\n\nHis complaints continued after the purchase. In a 2024 post, he said the rules-based algorithms had become too divisive.\n\n\"One of the strongest signals is if you forward X posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot, because it takes effort to forward,\" Musk wrote. \"Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realize that.\"\n\nHe recommended that users send videos of puppies to friends to combat the issue.",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk are at it again, with each of the tech titans taking aim at the other in a series of heated posts on X.\n\nMusk appeared to start the latest escalation early on Tuesday morning, when he posted \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT\" in response to a post that said that use of OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to the deaths of nine children and adults since it was released in 2022.\n\nAltman fired back, first in defense of ChatGPT and OpenAI's desire to protect its users, and then blasting Tesla's Autopilot technology, calling it unsafe.\n\n\"It is genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman continued, calling out Autopilot.\n\n\"I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released,\" he wrote. \"I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions.\"\n\nAltman added: \"You take 'every accusation is a confession' so far.\"\n\nThere have been at least eight wrongful-death lawsuits filed against OpenAI that allege use of ChatGPT has contributed to worsening mental health conditions, leading to instances of suicide and murder, including among children and young adults.\n\nSafety concerns around Tesla's self-driving technology have also been central to multiple wrongful-death lawsuits, including one surrounding a 2019 crash in Florida that left a 22-year-old woman dead. A jury determined Tesla was 33% liable for the crash and awarded the plaintiffs $329 million in total damages, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe social media feud comes as the pair is stuck in the middle of a long-running legal battle over OpenAI's status as a nonprofit company. Musk sued Altman, and other leaders of OpenAI, alleging that they misled him when they decided to pursue a for-profit structure, moving the company away from its original nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit.",

    "description": "Legacy automakers and Tesla rival Rivian have recently announced roadmaps to pursue autonomous driving technology in-house.",
    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he has offered to license Full Self-Driving to other automakers.\n\nCompanies like Ford and Rivian announced in recent weeks that they'll pursue self-driving in-house.\n\nNvidia also released a toolkit that lowers the barrier to entry for pursuing autonomy.\n\nElon Musk has called legacy automakers' hesitancy to license Tesla's Full Self-Driving software \"crazy,\" but a slew of industry moves show that their reluctance is strategic.\n\nIn recent weeks, more automakers have released roadmaps to build key pieces of automated driving software rather than outsourcing the technology. Because automakers see vehicle tech as a brand-defining component, a Tesla license can become a hard sell.\n\nRivian, for example, is going deeper into vertical integration by designing a proprietary chip for the brain behind the company's autonomous driving computer.

    "fullText": "Just months ago, Elon Musk seemed to swear off major political spending. That seems to be over now.\n\nThe tech titan has poured $10 million into a super PAC backing GOP Senate candidate Nate Morris in Kentucky, according to Axios and The New York Times.\n\nIt would be Musk's largest publicly known single contribution to a political candidate since the 2024 election, when he spent nearly $300 million and emerged as the GOP's largest donor.\n\nMorris, an entrepreneur and tech executive running on an \"America First\" platform, is running against two other candidates to succeed the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell. He's been backed by a slew of MAGA-aligned politicians and figures, though President Donald Trump has yet to make an endorsement in the race.\n\nOn an episode of Donald Trump Jr's \"Triggered\" podcast on Monday, Morris said that the super PAC contribution came after he had a \"terrific meeting\" with Musk last week.\n\n\"He got excited about the race, and I think he was excited that I was a business guy and entrepreneur, and decided to make a big contribution to the super PAC that's going to be helping our campaign,\" Morris said. \"We're so delighted to have Elon's support, and for him to go all-in on us.\"\n\nMusk has not yet publicly commented on the reported contribution, and spokespeople for Musk and his companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe world's richest man has also reported to have made major contributions to super PACs tied to House and Senate GOP leadership. It comes as he's appeared to largely mend his relationship with Trump.\n\n\"America is toast if the radical left wins,\" Musk wrote on X earlier this month in response to reports of those contributions. \"They will open the floodgates to illegal immigration and fraud. Won't be America anymore.\"\n\nThe details of Musk's contributions will be publicly disclosed to the Federal Election Commission at the end of January.\n\nMore broadly, Musk appears to be re-engaging with American politics, posting about hot-button topics including immigration and his support for legislation to require proof of citizenship for voting.\n\nMusk spending big on an election would mark something of a reversal from the middle of last year.\n\nShortly before his feud with Trump erupted into public view, Musk declared that he was scaling back his political contributions.\n\n\"If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,\" Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May. \"I do not currently see a reason.\"\n\nThose comments came a month after he spent millions to support a GOP candidate in a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, only for that candidate to lose handily.",

Since 1994, Michael O'Leary has been Ryanair's CEO.\n\nHis stake in the company is worth over 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), but O'Leary is perhaps best known for his outspoken, provocative style.\n\nLast Wednesday, O'Leary told Reuters that he wasn't interested in installing Starlink, Musk's satellite internet service.\n\nIt's been growing in popularity among airlines, but Ryanair is known for its no-frills offering, and O'Leary doesn't think customers would want to pay extra for it.\n\nBut Musk said O'Leary had the wrong numbers for the additional fuel costs due to the aerodynamic changes from installing a Starlink terminal.\n\nThe two billionaires then traded insults.\n\n\"Very wealthy, but he's still an idiot,\" O'Leary said on Irish radio, adding that Musk has \"zero\" knowledge of running an airline.\n\nMusk then said O'Leary was an \"utter idiot,\" called for his firing, and began talking about buying Ryanair.\n\nThe airline's social media team, which is known for its dry humor, then continued to annoy Musk.\n\nResponding to reports about a widespread X outage, the Ryanair account posted on Friday: \"Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?\"\n\nAnd on Monday, it jested that in-flight WiFi was an example of propaganda it wasn't falling for.\n\nMusk then replied, \"How much would it cost to buy you?\" before beginning his poll.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Musk has polled X users about his business ventures.\n\nBack in 2021, he ran a poll about selling 10% of his Tesla stock. More famously, he ran several about Twitter in 2022.\n\nThat included 70% of 2 million voters saying Twitter did not \"rigorously adhere\" to free speech, and 4.4 million users voting on an edit button.\n\nMusk then bought the platform for $44 billion and later renamed it X.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryanair has a market cap of nearly $36 billion — a fraction of Musk's $681 billion net worth.\n\nHowever, it's highly unlikely he could acquire it.\n\nIreland is part of the European Union, whose laws require airlines to be majority-owned by EU nationals or member states.\n\nAviation is a highly regulated sector. The rules are even stricter in the US, which says foreign ownership cannot exceed 25%.",

    "fullText": "Tesla boss clashed with Michael O’Leary when airline boss rejected installing Starlink technology on aircraft\n\nElon Musk has floated the idea of buying the budget airline Ryanair, escalating his public spat with the Irish carrier’s boss, Michael O’Leary.\n\nThe two outspoken businessmen have locked horns since last week, when O’Leary was asked whether he would follow Lufthansa and British Airways in installing Musk’s Starlink satellite internet technology on his fleet of 650 aircraft.\n\nThe Ryanair chief executive rejected the idea, saying that adding antennas to the jets would result in “2% fuel drag”, adding an extra $200m-$250m to its $5bn (£3.71bn) annual kerosene bill.\n\nMusk said that interpretation was “misinformed” in a post on his X platform, prompting a tit-for-tat exchange of insults, with each calling the other an “idiot” and then the Tesla and SpaceX CEO saying O’Leary should be fired.\n\nOn Friday, the world’s richest person asked his followers on X whether he should buy Europe’s biggest airline, which is valued at €30bn (£26bn), posting: “Should I buy Ryan Air and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?”\n\nHe followed it up with a poll asking whether he should “Buy Ryan Air and restore Ryan as their rightful ruler”. More than three-quarters of the nearly 900,000 respondents said yes, three hours before the poll closed. Tony Ryan, the Irish billionaire businessman who co-founded the budget airline in 1984, died in 2007.\n\nRyanair’s X account also mocked Musk, posting in response to an X outage across the US last week: “Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?”\n\nMusk wrote in a reply to a post from the airline teasing him: “How much would it cost to buy you?”\n\nAll this may look like idle talk, but the billionaire has followed through on such threats before. In a social media exchange in 2017 he tweeted that he loved Twitter and when a journalist suggested he should buy it, Musk replied: “How much is it?” He bought the platform almost five years later in a $44bn deal, later renaming it X.\n\nHowever, movements in the airline’s share price on Tuesday suggested investors were not taking the idea of a takeover seriously, with Ryanair shares closing nearly 1% down.\n\nMusk was born in South Africa and, after a stint in Canada, now lives in the US. Airlines based in the EU must be majority-owned by EU nationals or citizens of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein under the bloc’s rules.\n\nThe row began when O’Leary spoke on Irish radio on Friday, telling an interviewer that he would take no notice of what the Tesla CEO had to say about installing wifi on Ryanair planes.\n\n“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,” he told Newstalk. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot … What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”\n\nHe claimed that adding a Starlink antenna to every jet would push the fuel bill up by “an extra dollar for every passenger we fly and the reality for us is we can’t afford those costs. Passengers won’t pay for internet usage; if it’s free, they’ll use it – but they won’t pay one euro each to use the internet.”\n\nO’Leary, 64, also said he was “thankfully” too old to have any social media accounts.\n\nRyanair was contacted for comment.",

    "description": "Jacob...",
    "fullText": "The neofascist tech oligarch was cast out of Trump’s inner circle, but his money and influence are still omnipresent.\n\nLast June, the relationship between President Donald Trump and his top political benefactor, Elon Musk, seemed to be in shambles. Wrapping up his 180-day tenure as a “special government employee,” Musk had stepped down from the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which had secured for the world’s richest mogul even greater power (and some very valuable government data). Musk’s close involvement with the agenda of the second Trump administration had prompted critics to call it the “Trump-Musk White House”—but the now-sidelined tech oligarch seemed to have become the same sort of obsolete Trump crony that Rex Tillerson or Mike Pence had been in the wake of Trump’s first term.\n\nDespite all the chaos Musk fomented at DOGE by unleashing a corps of twentysomething engineers to wipe out payrolls and agencies under dodgy AI-driven data raids, he failed to sufficiently handicap the administrative state or nuke government spending as he had pledged to. Trump had also decided not to pick Musk’s close ally Jared Isaacman to be NASA administrator—a key post for a tech oligarch with a bevy of government rocket-launch contracts and aspirations to go to Mars—because of Isaacman’s history as a donor to Democratic political campaigns. Things were getting frosty.\n\nMusk, as is his wont, was posting hysterically late into the night on X. Rather than attacking destitute migrants or trans Democrats, Musk was now targeting Trump, whom he accused of various betrayals. The tech mogul claimed to be especially outraged over Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” that vastly expanded government spending while slashing taxes—a measure that Musk saw as a “disgusting abomination” certain to balloon the national debt. Finally, Musk wrote on X, it was “time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.”\n\nAs the Department of Justice’s dissembling in the ongoing Epstein files farrago has demonstrated, Musk was in some sense correct. But his supposed “really big bomb” had a surprisingly small blast radius. It also seemed to lack the conviction of its poster: Musk eventually deleted the message.\n\nMusk made noise about starting an America Party to challenge Trumpian spending, but it never went beyond a super PAC that seems destined to become another MAGA totem, on course to be folded into the mainstream GOP apparatus. While touting the work of Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian Trump gadfly, Musk has otherwise continued to put his money into top Republican organizations. He gave $15 million to three Republican super PACs just before he threatened to start his America Party.\n\nDespite being a vindictive president with vast powers at his disposal, Trump did nothing to retaliate against Musk after he began speaking out. There was some public bickering, including Trump threatening to “terminate” Musk’s government contracts. The president and some of his allies described Musk as an erratic drug addict. But the Musk-Trump relationship was easily mended, at least as a combined political project. Their handshake reunion at the Charlie Kirk memorial was a reminder of how quickly transactional political relationships can be repaired—and that Trump and Musk, who traded barbs well before the 2024 election, have done this before.\n\nWith an eye toward stopping any blue wave in the 2026 midterms, Musk is continuing to shovel money behind the MAGA electoral juggernaut and other administration priorities. Axios recently reported that Musk attended a meeting with Vice President JD Vance and various Trump advisers to discuss midterm donations and political strategy. Susie Wiles, the influential Trump chief of staff who had recently described Musk as a ketamine addict in an interview with Vanity Fair, was also there.\n\nSo in spite of the public furors that have hounded the Trump-Musk alliance, the deeper alignment of interests is clear. Musk needs government contracts and subsidies—which have amounted to $38 billion to date, according to an exhaustive Washington Post investigation. The Department of Defense and the Space Force need SpaceX’s rocket launch capabilities. Trump and the Republican Party need Musk’s money—after raking in some $290 million of it in the 2024 cycle—and the propagandistic power of X, which shouldn’t be underrated. And no one really needs an overblown public media war (that, given past results, would probably be poorly leveraged by Democrats but might fracture an increasingly fragile MAGA base).\n\nSince Musk left DOGE and implied that the president was a pedophile, his companies have continued to accrue valuable contracts, while SpaceX has cemented itself as the premier space-launch vehicle for an administration that would like to colonize everything from Greenland to outer space. In 2025, SpaceX received contracts from the US Space Force worth more than $6 billion. The Department of Defense continues to use Starlink, SpaceX’s Internet service built on thousands of small satellites crowding low-earth orbit, and handed out at least $200 million in contracts for xAI’s Grok, Musk’s Hitlerian, deepfake-crafting chatbot. That software will soon be integrated into military networks, Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth bragged. Other government departments that made deals to use Grok have been slower to roll out the software, citing a need for more testing.\n\nCompared to his colleagues Peter Thiel and David Sacks—both pivotal players in the rise of the tech right and the funneling of massive amounts of cash from Silicon Valley to Republican interests—Musk was late in coming to reactionary techno-fascism. A centi-billionaire who ruled over a large business empire, he was not deeply involved in electoral politics before 2020. That changed thanks to the social, economic, and political upheavals surrounding Covid—as well as the personal ordeal of his daughter Vivian Wilson coming out as trans and publicly disowning him. In response, Musk promptly disowned both social liberalism and democracy itself. He theorized a new public menace that he dubbed the woke mind virus and began setting his sights on controlling public discourse and the highest levels of government. And in his shambolic way, he’s been quite successful at it.\n\nMusk’s behavior may be terribly chaotic and inconsistent, full of impossible promises about technological glories to come and threats to create political organizations that never graduate beyond X posts. But he still has the zeal of the convert and unlimited resources. In his grievances—and in his social and business networks—Musk is firmly enmeshed in the far-right MAGA project underwritten by a new tech aristocracy that has little regard for the basic tenets of electoral democracy. For now, as 2026 approaches, Musk’s pro-Republican donations and rhetoric are already flowing firmly behind the president and his party’s prerogatives. The only question is how far the world’s richest man will go.",

    "description": "Legacy automakers and Tesla rival Rivian have recently announced roadmaps to pursue autonomous driving technology in-house.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has called legacy automakers' hesitancy to license Tesla's Full Self-Driving software \"crazy,\" but a slew of industry moves show that their reluctance is strategic.\n\nIn recent weeks, more automakers have released roadmaps to build key pieces of automated driving software rather than outsourcing the technology. Because automakers see vehicle tech as a brand-defining component, a Tesla license can become a hard sell.\n\nRivian, for example, is going deeper into vertical integration by designing a proprietary chip for the brain behind the company's autonomous driving computer. CEO RJ Scaringe even broached the idea of pursuing a robotaxi business at Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day in early December.\n\nLegacy automakers aren't taking the same ambitious route of designing custom chips, but they have begun to seek in-house solutions.\n\nFord announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that it plans to develop eyes-off driving software for public roads by 2028. The company said going in-house cuts costs by 30% and provides more control over how the software is integrated and deployed.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" Paul Costa, Ford's head of electrical engineering, told Business Insider. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nMusk said in a X post in November that it was \"crazy\" that legacy automakers didn't want to license Tesla FSD, an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that the EV maker has said will enable fully autonomous driving.\n\n\"When legacy auto does occasionally reach out, they tepidly discuss implementing FSD for a tiny program in 5 years with unworkable requirements for Tesla, so pointless,\" Musk said in the post.\n\nMusk didn't specify what those requirements were. A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExperts who track the software side of the automotive industry told Business Insider there's a practical reason to go in-house, even if there are near-term challenges.\n\nChris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte who consults for key automakers, told Business Insider that companies have to decide what level of autonomy their customer base will want and how to achieve it, like using lidar or using a cameras-only system.\n\n\"It's not so much like, 'I'm taking it in-house because I don't want to use somebody's technology.' But this is a competitive business for them,\" Ahn said. \"People who own Fords own Fords for certain reasons that are probably different reasons than why people who own Mercedes own Mercedes. And I think each of these automakers are going to have to define what does ADAS mean for the user base of my brand today.\"\n\nSteve Man, a senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider that the technology stack of autonomous vehicles could be thought of as three interconnected parts: the software, the sensors, and the actuators — the components that control the physical movement of the car.\n\nAll three components need to be able to \"talk\" to each other within a vehicle platform, Man said, which can be challenging and costly to do when an automaker relies on multiple suppliers.\n\n\"It's actually cheaper to bring everything in-house to integrate those three buckets of things,\" Man said.\n\nAs automakers seek more control over their technology, the tools to build autonomy are becoming more accessible. That makes a Tesla FSD license a less compelling business case.\n\nAt CES, Nvidia introduced Alpamayo, a package of AI reasoning models, simulation tools, and datasets automakers can use to develop self-driving technology.\n\nMercedes-Benz was revealed to be Nvidia's first major customer; the automaker plans to launch a Tesla FSD-level ADAS built on Alpamayo by the end of the year.\n\nAlpamayo isn't a full-stack autonomous driving software that automakers simply plug in. An Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider it's a toolset that can \"strengthen and speed up an OEM's own ADAS or autonomy program, whether they're building end-to-end systems or upgrading existing architectures.\"\n\nAutomakers still need proprietary data and talent to implement and develop their autonomous systems.\n\nHugh Nguyen, a KPMG partner who specializes in autonomous driving systems, told Business Insider that Alpamayo \"democratizes\" AV development by reducing the cost and time for training self-driving systems.\n\nDuring a Q&A session at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Tesla FSD \"completely world-class,\" before drawing a distinction between Tesla's goals and Nvidia's.\n\n\"We're not a self-driving car company,\" he said. \"We just want to enable the world's autonomous industry. Everything that moves should be autonomous.\"",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) just delivered a rare double whammy to Nvidia (NVDA) over the past weekend.\n\nCEO Elon Musk revealed that Tesla’s much-talked-about AI5 self-driving chips are nearly complete, and that the next one, A16, is already underway.\n\nWith the AI inference part covered, Musk said Sunday on X that Dojo 3 is being restarted, pushing Tesla back into large-scale AI training after previously pulling back.\n\nNvidia threw the first punch, though, when it rolled out “Alpamayo” at CES 2026 (an open-source autonomous vehicle AI toolkit), aiming to become the default autonomy platform powering a ton of brands.\n\nMusk responded swiftly, downplaying the risk.\n\nClearly, this is a mighty interesting time for the AV industry, with the tug-of-war between two giants in Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nFor Tesla, it’s all about building a closed loop that covers the entire AV stack.\n\nTesla-designed in-car compute (this includes AI5, which is “nearly done,” and the AI6, which is already underway)\n\nTesla’s camera-first software stack\n\nTesla’s data flywheel is powered by its own fleet\n\nSo for Tesla, it’s all about keeping the autonomy part within its potent ecosystem, as Nvidia looks to power everyone else.\n\nFor investors, these promises aren’t new, which makes the follow-through all the more critical.\n\nTesla is looking to tighten its grip on the hardware behind self-driving.\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nForget Blackwell, Nvidia future is Vera Rubin, agentic software\n\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\n\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\n\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nMusk announced on Saturday in an X post that the EV giant is nearing completion of its AI5 self-driving computer chip, and that the AI6 is already in development.\n\nAccording to Musk, the AI5 chips, which are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, will enter high-volume production in 2027, replacing the AI4 hardware. Also, Tesla has lined up Samsung Electronics for U.S.-based chip manufacturing.\n\nIt’s pretty easy to get lost in the AI jargon, so it’s important to be clear about things at each step about what’s happening.\n\nThe A15 and A16 move is essentially about “inference at the edge”. That’s basically running Tesla’s Full Self-Driving neural nets inside the car, instead of relying on a third-party compute stack.",

OpenAI's chief research officer, Mark Chen, said in December that Mark Zuckerberg attempted to lure some OpenAI engineers to Meta by hand-delivering them soup.\n\nxAI's focus on hiring comes as the startup continues to grow despite being embroiled in controversy over its Grok chatbot.\n\nThe AI startup raised $20 billion earlier this month at a valuation of over $230 billion, as it battles backlash around the world over Grok generating sexualized images of real people on X.\n\nThe social media platform said last week it would prevent Grok from sexualizing images of real people after California's Attorney General said the state would launch an investigation into reports that Grok had produced deepfakes of women and minors on X.\n\nThe AI chatbot has also faced temporary bans in Indonesia and Malaysia, and an investigation from the UK's media regulator. xAI did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on the Netflix model for its self-driving software — and owners we talked to have mixed feelings about the move.\n\nOn Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla's supervised Full Self-Driving software — known as FSD — will only be offered behind its $99-a-month paywall after February 14.\n\nIt's a major shift for the electric-car maker. Tesla first began selling its self-driving software in late 2016 for $5,000, later raising the price (it's currently $8,000) and introducing a monthly subscription option in 2021.\n\nNow, drivers who want their car to steer, brake, and change lanes on its own will only have the option to pay $99 month to month.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three Tesla owners about the change. Their reactions ranged from frustration to enthusiasm.\n\n\"It's a big turnoff for me,\" Leslie Snipes, an owner of a standard-range Model 3, told Business Insider. \"Especially since nearly everything is now a subscription.\"\n\nSnipes said she tested FSD during a complimentary one-month trial when she bought her car in 2022. She loved the feature at the time, but a lifetime purchase cost $10,000 back then — a cost she said was too high for her family.\n\nNow, her biggest concern is safety.\n\n\"I have much less confidence in Tesla's self-driving,\" she said. \"I've had multiple experiences where the cameras were inoperable due to low-light conditions or obstructions like rain, which makes this shift concerning.\"\n\nShe said she'd only consider paying for FSD for specific months, like when she is planning long road trips.\n\nScott Anderson, who just bought a Model Y in Arizona, said he never seriously considered paying thousands of dollars upfront for the software. He chose the monthly subscription and remains excited about the tech.\n\n\"My wife and I recently took a trip about 70 miles from home up into the mountains,\" he said. \"Our new car drove us the entire way without any interruptions.\"\n\nAnderson added that he hopes the monthly price will eventually come down as Tesla rolls out more advanced technology.\n\nBut for longtime Tesla owners who have already outright purchased the software, Musk's announcement carries different implications.\n\n\"I find myself using FSD more and more as I drive,\" Nikki Lindgren, a California Tesla owner who bought the technology years ago, told Business Insider. \"The change would mostly modify if or when we replace our current Tesla.\"\n\nLindgren said the shift to subscriptions could discourage her from buying a new Tesla unless the company allows customers to transfer previously purchased software to another vehicle.\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nTesla is facing some critical self-driving deadlines this year, including its robotaxis entering more major cities and ramping up volume production of the Cybercab.\n\nDelivering on the promises carries enormous weight for CEO Elon Musk. His attention-grabbing $1 trillion pay package is tied in part to the company's self-driving vision, raising the pressure to prove that its technology — and the revenue it generates — is moving closer to full autonomy.\n\nSeth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who monitors Tesla, said the company's switch to monthly subscriptions indicates \"growing confidence\" inside the EV maker about its technology's momentum. He even thinks drivers might soon be able to take their eyes off the road when the car is in FSD.\n\nBut he doesn't think that rollout will be paired with lower prices for consumers.\n\n\"Once unsupervised is released, I expect the price will rise to reflect the additional driving capabilities and we could see Tesla offer bundles that include charging and insurance in some states,\" he said. \"Admittedly, this just shifts the payment from one loan payment including the vehicle and FSD to two payments.\"\n\nGoldstein said he thinks most drivers will respond like Snipes, the most skeptical Tesla owner that Business Insider spoke to.\n\n\"This may lead to some consumers purchasing a Tesla as they can choose to buy FSD later or only purchase it in months when they plan to take a longer trip,\" he said.",

Paul Wazzan, named in the filing as \"a financial economist with decades of professional and academic experience.\"\n\nThe document alleges Musk was defrauded of the $38 million in seed money he donated to OpenAI when he helped found it in 2015, and states he is now entitled to a percentage of OpenAI's current $500 billion valuation.\n\nMusk said on his social media platform, X, on Friday: \"Can't wait to start the trial. The discovery and testimony will blow your mind.\"\n\nMusk is suing OpenAI's key leaders, including the CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, over allegations that the AI company misled him by shifting away from its core mission to remain a nonprofit.\n\nWazzan calculated that Musk should receive $65.50 billion to $109.43 billion in \"wrongful gains\" from OpenAI. He made a similar calculation for Microsoft's \"wrongful gains,\" which equated to between $13.30 billion and $25.06 billion.\n\nMusk has been using recently unsealed court documents to attack his rival in posts on X. On Friday, OpenAI published a blog titled \"The truth Elon left out.\"\n\nThe blog, which provided commentary alongside excerpts from several court documents, said that Musk wanted \"full control\" of OpenAI, \"since he'd been burned by not having it in the past.\" It added that OpenAI's leadership was surprised when Musk suggested having his kids control AGI, or artificial general intelligence, during conversations about succession planning.\n\nThe statements address the heart of Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI.\n\n\"Mr. Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign. We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best-resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nMusk and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft, saying he deserves the \"wrongful gains\" that they received from his early support, according to a court filing ​on Friday.\n\nOpenAI gained between $65.5 billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's contributions when he was co-founding what ‌was then a startup from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion, Musk said in the federal court filing ahead of his trial ‌against the two companies.\n\n\"Without Elon Musk, there'd be no OpenAI. He provided the bulk of the seed funding, lent his reputation, and taught them all he knows about scaling a business.

A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence ‍that the company \"aided and abetted\" OpenAI.\n\nThe two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate filing on Friday.\n\nMusk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and runs xAI with its competitor chatbot Grok, alleges that ChatGPT operator OpenAI violated its founding mission in a high-profile ​restructuring to a for-profit entity.\n\nA judge in Oakland, California, ruled this month that a jury will hear the ‌trial, expected to start in April.\n\nMusk's filing says he contributed about $38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding, helped recruit staff, connect the founders with contacts and lend credibility to the project when it was created.\n\n\"Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor's initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned - and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much ⁠larger than Mr. Musk's initial contributions,\" Musk argues.\n\nThe filing says Musk's ​contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, ​financial economist C.

    "description": "From Elon Musk to Mark Zuckerberg, here's a look back at what industry titans were doing 10 years ago and what has changed.",
    "fullText": "Forget what you were doing in 2016 — what about the world's tech elite?\n\nMillennials are posting throwback pictures on social media and reminiscing over what many see as simpler times.\n\nIn some ways, the tech world was, too. Then, it was the era of apps. Today, it's the age of AI. Tech founders were more likely to be celebrated as disruptors, but in 2026, there is greater wariness about the billionaire class providing the tools we use every day.\n\nHere's what tech leaders were up to in 2016, and how their companies, personal brands, and net worths have changed in the decade since.\n\nA lot has changed for Elon Musk since 2016. The Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder is now worth over half a trillion dollars and wields extraordinary influence across the worlds of business and politics. But 10 years ago, he had a net worth of just over $11 billion, expressed little interest in politics, and was better known as an ambitious entrepreneur pioneering clean energy and rocket technology.\n\nIn July 2016, Musk released Tesla's \"masterplan part deux,\" which outlined the company's goals of building more affordable EVs and rolling out fleets of self-driving cars that make money for Tesla owners even when they're not using them. While Tesla has achieved the first goal, introducing the Model 3 and Y and dominating the US EV market, the second has proven more elusive.\n\nMusk also spent 2016 helping set up a mysterious new startup with an ambitious mission of building superintelligent AI — OpenAI. A decade later, he's suing the company and his former cochair, Sam Altman, over claims he was misled over the ChatGPT maker's abandonment of its nonprofit mission.\n\nIt's not just Mark Zuckerberg's personal look that's changed over the last decade — his company has a completely different name.\n\nIn 2016, Facebook was focused on social media and advertising growth. After rebranding to Meta in 2021 to focus on the metaverse, the company today is all in on the AI boom. Oh, and Zuckerberg wears chains now.\n\nA decade ago, Facebook was starting to come under scrutiny for its political influence, including the 2016 election that put Donald Trump in the White House. That's changed. Now, Zuckerberg openly embraces the Trump administration, and Meta this month hired his former advisor and official.\n\nZuckerberg was already a billionaire tech elite in 2016, but today he is the sixth-richest person in the world with a net worth of $220 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWhile Altman was influential in Silicon Valley in 2016, he was nowhere near the global name he is today. In 2016, Altman was leading the transformation of startup seed accelerator Y Combinator as its president, having launched a VC arm, a fellowship program, and a research lab.\n\nThe year before, Altman and Musk became co-chairs of OpenAI, having formed part of the team that founded the company. The company had already raised $1 billion in 2015 toward conducting research to benefit humanity. At the time, Altman told Business Insider that OpenAI's specific research goals were still being debated.\n\nAltman launched the website Voteplz in 2016 to streamline the voting process in the presidential election, and said in a tweet he was voting against Trump because he believed \"the principles he stands for represent an unacceptable threat to America.\"\n\nDespite this early opposition, Altman lauded Trump last year as a \"pro-business, pro-innovation president\".\n\nSame leather jacket. A whole different status. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, may have kept the same style, but his company has evolved from a gaming chip giant into the world's most valuable company that's also critical to the AI boom.\n\nThe graphics processing units designed by Nvidia were mostly sold to gamers in 2016, but its chips were already being used in AI research labs. Now they are stacked up in data centers across the world to power AI models like ChatGPT. They have become so important to the global economy that any signs of weakness in Nvidia's results prompt fears of an AI bubble.\n\nDespite founding the world's most valuable company, his net worth of $155 billion puts him in ninth place on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. Still, that's a huge jump from his net worth of about $3 billion at the end of 2016.\n\nPhilanthropy continues to dominate Bill Gates' public life. The Microsoft cofounder has ramped up donations through the Gates Foundation — formerly known as The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — as part of his plan to give away nearly all his wealth over the next 20 years.\n\nIn 2016, Gates was the richest person in the world with a net worth of $87.4 billion. With his then-wife, Melinda French Gates, the two dedicated their 2016 annual letter to clean-energy development, writing about making zero-carbon emissions a priority and bringing energy to the world's poorest people.\n\nThe foundation focused on eliminating HIV, malaria, and other infectious diseases — a mission that has continued to 2026.\n\nIn 2016, Amazon was already dominating the online retail market, and Jeff Bezos was still the company's CEO.\n\nDespite a barrage of negative media attention the year before based on reports that Amazon warehouses were high-pressure, toxic work environments — claims Bezos disputed — the company's dominance in cloud was growing. This trajectory has continued with Amazon Web Services seeing a 20% cloud sales growth in the third quarter of 2025, with plans to double capacity by the end of 2027.\n\nBezos said in 2016 that his ambition for his space technology company, Blue Origin, was to move heavy, polluting industry away from Earth to one day save the planet. In November 2025, the firm had its first successful booster recovery, bringing Blue Origin closer to rivaling SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nBezos was still married to MacKenzie Scott before the two filed for divorce in 2019. He stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021 and married Lauren Sánchez in a lavish multi-day celebration in Venice in June 2025.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is turning to the court of public opinion as it wages a legal battle with Elon Musk.\n\nWhile Musk and OpenAI prepare to head to a high-stakes jury trial in April, the two are duking it out online over what exactly happened when Musk split ways with the AI startup he helped cofound.\n\nMusk has been using recently unsealed court documents to attack his rival in posts on his social media platform, X. On Friday, OpenAI published a blog titled \"The truth Elon left out.\"\n\nThe blog, which provided commentary alongside excerpts from several court documents, alleges that Musk wanted \"full control\" of OpenAI, \"since he'd been burned by not having it in the past,\" and that OpenAI's leadership was surprised when Musk suggested having his kids control AGI or artificial general intelligence during conversations about succession planning.\n\nThe statements are aimed at the heart of Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI.\n\nMusk is suing OpenAI's key leaders, including CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, over allegations that the AI company misled him by shifting away from its core mission to remain a nonprofit. Musk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was a nonprofit.\n\nThe startup, since its 2015 founding, operated as a nonprofit-controlled organization with a for-profit operating arm. It completed its transition to a for-profit public benefit corporation in October 2025.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLast Tuesday, more than 100 documents related to the suit were unsealed, including diary entries from Brockman, which were obtained during the discovery process.\n\nIn one of the entries that was highlighted, Brockman appeared to write about his misgivings about pushing Musk out of OpenAI and committing to a nonprofit-only entity.\n\n\"Cannot say that we are committed to the non-profit,\" the entry from the court documents said. \"Don't want to say that we're committed. If three months later we're doing b-corp then it was a lie.\"\n\nIt was Brockman's diary entries that US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers cited in a recent ruling, in which she determined Musk had enough evidence that he'd been misled to take the case to trial.",

    "fullText": "How confident are you in AI? Enough to bet your retirement on it?\n\nThat's become a debate thanks to a bold proclamation by Elon Musk: Saving for retirement in 10 or 20 years \"won't matter.\"\n\nMusk's confidence comes from the work he's doing in artificial intelligence. The technological advancements will create an \"abundance\" of resources, granting everyone a \"universal high income,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said.\n\nThat's easy to say when you have checks notes and almost passes out nearly $700 billion in the bank. What about people whose net worths have a lot fewer zeros?\n\nA group of BI reporters reached out to seven personal finance and AI gurus to get their take. They all agreed you shouldn't stop those direct deposits into your 401(K).\n\nEven if AI increases productivity and reduces costs over time, it's not clear whether the benefits will be distributed evenly across the population.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans are already in a precarious position regarding their retirement. Last year, BI's Noah Sheidlower spoke to nearly 200 Americans who continue to work past the age of 80 as part of our \"80 over 80\" series.\n\nWhile some like the fact that they can still work, others don't have a choice. And that's with the benefit of Social Security, a safety net that might not exist in the future.\n\nYou can't completely discredit Musk's take, though.\n\nYes, forgoing retirement on the belief that AI and tech will just figure it out in a few decades is a massive gamble. But the past few years have reminded us that tech can quickly flip the script on conventional wisdom.\n\nFive years ago, a career as a computer programmer felt secure. Now … not so much.\n\nIt's not a new phenomenon. My colleague Alistair Barr recently wrote in his Tech Memo newsletter () that the US quickly went from having 25 million horses to fewer than two million thanks to the arrival of the steam engine.\n\nEven if Musk is right, you'll probably still want some extra pocket change. Money isn't just about being able to buy things. It's also about access and exclusivity, and it's not clear how that might work in this new utopia.\n\nIt's not just going to Disney World; it's being able to cut the lines. It's not just getting tickets to the game; it's sitting courtside.\n\nBut if everyone's got \"universal high income,\" how will those perks work? Will all of us be equal? Or maybe some of us will be more equal than others?",

    "fullText": "Ashley St. Clair, who gave birth to one of Elon Musk's sons in 2024, sued Musk's xAI in a New York court on Thursday, alleging that its chatbot Grok generated sexually explicit deepfake images of her at users' request.\n\nIn the complaint, St. Clair, a writer, influencer, and political strategist, claims X users prompted Grok to manipulate images of her, including photos from when she was 14, into graphic sexual content. She alleges some images remained online for more than a week and that her premium X account was later terminated after she complained.\n\nShe is also requesting a temporary restraining order to compel xAI to immediately cease from \"the intentional disclosure of nonconsensual intimate images.\"\n\nxAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Grok first promised Ms. St. Clair that it would refrain from manufacturing more images unclothing her,\" the complaint read. \"Instead, Defendant retaliated against her, demonetizing her X account and generating multitudes more images of her,\" the suit alleged.\n\nSt. Clair is also involved in a separate suit with Musk over the custody of their son, in which she sought sole custody.\n\nxAI responded the same day with a separate lawsuit, arguing that St. Clair agreed to its terms of service, which requires any litigation to be heard in Texas. St. Clair is represented by attorney Carrie Goldberg, who specializes in cases involving abuse and has represented clients against Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\"xAI is not a reasonably safe product,\" Goldberg said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm.\"\n\nThe lawsuit followed international backlash against the Grok chatbot for its ability to undress images of real people and create sexualized images without their consent at users' request.\n\nIndonesia and Malaysia blocked access to Grok, while UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called explicit images generated by Grok \"disgusting\" and \"shameful\" in a meeting with the House of Commons.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta also announced that his office is investigating the \"non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online\" of \"women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations.\"\n\nX said on the same day in a blog post that users would no longer be allowed to create AI photos of real people in sexualized or revealing clothing on the platform, adding that the restriction \"applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Business Insider reporter Henry Chandonnet found that it is still \"surprisingly easy\" to prompt Grok to create nude images of him by going to the app itself instead of using the Grok chatbot on X.",

    "fullText": "Europe's biggest airline won't be installing Starlink on its planes anytime soon, and senior SpaceX staff like Elon Musk aren't best pleased.\n\nRyanair CEO Michael O'Leary isn't convinced by Starlink, Musk's satellite internet provider, which is becoming more popular among airlines.\n\nFor example, Lufthansa — the German flag carrier which runs the continent's second-largest airline group — announced on Tuesday that it would introduce the service. The following day, Scandinavian Airlines operated its first flight with Starlink.\n\nHowever, as a budget airline, Ryanair is known for its no-frills offering.\n\n\"We don't think ‍our ⁠passengers are willing to pay for WiFi for an average ⁠one-hour flight,\" O'Leary told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nHis comments sparked a debate on X. Musk said in a post: \"They [Ryanair] will lose customers to airlines that do have internet.\"\n\nRyanair and its subsidiaries operate a fleet of 643 airplanes, which handled 206 million passengers last year. 2024's statistics showed that it was the world's third-largest airline group, behind American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.\n\nThe Irish airline's low-cost business model allows it to offer tickets as low as 15 euros, or about $17.40. It focuses on quick turnarounds between flights, charging for add-ons like sitting next to your friends, and on-board sales, including scratchcards and duty-free cigarettes.\n\nEvery airline that's announced Starlink deals so far has included free in-flight internet for everyone on board. So, even if O'Leary changed his mind, it seems unlikely that Musk's company would let him charge Ryanair passengers to use Starlink.\n\nSpaceX executives also took umbrage at what they said was incorrect information about the fuel costs incurred by installing Starlink.\n\n\"You need to put [an] antenna on [the] fuselage — it comes with a 2% fuel ⁠penalty because of ​the weight and ​drag,\" O'Leary told Reuters.\n\nMichael Nicolls, the VP of Starlink engineering, said in an X post that Starlink terminals have a more fuel-efficient profile than other airplane internet providers. He added that SpaceX's analysis showed a Starlink terminal instead increased fuel costs by 0.3% on a Boeing 737-800, the model that makes up the bulk of Ryanair's fleet.\n\n\"Hmm, must be a way to get that down under 0.1%,\" Musk replied to him.\n\nRyanair declined to comment on Musk's and Nicolls' remarks when contacted by Business Insider. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile US budget airlines have recently pivoted to offer more premium options under intense financial pressures, Ryanair has little reason to do so. Adding an amenity like Starlink would be at odds with its business model, especially if it were free for passengers.\n\nPost-pandemic, more American travellers have been paying extra for more luxurious flights. Budget airlines have also struggled to compete on price with legacy carriers.\n\nBut on the other side of the Atlantic, Ryanair has managed to balance a spartan approach with financial success.\n\nIn its latest quarterly earnings, Ryanair posted after-tax profits of 1.72 billion euros, about $2 billion — a 20% increase from a year earlier. Southwest Airlines' latest quarterly earnings were down nearly 20% year-over-year to $54 million.",

    "fullText": "STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's Grok chatbot is testing Europe's ability to clamp down on deepfakes and digital undressing of images online, even after regulators scored a rare win by forcing Musk's xAI to curb the creation of sexualized images.\n\nxAI said late on Wednesday ​it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users after the chatbot churned out thousands of sexualized images of women and minors that alarmed global regulators.\n\nThe ‌climb-down by Musk, who initially laughed off the trend, highlights the difficulty of policing AI tools that make it cheap and easy to create explicit content. It is the latest clash between Europe and Musk, following rows ‌over election interference, content moderation and free speech.\n\nMany regulators are still scrambling to develop laws and rules to govern AI, with question marks over what constitutes nudity, how to define consent, and who bears responsibility: the user or the platform.\n\n\"It's really a grey zone with regards to the creation of the nude images,\" Ängla Pändel, a Stockholm-based data protection and privacy lawyer with Mannheimer Swartling, told Reuters.\n\nBritish regulator Ofcom, one of the most vocal on the issue, welcomed the move by Musk, but said its investigation into xAI over the Grok images would continue.\n\n\"Our formal investigation remains ⁠ongoing,\" a spokesperson said. \"We are working round the clock to ‌progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what's being done to fix it.\"\n\nSTRONGEST ENFORCEMENT STILL NEEDED, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nEarlier this month, Grok created hyper-realistic images of women on X manipulated to look like they were in tiny bikinis, degrading poses or even covered in bruises. ‍Some minors were digitally stripped down to swimwear.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Reuters found the chatbot still produced sexualized images privately on demand. That appeared to have been curbed at least in certain geographies on Thursday.\n\nMusk's xAI said it was blocking users from generating images of people in skimpy attire in \"jurisdictions where it's illegal\". It did not identify those jurisdictions.\n\nIn Malaysia and Indonesia the government has imposed temporary bans on Grok, ​while EU and UK regulators called the images unlawful. The UK, France and Italy launched probes, but faced calls for tougher action.\n\n\"Stronger enforcement under the Digital Services Act (DSA) ‌is needed to stop apps and platforms that sexualise or nudify women and children,\" said Christian Democrat MEP Nina Carberry, who called the latest move a \"positive step\".\n\n⁠A European Commission spokesperson said that if the Grok changes were not effective, the Commission would still use the full enforcement toolbox of the EU's DSA against the platform.\n\nLEGAL GREY AREA, HEAVY BURDEN ON VICTIMS\n\nThe UK's Online Safety Act makes the sharing of intimate images without consent, including AI-generated deepfakes, a 'priority offence', said Alexander Brown, a UK-based data protection lawyer at Simmons & Simmons.\n\n\"This means X must take proactive, proportionate steps to prevent such content from appearing on its platform and to swiftly remove it when detected,\" he said.\n\nBritain's regulator can fine a company up to 10% ⁠of revenue in the most serious cases of non-compliance or ask a court to require internet service ​providers to block the site.\n\nFor individuals, taking platforms to court is \"a really difficult and heavy process,” said ​Anders Bergsten, a lawyer at Mannheimer Swartling, citing the emotional toll on victims.\n\nDeepfakes have existed for years, well before the advent of the AI apps, though they were largely confined to the darker corners of the web. The publishing power of X gives Grok unprecedented reach.\n\n\"The frictionless publishing capability enables ‍the deepfakes to spread at scale,\" said U.S.-based ⁠lawyer Carrie Goldberg, who works with cyber harassment victims.\n\nLaws in Britain and Sweden make the non-consensual sharing of nude images illegal. Britain is widening the law to include the making of such images.\n\nUnder the DSA, suspending a service is considered a last resort. The EU AI Act also does not have any provision for nude ⁠images of adults, only transparency obligations for deepfakes, experts said.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed X's move on Thursday but warned: \"Free speech is not the freedom to violate consent. Young women's images are not public property, ‌and their safety is not up for debate.\"\n\n\"If we need to strengthen existing laws further, we are prepared to do that.\"",

The U.K. and European Union were investigating potential violations of online safety laws.\n\nFrance and India have also issued warnings, demanding stricter controls. Brazil called for an investigation into Grok’s misuse.\n\nThe British government, which has been one of Grok’s most vociferous critics in recent days, has welcomed the change, while the country’s regulator, Ofcom, said it would carry on with its investigation.\n\n“I shall not rest until all social media platforms meet their legal duties and provide a service that is safe and age-appropriate to all users,” Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta urged xAI to ensure there is no further harassment of women and girls from Grok’s editing functions.\n\n“We have zero tolerance for the AI-based creation and dissemination of nonconsensual intimate images or of child sexual abuse material,” he said.\n\nCalifornia has passed laws to shield minors from AI-generated sexual imagery of children and require AI chatbot platforms to remind users they aren’t interacting with a human.\n\nBut Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also vetoed a law last year that would have restricted children’s access to AI chatbots.\n\nPan Pylas in London contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "\"Savings? Where we're going, we don't need savings.\"\n\nThat twist on Doc Brown's famous line from \"Back to the Future\" captures Elon Musk's controversial view that future retirees won't need nest eggs.\n\n\"Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO told the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast earlier this month. \"It won't matter.\"\n\nThe world's richest man predicted that advances in AI, energy, and robotics will generate such an \"abundance\" of resources for all that individuals' retirement savings will be \"irrelevant.\"\n\nMusk's blue-sky vision comes at a time when years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and weak wage growth have created a nationwide affordability crisis. Household debt hit an all-time high of $18.59 trillion in the third quarter of 2025, up more than 50% from the same point in 2015.\n\nBusiness Insider asked seven personal finance and AI experts for their thoughts on Musk's comments.\n\nTheir reactions all boiled down to one thing: You really should be saving for retirement.\n\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"Most Americans should absolutely ignore these comments,\" said Geoffrey Sanzenbacher, a research fellow at Boston College's Center for Retirement Research (CRR). \"Musk's speculation sends a dangerous and misleading message.\"\n\nSanzenbacher cast doubt on Musk's timeframe, and said the tech billionaire's words were \"especially dangerous\" as Social Security is likely to be cut in the coming years due to a funding shortfall.\n\nAmericans should be \"saving more, not less,\" given that prospect, he said. He added that even if Musk's future comes to pass, \"people who saved now will hardly be much worse off in this utopian future.\"\n\nAlicia Munnell, a senior advisor at CRR and its former director, also dismissed Musk's recommendation.\n\n\"I would pay no attention to anything Elon Musk says out of his core area of expertise,\" she said.\n\n\"He has no idea how the American lives, how important Social Security and 401(k)s are to maintaining people's standard of living,\" Munnell continued. \"He needs to stay out of public policy and concentrate on going to Mars!\"\n\nOlivia Mitchell, the director of Wharton's Boettner Center on Pensions and Retirement Research, said there was \"some truth\" in Musk's view that AI could boost productivity and reduce costs over time.\n\nBut she warned his advice was \"risky\" for US households, especially as their retirement security will \"still depend heavily on individual saving beyond Social Security.\"\n\n\"Even in a richer economy, gains are likely to be uneven and uncertain, so people must still save, in case the future does not unfold as predicted,\" Mitchell added.\n\nKristin Pugh, a private wealth manager at Creative Planning, said AI would allow people to afford their basic needs without working, freeing them to spend more time doing other things\n\nBut past technological advances have made people more productive without leading them to work less, and created wealth gains that weren't distributed equally, she said.\n\n\"Before we 'cancel' the idea of saving for another time in our lives, let's look at the environment and the logistics that would provide for our basic needs,\" Pugh said.\n\n\"We need to push leaders like Musk and Altman for the game plan and the logistics of the vision before any decisions are made,\" she added, referring to Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI.\n\nEkaterina Abramova, a professor at the London Business School specializing in machine learning, said that AI will \"undoubtedly reshape\" the world over the next 20 years, but this will not automatically negate the need for retirement savings.\n\n\"A future of 'universal high income' would depend less on AI itself than on governments choosing to redistribute its gains generously and sustainably, across borders and amid inevitable social friction,\" she said.\n\nJohn Nosta, an innovation theorist and the founder of NostaLab, agreed that Musk's \"promise that retirement planning will become obsolete rests on a fragile chain of assumptions.\"\n\nIt \"presumes that political will, fiscal design (and management), social trust, and intergenerational fairness will mature in lockstep with machine capability,\" and this \"new equilibrium will be durable across decades,\" he said.\n\n\"That is not a technological problem — it is a coordination problem at the scale of civilization,\" Nosta added.\n\nNosta said it's critical that people protect themselves against the risks and uncertainties of life through financial planning, \"rather than assuming that abundance will simply carry everyone safely downstream to an abstract utopian destination.\"\n\nJames Ransom, a research fellow at University College London, said that new technologies have a \"pretty terrible track record of boosting wealth evenly across society\" and he hasn't seen any evidence that AI will be an exception.\n\nUsing a historical analogy, Ransom underlined just how bad humans are at predicting the future.\n\n\"Some employees of the RAND Corporation who were researching nuclear war in the 1950s didn't contribute to their pensions because they didn't believe they would live long enough,\" he said. \"This seemed rational to them, at the time. Let's learn from them, and not swing too far in the other direction.\"",

    "fullText": "UK government claims vindication after Keir Starmer criticised earlier decision to keep functionality as ‘horrific’\n\nThe UK government has claimed “vindication” after Elon Musk’s X announced it had stopped its AI-powered Grok feature from editing pictures of real people to show them in revealing clothes such as bikinis, including for premium subscribers.\n\nAfter a fortnight of public outcry at the tool embedded into X being used to create sexualised images of women and children, the company said it would “geoblock” the ability of users “to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X”, in countries where it was illegal.\n\nIt said it would do this in the UK in line with law changes ministers have pledged to introduce. X also said it had “zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content”. It did not specify whether people would still be able to create such images on the standalone Grok app.\n\nThe prime minister, Keir Starmer, called X’s earlier decision to continue allowing the tool to be used by paid subscribers “horrific”. He also called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful” in parliament on Wednesday. Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, called it “a further insult to victims, effectively monetising this horrific crime”.\n\nOfcom, the UK media regulator, on Monday launched a formal investigation into Musk’s platform after what it called “deeply concerning” reports of Grok being used to create and share illegal nonconsensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material on X.\n\nAn Ofcom spokesperson said: “X has said it’s implemented measures to prevent the Grok account from being used to create intimate images of people. This is a welcome development. However, our formal investigation remains ongoing. We are working round the clock to progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what’s being done to fix it.”\n\nKendall welcomed the latest move by X but said she expected Ofcom’s investigation to “robustly establish the facts”.\n\nScrutiny of Grok has intensified globally after it emerged some people were using it to digitally undress women and children without their consent and posting those images to X. Thousands of these sexualised AI images have appeared X over the last few weeks. xAI, which makes Grok, also owns X, and both are run by Musk.\n\nThe changes to the X and Grok systems came hours after the billionaire posted on his site: “I [sic] not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.”\n\nMusk’s xAI and X have faced growing backlash globally, including an investigation by California’s attorney general and calls by lawmakers and advocacy groups for Apple and Google to drop Grok from their app stores. Countries including Malaysia and Indonesia have instigated bans or legal action.\n\nX said in a statement: “We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and nonconsensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking child sexual exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”\n\nMusk has said that Grok was programmed to refuse illegal requests and must comply with the laws of any given country or state. “Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images. It does so only according to user requests,” Musk said on Wednesday.\n\nMusk has said earlier on X that anyone using Grok to make illegal content would suffer the same consequences as if they uploaded illegal content.\n\nThree Democratic US senators last week called on Apple and Alphabet’s Google to remove X and its built-in AI tool Grok from their app stores, citing the spread of nonconsensual sexual images of women and minors on the platform. A coalition of women’s groups, tech watchdogs and progressive activists also made similar appeals to the tech companies.\n\nLast week, X curtailed Grok’s ability to generate or edit images publicly for users who were not paying subscribers. But industry experts and watchdogs said that Grok was still able to produce sexually explicit images, and that restrictions, such as paywalling certain features, may not fully block access to deeper AI image tools.\n\nIn the UK, the law is changing this week to criminalise the creation of such images, and Starmer said on Wednesday that X was working to comply with the new rules.",

    "description": "Never underestimate the power of financial incentives. Even for tech billionaires.",
    "fullText": "\"You get what you measure\" is one of my favorite concepts in modern business. It means people and organizations tend to focus their behavior on whatever metrics get tracked and rewarded.\n\nThis even applies to tech billionaires.\n\nThis week, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will make its FSD service subscription-only and remove the option to buy it outright.\n\nOn social media, Elon stans theorized and argued with Elon-haters over the reason for this change. As usual, the debate was devoid of nuance. Fans took this as another sign of the Tesla CEO's genius. Critics argued this proves FSD doesn't work and is doomed.\n\nAs usual, the truth lies elsewhere. Here's my theory, which my Business Insider colleague Tom Carter nodded at earlier.\n\nI think Tesla is getting what it measures. Musk's new compensation package, approved by shareholders late last year, has several tough targets the company must hit before he gets $1 trillion.\n\nAccording to Tesla's proxy filing, there are four product goals. Number 2 on the list is this: \"10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions.\"\n\nOne way Tesla can reach this milestone more quickly is to remove the option to buy FSD outright. By mid-February, anyone considering this option will need to subscribe instead.\n\nWhy would Tesla's board make this a goal for Musk? Subscriptions are a steadier business. Investors prefer continuous income generated by subscription businesses, versus lumpier operations that rely on large, one-time purchases. A pure FSD subscription also gives Tesla more flexibility to change pricing in the future.\n\nI think this is the main lesson, though: Never underestimate the power of financial incentives.\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the FSD change.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Musk attempts to recast AI tool’s misuse. Plus, tech billionaires plot against a proposed California tax on their fortunes\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, US tech editor for the Guardian. Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.\n\nThe firestorm over the Grok AI tool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

FSD will only be available as a monthly subscription thereafter,\" the Tesla CEO wrote in a post on X.\n\nTesla owners currently have the option to buy FSD for $8,000 or pay $99 a month to access the service.\n\nIt comes as the company struggles to get customers to pay for the technology, which Musk has regularly described as critical to Tesla's future.\n\nIn Tesla's third-quarter earnings call in October, the company's CFO told investors that only around 12% of Tesla's current fleet subscribed to FSD, with quarterly revenue decreasing compared to the same period the previous year.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key part of Musk's mammoth pay package, which was approved by Tesla investors in November. Reaching 10 million FSD subscriptions is among the milestones that Tesla needs to hit for Musk to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.\n\nThe company's rollout of Full Self-Driving, which allows a Tesla vehicle to drive itself in most situations but requires human supervision at all times, has attracted regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced investigations last year into whether Tesla correctly reported crashes linked to FSD, and over reports of Tesla vehicles with FSD activated running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nTesla also faces a potential ban on selling vehicles in California after a judge ruled that the company's marketing of its Full Self Driving and Autopilot systems misled consumers.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "A growing number of domestic and international airlines are offering Starlink WiFi to passengers, like United Airlines, British Airways, and Emirates.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk's Starlink has gained yet another airline customer as the ultra-high-speed WiFi service continues to gain popularity.\n\nThe Lufthansa Group announced in January that it's installing Starlink and expects to start offering it in the second half of this year.\n\nThe company is named for the German flag carrier, but it also owns several more airlines across Europe, including national carriers for Austria, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland.\n\nLufthansa has a fleet of around 850 aircraft across all its airlines, and its announcement means more than 30 airlines are now set to have Starlink.\n\nBusiness Insider previously tested Starlink on Qatar Airways' first flight with it last October. The connection speed peaked at 215 megabits per second, more than enough for a lag-free video call, and faster than many cable-based internet services.\n\nStarlink functions thanks to a constellation of over 7,000 satellites, which allows internet connections in remote locations, such as flying over an ocean. The satellites are in low-earth orbit, which means faster internet speeds — but also disrupts astronomers.\n\nStarlink isn't the only game in town, however.\n\nJetBlue has signed up for Amazon Leo, which functions similarly, but has only launched 150 satellites so far.\n\nAnother in-flight WiFi rival is Viasat, which is used by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. It only has a handful of satellites in a geostationary orbit, which have a longer time delay.\n\nWhile it has rivals, Starlink wants to cement its dominance. As Starlink grows in popularity, it could be that more carriers All airlines with Starlink offer it free of charge, although some require passengers to \n\nAs of Lufthansa's announcement, here are all the airlines that have publicly announced plans to launch Starlink:\n\nThe Irish flag carrier is part of International Airlines Group, which announced its Starlink deal in early November. It's set to roll out Starlink from early 2026, but plans are still being finalized across the conglomerate.\n\nLatvia's airBaltic flies around Europe and the Middle East only using Airbus A220 jets. It was the first European airline to adopt Starlink, and hopes to complete installation on all its planes by the end of the year.\n\nAir Busan is a budget carrier and a subsidiary of Korean Air, which announced in December that it's adding Starlink.\n\nWhile the legacy carrier has clearer plans for its wide-body jets, Korean said Air Busan will review which planes to prioritize.\n\n\"Rollout schedules will vary by carrier, with the earliest service introduction expected as early as the third quarter of 2026,\" it added.\n\nAir Dolomiti is a regional airline that only operates Embraer jets and focuses on connecting Italian destinations with other cities around Europe.\n\nIt's a subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nIntroduction is set to begin in the second half of 2026, with all Lufthansa Group planes equipped with Starlink by 2029. The company said access would be free for all status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nThe French flag carrier announced its Starlink deal last September, available to Flying Blue loyalty members. Installation began across its fleet, including regional planes, this summer.\n\nAir New Zealand first said it was working with Starlink two years ago. It then rolled it out on two domestic aircraft in June, saying that it was \"currently in the test phase.\"\n\nAir Seoul is a budget carrier and another subsidiary of Korean Air. Like with Air Busan, it is not yet clear which jets will get Starlink.\n\nAfter merging with Hawaiian Airlines — the first major carrier to offer Starlink — Alaska Airlines announced its deal in August. It says it will first be available next year and will be rolled out across the fleet by 2027.\n\nAsiana Airlines is another subsidiary of Korean Air.\n\nThe two airlines merged in 2024, while the Asiana brand is set to be phased out by the end of next year.\n\n\"Following the integration with Asiana Airlines, the airline plans to complete fleetwide installation by the end of 2027,\" Korean said in its Starlink announcement.\n\nIt also said it will prioritize installation on its Boeing 777 and Airbus A350 jets.\n\nThe flag carrier of Austria is a subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nWhile Lufthansa said the rollout will start in the second half of 2026, it isn't clear exactly when Austrian jets will get Starlink.\n\nThe UK flag carrier is also part of IAG. BA said it would start rolling out Starlink next year and that it would be available free of charge to all its passengers.\n\nBelgium's national airline is another subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nLufthansa's rollout of Starlink will begin in late 2026.\n\nEdelweiss Air is a sister company to Swiss International Air Lines. Both are subsidiaries of Lufthansa.\n\nLike with other Lufthansa-owned airlines, Starlink will be free for all status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nDubai's airline is starting to roll out Starlink this month and plans to add it to all 232 in-service aircraft by mid-2027. It's also set to operate the first double-decker Airbus A380 with the service.\n\nEurowings is a German budget airline and another subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nStarlink will be free for all Lufthansa Group status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nThe Emirati budget airline also announced its Starlink deal during this month's Dubai Airshow.

Introduction is set to begin in the second half of 2026, with all planes equipped with Starlink by 2029.\n\nIt said access would be free for all status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nThe Lufthansa Group added that further details will be announced throughout the year.\n\nQatar Airways outpaced its regional rival, Emirates, by announcing Starlink back in May 2024. As of November, it operates the most wide-body aircraft with the service, numbering over 100. Starlink is installed on all Qatar's Boeing 777s and is being rolled out to its Airbus A350s.\n\nScandinavian Airlines, or SAS, is the flag carrier for Sweden, Denmark, and Norway.

    "description": "The legal battle over OpenAI's shift to a for-profit model has been scheduled for April and could last for four weeks.",
    "fullText": "The showdown between Elon Musk and Sam Altman is headed to court — and it's set to be a long one.\n\nOakland federal judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Tuesday set a new trial date for Musk's legal dispute with OpenAI — one week after saying the Tesla CEO had enough evidence for the case to be decided by a jury.\n\nJury selection is now scheduled to start on Monday, April 27. The trial will start the next day and could last four weeks, through May 22, the court docket showed. The trial had previously been scheduled for March 30.\n\nIt's the latest development in a clash of the tech titans that kicked off last year when Musk sued Altman over the ChatGPT maker's partnership with Microsoft and shift toward a for-profit model. Musk, a founder and early supporter of OpenAI, claims he contributed $38 million to OpenAI over the years under the premise that it would maintain its original altruistic, nonprofit roots.\n\nOpenAI has countered that Musk knew about its pivot toward a for-profit as early as 2018 and says its nonprofit arm still plays a central role in its governance. The company has blasted the lawsuit as baseless and has characterized it as part of a larger harassment campaign by Musk.\n\nLast week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers rejected arguments by Altman's lawyers to block the case from proceeding to trial, saying Musk had sufficient evidence to justify a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" the judge said at a hearing on January 7. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nHundreds of exhibits were unsealed in the case last week, including a 2023 text that revealed tension in the two tech titans' relationship before Musk filed his suit.\n\n\"I don't think openai would have happened without you — and it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai,\" Altman texted Musk in 2023.\n\nMusk responded: \"I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake.\"",

    "title": "Tesla's Cybertruck is falling far short of Elon Musk's ambitious sales targets",
    "description": "Sales of the Cybertruck were far below the 250,000 annual target Musk set before the electric pickup rolled off the production line in 2023.",
    "fullText": "The Cybertruck is running out of road.\n\nTesla sold 20,237 Cybertrucks in the US last year, according to data from Cox Automotive released on Tuesday, as demand for Elon Musk's \"apocalypse-proof\" pickup fizzled.\n\nThat's nearly half the number Tesla sold in 2024, and sales dropped 68% year-on-year in the final quarter of 2025.\n\nThe figures are a far cry from the target of 250,000 sales a year Musk set before the Cybertruck rolled off the production line in 2023.\n\nThe divisive electric truck amassed over 1 million reservations, but early models launched with a price tag of over $79,000, significantly higher than the nearly $40,000 sticker price Musk had floated in 2019.\n\nSince then, demand has been underwhelming — and collapsing sales have not been the only speed bump.\n\nThe Cybertruck has faced a series of quality issues, with 10 recalls since 2023.\n\nWhile some of those issues have been fixed with a simple software update, others have proved more problematic. Tesla has issued recalls for accelerator pedals that could get trapped at full throttle, an optional off-road light bar that may detach and fly off the truck, and the Cybertruck's comically large windshield wiper failing.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cybertruck's highly distinctive design, which caused Tesla significant production issues, has had the unintended effect of turning the angular EV into a target.\n\nMultiple Cybertruck owners told Business Insider last March that they had been hit by vandalism and verbal harassment amid the backlash over Tesla CEO Musk's federal cost-cutting at the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTesla has employed some creative strategies for turning around the Cybertruck's sales slump.\n\nBusiness Insider's Grace Kay reported in April that the EV giant was quietly rebranding the futuristic pickup as a working man's truck. And SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, has taken delivery of an unspecified number of Cybertrucks.\n\nUnlike Tesla's other vehicles, however, the Cybertruck is only available in a limited number of countries.\n\nTesla sells the pickup in Mexico and Canada, and recently started sales in Korea, but the Cybertruck's hulking stainless-steel body and sharp edges make it almost impossible to sell in Europe and China, two of the EV giant's largest markets.\n\nTesla also launched the Cybertruck in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar last year — three oil-rich nations where chargers are scarce, and EV sales are low.\n\nThe Cybertruck's woes mean it is unlikely to help Tesla turn around its global sales slump. Sales of all Tesla vehicles declined for the second consecutive year in 2025, with Chinese rival BYD surpassing it to become the world's biggest EV maker.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nMusk is not the only one to see ambitious plans for big electric pickups fall flat.\n\nFord sold just over 27,000 of its flagship F-150 Lightning electric truck in 2025 and last month announced that it would replace the EV with an extended-range hybrid offering 700 miles of range.\n\nOther automakers have also backed away from electric pickups as an \"EV winter\" has taken hold in the US following the end of the $7,500 tax credit.\n\nStellantis canceled plans to build an all-electric RAM truck in September, while Ford and GM have signalled they plan to build more gas-powered pickups as they rack up billions of dollars in charges over their EV strategy shifts.\n\nWhat the future holds for the Cybertruck is unclear. Tesla quietly removed the option to buy a cheaper, rear-wheel drive trim from its website after just five months in September, and there has been no word on mooted plans to build a smaller version of the truck, which still starts at around $80,000 in the US.\n\nPublicly, Musk doesn't seem bothered by the Cybertruck's low sales, regularly praising the stainless-steel truck on his X feed.\n\n\"Cybertruck is an incredible vehicle. Our best ever from Tesla,\" he wrote last month.",

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "description": "Musk said a \"supersonic tsunami\" of AI and robotics will bring about a world of zero scarcity.",
    "fullText": "Saving for retirement is pointless thanks to the impending “supersonic tsunami” of AI and robotics, which will bring about a world of zero scarcity, according to Elon Musk.\n\nWhile the Tesla and SpaceX CEO admitted he’s “more optimistic” than most, he insisted people shouldn’t stress over building a nest egg for the distant future, contrary to the staid advice of nearly all other financial professionals.\n\n“Don’t worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,” said the world’s richest man on the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast last week. “It won’t matter.”\n\nPart of Musk’s controversial take lies in his vision of a world transformed by rapidly improving AI, robotics, and energy technology.\n\n“Anything short of shaping atoms, AI can do probably half or more of those jobs right now,” he said.\n\nThe advances could lead to such big productivity increases, he said, that they will surpass “what people possibly could think of as abundance.”\n\nRather than a universal income, everyone will enjoy a “universal ‘you can have whatever you want’ income” in the future, he claimed. In this world, the link between individual wages, savings, and living standards no longer makes sense.\n\nEven without savings, AI will help people obtain better medical care than currently available within five years, as well as remove any limit on the availability of goods, services, or educational opportunities.\n\n​Musk’s comments build on his earlier claims that AI and humanoid robots will make work “optional” within 10 to 20 years and render money itself irrelevant. Musk previously compared the future of work to leisure activities like playing sports or video games rather than a survival necessity.\n\n“If you want to work, [it’s] the same way you can go to the store and just buy some vegetables, or you can grow vegetables in your backyard. It’s much harder to grow vegetables in your backyard, and some people still do it because they like growing vegetables,” Musk said during the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in November.\n\n​To be sure, Musk’s predictions about the future come at a time where many Americans are struggling to save. In part due to persistent inflation and weak wage growth, only 55% of American adults said they had a “rainy day” fund of three months expenses saved up for an emergency, down from a high of 59% in 2021, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve. Fewer than half of those surveyed said they could cover an expense of $2,000 or more with their savings.",

    "description": "Elon Musk is staring down several self-imposed deadlines this year, from Cybercab volume production to a much-hyped Roadster demo.",
    "fullText": "It's a critical year for Tesla. Elon Musk says so.\n\nIn earnings calls, podcast interviews, and a steady stream of posts on X, the outspoken CEO has spent the past year teasing a wave of new hardware and software that he says will define Tesla's future.\n\n\"2026 will be something special,\" Musk posted on X on January 1.\n\nTesla's promises for the year fall into four major bets: self-driving software for consumer cars, a fully autonomous robotaxi service, humanoid robots, and showing off at least one long-delayed new vehicle.\n\nAnalysts say the company's future increasingly hinges on just one thing — whether its AI-powered autonomy can work at scale.\n\n\"I think 2026 is going to be the prove-it year for Tesla's robotaxi business,\" Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar who closely watches Tesla, told Business Insider. \"That's ultimately going to be the major driver for Tesla this year.\"\n\nLast June, Tesla Model Ys and Model 3s started carting passengers around Austin, Texas with no humans behind the steering wheel. Instead, the company launched with so-called \"safety drivers\" in the front passenger seat to intervene if needed.\n\nGoldstein said he's watching closely to see where regulators allow Tesla's self-driving vehicles to operate — and whether the company becomes confident enough in its technology to remove safety drivers from the front seats entirely.\n\nRight now, the robotaxis are driving in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta.\n\nDuring the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said Tesla's purpose-built autonomous vehicle, known as the Cybercab, would begin volume production in April. The two-passenger vehicle is designed without a steering wheel or brake pedal.\n\n\"That's really a vehicle that's optimized for full autonomy,\" he said on the call. \"I think the demand will be pretty nutty.\"\n\nTesla has also claimed a significant lead over competitors in consumer self-driving data. During the same earnings call, Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of Autopilot and AI software, said customers had driven more than six billion miles using Full Self-Driving in supervised mode.\n\n\"That's a big milestone,\" Elluswamy said. \"Overall, the safety continues to be very good.\"\n\nThose claims come as both legacy automakers and tech companies push deeper into autonomous driving. This week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nvidia unveiled its new self-driving car platform. Rivian said its $45,000 R2 SUV, launching in early 2026, will include self-driving capabilities. Ford plans to roll out advanced autonomous tech on its 2027 electric pickup, while General Motors is offering point-to-point hands-free driving in its high-end Cadillac Escalade IQ.\n\nMusk has dismissed the competition. In a post on X, he said Tesla was five years ahead of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — in self-driving technology.\n\nTesla is also preparing to reintroduce the second-generation Roadster, a two-door electric sports car first unveiled more than 8 years ago that has been repeatedly delayed. The vehicle is now slated for another unveiling on April Fool's Day.\n\nIn November, Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan that if Peter Thiel wanted a future with flying cars, he should get it. Musk has said the new Roadster is a collaboration with SpaceX and will include rocket technology.\n\n\"It's going to be the most memorable product unveil ever,\" he said, before telling the notorious podcaster that he set the unveil date for April Fools for \"deniability.\"\n\nThe Semi, an electric eighteen-wheeler, is also expected to roll out of Tesla's Nevada factory in the first half of 2026.\n\nEarly production models traversed California's highways with Pepsi and Walmart products in pilot tests.\n\nThen there's Optimus — a major bet for Tesla and one that Musk has said will be \"the biggest product ever.\"\n\nMusk has said the humanoid robots will eventually handle general-purpose tasks like folding laundry, tightening screws, or stirring a pot of pasta.\n\nBut manufacturing Optimus has proved challenging. Musk has said designing its hands, for example, is \"an incredibly difficult engineering challenge.\"\n\nIn a 2024 post on X, he claimed Tesla was aiming for \"high production for other companies\" by 2026, suggesting the robots could one day be manufactured at scale for outside customers.\n\nMusk's recent track record for deadlines has given some investors reason to be cautious of the CEO's projections for the coming year.\n\nMusk is a self-proclaimed optimist when it comes to deadlines and goals, but he does have a history of delivering much of what he promises — eventually.\n\n\"Elon is a visionary,\" Goldstein told Business Insider. \"He's figured out a lot of very difficult problems in the past when other people couldn't — making profitable EVs and reusable rockets — he deserves a lot of credit.\"\n\nBut Goldstein said Tesla's path to automotive dominance is narrowing. As the company has focused heavily on autonomy, other automakers have improved vehicle hardware quickly enough to challenge Tesla's advantage.\n\nThat's particularly true in China, he said.\n\n\"BYD has surpassed Tesla and then gone after a lower price point in key markets in China and Europe,\" he said.\n\nTesla has reported two consecutive years of sales declines, Goldstein added, and \"it's looking like 2026 could be a third.\" Meanwhile, many US automakers are pulling back from EVs and car-buyers can no longer enjoy the $7,500 EV incentive.\n\n\"2026 is going to be a bit of a challenge for Tesla as the EV scene has since dramatically changed, especially with last year's disappearance of any helpful federal tax credits,\" Robby DeGraff, a product and consumer insights manager at AutoPacific, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Subtle, slight refreshes of the Model Y and Model 3 plus reveals of the Cybercab and other innovations like the humanoid robots were newsworthy sure, but the reality is Tesla's lineup is stale and lagging behind much of the competition in terms of design, performance, and features,\" he added.\n\nDespite those risks, many investors remain sold on Musk's vision.\n\nIn mid-December, Tesla shares hit a record high of more than $481. The stock is up about 12% over the last year, including a roughly 50% surge in the past six months.\n\n\"I think the most important thing for Tesla to do right now, especially as we see the EV market slow a bit, is ready and ensure there's a proper entry-level, affordable EV out there for consumers,\" DeGraff added.\n\nDeGraff said the new \"Standard\" versions of the Model 3 and Model Y are \"a good step\" but \"there's more work to be done to bring that pricing down, which still remains a major deterrent for uncertain EV shoppers.\"",

    "description": "Health care experts are worried about Grok’s potential to breach patient privacy.",
    "fullText": "In Elon Musk’s world, AI is the new MD. The X owner is encouraging users to upload their medical test results—such as CT and bone scans—to the platform so that Grok, X’s artificial intelligence chatbot, can learn how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nHe’s previously said this information will be used to train X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok on how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nEarlier this month, Elon Musk reposted a video on X of himself talking about uploading medical data to Grok, saying: “Try it!”\n\n“You can upload your X-rays or MRI images to Grok and it will give you a medical diagnosis,” Musk said in the video, which was uploaded in June. “I have seen cases where it’s actually better than what doctors tell you.\n\nIn 2024, Musk said medical images uploaded to Grok would be used to train the bot.\n\n“This is still early stage, but it is already quite accurate and will become extremely good,” Musk wrote on X. “Let us know where Grok gets it right or needs work.”\n\nMusk also claimed in his response Grok saved a man in Norway by diagnosing a problem his doctors failed to notice. The X owner was willing to upload his own medical information to his bot.\n\n“I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,” Musk said in an episode of the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast released on Tuesday. “None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.”\n\nMusk did not disclose in the podcast why he received an MRI. XAI, which owns X, told Fortune in a statement: “Legacy Media Lies.”\n\nGrok is facing some competition in the AI health space. This week OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, an experience within the bot feature that allows users to securely connect medical records and wellness apps like MyFitnessPal and Apple Health. The company said it would not train the models using personal medical information.\n\nAI chatbots have become a ubiquitous source of medical information for people. OpenAI reported this week 40 million people seek health information from the model, 55% of which used to bot to look up or better understand symptoms.\n\nSo far, Grok’s ability to detect medical abnormalities have been mixed. The AI successfully analyzed blood test results and identified breast cancer, some users claimed. But it also grossly misinterpreted other pieces of information, according to physicians who responded to some of Musk’s about Grok’s ability to interpret medical information. In one instance, Grok mistook a “textbook case” of tuberculosis for a herniated disk or spinal stenosis. In another, the bot mistook a mammogram of a benign breast cyst for an image of testicles.\n\nA May 2025 study found that while all AI models have limitations in processing and predicting medical outcomes, Grok was the most effectively compared to Google’s Gemini and ChatGPT-4o when determining the presence of pathologies in 35,711 slices of brain MRI.\n\n“We know they have the technical capability,” Dr. Laura Heacock, associate professor at the New York University Langone Health Department of Radiology, wrote on X. “Whether or not they want to put in the time, data and [graphics processing units] to include medical imaging is up to them. For now, non-generative AI methods continue to outperform in medical imaging.”\n\nMusk’s lofty goal of training his AI to make medical diagnoses is also a risky one, experts said. While AI has increasingly been used as a means to make complicated science more accessible and create assistive technologies, teaching Grok to use data from a social media platform presents concerns about both Grok’s accuracy and user privacy.\n\nRyan Tarzy, CEO of health technology firm Avandra Imaging, said in an interview with Fast Company asking users to directly input data, rather than source it from secure databases with de-identified patient data, is Musk’s way of trying to accelerate Grok’s development. Also, the information comes from a limited sample of whoever is willing to upload their images and tests—meaning the AI is not gathering data from sources representative of the broader and more diverse medical landscape.\n\nMedical information shared on social media isn’t bound by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the federal law that protects patients’ private information from being shared without their consent. That means there’s less control over where the information goes after a user chooses to share it.\n\n“This approach has myriad risks, including the accidental sharing of patient identities,” Tarzy said. “Personal health information is ‘burned in’ too many images, such as CT scans, and would inevitably be released in this plan.”\n\nThe privacy dangers Grok may present aren’t fully known because X may have privacy protections not known by the public, according to Matthew McCoy, assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He said users share medical information at their own risk.\n\n“As an individual user, would I feel comfortable contributing health data?” he previously told the New York Times. “Absolutely not.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on Nov. 20, 2024.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Health in a push to become a hub for personal health data\n\nOpenAI suggests ChatGPT play doctor as millions of Americans face spiking insurance costs: ‘In the U.S., ChatGPT has become an important ally’\n\nAs Utah gives the AI power to prescribe some drugs, physicians warn of patient risks\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Going forward, X will not allow obscene imagery,\" government sources told news agency ANI.Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action ReportThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had raised concerns over obscene and harmful content allegedly generated by Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok. The ministry sent a letter to X (formerly Twitter), the social media website owned by Elon Musk, pointing out failures in moderating AI-generated content on its platform. The ministry highlighted concerns that the Grok and other services of xAI have been used to generate and distribute obscene or non-consensual images, particularly targeting the dignity and privacy of women. Through the letter, the government has also sought a report on the actions taken by the company, and the immediate removal of illegal materials.ALSO READ | AI tool to 'undress women': Grok under fire for generating non-consensual sexualised images; Musk pokes funNow, X has submitted a reply to the ministry, however, the officials described it as ‘not adequate’, saying the response by the social media platform lacked specific actions taken and preventive steps implemented.Earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi had written to IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, urging the government to urgently step in over what she described as a disturbing rise in the misuse of AI tools to sexualise women on social media, particularly on X.In her letter, Priyanka Chaturvedi called for strict “guardrails” on AI chatbots such as Grok, saying social media platforms must be made “a safe space for women”. She also underlined the need for better education of men from an early age to prevent such behaviour.“Have sought urgent attention and intervention of the IT Minister to take the issue of increasing incidents of AI apps being prompted to sexualise and undress women by unauthorised use of their images on social media,” Chaturvedi said in a post on X.In the letter shared publicly, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader flagged what she called an emerging trend on X, where men operating fake accounts allegedly upload photos of women and use AI prompts to minimise their clothing or sexualise them.“It is not just limited to sharing photos through fake accounts but are also targeting women who post their own photos,” she wrote.Calling the practice an “unacceptable and gross misuse of an AI function,” Chaturvedi also criticised Grok for “enabling this behaviour by adhering to such requests”.She described such acts as a “breach of women's right to privacy” and termed them “criminal”, adding that similar instances were “going absolutely unchecked” across other platforms as well.ALSO READ | Elon Musk's Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users after Deepfakes go viral across the world",

    "fullText": "Elizabeth Lopatto, writing at The Verge, “Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai Are Cowards”:\n\nSince X’s users started using Grok to undress women and\nchildren using deepfake images, I have been waiting for\nwhat I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s\nand Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet\ntells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim\nCook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of\nElon Musk.\n\nLopatto’s outrage and righteous anger are justified, but I think mostly misdirected. Apple and Google — and thus, Cook and Pichai, as the men who sit behind the desks where the buck stops at both companies — are culpable. But this is ultimately not about them, and not about Musk. It’s Trump, as president, they fear. Not Musk. And they are correct to fear Trump.\n\nYear one of Trump 2.0 has crystallized what had become — after decades of deliberate restraint after World War II, and even more so after the end of the Cold War — overlooked. The Presidency of the United States bestows upon its officeholder enormous, unparalleled, power. No one was afraid of Trump after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. The man was convicted of 34 felonies in a cold New York City courtroom in May 2024, a mere 19 months ago. Trump expected and asked for riots outside the courtroom. He got nothing but pathetic support from a handful of kooks. A year earlier, he lost a humiliating sexual assault civil lawsuit to E. Jean Carroll. Trump, just a year and a half ago, was a buffoon getting his mug shot taken. Today he’s arguing that his power is unchecked by anything other than his own sense of morality.\n\nNo other president has ever abused (or, if you support him, wielded) the powers of the office like Trump has. The power and influence of Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, CEOs of two of the top five companies in the world, isn’t merely superseded by Trump’s power and influence as president. Their power and influence are dwarfed by Trump’s. Any credible argument about how they should act must acknowledge that profound imbalance.\n\nI never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever\nagain. The next time Tim Cook says “privacy is a human\nright,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face.\nI mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has\ncreated an undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good,\nthe mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How do you plan\nto defend getting rid of the ICEBlock app while allowing X\nto generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and\nGoogle even identify their values beyond their commitment to\n“shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?\n\nThe profound power imbalance here is frustrating. But also terrifying. It’s folly to think these CEOs should steer their companies into direct confrontation with Trump. It would do no ultimate good for Apple or Google to burn themselves to the ground in protest. These men aren’t beholden to shareholders, per se. They’re doing their duty to institutions they’ve devoted their lives to. Companies that are worth preserving and protecting. Perhaps not in your estimation, but certainly from theirs.\n\nBut abject obsequiousness — which more and more seems the path Cook and Pichai are choosing — is no more justifiable a response than corporate suicide. The situation is not binary: acquiescence or war. There is a broad middle ground, founded on principle.\n\nDisney’s response to the Jimmy Kimmel controversy a few months ago shows the way. Defend the company’s principles while simultaneously defending the company from Trump’s demented wrath. You can take the position of “Fuck you, make me” without ever saying those words. Objection is not confrontation. Do the right thing and enforce the App Store and Play Store guidelines, and remove X and Grok from the stores. Make Musk object. Make the Trump administration object. Make them defend the indefensible — in public. Make clear why the apps were removed from the app stores and force Musk — and Trump, if he chooses — to argue that those things are A-OK by them. In court.\n\nThe judicious path for Apple and Google (and every other U.S. company) may well be to obey the law, even when the law is being actively corrupted. But the correct path is not to obey in advance. Stand behind the law while the law still exists on your side. Disney resisted Trump’s preposterous demand that they fire Jimmy Kimmel without lasting controversy, simply by standing firm in their conviction. Apple and Google could certainly do the same regarding apps that are being used to generate CSAM and deepfake harassment, regardless if the apps are part of the private fiefdom of Trump’s ally Elon Musk. It’s wise for Cook and Pichai to pick their battles. This one, I think, is worth picking. This is a moment when the App Store and Play Store can stand firmly on the side of longstanding and correct societal norms.",

    "fullText": "Ministers warn platform could be blocked after Grok AI used to create sexual images without consent\n\nElon Musk has accused the UK government of wanting to suppress free speech after ministers threatened fines and a possible ban for his social media site X after its AI tool, Grok, was used to make sexual images of women and children without their consent.\n\nThe billionaire claimed Grok was the most downloaded app on the UK App Store on Friday night after ministers threatened to take action unless the function to create sexually harassing images was removed.\n\nResponding to threats of a ban from the government, Musk wrote: “They just want to suppress free speech”.\n\nThousands of women have faced abuse from users of the AI tool which was first used to digitally strip fully clothed photographs into images showing them wearing micro bikinis, and then used for extreme image manipulation.\n\nPictures of teenage girls and children were altered to show them wearing swimwear, leading experts to say some of the content could be categorised as child sexual abuse material.\n\nSome users began to demand to see bruising on the bodies of the women, and for blood to be added to the images. Women were shown tied up, gagged and shot.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, said on Friday that ministers were looking seriously at the possibility of access to X being barred in the UK.\n\nShe said she expected Ofcom, which said this week that it was seeking urgent answers from the platform, to announce action within “days not weeks”.\n\n“X needs to get a grip and get this material down,” she said. “And I would remind them that in the Online Safety Act, there are backstop powers to block access to services if they refuse to comply with the law for people in the UK. And if Ofcom decides to use those powers, they would have the full backing of the government.”\n\nThe UK government’s concerns were echoed by the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Speaking in Canberra on Saturday, Albanese said that “global citizens deserve better”. Australia recently banned the use of social media for under-16s.\n\n“The use of generative artificial intelligence to exploit or sexualise people without their consent is abhorrent,” he said.\n\n“The fact that this tool was used so that people were using its image creation function through Grok is just completely abhorrent. It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility.”\n\nSome rightwing political figures have tried to frame this as a free speech issue. Responding to the news X faced a potential ban, the former prime minister Liz Truss said: “Starmer is really losing it now.”\n\nX partially restricted access to Grok on Friday. Its public account lost the ability to generate images at the request of free users, leaving the function available only to paid subscribers. It also appeared to have stopped creating bikini images.\n\nThe Grok app, however, which does not generate images publicly, is still able to create sexually explicit material from women’s pictures.\n\nOther nudificiation apps are still available. The Labour MP Jess Asato, who campaigns against the sexual abuse and harassment of women, said legislation to ban such apps was urgently needed.\n\nShe posted on social media: “It’s not just XAi. This nudification tool was advertised yesterday on @YouTube.\n\n“No rules had been broken @Google said on reporting.\n\n“Our nudification legislation needs to be expedited.”\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said.

    "title": "Diary entries, text messages, and late-night emails: 9 revelations from newly unsealed court documents in Musk vs. Altman",
    "description": "Text messages, emails, and journal entries were part of a trove of documents unsealed in the legal battle between Elon Musk and Sam Altman.",
    "fullText": "More than 100 documents detailing texts, emails, and even diary entries from some of the world's most powerful tech executives were unsealed on Tuesday as part of Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman.\n\nThe documents provide a rare window into the inner workings of Silicon Valley — from late-night texts to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to debates between Altman and Musk about OpenAI's future. The documents also include previously unreleased writing from Nadella, as well as several entries from the personal diary of OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman.\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in 2024, Musk alleges that OpenAI executives misled him when they decided to move the company away from its original nonprofit mission and pursue a profit-oriented structure. Musk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit organization.\n\nOpenAI has denied the allegations and said the billionaire was aware of the company's plans to shift to a for-profit structure.\n\n\"Mr. Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best-resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a California federal judge said there was sufficient evidence for a jury to consider Musk's claim. The two tech execs are now set to face off in court in March, though they could still settle before that.\n\nBusiness Insider reviewed hundreds of pages of newly unsealed documents. Take a look at some of the most interesting details we've found:\n\nThe court documents included snippets from OpenAI cofounder Brockman's diary.\n\nBrockman mused about being \"free\" and owning his \"destiny\" and \"Financially what will take me to $1B?\"\n\nBrockman said during a deposition last year that his \"primary motivation was to the mission,\" and the \"financial reward\" was a secondary consideration.\n\nIn the diary, Brockman broke down the pros and cons of parting ways with Musk. \"Some chance that rejecting Elon will actually lose us Sam. We'll find out tomorrow if doing an override all the way through is palettable,\" the diary read. \"This is the only chance we have to get out from Elon. Is he the 'glorious leader' that I would pick?\"\n\nIn a separate entry, Brockman debated how OpenAI would move forward and turn a profit. \"It all comes down to the money. We can get it from Tesla, probably. We could also probably get it from Google,\" he wrote.\n\nDuring a September deposition, Jared Birchall, who runs Musk's family office and has roles across several of his businesses, was asked about his job at Neuralink.\n\nBirchall said he was only operating as \"the named CFO\" because the brain chip company had recently hired a new head of finance, to whom they had yet to transfer the title.\n\nAccording to a review of LinkedIn profiles, William Sawyer became Neuralink's head of finance in August.\n\nSawyer declined to comment when reached by Business Insider.\n\nMicrosoft's CEO said in a 2025 deposition that his financial advisor had invested some of his money in Neuralink.\n\nNadella said he hadn't talked to Musk about it.\n\nAt another point in the deposition, Nadella described his feelings toward Musk.\n\n\"I mean, Elon is a pretty idiosyncratic guy in the sense he has a lot of opinions on lots of things, but what I have found to be most inspiring is how he goes about building what he does,\" Nadella said.\n\nAccording to a document dated July 10, 2023, Nadella was working on a book called \"An Inflection Point: Mission, transformation, and the dawn of next generation AI.\"\n\nThe document included sample chapters and was co-written by Harvard business professor Marco Iansiti.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft said the company has been working with Iansiti and Keystone Research over the years, and didn't end up publishing the book.\n\nMusk emailed Jensen Huang in 2016, asking for one of the company's first supercomputers.\n\n\"Can OpenAI buy one of the early units? The team was asking me about this earlier today,\" Musk wrote.\n\n\"I've not forgotten,\" Huang responded. \"I will make sure OpenAI gets one of the first ones.\"\n\n\"OpenAI is on a path of certain failure relative to Google,\" Musk wrote in a January 2018 email to Altman.\n\n\"There obviously needs to be immediate and dramatic action or everyone except for Google will be consigned to irrelevance,\" he said.\n\nMusk left OpenAI's board in February 2018. At the time, he cited a potential conflict of interest with Tesla and its AI work.\n\n\"To be clear, I have a lot of respect for your abilities and accomplishments, but I am not happy with how things have been managed,\" Musk wrote in the 2018 email. \"Either we fix things and my engagement increases a lot or we don't and I will drop to near zero and publicly reduce my association. I will not be in a situation where the perception of my influence and time doesn't match the reality.\"\n\n\"What happened to Amazon?\" Musk wrote in an August 2016 email to Altman about OpenAI's efforts to negotiate funding from an outside tech company.\n\n\"I think Jeff is a bit of a tool and Satya is not, so I slightly prefer Microsoft, but I hate their marketing dept,\" Musk wrote.\n\nIn response, Altman said Amazon \"started really dicking us around.\"\n\nOpenAI announced a deal with Microsoft in July 2019.\n\nMicrosoft offered Altman a role after the OpenAI CEO was ousted by the company's board in November 2023. Altman's departure spawned an open letter that was signed by hundreds of OpenAI employees who threatened to leave if Altman was not brought back as CEO.\n\n\"Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join,\" a portion of the letter read.\n\nMira Murati, OpenAI's then-CTO, signed the open letter. She addressed Microsoft's support in a text to Nadella.\n\n\"Hi Satya, I know it's super late. Need to call you urgently,\" said the text, which asked Nadella to confirm whether Microsoft planned to offer roles to OpenAI staff.\n\n\"Thx. So sorry. But that is right,\" Nadella responded the following morning.\n\n\"Satya could you please make a public statement soon that shows support for the joint openai team, basically bringing the team together?\" Murati responded. It's very important that we don't lose researchers to Demis or Elon. The technical team is being dragged in so many recruiting directions and a unified front would help immensely.\"\n\n\"i remember seeing you in a tv interview a long time ago (maybe 60 minutes?) where you being attacked by some guys, and you said they were heroes of yours and it was really tough,\" Altman texted Musk in February 2023. \"well, you're my hero and that's what it feels like when you attack OpenAI.\"\n\nAltman also wrote that \"it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai.\"\n\n\"I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake,\" Musk responded.\n\nDo you work for OpenAI or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Elon Musk said Grok gave him a clean bill of health.\n\nMusk told podcaster Peter Diamandis that he recently underwent an MRI. Afterward, the xAI CEO said he followed his own advice by uploading the results of a medical test to his company's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,\" Musk said during a wide-ranging interview with Diamandis on \"Moonshots\" posted on Tuesday. \"None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.\"\n\nIt's unclear why Musk underwent an MRI. His discussion with Diamandis, the founder of the XPrize and a Harvard-educated doctor, underscores the ongoing discussion about longevity that surrounds much of the discussion of AI's future development.\n\nAcross Silicon Valley, tech billionaires like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Peter Thiel are funding millions in research to combat aging and extend humanity's lifespan. In 2024, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei wrote that AI could double life expectancy by 2030.\n\nLast week, Musk encouraged people to try uploading their results to Grok. He said that a Norwegian man posted on Reddit that Grok saved his life after the chatbot encouraged him to return to the hospital to get a CT scan, which confirmed that doctors had missed that his appendix was close to rupturing.\n\n\"Try it!\" Musk wrote on X, quote-tweeting remarks from a February 2025 appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nAt the time, Musk told Rogan that AI would be \"very good\" at helping with medical diagnoses.\n\nMusk said true immortality or close to it would be \"one of the worst curses you could possibly give anyone.\" That being said, the billionaire thinks it should be possible to crack the secret to staving off aging.\n\n\"I've long thought that longevity or semi-mortality is an extremely solvable problem,\" Musk said. \"I don't think it's a particularly hard problem. I mean, when you consider the fact that your body is extremely synchronized in its age, the clock must be incredibly obvious.\"\n\nDiamandis pitched Musk on working with Fountain Life, a longevity company that Diamandis cofounded with Tony Robbins and William Kapp. Depending on the membership tier, Fountain Life offers access to \"AI-guided diagnostics\" that test for biomarkers. The first goal of this branch of medicine, Kapp told TechCrunch last year, is \"don't die of anything stupid.\"\n\n\"We do a 200 gigabyte upload of you, everything knowable about you, full genome, all imaging, everything,\" Diamandis said, adding he did not want Musk \"to pull a Steve Jobs.\"\n\nApple's visionary leader died in 2011 of pancreatic cancer. Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that he regretted waiting to undergo surgery to address the cancer.",

    "fullText": "Sample of roughly 500 posts shows how frequently people are creating sexualized images with Elon Musk’s AI chatbot\n\nNew research that samples X users prompting Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok demonstrates how frequently people are creating sexualized images with it. Nearly three-quarters of posts collected and analyzed by a PhD researcher at Dublin’s Trinity College were requests for nonconsensual images of real women or minors with items of clothing removed or added.\n\nThe posts offer a new level of detail on how the images are generated and shared on X, with users coaching one another on prompts; suggesting iterations on Grok’s presentations of women in lingerie or swimsuits, or with areas of their body covered in semen; and asking Grok to remove outer clothing in replies to posts containing self-portraits by female users.\n\nAmong hundreds of posts identified by Nana Nwachukwu as direct, nonconsensual requests for Grok to remove or replace clothing, dozens reviewed by the Guardian show users posting pictures of women including celebrities, models, stock photos and women who are not public figures posing in snapshots.\n\nSeveral posts in the trove reviewed by the Guardian have received tens of thousands of impressions and come from premium, “blue check” accounts, including accounts with tens of thousands of followers. Premium accounts with more than 500 followers and 5m impressions over three months are eligible for revenue-sharing under X’s eligibility rules.\n\nIn one Christmas Day post, an account with more than 93,000 followers presented side-by-side images of an unknown woman’s backside with the caption: “Told Grok to make her butt even bigger and switch leopard print to USA print. 2nd pic I just told it to add cum on her ass lmao.”\n\nA 3 January post, representative of dozens reviewed by the Guardian, captioned an apparent holiday snap of an unknown woman: “@grok replace give her a dental floss bikini.” Within two minutes, Grok provided a photorealistic image that satisfied the request. Other posts in the trove show more sophisticated employment of JSON-prompt engineering to induce Grok to generate novel sexualized images of fictitious women.\n\nThe data does not cover all such requests made to Grok. While content analysis firm Copyleaks reported on 31 December that X users were generating “roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute”, Nwachukwu said that her sample is limited to just more than 500 posts she was able to collect with X’s API via a developer account. She said that the true scale “could be thousands, it could be hundreds of thousands” but that changes made by Musk to the API mean that “it is much harder to see what is happening” on the platform. On Wednesday, Bloomberg News cited researchers who found that Grok users were generating up to 6,700 undressed images per hour.\n\nNwachukwu, an expert on AI governance and a longtime observer of and participant in social media safety initiatives, said that she first noticed requests along these lines from X users back in 2023.\n\nAt the time, she said, “Grok did not oblige the requests. It wasn’t really good at doing those things.” The bot’s responses began changing in 2024, and reached a critical mass late last year.\n\nIn October 2025, she noticed that “people were putting Halloween attire on themselves using Grok. Of course, a section of users realized we can also ask it to change what other people are wearing.” By year’s end, “there was a huge uptick in people asking Grok to put different people in bikinis or other types of suggestive clothing”.\n\nThere were other indications last year of an increased willingness to tolerate or even encourage the generation of sexually suggestive material with Grok.\n\nIn August, xAI incorporated a “spicy mode” setting in the mobile version of Grok’s text-to-video generation tool, leading the Verge to characterize it as “a service designed specifically to make suggestive videos”.\n\nNwachukwu’s data is just the latest indication of how the platform under Musk has become a magnet for forms of content that other platforms work to exclude, including hate speech, gore content and copyrighted material.\n\nOn Friday, Grok issued a bizarre public apology over the incident on X, claiming that “xAI is implementing stronger safeguards to prevent this”. On Tuesday, X Safety posted a promise to ban users who shared child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Musk himself said: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”\n\nNwachukwu said, however, that posts like those she has already collected are still appearing on the platform. Musk is giving “the middle finger to everyone who has asked for the platform to be moderated”, she said. The billionaire slashed Twitter’s trust and safety teams when he took over in 2022.\n\nShe added that other AI chatbots do not have the same issues.\n\n“Other generative AI platforms – ChatGPT or Gemini – they have safeguards,” she said. “If you ask them to generate something that looks like a person, it would never be a depiction of that person. They don’t generate depictions of real human beings.”\n\nThe revelations about the nonconsensual imagery on X has already drawn the attention of regulators in the UK, Europe, India, and Australia.\n\nNwachukwu, who is from Nigeria, pointed to a specific harm being done in the posts to “women from conservative societies”.\n\n“There’s a lot of targeting of people from conservative beliefs, conservative societies: west Africa, south Asia. This represents a different kind of harm for them,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Judge says there is plenty of evidence to suggest OpenAI’s leaders made assurances nonprofit structure would be kept\n\nElon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI is to go to trial after a US judge said there is plenty of evidence to support the billionaire’s case.\n\nThe world’s richest man, who co-founded OpenAI, is suing the ChatGPT developer and its chief executive, Sam Altman, over claims its leaders violated the organisation’s founding mission by shifting to a for-profit model.\n\nThe US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, told a hearing there was plenty of evidence that suggested OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure was going to be maintained.\n\nShe said there were enough disputed facts to let a jury consider the claims at a trial scheduled for March, rather than decide the issues herself. Rogers said she would issue a written order after the hearing that addresses OpenAI’s attempt to throw out the case.\n\nThe court dispute comes amid a broader showdown over dominance in the market for generative artificial intelligence. Musk’s xAI and its chatbot Grok are competing with OpenAI and other technology developers.\n\nMusk is seeking unspecified monetary damages from what he calls “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI.\n\nIn a statement after the hearing, OpenAI said: “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.”\n\nMusk’s startup xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSteven Molo, a lead trial attorney for the billionaire and xAI, said after the hearing: “We look forward to presenting all the evidence of the defendants’ wrongdoing to the jury.”\n\nMusk contends he contributed about $38m (£28m), roughly 60% of OpenAI’s early funding, along with strategic guidance and credibility, based on assurances that the organisation would remain a nonprofit dedicated to the public benefit.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman of plotting a for-profit switch to enrich themselves, culminating in multibillion-dollar deals with Microsoft and a recent restructuring.\n\nOpenAI, Altman and Brockman have denied the claims, and have described Musk as “a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader”.\n\nMicrosoft, which is also a defendant, urged Rogers to throw out Musk’s claims against it. A lawyer for Microsoft said there was no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has been approached for comment.\n\nLawyers for OpenAI at the hearing asked Rogers to enter judgment against Musk, contending that he had not shown enough of a factual basis to sustain his allegations including fraud and breach of contract.\n\nOpenAI also contends that Musk failed to bring his allegations in a timely manner. The judge said the jury would be asked to weigh whether the lawsuit was filed outside the statute of limitations.",

IWF analysts said the images would be considered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under UK law.\n\n“We can confirm our analysts have discovered criminal imagery of children aged between 11 and 13 which appears to have been created using the tool,” said Ngaire Alexander, the head of the IWF’s hotline, which investigates reports of CSAM from members of the public.\n\nX, Elon Musk’s social media platform, has been deluged with images of women and children whose clothes have been digitally removed by the Grok tool, sparking public outcry and condemnation from politicians.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, the House of Commons women and equalities committee said it would no longer use X for its communications, saying it was no longer appropriate to do so given preventing violence against women and girls was among its key policy areas.\n\nThe decision marks the first significant move by a Westminster organisation to exit X in response to the misuse of Grok. While the decision concerned only the committee’s account, some individual members, including the Labour chair, Sarah Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.\n\nAlexander said the imagery viewed by the IWF has been used to create even more extreme material – known as Category A, which includes penetrative sexual activity – using a different AI tool.\n\n“We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material. Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream. That is unacceptable,” Alexander added.\n\nMusk’s xAI, which owns Grok and X, has been approached for comment.\n\nDowning Street said “all options were on the table”, including a boycott of X as ministers backed the UK regulator, Ofcom, to take action.\n\nOn Wednesday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “X needs to deal with this urgently and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users.\n\n“It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law.”\n\nRequests for Grok to manipulate images of women to “put her in a bikini” continued to flood in on X on Wednesday. Despite the warnings of EU and UK regulatory action, there was no evidence that the platform had installed tighter safeguards, and pictures of teenage girls continue to be stripped down digitally at the request of X users, to show them in small, revealing items of underwear, or positioned in sexually explicit poses.\n\nSome users have demanded more extreme content, asking the chatbot to decorate bikinis with swastikas, or requesting alterations to photographs of women so they appear to be victims of abuse. The chatbot has obliged by adding cigarette burns, facial bruising, and blood to some images of women.\n\nThe UK’s data watchdog – the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) – said it had contacted X and xAI “to seek clarity on the measures they have in place to comply with UK data protection law and protect individuals’ rights”, adding people have “a right to use social media knowing their personal data is being handled lawfully and with respect”.\n\nX has said it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, “by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary”.",

The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure.

The funding round exceeded its initial $15bn target, according to xAI’s press release. The company touted Grok’s image-generation abilities in the announcement of its latest funding round.\n\nxAI lacks the prominence of its rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and has continually drawn criticism for generating misinformation, antisemitic content and now potentially illegal sexual material. Nonetheless, the company has been able to win government contracts and billions of dollars in investment amid the AI boom. xAI’s latest funding round comes during some of the fiercest pushback against the company yet, with lawmakers in multiple countries demanding answers regarding Grok’s output.\n\nOver the past week, Grok has responded to tens of thousands of prompts from users on X requesting the chatbot remove women’s clothing in images or pose them in sexualized ways. Many of the prompts have included images of women who have not given their consent to be digitally undressed, including Ashley St Clair, the estranged mother of one of Musk’s children.\n\n“I felt horrified, I felt violated, especially seeing my toddler’s backpack in the back of it,” St Clair told the Guardian, adding that her complaints to X did not go anywhere. The Guardian’s request for comment from xAI resulted in an automated response stating “Legacy Media Lies”.\n\nSome of Grok’s images included a photo of a 12-year-old girl, which the chatbot manipulated to remove the child’s actual clothing and depict her instead in a bikini. Other suggestive images have featured children as young as 10 years old. The chatbot posted an apology on Friday that stated lapses in its safeguards led to generating images of minors, but continued to generate sexualized images of children in the ensuing days.\n\nxAI has been seeking investment for months as it works to increase its AI models’ capabilities and build out enormous data centers in Memphis, Tennessee. The company claimed the new funding would help its core mission of “Understanding the Universe”.\n\nFrench ministers reported Grok’s output to prosecutors on Friday and referred the episode to media regulators to decide whether the images violate the European Union’s Digital Services Act. Liz Kendall, the UK’s technology secretary, also condemned Grok’s deepfakes on Tuesday as “appalling and unacceptable”, calling on the British regulator Ofcom to take action. Ofcom posted on X that it had made contact with xAI to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Lawmakers in the US, where xAI is headquartered, have remained comparatively mum.\n\nThe company made a similar funding announcement in July of last year during another controversy over Grok. A week after the chatbot began posting antisemitic content and pro-Nazi ideology, including describing itself as “MechaHitler”, xAI announced it had secured a contract with the US Pentagon worth nearly $200m.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says China is on track to outpace every other country in the computing power needed to run AI.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in an episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast published Tuesday that \"China's going to have more power than anyone else and probably will have more chips.\"\n\n\"Based on current trends, China will far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute,\" he added.\n\nMusk said China's decisive advantage in the AI race lies in its ability to scale electricity generation. He estimated that China could reach about three times the electricity output of the US by 2026, giving it the capacity to support energy-hungry AI data centers.\n\nElectricity generation is the limiting factor to scaling AI systems, Musk said.\n\n\"People are underestimating the difficulty of bringing electricity online,\" he added.\n\nWhile the US has focused on restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors, Musk suggested those constraints may matter less over time. China will \"figure out the chips,\" he said.\n\nMusk added that diminishing returns at the cutting edge of chip performance might make it easier for China to catch up, even without access to the most advanced designs.\n\nMusk has previously pointed to China as a model in areas beyond AI infrastructure.\n\nIn an episode of the \"People by WTF\" podcast published in November, Musk said he wants to turn his social media platform X into \"WeChat++,\" referencing China's dominant super app.\n\n\"I also like the idea of sort of having a unified app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there,\" he said. \"China has this with WeChat.\"\n\nMusk's comments come as energy supply and data infrastructure emerge as key constraints in scaling AI, rather than chips or algorithms.\n\nCompanies worldwide have rushed to build AI data centers, many of which require as much electrical power as small cities.\n\nA report from Goldman Sachs in November said that an electricity shortage could slow US progress in the AI race.\n\n\"As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nThe report added that while pressure on the US power grid is increasing, China has been steadily expanding its energy capacity.\n\n\"We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping praised his country's progress in AI in 2025, saying China had \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" he said in his speech in Beijing.\n\n\"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Warren Buffett's late business partner, Charlie Munger, once said the \"hard part\" of getting rich is pulling together the first $100,000, as that's often a \"long struggle\" for someone starting at zero.\n\nElon Musk is at the polar opposite end of the wealth spectrum — worth so much on paper that he can gain or lose tens of billions of dollars and barely move the needle on his net worth.\n\nAfter just two trading days this year, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has added $24 billion to his personal fortune, lifting it by about 4% to $644 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe world's richest person by far — he's worth more than double Alphabet cofounder Larry Page in second place — was last year's biggest wealth gainer with a $187 billion increase.\n\nMusk is comfortably leading that list in 2026 as well. As of Monday's close, Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy is a distant runner up with a roughly $8 billion gain.\n\nIt's not exactly clear why Musk's fortune has swelled this year. Tesla stock has only inched up 0.4%, boosting the value of its CEO's stake by less than $2 billion even if his previously disputed stock options are included.\n\nSpaceX's valuation rocketed to $800 billion in December, but that was reflected in Musk's wealth gain last year. Nor have there been any publicized valuation increases for his other companies, which include xAI, Neuralink, and The Boring Company.\n\nThat suggests Bloomberg has simply tweaked its calculations, causing a change in net worth that would be material even for Musk's fellow centibillionaires, but appears closer to a rounding error for Musk.\n\nTech billionaires like Musk have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, as investors continue to bet big that their companies will capitalize on the red-hot trend.\n\nPage and his cofounder, Sergey Brin, have both added over $2 billion to their fortunes this year, thanks to Alphabet shares climbing 1% or so. They grew $101 billion and $92 billion richer respectively last year, trailing only Musk in wealth gain.",

    "description": "Donald Trump and Elon Musk have a complicated relationship. They've had some very public spats, but the two powerful men remain political allies.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump appear to be back on after an on-again, off-again relationship over the years.\n\nThe world's richest person and the two-time president of the United States weren't always close, but became singular political allies, with Musk calling himself \"first buddy\" following Trump's 2024 victory and donating more than $200 million toward pro-Trump super PACs.\n\nAt the beginning of Trump's second term, Musk was frequently seen on the president's side and served as the de facto head of the White House DOGE office.\n\nIn June 2025, Trump and Musk's relationship blew up after Musk criticized Trump's signature \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" Musk even threatened to start his own political party. Trump threatened to \"destroy\" Musk's companies.\n\nTensions have cooled since then. Musk and Trump shook hands at Charlie Cook's memorial service in September, a reunion that Musk and the White House proudly shared on social media. In October 2025, Trump said he now had a \"good\" relationship with Musk.\n\n\"I like Elon, I've always liked him,\" Trump said.\n\nHere's how the two billionaires reached this point.\n\nJust before the 2016 presidential election, Musk told CNBC he didn't think Trump should be president.\n\n\"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire added that Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies were the \"right ones.\"\n\nAfter he won the presidency, Trump appointed Musk to two economic advisory councils, along with other business leaders like then Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nMusk received criticism for working with the controversial president, but he defended his choice by saying he was using the position to lobby for better environmental and immigration policies.\n\nOn June 1, 2017, after Trump announced the US would pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Musk resigned from his roles on presidential advisory boards.\n\n\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk said in a tweet announcing his departure.\n\nMusk's goal for Tesla is to curb dependence on fossil fuels through electric vehicles, solar power, and stationary energy storage.\n\nDuring a January 2020 interview with CNBC, Trump praised Musk's accomplishments and intelligence.\n\n\"You have to give him credit,\" the former president said, referring to Tesla becoming more valuable than Ford and General Motors. \"He's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And he's doing good at rockets too, by the way.\"\n\nTrump called Musk \"one of our great geniuses\" and likened him to Thomas Edison.\n\nAs the pandemic gripped the US in early 2020, Musk clashed with California public-health officials who forced Tesla to temporarily shut down its factory there. Trump voiced his support for Musk.\n\n\"California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW,\" Trump tweeted in May 2020. \"It can be done Fast & Safely!\"\n\nIn May 2022, Musk said he would unban Trump as Twitter's new owner.\n\nMusk called the ban a \"morally bad decision\" and \"foolish to the extreme\" in an interview with the Financial Times. Twitter kicked Trump off its platform following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThe Tesla billionaire has called himself a \"free speech absolutist,\" and one of his key goals for taking Twitter private was to loosen content moderation.\n\nIn July 2022, Trump took aim at Musk, saying the businessman voted for him but later denied it.\n\n\"You know [Musk] said the other day 'Oh, I've never voted for a Republican,'\" Trump said during a Saturday rally in Anchorage, Alaska. \"I said 'I didn't know that.' He told me he voted for me. So he's another bullshit artist.\"\n\nDays later, Musk tweeted that Trump's claim was \"not true.\"\n\nMusk stopped short of attacking Trump personally, but said he shouldn't run for president again.\n\n\"I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset. Dems should also call off the attack – don't make it so that Trump's only way to survive is to regain the Presidency,\" he tweeted.\n\nHe continued: \"Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!? Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69.\" Trump is 76 years old.\n\nSoon after, Trump went on the offensive, posting a lengthy attack on Musk on Truth Social.\n\n\"When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it's electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he'd be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" Trump said in a post that criticized two of Musk's ventures, Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\n\n\"Lmaooo,\" Musk responded on Twitter.\n\nFollowing Musk's official purchase of Twitter in October 2022, Trump applauded the deal.\n\n\"I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands, and will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs that truly hate our country,\" he said. He added that he likes Truth Social better than other platforms, echoing comments from earlier this year in which he ruled out a return to Twitter.\n\nMusk later joked about the potential of welcoming the former president back to his newly acquired platform.\n\n\"If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!,\" the Tesla CEO tweeted in October 2022.\n\nMusk and other right-leaning voices in Silicon Valley initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis ended 2022 as Trump's best-positioned primary challenger. In November 2022, as DeSantis was skyrocketing to acclaim, Musk said he would endorse him. In March 2023, after enduring Trump's attacks for months, DeSantis prepared to make history by formally announcing his candidacy in an interview on Twitter.\n\nThe initial few minutes were a glitchy disaster. Trump and his allies ruthlessly mocked DeSantis' \"Space\" with Musk and venture capitalist David Sachs. DeSantis' interview later proceeded, but his campaign was dogged for days with negative headlines.\n\nMusk live-streamed a visit to the US-Mexico border on Twitter, which he had rebranded as \"X.\" Musk offered his support for one of Trump's signature immigration policies.\n\n\"We actually do need a wall and we need to require people to have some shred of evidence to claim asylum to enter, as everyone is doing that,\" Musk wrote on X. \"It's a hack that you can literally Google to know exactly what to say! Will find out more when I visit Eagle Pass maybe as soon as tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump tried to woo Musk during a meeting at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. According to The New York Times, Trump met with Musk and a few other GOP megadonors when the former president's campaign was particularly cash-strapped. After the Times published its report, Musk said he would not be \"donating money to either candidate for US President.\"\n\nMusk said he \"fully endorsed\" Trump after the former president was shot during a political rally ahead of the Republican National Convention. Musk's endorsement marked a major turning point in his yearslong political evolution from an Obama voter. Days later, it would come to light that Musk pressed Trump to select Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate.\n\nTrump announced Vance as his vice presidential pick at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe ticket, Musk wrote on X, \"resounds with victory.\"\n\nTrump, who ended the Republican National Convention primed for victory, stumbled after Biden abruptly dropped out of the 2024 race. He and his allies have struggled to attack Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAmid Harris' early media blitz, Trump joined Musk on a two-hour livestream on X that garnered an audience of over 1 million listeners. The conversation covered topics ranging from a retelling of Trump's assassination attempt to illegal immigration to Musk's potential role with a government efficiency commission.\n\nIn August, Trump began to suggest that he \"certainly would\" consider adding Musk to his Cabinet or an advisory role. The Tesla CEO responded by tweeting an AI-generated photo of himself on a podium emblazoned with the acronym \"D.O.G.E\"—Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"I am willing to serve,\" he wrote above the image.\n\nIn September 2024, Trump softened the possibility that Musk might join his Cabinet suggestion of Musk joining his Cabinet. However, he also said that Musk could \"consult with the country\" and help give \"some very good ideas.\"\n\nMusk later expressed enthusiasm about the news.\n\n\"I can't wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHe later added that he \"looked forward to serving\" the country and would be willing to do with without any pay, title, or recognition.\n\nMusk joined Trump onstage during the former president's rally, hosted on October 5 in the same location where Trump survived an assassination attempt in July 2024. Musk sported an all-black \"Make America Great Again\" cap and briefly addressed the crowd, saying that voter turnout for Trump this year was essential or \"this will be the last election.\"\n\n\"President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution,\" Musk said. \"He must win to preserve democracy in America.\"\n\nThe next day, Musk's America PAC announced that it would offer $47 to each person who refers registered voters residing in swing states to sign a petition \"in support for the First and Second Amendments.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO later told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he might face \"vengeance\" if Trump loses the election.\n\nMusk was by Trump's side on election night at Mar-a-Lago, helping celebrate his victory.\n\nNearly a week after his 2024 presidential election win, Trump announced that Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy were chosen to lead a newly minted Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE, as Musk liked to call it, in reference to the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin).\n\n\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pay the way for my Administration to dismantle the Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nOutside of administrative duties, Musk's presence at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club was so constant that Trump joked he couldn't \"get rid of him.\"\n\n\"Elon won't go home,\" Trump told NBC News jokingly\n\nThe pair's close relationship grew into a more personal friendship. Musk was seen attending Trump's Thanksgiving dinner and on the golf course with Trump and his grandchildren, where Kai Trump said he achieved \"uncle status.\"\n\nTrump dismissed concerns that Musk would be running the country, adding in a barb that the billionaire couldn't even be in charge if he wanted to, since he was born in South Africa.\n\n\"No, he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump said in December 2024. \"And I'm safe. You know why? He can't be? He wasn't born in this country.\"\n\nTrump's comments came after Musk flexed his influence to help shut down a bipartisan emergency spending bill earlier that month. Some Republicans questioned why Trump hadn't been more active in derailing the bill, and Democrats baited the President-elect on social media with posts about Musk \"calling the shots\" and taking on the role of a \"shadow president.\n\nTrump was sworn into office on January 20. Several tech leaders were in attendance, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sundar Pichai. The \"first buddy\" was also front and center for Trump's inauguration.\n\nMusk took the stage to celebrate at an inauguration event at the Capital One Arena, where he sparked accusations over a gesture he made that some said resembled a Nazi salute. Musk denied the allegations.\n\n\"Hopefully, people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi,\" he said during an interview with Joe Rogan.\n\nThough Musk quickly became the face of the DOGE effort, White House court filings said he had \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"\n\nIn the February 2025 filing, Musk was described as a senior advisor to Trump with \"no greater authority than other senior White House advisors.\" Officials also called him a \"special government employee.\"\n\nTrump told reporters they can call Musk \"whatever you want.\"\n\nThe White House later named Amy Gleason, who previously worked for US Digital Service, as the acting DOGE administrator.\n\nMusk's companies struggled to escape the almost daily DOGE-related news cycles.\n\nProtests, boycotts, and vandalism at Tesla dealerships spread across the US.\n\nIn March, Trump stepped in to defend Musk's electric car company, with Teslas on the South Lawn of the White House. Trump later wrote that he'd purchased a Tesla to show support for Musk.\n\n\"The Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThree months into DOGE's mission to reshape the federal workforce, Musk announced that he would be stepping back from the effort. He broke the news during an underwhelming Tesla earnings call, where earnings per share were down 71% year over year.\n\n\"Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" Musk said during the call. He added that \"the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency\" had been completed.\n\nAt the time, Musk said he would keep spending one or two days each week on governmental duties, so long as Trump wanted him to do so.\n\nOn June 30, Musk doubled down on his calls for another political party. He also vowed to defeat politicians who support Trump's bill.\n\n\"They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,\" Musk wrote on X.\n\nTrump responded on July 1 on Truth Social, suggesting that DOGE could be turned on its former chief.\n\n\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk followed up with more posts on X proclaiming his opposition to the spending bill.\n\nTrump signed his signature bill on July 4, 2025.\n\nOn July 5, Musk said on X that he had formed the America Party to \"give you back your freedom.\"\n\nTrump responded on Truth Social that he was \"saddened\" to see Musk go \"completely 'off the rails,'\" essentially becoming a \"TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.\" Trump added that third political parties have never succeeded.\n\nLate in the month, Trump said that even though his signature domestic plan slashes EV subsidies, he's not out to hurt Musk's bottom line.\n\n\"Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large-scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!\"\n\nTrump's statement came a day after the White House appeared to suggest that federal agencies shouldn't contract with Musk's xAI.\n\nTrump and Musk were seen for the first time since their public falling out at the memorial service for conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nTrump, Vice President JD Vance, and a host of other top White House officials joined together in Arizona to pay tribute to Kirk, who was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University.\n\nMusk and the White House later posted photos of the meet-up on X.\n\nTrump said that Musk came over \"to say hello.\"\n\n\"I thought it was nice, he came over, we had a little conversation,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after the memorial service. \"We had a very good relationship but it was nice that he came over. \"\n\nPOTUS x @ElonMusk \n\nFor Charlie. pic.twitter.com/Inaf8X81Gy\n\nMusk had previously said that the White House had invited him to an exclusive dinner for tech CEOs but was unable to attend.\n\nTrump said he and Musk had a \"good\" relationship and called their brief feud \"a stupid moment.\"\n\n\"He had a bad spell, he had a bad period. He had a bad moment,\" Trump told reporters when asked about their relationship. \"It was a stupid moment in his life, very stupid. I'm sure he'd tell you that. But I like Elon, and I suspect I always will.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO still has beefs elsewhere. In late October, Musk called Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy a \"dummy\" amid a spat over who would lead NASA.\n\nTrump invited Musk to attend a dinner at the White House with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November. The event marks Musk's first public appearance at the White House since stepping back from the DOGE office in May 2025.\n\nThe guest list for the dinner included prominent CEOs such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk shared a photo of the event on X, which included himself, Trump, the crown prince, and Huang.\n\n\"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nOne day after the dinner, Trump joked about Musk in a speech at the US-Saudi Investment Forum.\n\n\"You're so lucky I'm with you, Elon. I'll tell you. Has he ever thanked me properly?\" Trump said.\n\nHours after news broke that the US had raided Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on January 3, Elon Musk posted his support.\n\n\"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"It is heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant,\" he posted again. \"Venezuela can now have the prosperity it deserves.\"\n\nThat same evening, Musk posted that he had a \"lovely dinner\" with Trump and Melania Trump, along with a photo of the three of them seated at a table at Mar-a-Lago.",

    "fullText": "A short video. A few words. And suddenly, the internet is on fire.\n\nA Somali TikToker is facing intense backlash after commenting what many interpreted as a threat against Elon Musk. The remark spread fast, pulled Musk into the conversation, and triggered a wave of reactions that raised serious questions about online speech and real-world consequences.\n\nIn the now-viral clip, the TikToker appeared dismissive when Musk’s name came up. Her response stopped people cold.\n\n“I wouldn’t worry too much about him,” she said. “He about to die.”\n\nThe statement didn’t include context, jokes, or qualifiers. Viewers immediately flagged it as disturbing, especially given Musk’s global profile and the climate around public figures and security concerns. The clip moved across X, TikTok, and Reddit within hours.\n\nBOOM! Elon Musk FIRES BACK at the Somali woman threatening his life\n\nWhen fraud is exposed – it’s always the fraudsters who yell and complain the loudest.\n\nTheir THEFT will come to an end. pic.twitter.com/K0sfl3DFl1\n\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 2, 2026\n\nElon Musk didn’t ignore it. Instead, he responded directly on X with a blunt message that escalated the situation instantly. “Then it is war.”\n\nThe response fueled speculation. Some saw it as sarcasm. Others read it as a warning. Either way, it ensured the exchange wouldn’t fade quietly.\n\nOnce Musk replied, the clip went from niche content to headline material.\n\nAs the clip circulated, comment sections exploded. Many users expressed shock at how casually the statement was delivered. Others went further, predicting severe consequences for the TikToker.\n\n“She’s about to spend some years behind bars,” one comment read. Another user wrote, “She about to be ‘mysteriously’ missing. I don’t think anyone will care.”\n\nThose comments sparked a second wave of criticism, with users arguing that the backlash itself was becoming dangerous.\n\nSeveral legal-minded users pointed out why the comment raised alarms. Saying that a healthy, relatively young person will die soon can be interpreted as more than opinion.\n\n“When you say that a person who is healthy and not old will die ‘naturally’ soon, this looks like a threat,” one widely shared post argued.\n\nIn many countries, language that implies harm toward a specific individual can trigger investigation, even without explicit details.\n\nThat distinction matters more when the subject is a high-profile figure.\n\nThe situation reopened a familiar debate. Where does free expression end, and where does accountability begin?\n\nSome defended the TikToker, claiming the statement was careless but not criminal. Others argued that public figures face constant danger and that language like this cannot be brushed aside.\n\nPlatforms also came under scrutiny for how quickly content spreads before moderation steps in. Once again, the internet moved faster than clarity.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Musk has become the center of an online firestorm triggered by a single sentence. His presence alone tends to magnify conflicts.\n\nOne comment becomes a movement. One reply becomes a signal. And millions rush to interpret intent. That dynamic keeps repeating, and each time the stakes feel higher.\n\nJUST IN: Somali woman Fardowsa Muhumed is FRANTIC after threatening Elon Musk’s life, to which Elon replied, “then IT IS WAR”\n\nShe’s retracting her threat, and says “[I am] truly in fear for my future!”\n\nCowards.pic.twitter.com/aG1pRqYplt https://t.co/mMkGcIMu7u\n\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 2, 2026\n\nIn a video released a few hours ago, the Somali woman has apologized for her comments and claimed the video was taken out of context.\n\n“Let me make myself clear, I never intended or aimed to threaten the life of Elon Musk. I am not a person who carries around hate; the media has taken my words out of context, and it’s been deeply hurtful to watch how that’s turned into me being dehumanized and painted as a villain.",

    "fullText": "The novelty of eating at a diner owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off in just a few months\n\nLess than six months since it opened, Elon Musk’s Tesla Diner has the feel of a ghost town. Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are the hours-long, hundred-person lines wrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.\n\nOn a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot for Tesla car charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.\n\nThe novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsite anti-Musk protests, noise complaints from neighbors and customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.\n\nGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month that he was leaving the Tesla Diner to focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chef removed his previous Instagram posts referencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.\n\nGreenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.\n\nGreenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Diner faced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Musk made what rights groups have described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.\n\nMusk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA since at least 2018 as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.\n\n“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”\n\nThe diner received immense media coverage upon opening but poor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.\n\nA display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.\n\nTesla posted on X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.\n\nOn social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.\n\nThe diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.\n\nAs the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.\n\n“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.",

The chatbot, a product of Musk’s company xAI, has been generating a wave of sexualized images throughout the week in response to user prompts.\n\nScreenshots shared by users on X showed Grok’s public media tab filled with such images. xAI said it was working to improve its systems to prevent future incidents.\n\n“There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing,” Grok said in a post on X in response to a user. “xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.”\n\n“As noted, we’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them—CSAM is illegal and prohibited,” xAI posted to the @Grok account on X, referring to child sexual abuse material.\n\nMany users on X have prompted Grok to generate sexualized, nonconsensual AI-altered versions of images in recent days, in some cases removing people’s clothing without their consent. Musk on Thursday reposted an AI photo of himself in a bikini, captioned with cry-laughing emojis, in a nod to the trend.\n\nGrok’s generation of sexualized images appeared to lack safety guardrails, allowing for minors to be featured in its posts of people, usually women, wearing little clothing, according to posts from the chatbot. In a reply to a user on X on Thursday, Grok said most cases could be prevented through advanced filters and monitoring although it said “no system is 100% foolproof”, adding that xAI was prioritising improvements and reviewing details shared by users.\n\nWhen contacted for comment by email, xAI replied with the message: “Legacy Media Lies”.\n\nThe problem of AI being used to generate child sexual abuse material is a longstanding issue in the artificial intelligence industry. A 2023 Stanford study found that a dataset used to train a number of popular AI image-generation tools contained over 1000 CSAM images. Training AI on images of child abuse can allow models to generate new images of children being exploited, experts say.\n\nGrok also has a history of failing to maintain its safety guardrails and posting misinformation. In May of last year, Grok began posting about the far-right conspiracy of “white genocide” in South Africa on posts with no relation to the concept. xAI also apologized in July after Grok began posting rape fantasies and antisemitic material, including calling itself “MechaHitler” and praising Nazi ideology. The company nevertheless secured a nearly $200m contract with the US Department of Defense a week after the incidents.",

He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop.\n\nDeliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.\n\nTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.\n\nThe stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers.\n\n— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.
