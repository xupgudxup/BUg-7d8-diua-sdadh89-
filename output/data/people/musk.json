    "description": "Elon Musk said Ryanair \"will lose customers to airlines that do have internet\" after its CEO said he wasn't interested in Starlink.",
    "fullText": "Europe's biggest airline won't be installing Starlink on its planes anytime soon, and senior SpaceX staff like Elon Musk aren't best pleased.\n\nRyanair CEO Michael O'Leary isn't convinced by Starlink, Musk's satellite internet provider, which is becoming more popular among airlines.\n\nFor example, Lufthansa — the German flag carrier which runs the continent's second-largest airline group — announced on Tuesday that it would introduce the service. The following day, Scandinavian Airlines operated its first flight with Starlink.\n\nHowever, as a budget airline, Ryanair is known for its no-frills offering.\n\n\"We don't think ‍our ⁠passengers are willing to pay for WiFi for an average ⁠one-hour flight,\" O'Leary told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nHis comments sparked a debate on X. Musk said in a post: \"They [Ryanair] will lose customers to airlines that do have internet.\"\n\nRyanair and its subsidiaries operate a fleet of 643 airplanes, which handled 206 million passengers last year. 2024's statistics showed that it was the world's third-largest airline group, behind American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.\n\nThe Irish airline's low-cost business model allows it to offer tickets as low as 15 euros, or about $17.40. It focuses on quick turnarounds between flights, charging for add-ons like sitting next to your friends, and on-board sales, including scratchcards and duty-free cigarettes.\n\nEvery airline that's announced Starlink deals so far has included free in-flight internet for everyone on board. So, even if O'Leary changed his mind, it seems unlikely that Musk's company would let him charge Ryanair passengers to use Starlink.\n\nSpaceX executives also took umbrage at what they said was incorrect information about the fuel costs incurred by installing Starlink.\n\n\"You need to put [an] antenna on [the] fuselage — it comes with a 2% fuel ⁠penalty because of ​the weight and ​drag,\" O'Leary told Reuters.\n\nMichael Nicolls, the VP of Starlink engineering, said in an X post that Starlink terminals have a more fuel-efficient profile than other airplane internet providers. He added that SpaceX's analysis showed a Starlink terminal instead increased fuel costs by 0.3% on a Boeing 737-800, the model that makes up the bulk of Ryanair's fleet.\n\n\"Hmm, must be a way to get that down under 0.1%,\" Musk replied to him.\n\nRyanair declined to comment on Musk's and Nicolls' remarks when contacted by Business Insider. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile US budget airlines have recently pivoted to offer more premium options under intense financial pressures, Ryanair has little reason to do so. Adding an amenity like Starlink would be at odds with its business model, especially if it were free for passengers.\n\nPost-pandemic, more American travellers have been paying extra for more luxurious flights. Budget airlines have also struggled to compete on price with legacy carriers.\n\nBut on the other side of the Atlantic, Ryanair has managed to balance a spartan approach with financial success.\n\nIn its latest quarterly earnings, Ryanair posted after-tax profits of 1.72 billion euros, about $2 billion — a 20% increase from a year earlier. Southwest Airlines' latest quarterly earnings were down nearly 20% year-over-year to $54 million.",

    "fullText": "STOCKHOLM/LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's Grok chatbot is testing Europe's ability to clamp down on deepfakes and digital undressing of images online, even after regulators scored a rare win by forcing Musk's xAI to curb the creation of sexualized images.\n\nxAI said late on Wednesday ​it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users after the chatbot churned out thousands of sexualized images of women and minors that alarmed global regulators.\n\nThe ‌climb-down by Musk, who initially laughed off the trend, highlights the difficulty of policing AI tools that make it cheap and easy to create explicit content. It is the latest clash between Europe and Musk, following rows ‌over election interference, content moderation and free speech.\n\nMany regulators are still scrambling to develop laws and rules to govern AI, with question marks over what constitutes nudity, how to define consent, and who bears responsibility: the user or the platform.\n\n\"It's really a grey zone with regards to the creation of the nude images,\" Ängla Pändel, a Stockholm-based data protection and privacy lawyer with Mannheimer Swartling, told Reuters.\n\nBritish regulator Ofcom, one of the most vocal on the issue, welcomed the move by Musk, but said its investigation into xAI over the Grok images would continue.\n\n\"Our formal investigation remains ⁠ongoing,\" a spokesperson said. \"We are working round the clock to ‌progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what's being done to fix it.\"\n\nSTRONGEST ENFORCEMENT STILL NEEDED, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nEarlier this month, Grok created hyper-realistic images of women on X manipulated to look like they were in tiny bikinis, degrading poses or even covered in bruises. ‍Some minors were digitally stripped down to swimwear.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Reuters found the chatbot still produced sexualized images privately on demand. That appeared to have been curbed at least in certain geographies on Thursday.\n\nMusk's xAI said it was blocking users from generating images of people in skimpy attire in \"jurisdictions where it's illegal\". It did not identify those jurisdictions.\n\nIn Malaysia and Indonesia the government has imposed temporary bans on Grok, ​while EU and UK regulators called the images unlawful. The UK, France and Italy launched probes, but faced calls for tougher action.\n\n\"Stronger enforcement under the Digital Services Act (DSA) ‌is needed to stop apps and platforms that sexualise or nudify women and children,\" said Christian Democrat MEP Nina Carberry, who called the latest move a \"positive step\".\n\n⁠A European Commission spokesperson said that if the Grok changes were not effective, the Commission would still use the full enforcement toolbox of the EU's DSA against the platform.\n\nLEGAL GREY AREA, HEAVY BURDEN ON VICTIMS\n\nThe UK's Online Safety Act makes the sharing of intimate images without consent, including AI-generated deepfakes, a 'priority offence', said Alexander Brown, a UK-based data protection lawyer at Simmons & Simmons.\n\n\"This means X must take proactive, proportionate steps to prevent such content from appearing on its platform and to swiftly remove it when detected,\" he said.\n\nBritain's regulator can fine a company up to 10% ⁠of revenue in the most serious cases of non-compliance or ask a court to require internet service ​providers to block the site.\n\nFor individuals, taking platforms to court is \"a really difficult and heavy process,” said ​Anders Bergsten, a lawyer at Mannheimer Swartling, citing the emotional toll on victims.\n\nDeepfakes have existed for years, well before the advent of the AI apps, though they were largely confined to the darker corners of the web. The publishing power of X gives Grok unprecedented reach.\n\n\"The frictionless publishing capability enables ‍the deepfakes to spread at scale,\" said U.S.-based ⁠lawyer Carrie Goldberg, who works with cyber harassment victims.\n\nLaws in Britain and Sweden make the non-consensual sharing of nude images illegal. Britain is widening the law to include the making of such images.\n\nUnder the DSA, suspending a service is considered a last resort. The EU AI Act also does not have any provision for nude ⁠images of adults, only transparency obligations for deepfakes, experts said.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed X's move on Thursday but warned: \"Free speech is not the freedom to violate consent. Young women's images are not public property, ‌and their safety is not up for debate.\"\n\n\"If we need to strengthen existing laws further, we are prepared to do that.\"",

The U.K. and European Union were investigating potential violations of online safety laws.\n\nFrance and India have also issued warnings, demanding stricter controls. Brazil called for an investigation into Grok’s misuse.\n\nThe British government, which has been one of Grok’s most vociferous critics in recent days, has welcomed the change, while the country’s regulator, Ofcom, said it would carry on with its investigation.\n\n“I shall not rest until all social media platforms meet their legal duties and provide a service that is safe and age-appropriate to all users,” Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta urged xAI to ensure there is no further harassment of women and girls from Grok’s editing functions.\n\n“We have zero tolerance for the AI-based creation and dissemination of nonconsensual intimate images or of child sexual abuse material,” he said.\n\nCalifornia has passed laws to shield minors from AI-generated sexual imagery of children and require AI chatbot platforms to remind users they aren’t interacting with a human.\n\nBut Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also vetoed a law last year that would have restricted children’s access to AI chatbots.\n\nPan Pylas in London contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "\"Savings? Where we're going, we don't need savings.\"\n\nThat twist on Doc Brown's famous line from \"Back to the Future\" captures Elon Musk's controversial view that future retirees won't need nest eggs.\n\n\"Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO told the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast earlier this month. \"It won't matter.\"\n\nThe world's richest man predicted that advances in AI, energy, and robotics will generate such an \"abundance\" of resources for all that individuals' retirement savings will be \"irrelevant.\"\n\nMusk's blue-sky vision comes at a time when years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and weak wage growth have created a nationwide affordability crisis. Household debt hit an all-time high of $18.59 trillion in the third quarter of 2025, up more than 50% from the same point in 2015.\n\nBusiness Insider asked seven personal finance and AI experts for their thoughts on Musk's comments.\n\nTheir reactions all boiled down to one thing: You really should be saving for retirement.\n\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"Most Americans should absolutely ignore these comments,\" said Geoffrey Sanzenbacher, a research fellow at Boston College's Center for Retirement Research (CRR). \"Musk's speculation sends a dangerous and misleading message.\"\n\nSanzenbacher cast doubt on Musk's timeframe, and said the tech billionaire's words were \"especially dangerous\" as Social Security is likely to be cut in the coming years due to a funding shortfall.\n\nAmericans should be \"saving more, not less,\" given that prospect, he said. He added that even if Musk's future comes to pass, \"people who saved now will hardly be much worse off in this utopian future.\"\n\nAlicia Munnell, a senior advisor at CRR and its former director, also dismissed Musk's recommendation.\n\n\"I would pay no attention to anything Elon Musk says out of his core area of expertise,\" she said.\n\n\"He has no idea how the American lives, how important Social Security and 401(k)s are to maintaining people's standard of living,\" Munnell continued. \"He needs to stay out of public policy and concentrate on going to Mars!\"\n\nOlivia Mitchell, the director of Wharton's Boettner Center on Pensions and Retirement Research, said there was \"some truth\" in Musk's view that AI could boost productivity and reduce costs over time.\n\nBut she warned his advice was \"risky\" for US households, especially as their retirement security will \"still depend heavily on individual saving beyond Social Security.\"\n\n\"Even in a richer economy, gains are likely to be uneven and uncertain, so people must still save, in case the future does not unfold as predicted,\" Mitchell added.\n\nKristin Pugh, a private wealth manager at Creative Planning, said AI would allow people to afford their basic needs without working, freeing them to spend more time doing other things\n\nBut past technological advances have made people more productive without leading them to work less, and created wealth gains that weren't distributed equally, she said.\n\n\"Before we 'cancel' the idea of saving for another time in our lives, let's look at the environment and the logistics that would provide for our basic needs,\" Pugh said.\n\n\"We need to push leaders like Musk and Altman for the game plan and the logistics of the vision before any decisions are made,\" she added, referring to Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI.\n\nEkaterina Abramova, a professor at the London Business School specializing in machine learning, said that AI will \"undoubtedly reshape\" the world over the next 20 years, but this will not automatically negate the need for retirement savings.\n\n\"A future of 'universal high income' would depend less on AI itself than on governments choosing to redistribute its gains generously and sustainably, across borders and amid inevitable social friction,\" she said.\n\nJohn Nosta, an innovation theorist and the founder of NostaLab, agreed that Musk's \"promise that retirement planning will become obsolete rests on a fragile chain of assumptions.\"\n\nIt \"presumes that political will, fiscal design (and management), social trust, and intergenerational fairness will mature in lockstep with machine capability,\" and this \"new equilibrium will be durable across decades,\" he said.\n\n\"That is not a technological problem — it is a coordination problem at the scale of civilization,\" Nosta added.\n\nNosta said it's critical that people protect themselves against the risks and uncertainties of life through financial planning, \"rather than assuming that abundance will simply carry everyone safely downstream to an abstract utopian destination.\"\n\nJames Ransom, a research fellow at University College London, said that new technologies have a \"pretty terrible track record of boosting wealth evenly across society\" and he hasn't seen any evidence that AI will be an exception.\n\nUsing a historical analogy, Ransom underlined just how bad humans are at predicting the future.\n\n\"Some employees of the RAND Corporation who were researching nuclear war in the 1950s didn't contribute to their pensions because they didn't believe they would live long enough,\" he said. \"This seemed rational to them, at the time. Let's learn from them, and not swing too far in the other direction.\"",

    "fullText": "UK government claims vindication after Keir Starmer criticised earlier decision to keep functionality as ‘horrific’\n\nThe UK government has claimed “vindication” after Elon Musk’s X announced it had stopped its AI-powered Grok feature from editing pictures of real people to show them in revealing clothes such as bikinis, including for premium subscribers.\n\nAfter a fortnight of public outcry at the tool embedded into X being used to create sexualised images of women and children, the company said it would “geoblock” the ability of users “to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X”, in countries where it was illegal.\n\nIt said it would do this in the UK in line with law changes ministers have pledged to introduce. X also said it had “zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content”. It did not specify whether people would still be able to create such images on the standalone Grok app.\n\nThe prime minister, Keir Starmer, called X’s earlier decision to continue allowing the tool to be used by paid subscribers “horrific”. He also called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful” in parliament on Wednesday. Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, called it “a further insult to victims, effectively monetising this horrific crime”.\n\nOfcom, the UK media regulator, on Monday launched a formal investigation into Musk’s platform after what it called “deeply concerning” reports of Grok being used to create and share illegal nonconsensual intimate images and child sexual abuse material on X.\n\nAn Ofcom spokesperson said: “X has said it’s implemented measures to prevent the Grok account from being used to create intimate images of people. This is a welcome development. However, our formal investigation remains ongoing. We are working round the clock to progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what’s being done to fix it.”\n\nKendall welcomed the latest move by X but said she expected Ofcom’s investigation to “robustly establish the facts”.\n\nScrutiny of Grok has intensified globally after it emerged some people were using it to digitally undress women and children without their consent and posting those images to X. Thousands of these sexualised AI images have appeared X over the last few weeks. xAI, which makes Grok, also owns X, and both are run by Musk.\n\nThe changes to the X and Grok systems came hours after the billionaire posted on his site: “I [sic] not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.”\n\nMusk’s xAI and X have faced growing backlash globally, including an investigation by California’s attorney general and calls by lawmakers and advocacy groups for Apple and Google to drop Grok from their app stores. Countries including Malaysia and Indonesia have instigated bans or legal action.\n\nX said in a statement: “We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and nonconsensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking child sexual exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”\n\nMusk has said that Grok was programmed to refuse illegal requests and must comply with the laws of any given country or state. “Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images. It does so only according to user requests,” Musk said on Wednesday.\n\nMusk has said earlier on X that anyone using Grok to make illegal content would suffer the same consequences as if they uploaded illegal content.\n\nThree Democratic US senators last week called on Apple and Alphabet’s Google to remove X and its built-in AI tool Grok from their app stores, citing the spread of nonconsensual sexual images of women and minors on the platform. A coalition of women’s groups, tech watchdogs and progressive activists also made similar appeals to the tech companies.\n\nLast week, X curtailed Grok’s ability to generate or edit images publicly for users who were not paying subscribers. But industry experts and watchdogs said that Grok was still able to produce sexually explicit images, and that restrictions, such as paywalling certain features, may not fully block access to deeper AI image tools.\n\nIn the UK, the law is changing this week to criminalise the creation of such images, and Starmer said on Wednesday that X was working to comply with the new rules.",

    "fullText": "\"You get what you measure\" is one of my favorite concepts in modern business. It means people and organizations tend to focus their behavior on whatever metrics get tracked and rewarded.\n\nThis even applies to tech billionaires.\n\nThis week, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will make its FSD service subscription-only and remove the option to buy it outright.\n\nOn social media, Elon stans theorized and argued with Elon-haters over the reason for this change. As usual, the debate was devoid of nuance. Fans took this as another sign of the Tesla CEO's genius. Critics argued this proves FSD doesn't work and is doomed.\n\nAs usual, the truth lies elsewhere. Here's my theory, which my Business Insider colleague Tom Carter nodded at earlier.\n\nI think Tesla is getting what it measures. Musk's new compensation package, approved by shareholders late last year, has several tough targets the company must hit before he gets $1 trillion.\n\nAccording to Tesla's proxy filing, there are four product goals. Number 2 on the list is this: \"10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions.\"\n\nOne way Tesla can reach this milestone more quickly is to remove the option to buy FSD outright. By mid-February, anyone considering this option will need to subscribe instead.\n\nWhy would Tesla's board make this a goal for Musk? Subscriptions are a steadier business. Investors prefer continuous income generated by subscription businesses, versus lumpier operations that rely on large, one-time purchases. A pure FSD subscription also gives Tesla more flexibility to change pricing in the future.\n\nI think this is the main lesson, though: Never underestimate the power of financial incentives.\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the FSD change.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Musk attempts to recast AI tool’s misuse. Plus, tech billionaires plot against a proposed California tax on their fortunes\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, US tech editor for the Guardian. Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.\n\nThe firestorm over the Grok AI tool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk has a Valentine's Day present for Tesla owners: another subscription.\n\nThe billionaire said on Wednesday that Tesla will stop making its Full Self-Driving feature available as a one-off purchase and will only offer the assisted driving software as a subscription service.\n\n\"Tesla will stop selling FSD after Feb 14. FSD will only be available as a monthly subscription thereafter,\" the Tesla CEO wrote in a post on X.\n\nTesla owners currently have the option to buy FSD for $8,000 or pay $99 a month to access the service.\n\nIt comes as the company struggles to get customers to pay for the technology, which Musk has regularly described as critical to Tesla's future.\n\nIn Tesla's third-quarter earnings call in October, the company's CFO told investors that only around 12% of Tesla's current fleet subscribed to FSD, with quarterly revenue decreasing compared to the same period the previous year.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key part of Musk's mammoth pay package, which was approved by Tesla investors in November. Reaching 10 million FSD subscriptions is among the milestones that Tesla needs to hit for Musk to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.\n\nThe company's rollout of Full Self-Driving, which allows a Tesla vehicle to drive itself in most situations but requires human supervision at all times, has attracted regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced investigations last year into whether Tesla correctly reported crashes linked to FSD, and over reports of Tesla vehicles with FSD activated running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nTesla also faces a potential ban on selling vehicles in California after a judge ruled that the company's marketing of its Full Self Driving and Autopilot systems misled consumers.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "A growing number of domestic and international airlines are offering Starlink WiFi to passengers, like United Airlines, British Airways, and Emirates.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk's Starlink has gained yet another airline customer as the ultra-high-speed WiFi service continues to gain popularity.\n\nThe Lufthansa Group announced in January that it's installing Starlink and expects to start offering it in the second half of this year.\n\nThe company is named for the German flag carrier, but it also owns several more airlines across Europe, including national carriers for Austria, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland.\n\nLufthansa has a fleet of around 850 aircraft across all its airlines, and its announcement means more than 30 airlines are now set to have Starlink.\n\nBusiness Insider previously tested Starlink on Qatar Airways' first flight with it last October. The connection speed peaked at 215 megabits per second, more than enough for a lag-free video call, and faster than many cable-based internet services.\n\nStarlink functions thanks to a constellation of over 7,000 satellites, which allows internet connections in remote locations, such as flying over an ocean. The satellites are in low-earth orbit, which means faster internet speeds — but also disrupts astronomers.\n\nStarlink isn't the only game in town, however.\n\nJetBlue has signed up for Amazon Leo, which functions similarly, but has only launched 150 satellites so far.\n\nAnother in-flight WiFi rival is Viasat, which is used by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. It only has a handful of satellites in a geostationary orbit, which have a longer time delay.\n\nWhile it has rivals, Starlink wants to cement its dominance. As Starlink grows in popularity, it could be that more carriers All airlines with Starlink offer it free of charge, although some require passengers to \n\nAs of Lufthansa's announcement, here are all the airlines that have publicly announced plans to launch Starlink:\n\nThe Irish flag carrier is part of International Airlines Group, which announced its Starlink deal in early November. It's set to roll out Starlink from early 2026, but plans are still being finalized across the conglomerate.\n\nLatvia's airBaltic flies around Europe and the Middle East only using Airbus A220 jets. It was the first European airline to adopt Starlink, and hopes to complete installation on all its planes by the end of the year.\n\nAir Busan is a budget carrier and a subsidiary of Korean Air, which announced in December that it's adding Starlink.\n\nWhile the legacy carrier has clearer plans for its wide-body jets, Korean said Air Busan will review which planes to prioritize.\n\n\"Rollout schedules will vary by carrier, with the earliest service introduction expected as early as the third quarter of 2026,\" it added.\n\nAir Dolomiti is a regional airline that only operates Embraer jets and focuses on connecting Italian destinations with other cities around Europe.\n\nIt's a subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nIntroduction is set to begin in the second half of 2026, with all Lufthansa Group planes equipped with Starlink by 2029. The company said access would be free for all status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nThe French flag carrier announced its Starlink deal last September, available to Flying Blue loyalty members. Installation began across its fleet, including regional planes, this summer.\n\nAir New Zealand first said it was working with Starlink two years ago. It then rolled it out on two domestic aircraft in June, saying that it was \"currently in the test phase.\"\n\nAir Seoul is a budget carrier and another subsidiary of Korean Air. Like with Air Busan, it is not yet clear which jets will get Starlink.\n\nAfter merging with Hawaiian Airlines — the first major carrier to offer Starlink — Alaska Airlines announced its deal in August. It says it will first be available next year and will be rolled out across the fleet by 2027.\n\nAsiana Airlines is another subsidiary of Korean Air.\n\nThe two airlines merged in 2024, while the Asiana brand is set to be phased out by the end of next year.\n\n\"Following the integration with Asiana Airlines, the airline plans to complete fleetwide installation by the end of 2027,\" Korean said in its Starlink announcement.\n\nIt also said it will prioritize installation on its Boeing 777 and Airbus A350 jets.\n\nThe flag carrier of Austria is a subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nWhile Lufthansa said the rollout will start in the second half of 2026, it isn't clear exactly when Austrian jets will get Starlink.\n\nThe UK flag carrier is also part of IAG. BA said it would start rolling out Starlink next year and that it would be available free of charge to all its passengers.\n\nBelgium's national airline is another subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nLufthansa's rollout of Starlink will begin in late 2026.\n\nEdelweiss Air is a sister company to Swiss International Air Lines. Both are subsidiaries of Lufthansa.\n\nLike with other Lufthansa-owned airlines, Starlink will be free for all status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nDubai's airline is starting to roll out Starlink this month and plans to add it to all 232 in-service aircraft by mid-2027. It's also set to operate the first double-decker Airbus A380 with the service.\n\nEurowings is a German budget airline and another subsidiary of Lufthansa, which announced its deal with Starlink in January.\n\nStarlink will be free for all Lufthansa Group status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nThe Emirati budget airline also announced its Starlink deal during this month's Dubai Airshow. It only operates Boeing 737s and plans to install Starlink on 100 of them from next year.\n\nThe Spanish flag carrier is also part of IAG. The conglomerate said it would roll out Starlink across its fleets from 2026.\n\nItaly's flag carrier is part-owned by the country's government and the Lufthansa Group. The latter announced a deal with Starlink in January.\n\nThe Pope typically flies abroad on a chartered ITA Airways plane, with the airline dressing the seats in Vatican colors.\n\nBudget airline Jin Air, another subsidiary of Korean Air, will also get Starlink on its planes.\n\nIt will first install the high-speed WiFi on its Boeing 737-8 jets, the announcement said.\n\nJSX is a charter air carrier and was the first carrier to equip Starlink back in 2023. Its fleet is mostly made up of regional Embraer jets.\n\nKorean Air announced in December that it's adding Starlink, with service starting as early as the third quarter of 2026.\n\nIt said it will prioritize installation on its Boeing 777 and Airbus A350 jets, aiming for Starlink to be across the fleet by the end of 2027.\n\nLevel is a budget airline based in Barcelona and is part of IAG. The airline's parent company said it would roll out Starlink from 2026.\n\nLufthansa, Germany's flag carrier, announced in January that it would install Starlink across its fleet and those of its subsidiaries. Introduction is set to begin in the second half of 2026, with all planes equipped with Starlink by 2029.\n\nIt said access would be free for all status customers and Travel ID users.\n\nThe Lufthansa Group added that further details will be announced throughout the year.\n\nQatar Airways outpaced its regional rival, Emirates, by announcing Starlink back in May 2024. As of November, it operates the most wide-body aircraft with the service, numbering over 100. Starlink is installed on all Qatar's Boeing 777s and is being rolled out to its Airbus A350s.\n\nScandinavian Airlines, or SAS, is the flag carrier for Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. It announced Starlink in January and said the rollout would begin at the end of the year. Passengers would need to \n\nSwiss International Air Lines is one of the many subsidiaries of Lufthansa getting Starlink internet. It will be part of the rollout that starts in the second half of 2026.\n\nUnited Airlines was the second US airline to announce a Starlink deal, but the first of the Big Three. It has installed the service on over half of its regional planes, and is continuing to roll it out across its whole fleet. The airline says customers will get a notification before their flight if it is equipped with Starlink. Passengers need to \n\nVirgin Atlantic was the first UK airline to announce its deal with Starlink, which it did in July. Installation is planned to start in the second half of next year.

    "fullText": "The showdown between Elon Musk and Sam Altman is headed to court — and it's set to be a long one.\n\nOakland federal judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Tuesday set a new trial date for Musk's legal dispute with OpenAI — one week after saying the Tesla CEO had enough evidence for the case to be decided by a jury.\n\nJury selection is now scheduled to start on Monday, April 27. The trial will start the next day and could last four weeks, through May 22, the court docket showed. The trial had previously been scheduled for March 30.\n\nIt's the latest development in a clash of the tech titans that kicked off last year when Musk sued Altman over the ChatGPT maker's partnership with Microsoft and shift toward a for-profit model. Musk, a founder and early supporter of OpenAI, claims he contributed $38 million to OpenAI over the years under the premise that it would maintain its original altruistic, nonprofit roots.\n\nOpenAI has countered that Musk knew about its pivot toward a for-profit as early as 2018 and says its nonprofit arm still plays a central role in its governance. The company has blasted the lawsuit as baseless and has characterized it as part of a larger harassment campaign by Musk.\n\nLast week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers rejected arguments by Altman's lawyers to block the case from proceeding to trial, saying Musk had sufficient evidence to justify a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" the judge said at a hearing on January 7. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nHundreds of exhibits were unsealed in the case last week, including a 2023 text that revealed tension in the two tech titans' relationship before Musk filed his suit.\n\n\"I don't think openai would have happened without you — and it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai,\" Altman texted Musk in 2023.\n\nMusk responded: \"I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake.\"",

    "title": "Tesla's Cybertruck is falling far short of Elon Musk's ambitious sales targets",
    "description": "Sales of the Cybertruck were far below the 250,000 annual target Musk set before the electric pickup rolled off the production line in 2023.",
    "fullText": "The Cybertruck is running out of road.\n\nTesla sold 20,237 Cybertrucks in the US last year, according to data from Cox Automotive released on Tuesday, as demand for Elon Musk's \"apocalypse-proof\" pickup fizzled.\n\nThat's nearly half the number Tesla sold in 2024, and sales dropped 68% year-on-year in the final quarter of 2025.\n\nThe figures are a far cry from the target of 250,000 sales a year Musk set before the Cybertruck rolled off the production line in 2023.\n\nThe divisive electric truck amassed over 1 million reservations, but early models launched with a price tag of over $79,000, significantly higher than the nearly $40,000 sticker price Musk had floated in 2019.\n\nSince then, demand has been underwhelming — and collapsing sales have not been the only speed bump.\n\nThe Cybertruck has faced a series of quality issues, with 10 recalls since 2023.\n\nWhile some of those issues have been fixed with a simple software update, others have proved more problematic. Tesla has issued recalls for accelerator pedals that could get trapped at full throttle, an optional off-road light bar that may detach and fly off the truck, and the Cybertruck's comically large windshield wiper failing.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cybertruck's highly distinctive design, which caused Tesla significant production issues, has had the unintended effect of turning the angular EV into a target.\n\nMultiple Cybertruck owners told Business Insider last March that they had been hit by vandalism and verbal harassment amid the backlash over Tesla CEO Musk's federal cost-cutting at the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTesla has employed some creative strategies for turning around the Cybertruck's sales slump.\n\nBusiness Insider's Grace Kay reported in April that the EV giant was quietly rebranding the futuristic pickup as a working man's truck. And SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, has taken delivery of an unspecified number of Cybertrucks.\n\nUnlike Tesla's other vehicles, however, the Cybertruck is only available in a limited number of countries.\n\nTesla sells the pickup in Mexico and Canada, and recently started sales in Korea, but the Cybertruck's hulking stainless-steel body and sharp edges make it almost impossible to sell in Europe and China, two of the EV giant's largest markets.\n\nTesla also launched the Cybertruck in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar last year — three oil-rich nations where chargers are scarce, and EV sales are low.\n\nThe Cybertruck's woes mean it is unlikely to help Tesla turn around its global sales slump. Sales of all Tesla vehicles declined for the second consecutive year in 2025, with Chinese rival BYD surpassing it to become the world's biggest EV maker.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nMusk is not the only one to see ambitious plans for big electric pickups fall flat.\n\nFord sold just over 27,000 of its flagship F-150 Lightning electric truck in 2025 and last month announced that it would replace the EV with an extended-range hybrid offering 700 miles of range.\n\nOther automakers have also backed away from electric pickups as an \"EV winter\" has taken hold in the US following the end of the $7,500 tax credit.\n\nStellantis canceled plans to build an all-electric RAM truck in September, while Ford and GM have signalled they plan to build more gas-powered pickups as they rack up billions of dollars in charges over their EV strategy shifts.\n\nWhat the future holds for the Cybertruck is unclear. Tesla quietly removed the option to buy a cheaper, rear-wheel drive trim from its website after just five months in September, and there has been no word on mooted plans to build a smaller version of the truck, which still starts at around $80,000 in the US.\n\nPublicly, Musk doesn't seem bothered by the Cybertruck's low sales, regularly praising the stainless-steel truck on his X feed.\n\n\"Cybertruck is an incredible vehicle. Our best ever from Tesla,\" he wrote last month.",

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "description": "Musk said a \"supersonic tsunami\" of AI and robotics will bring about a world of zero scarcity.",
    "fullText": "Saving for retirement is pointless thanks to the impending “supersonic tsunami” of AI and robotics, which will bring about a world of zero scarcity, according to Elon Musk.\n\nWhile the Tesla and SpaceX CEO admitted he’s “more optimistic” than most, he insisted people shouldn’t stress over building a nest egg for the distant future, contrary to the staid advice of nearly all other financial professionals.\n\n“Don’t worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,” said the world’s richest man on the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast last week. “It won’t matter.”\n\nPart of Musk’s controversial take lies in his vision of a world transformed by rapidly improving AI, robotics, and energy technology.\n\n“Anything short of shaping atoms, AI can do probably half or more of those jobs right now,” he said.\n\nThe advances could lead to such big productivity increases, he said, that they will surpass “what people possibly could think of as abundance.”\n\nRather than a universal income, everyone will enjoy a “universal ‘you can have whatever you want’ income” in the future, he claimed. In this world, the link between individual wages, savings, and living standards no longer makes sense.\n\nEven without savings, AI will help people obtain better medical care than currently available within five years, as well as remove any limit on the availability of goods, services, or educational opportunities.\n\n​Musk’s comments build on his earlier claims that AI and humanoid robots will make work “optional” within 10 to 20 years and render money itself irrelevant. Musk previously compared the future of work to leisure activities like playing sports or video games rather than a survival necessity.\n\n“If you want to work, [it’s] the same way you can go to the store and just buy some vegetables, or you can grow vegetables in your backyard. It’s much harder to grow vegetables in your backyard, and some people still do it because they like growing vegetables,” Musk said during the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in November.\n\n​To be sure, Musk’s predictions about the future come at a time where many Americans are struggling to save. In part due to persistent inflation and weak wage growth, only 55% of American adults said they had a “rainy day” fund of three months expenses saved up for an emergency, down from a high of 59% in 2021, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve. Fewer than half of those surveyed said they could cover an expense of $2,000 or more with their savings.",

    "description": "Elon Musk is staring down several self-imposed deadlines this year, from Cybercab volume production to a much-hyped Roadster demo.",
    "fullText": "It's a critical year for Tesla. Elon Musk says so.\n\nIn earnings calls, podcast interviews, and a steady stream of posts on X, the outspoken CEO has spent the past year teasing a wave of new hardware and software that he says will define Tesla's future.\n\n\"2026 will be something special,\" Musk posted on X on January 1.\n\nTesla's promises for the year fall into four major bets: self-driving software for consumer cars, a fully autonomous robotaxi service, humanoid robots, and showing off at least one long-delayed new vehicle.\n\nAnalysts say the company's future increasingly hinges on just one thing — whether its AI-powered autonomy can work at scale.\n\n\"I think 2026 is going to be the prove-it year for Tesla's robotaxi business,\" Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar who closely watches Tesla, told Business Insider. \"That's ultimately going to be the major driver for Tesla this year.\"\n\nLast June, Tesla Model Ys and Model 3s started carting passengers around Austin, Texas with no humans behind the steering wheel. Instead, the company launched with so-called \"safety drivers\" in the front passenger seat to intervene if needed.\n\nGoldstein said he's watching closely to see where regulators allow Tesla's self-driving vehicles to operate — and whether the company becomes confident enough in its technology to remove safety drivers from the front seats entirely.\n\nRight now, the robotaxis are driving in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta.\n\nDuring the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said Tesla's purpose-built autonomous vehicle, known as the Cybercab, would begin volume production in April. The two-passenger vehicle is designed without a steering wheel or brake pedal.\n\n\"That's really a vehicle that's optimized for full autonomy,\" he said on the call. \"I think the demand will be pretty nutty.\"\n\nTesla has also claimed a significant lead over competitors in consumer self-driving data. During the same earnings call, Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of Autopilot and AI software, said customers had driven more than six billion miles using Full Self-Driving in supervised mode.\n\n\"That's a big milestone,\" Elluswamy said. \"Overall, the safety continues to be very good.\"\n\nThose claims come as both legacy automakers and tech companies push deeper into autonomous driving. This week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nvidia unveiled its new self-driving car platform. Rivian said its $45,000 R2 SUV, launching in early 2026, will include self-driving capabilities. Ford plans to roll out advanced autonomous tech on its 2027 electric pickup, while General Motors is offering point-to-point hands-free driving in its high-end Cadillac Escalade IQ.\n\nMusk has dismissed the competition. In a post on X, he said Tesla was five years ahead of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — in self-driving technology.\n\nTesla is also preparing to reintroduce the second-generation Roadster, a two-door electric sports car first unveiled more than 8 years ago that has been repeatedly delayed. The vehicle is now slated for another unveiling on April Fool's Day.\n\nIn November, Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan that if Peter Thiel wanted a future with flying cars, he should get it. Musk has said the new Roadster is a collaboration with SpaceX and will include rocket technology.\n\n\"It's going to be the most memorable product unveil ever,\" he said, before telling the notorious podcaster that he set the unveil date for April Fools for \"deniability.\"\n\nThe Semi, an electric eighteen-wheeler, is also expected to roll out of Tesla's Nevada factory in the first half of 2026.\n\nEarly production models traversed California's highways with Pepsi and Walmart products in pilot tests.\n\nThen there's Optimus — a major bet for Tesla and one that Musk has said will be \"the biggest product ever.\"\n\nMusk has said the humanoid robots will eventually handle general-purpose tasks like folding laundry, tightening screws, or stirring a pot of pasta.\n\nBut manufacturing Optimus has proved challenging. Musk has said designing its hands, for example, is \"an incredibly difficult engineering challenge.\"\n\nIn a 2024 post on X, he claimed Tesla was aiming for \"high production for other companies\" by 2026, suggesting the robots could one day be manufactured at scale for outside customers.\n\nMusk's recent track record for deadlines has given some investors reason to be cautious of the CEO's projections for the coming year.\n\nMusk is a self-proclaimed optimist when it comes to deadlines and goals, but he does have a history of delivering much of what he promises — eventually.\n\n\"Elon is a visionary,\" Goldstein told Business Insider. \"He's figured out a lot of very difficult problems in the past when other people couldn't — making profitable EVs and reusable rockets — he deserves a lot of credit.\"\n\nBut Goldstein said Tesla's path to automotive dominance is narrowing. As the company has focused heavily on autonomy, other automakers have improved vehicle hardware quickly enough to challenge Tesla's advantage.\n\nThat's particularly true in China, he said.\n\n\"BYD has surpassed Tesla and then gone after a lower price point in key markets in China and Europe,\" he said.\n\nTesla has reported two consecutive years of sales declines, Goldstein added, and \"it's looking like 2026 could be a third.\" Meanwhile, many US automakers are pulling back from EVs and car-buyers can no longer enjoy the $7,500 EV incentive.\n\n\"2026 is going to be a bit of a challenge for Tesla as the EV scene has since dramatically changed, especially with last year's disappearance of any helpful federal tax credits,\" Robby DeGraff, a product and consumer insights manager at AutoPacific, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Subtle, slight refreshes of the Model Y and Model 3 plus reveals of the Cybercab and other innovations like the humanoid robots were newsworthy sure, but the reality is Tesla's lineup is stale and lagging behind much of the competition in terms of design, performance, and features,\" he added.\n\nDespite those risks, many investors remain sold on Musk's vision.\n\nIn mid-December, Tesla shares hit a record high of more than $481. The stock is up about 12% over the last year, including a roughly 50% surge in the past six months.\n\n\"I think the most important thing for Tesla to do right now, especially as we see the EV market slow a bit, is ready and ensure there's a proper entry-level, affordable EV out there for consumers,\" DeGraff added.\n\nDeGraff said the new \"Standard\" versions of the Model 3 and Model Y are \"a good step\" but \"there's more work to be done to bring that pricing down, which still remains a major deterrent for uncertain EV shoppers.\"",

    "description": "Health care experts are worried about Grok’s potential to breach patient privacy.",
    "fullText": "In Elon Musk’s world, AI is the new MD. The X owner is encouraging users to upload their medical test results—such as CT and bone scans—to the platform so that Grok, X’s artificial intelligence chatbot, can learn how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nHe’s previously said this information will be used to train X’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok on how to interpret them efficiently.\n\nEarlier this month, Elon Musk reposted a video on X of himself talking about uploading medical data to Grok, saying: “Try it!”\n\n“You can upload your X-rays or MRI images to Grok and it will give you a medical diagnosis,” Musk said in the video, which was uploaded in June. “I have seen cases where it’s actually better than what doctors tell you.\n\nIn 2024, Musk said medical images uploaded to Grok would be used to train the bot.\n\n“This is still early stage, but it is already quite accurate and will become extremely good,” Musk wrote on X. “Let us know where Grok gets it right or needs work.”\n\nMusk also claimed in his response Grok saved a man in Norway by diagnosing a problem his doctors failed to notice. The X owner was willing to upload his own medical information to his bot.\n\n“I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,” Musk said in an episode of the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast released on Tuesday. “None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.”\n\nMusk did not disclose in the podcast why he received an MRI. XAI, which owns X, told Fortune in a statement: “Legacy Media Lies.”\n\nGrok is facing some competition in the AI health space. This week OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, an experience within the bot feature that allows users to securely connect medical records and wellness apps like MyFitnessPal and Apple Health. The company said it would not train the models using personal medical information.\n\nAI chatbots have become a ubiquitous source of medical information for people. OpenAI reported this week 40 million people seek health information from the model, 55% of which used to bot to look up or better understand symptoms.\n\nSo far, Grok’s ability to detect medical abnormalities have been mixed. The AI successfully analyzed blood test results and identified breast cancer, some users claimed. But it also grossly misinterpreted other pieces of information, according to physicians who responded to some of Musk’s about Grok’s ability to interpret medical information. In one instance, Grok mistook a “textbook case” of tuberculosis for a herniated disk or spinal stenosis. In another, the bot mistook a mammogram of a benign breast cyst for an image of testicles.\n\nA May 2025 study found that while all AI models have limitations in processing and predicting medical outcomes, Grok was the most effectively compared to Google’s Gemini and ChatGPT-4o when determining the presence of pathologies in 35,711 slices of brain MRI.\n\n“We know they have the technical capability,” Dr. Laura Heacock, associate professor at the New York University Langone Health Department of Radiology, wrote on X. “Whether or not they want to put in the time, data and [graphics processing units] to include medical imaging is up to them. For now, non-generative AI methods continue to outperform in medical imaging.”\n\nMusk’s lofty goal of training his AI to make medical diagnoses is also a risky one, experts said. While AI has increasingly been used as a means to make complicated science more accessible and create assistive technologies, teaching Grok to use data from a social media platform presents concerns about both Grok’s accuracy and user privacy.\n\nRyan Tarzy, CEO of health technology firm Avandra Imaging, said in an interview with Fast Company asking users to directly input data, rather than source it from secure databases with de-identified patient data, is Musk’s way of trying to accelerate Grok’s development. Also, the information comes from a limited sample of whoever is willing to upload their images and tests—meaning the AI is not gathering data from sources representative of the broader and more diverse medical landscape.\n\nMedical information shared on social media isn’t bound by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the federal law that protects patients’ private information from being shared without their consent. That means there’s less control over where the information goes after a user chooses to share it.\n\n“This approach has myriad risks, including the accidental sharing of patient identities,” Tarzy said. “Personal health information is ‘burned in’ too many images, such as CT scans, and would inevitably be released in this plan.”\n\nThe privacy dangers Grok may present aren’t fully known because X may have privacy protections not known by the public, according to Matthew McCoy, assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He said users share medical information at their own risk.\n\n“As an individual user, would I feel comfortable contributing health data?” he previously told the New York Times. “Absolutely not.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on Nov. 20, 2024.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Health in a push to become a hub for personal health data\n\nOpenAI suggests ChatGPT play doctor as millions of Americans face spiking insurance costs: ‘In the U.S., ChatGPT has become an important ally’\n\nAs Utah gives the AI power to prescribe some drugs, physicians warn of patient risks\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Around 3,500 pieces of content were blocked, and over 600 accounts were deleted. Going forward, X will not allow obscene imagery,\" government sources told news agency ANI.Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action ReportThe Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) had raised concerns over obscene and harmful content allegedly generated by Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok. The ministry sent a letter to X (formerly Twitter), the social media website owned by Elon Musk, pointing out failures in moderating AI-generated content on its platform. The ministry highlighted concerns that the Grok and other services of xAI have been used to generate and distribute obscene or non-consensual images, particularly targeting the dignity and privacy of women. Through the letter, the government has also sought a report on the actions taken by the company, and the immediate removal of illegal materials.ALSO READ | AI tool to 'undress women': Grok under fire for generating non-consensual sexualised images; Musk pokes funNow, X has submitted a reply to the ministry, however, the officials described it as ‘not adequate’, saying the response by the social media platform lacked specific actions taken and preventive steps implemented.Earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi had written to IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, urging the government to urgently step in over what she described as a disturbing rise in the misuse of AI tools to sexualise women on social media, particularly on X.In her letter, Priyanka Chaturvedi called for strict “guardrails” on AI chatbots such as Grok, saying social media platforms must be made “a safe space for women”. She also underlined the need for better education of men from an early age to prevent such behaviour.“Have sought urgent attention and intervention of the IT Minister to take the issue of increasing incidents of AI apps being prompted to sexualise and undress women by unauthorised use of their images on social media,” Chaturvedi said in a post on X.In the letter shared publicly, the Shiv Sena (UBT) leader flagged what she called an emerging trend on X, where men operating fake accounts allegedly upload photos of women and use AI prompts to minimise their clothing or sexualise them.“It is not just limited to sharing photos through fake accounts but are also targeting women who post their own photos,” she wrote.Calling the practice an “unacceptable and gross misuse of an AI function,” Chaturvedi also criticised Grok for “enabling this behaviour by adhering to such requests”.She described such acts as a “breach of women's right to privacy” and termed them “criminal”, adding that similar instances were “going absolutely unchecked” across other platforms as well.ALSO READ | Elon Musk's Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users after Deepfakes go viral across the world",

    "fullText": "Elizabeth Lopatto, writing at The Verge, “Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai Are Cowards”:\n\nSince X’s users started using Grok to undress women and\nchildren using deepfake images, I have been waiting for\nwhat I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s\nand Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet\ntells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim\nCook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of\nElon Musk.\n\nLopatto’s outrage and righteous anger are justified, but I think mostly misdirected. Apple and Google — and thus, Cook and Pichai, as the men who sit behind the desks where the buck stops at both companies — are culpable. But this is ultimately not about them, and not about Musk. It’s Trump, as president, they fear. Not Musk. And they are correct to fear Trump.\n\nYear one of Trump 2.0 has crystallized what had become — after decades of deliberate restraint after World War II, and even more so after the end of the Cold War — overlooked. The Presidency of the United States bestows upon its officeholder enormous, unparalleled, power. No one was afraid of Trump after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. The man was convicted of 34 felonies in a cold New York City courtroom in May 2024, a mere 19 months ago. Trump expected and asked for riots outside the courtroom. He got nothing but pathetic support from a handful of kooks. A year earlier, he lost a humiliating sexual assault civil lawsuit to E. Jean Carroll. Trump, just a year and a half ago, was a buffoon getting his mug shot taken. Today he’s arguing that his power is unchecked by anything other than his own sense of morality.\n\nNo other president has ever abused (or, if you support him, wielded) the powers of the office like Trump has. The power and influence of Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, CEOs of two of the top five companies in the world, isn’t merely superseded by Trump’s power and influence as president. Their power and influence are dwarfed by Trump’s. Any credible argument about how they should act must acknowledge that profound imbalance.\n\nI never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever\nagain. The next time Tim Cook says “privacy is a human\nright,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face.\nI mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has\ncreated an undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good,\nthe mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How do you plan\nto defend getting rid of the ICEBlock app while allowing X\nto generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and\nGoogle even identify their values beyond their commitment to\n“shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?\n\nThe profound power imbalance here is frustrating. But also terrifying. It’s folly to think these CEOs should steer their companies into direct confrontation with Trump. It would do no ultimate good for Apple or Google to burn themselves to the ground in protest. These men aren’t beholden to shareholders, per se. They’re doing their duty to institutions they’ve devoted their lives to. Companies that are worth preserving and protecting. Perhaps not in your estimation, but certainly from theirs.\n\nBut abject obsequiousness — which more and more seems the path Cook and Pichai are choosing — is no more justifiable a response than corporate suicide. The situation is not binary: acquiescence or war. There is a broad middle ground, founded on principle.\n\nDisney’s response to the Jimmy Kimmel controversy a few months ago shows the way. Defend the company’s principles while simultaneously defending the company from Trump’s demented wrath. You can take the position of “Fuck you, make me” without ever saying those words. Objection is not confrontation. Do the right thing and enforce the App Store and Play Store guidelines, and remove X and Grok from the stores. Make Musk object. Make the Trump administration object. Make them defend the indefensible — in public. Make clear why the apps were removed from the app stores and force Musk — and Trump, if he chooses — to argue that those things are A-OK by them. In court.\n\nThe judicious path for Apple and Google (and every other U.S. company) may well be to obey the law, even when the law is being actively corrupted. But the correct path is not to obey in advance. Stand behind the law while the law still exists on your side. Disney resisted Trump’s preposterous demand that they fire Jimmy Kimmel without lasting controversy, simply by standing firm in their conviction. Apple and Google could certainly do the same regarding apps that are being used to generate CSAM and deepfake harassment, regardless if the apps are part of the private fiefdom of Trump’s ally Elon Musk. It’s wise for Cook and Pichai to pick their battles. This one, I think, is worth picking. This is a moment when the App Store and Play Store can stand firmly on the side of longstanding and correct societal norms.",

    "fullText": "Ministers warn platform could be blocked after Grok AI used to create sexual images without consent\n\nElon Musk has accused the UK government of wanting to suppress free speech after ministers threatened fines and a possible ban for his social media site X after its AI tool, Grok, was used to make sexual images of women and children without their consent.\n\nThe billionaire claimed Grok was the most downloaded app on the UK App Store on Friday night after ministers threatened to take action unless the function to create sexually harassing images was removed.\n\nResponding to threats of a ban from the government, Musk wrote: “They just want to suppress free speech”.\n\nThousands of women have faced abuse from users of the AI tool which was first used to digitally strip fully clothed photographs into images showing them wearing micro bikinis, and then used for extreme image manipulation.\n\nPictures of teenage girls and children were altered to show them wearing swimwear, leading experts to say some of the content could be categorised as child sexual abuse material.\n\nSome users began to demand to see bruising on the bodies of the women, and for blood to be added to the images. Women were shown tied up, gagged and shot.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, said on Friday that ministers were looking seriously at the possibility of access to X being barred in the UK.\n\nShe said she expected Ofcom, which said this week that it was seeking urgent answers from the platform, to announce action within “days not weeks”.\n\n“X needs to get a grip and get this material down,” she said. “And I would remind them that in the Online Safety Act, there are backstop powers to block access to services if they refuse to comply with the law for people in the UK. And if Ofcom decides to use those powers, they would have the full backing of the government.”\n\nThe UK government’s concerns were echoed by the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Speaking in Canberra on Saturday, Albanese said that “global citizens deserve better”. Australia recently banned the use of social media for under-16s.\n\n“The use of generative artificial intelligence to exploit or sexualise people without their consent is abhorrent,” he said.\n\n“The fact that this tool was used so that people were using its image creation function through Grok is just completely abhorrent. It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility.”\n\nSome rightwing political figures have tried to frame this as a free speech issue. Responding to the news X faced a potential ban, the former prime minister Liz Truss said: “Starmer is really losing it now.”\n\nX partially restricted access to Grok on Friday. Its public account lost the ability to generate images at the request of free users, leaving the function available only to paid subscribers. It also appeared to have stopped creating bikini images.\n\nThe Grok app, however, which does not generate images publicly, is still able to create sexually explicit material from women’s pictures.\n\nOther nudificiation apps are still available. The Labour MP Jess Asato, who campaigns against the sexual abuse and harassment of women, said legislation to ban such apps was urgently needed.\n\nShe posted on social media: “It’s not just XAi. This nudification tool was advertised yesterday on @YouTube.\n\n“No rules had been broken @Google said on reporting.\n\n“Our nudification legislation needs to be expedited.”\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says saving for retirement will be \"irrelevant\" if he's right about what the future holds.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO predicted AI would help create an \"abundance\" of resources for all.\n\nPeople would have \"whatever stuff they want\" and access to superb healthcare and education, he said.\n\nSaving for retirement has been a cornerstone of personal finance for well over a century. It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said. That would mean \"better medical care than anyone has today, available for everyone within five years,\" he continued. \"No scarcity of goods and services. You can learn anything you want about anything for free.\"\n\nHowever, the serial entrepreneur warned of a \"bumpy\" transition to this utopian world, marked by jarring change and social unrest. He also flagged a potential loss of purpose.\n\n\"Now, if you actually get all the stuff you want, is that actually the future you want?\" he asked. '\"Because it means that your job won't matter.\"\n\nMusk is known for transforming the auto sector with Tesla's electric vehicles, and revolutionizing the aerospace industry with SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nHis companies are developing self-driving cars, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces, AI assistants, and other innovations as he paves his way to becoming the first trillionaire in history.\n\nDespite his track record, Musk's latest prediction clashes hard with the reality faced by many Americans. Years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and anemic wage growth have created an affordability crisis.\n\nMillions of people feel priced out of getting a college degree, accessing quality healthcare, owning a home, or having children. A comfortable retirement also feels out of reach, with surveys showing the majority of Americans aren't saving nearly enough.",

    "description": "Text messages, emails, and journal entries were part of a trove of documents unsealed in the legal battle between Elon Musk and Sam Altman.",
    "fullText": "More than 100 documents detailing texts, emails, and even diary entries from some of the world's most powerful tech executives were unsealed on Tuesday as part of Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman.\n\nThe documents provide a rare window into the inner workings of Silicon Valley — from late-night texts to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to debates between Altman and Musk about OpenAI's future. The documents also include previously unreleased writing from Nadella, as well as several entries from the personal diary of OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman.\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in 2024, Musk alleges that OpenAI executives misled him when they decided to move the company away from its original nonprofit mission and pursue a profit-oriented structure. Musk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit organization.\n\nOpenAI has denied the allegations and said the billionaire was aware of the company's plans to shift to a for-profit structure.\n\n\"Mr. Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best-resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a California federal judge said there was sufficient evidence for a jury to consider Musk's claim. The two tech execs are now set to face off in court in March, though they could still settle before that.\n\nBusiness Insider reviewed hundreds of pages of newly unsealed documents. Take a look at some of the most interesting details we've found:\n\nThe court documents included snippets from OpenAI cofounder Brockman's diary.\n\nBrockman mused about being \"free\" and owning his \"destiny\" and \"Financially what will take me to $1B?\"\n\nBrockman said during a deposition last year that his \"primary motivation was to the mission,\" and the \"financial reward\" was a secondary consideration.\n\nIn the diary, Brockman broke down the pros and cons of parting ways with Musk. \"Some chance that rejecting Elon will actually lose us Sam. We'll find out tomorrow if doing an override all the way through is palettable,\" the diary read. \"This is the only chance we have to get out from Elon. Is he the 'glorious leader' that I would pick?\"\n\nIn a separate entry, Brockman debated how OpenAI would move forward and turn a profit. \"It all comes down to the money. We can get it from Tesla, probably. We could also probably get it from Google,\" he wrote.\n\nDuring a September deposition, Jared Birchall, who runs Musk's family office and has roles across several of his businesses, was asked about his job at Neuralink.\n\nBirchall said he was only operating as \"the named CFO\" because the brain chip company had recently hired a new head of finance, to whom they had yet to transfer the title.\n\nAccording to a review of LinkedIn profiles, William Sawyer became Neuralink's head of finance in August.\n\nSawyer declined to comment when reached by Business Insider.\n\nMicrosoft's CEO said in a 2025 deposition that his financial advisor had invested some of his money in Neuralink.\n\nNadella said he hadn't talked to Musk about it.\n\nAt another point in the deposition, Nadella described his feelings toward Musk.\n\n\"I mean, Elon is a pretty idiosyncratic guy in the sense he has a lot of opinions on lots of things, but what I have found to be most inspiring is how he goes about building what he does,\" Nadella said.\n\nAccording to a document dated July 10, 2023, Nadella was working on a book called \"An Inflection Point: Mission, transformation, and the dawn of next generation AI.\"\n\nThe document included sample chapters and was co-written by Harvard business professor Marco Iansiti.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft said the company has been working with Iansiti and Keystone Research over the years, and didn't end up publishing the book.\n\nMusk emailed Jensen Huang in 2016, asking for one of the company's first supercomputers.\n\n\"Can OpenAI buy one of the early units? The team was asking me about this earlier today,\" Musk wrote.\n\n\"I've not forgotten,\" Huang responded. \"I will make sure OpenAI gets one of the first ones.\"\n\n\"OpenAI is on a path of certain failure relative to Google,\" Musk wrote in a January 2018 email to Altman.\n\n\"There obviously needs to be immediate and dramatic action or everyone except for Google will be consigned to irrelevance,\" he said.\n\nMusk left OpenAI's board in February 2018. At the time, he cited a potential conflict of interest with Tesla and its AI work.\n\n\"To be clear, I have a lot of respect for your abilities and accomplishments, but I am not happy with how things have been managed,\" Musk wrote in the 2018 email. \"Either we fix things and my engagement increases a lot or we don't and I will drop to near zero and publicly reduce my association. I will not be in a situation where the perception of my influence and time doesn't match the reality.\"\n\n\"What happened to Amazon?\" Musk wrote in an August 2016 email to Altman about OpenAI's efforts to negotiate funding from an outside tech company.\n\n\"I think Jeff is a bit of a tool and Satya is not, so I slightly prefer Microsoft, but I hate their marketing dept,\" Musk wrote.\n\nIn response, Altman said Amazon \"started really dicking us around.\"\n\nOpenAI announced a deal with Microsoft in July 2019.\n\nMicrosoft offered Altman a role after the OpenAI CEO was ousted by the company's board in November 2023. Altman's departure spawned an open letter that was signed by hundreds of OpenAI employees who threatened to leave if Altman was not brought back as CEO.\n\n\"Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join,\" a portion of the letter read.\n\nMira Murati, OpenAI's then-CTO, signed the open letter. She addressed Microsoft's support in a text to Nadella.\n\n\"Hi Satya, I know it's super late. Need to call you urgently,\" said the text, which asked Nadella to confirm whether Microsoft planned to offer roles to OpenAI staff.\n\n\"Thx. So sorry. But that is right,\" Nadella responded the following morning.\n\n\"Satya could you please make a public statement soon that shows support for the joint openai team, basically bringing the team together?\" Murati responded. It's very important that we don't lose researchers to Demis or Elon. The technical team is being dragged in so many recruiting directions and a unified front would help immensely.\"\n\n\"i remember seeing you in a tv interview a long time ago (maybe 60 minutes?) where you being attacked by some guys, and you said they were heroes of yours and it was really tough,\" Altman texted Musk in February 2023. \"well, you're my hero and that's what it feels like when you attack OpenAI.\"\n\nAltman also wrote that \"it really fucking hurts when you publicly attack openai.\"\n\n\"I hear you and it is certainly not my intention to be hurtful, for which I apologize, but the fate of civilization is at stake,\" Musk responded.\n\nDo you work for OpenAI or have a tip?

    "description": "Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk described a future where technology creates an abundance of resources so \"anyone can have whatever stuff they want.\"",
    "fullText": "Saving for retirement has been a cornerstone of personal finance for well over a century. It could become pointless soon, Elon Musk says.\n\n\"One side recommendation I have is: Don't worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the latest episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast. \"It won't matter.\"\n\n\"If any of the things that we've said are true, saving for retirement will be irrelevant,\" Musk added.\n\nThe world's richest man, whose net worth exceeds $600 billion, described a future where advances in AI, energy, and robotics supercharge productivity, creating an \"abundance\" of resources that would allow everyone to be granted a \"universal high income.\"\n\nThe \"good future is anyone can have whatever stuff they want,\" Musk said. That would mean \"better medical care than anyone has today, available for everyone within five years,\" he continued. \"No scarcity of goods and services. You can learn anything you want about anything for free.\"\n\nHowever, the serial entrepreneur warned of a \"bumpy\" transition to this utopian world, marked by jarring change and social unrest. He also flagged a potential loss of purpose.\n\n\"Now, if you actually get all the stuff you want, is that actually the future you want?\" he asked. '\"Because it means that your job won't matter.\"\n\nMusk is known for transforming the auto sector with Tesla's electric vehicles, and revolutionizing the aerospace industry with SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nHis companies are developing self-driving cars, humanoid robots, brain-computer interfaces, AI assistants, and other innovations as he paves his way to becoming the first trillionaire in history.\n\nDespite his track record, Musk's latest prediction clashes hard with the reality faced by many Americans. Years of stubborn inflation, elevated interest rates, and anemic wage growth have created an affordability crisis.\n\nMillions of people feel priced out of getting a college degree, accessing quality healthcare, owning a home, or having children. A comfortable retirement also feels out of reach, with surveys showing the majority of Americans aren't saving nearly enough.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Musk's blue-sky vision of an abundant future may seem like wishful thinking — or even dangerous advice if it leads people to stop saving, but the world doesn't change as he expects, leaving them short in retirement.",

    "description": "Elon Musk said the solution to longevity \"is an extremely solvable problem.\"",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk said Grok gave him a clean bill of health.\n\nMusk told podcaster Peter Diamandis that he recently underwent an MRI. Afterward, the xAI CEO said he followed his own advice by uploading the results of a medical test to his company's AI chatbot.\n\n\"I did an MRI recently and submitted it to Grok,\" Musk said during a wide-ranging interview with Diamandis on \"Moonshots\" posted on Tuesday. \"None of the doctors nor Grok found anything.\"\n\nIt's unclear why Musk underwent an MRI. His discussion with Diamandis, the founder of the XPrize and a Harvard-educated doctor, underscores the ongoing discussion about longevity that surrounds much of the discussion of AI's future development.\n\nAcross Silicon Valley, tech billionaires like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Peter Thiel are funding millions in research to combat aging and extend humanity's lifespan. In 2024, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei wrote that AI could double life expectancy by 2030.\n\nLast week, Musk encouraged people to try uploading their results to Grok. He said that a Norwegian man posted on Reddit that Grok saved his life after the chatbot encouraged him to return to the hospital to get a CT scan, which confirmed that doctors had missed that his appendix was close to rupturing.\n\n\"Try it!\" Musk wrote on X, quote-tweeting remarks from a February 2025 appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nAt the time, Musk told Rogan that AI would be \"very good\" at helping with medical diagnoses.\n\nMusk said true immortality or close to it would be \"one of the worst curses you could possibly give anyone.\" That being said, the billionaire thinks it should be possible to crack the secret to staving off aging.\n\n\"I've long thought that longevity or semi-mortality is an extremely solvable problem,\" Musk said. \"I don't think it's a particularly hard problem. I mean, when you consider the fact that your body is extremely synchronized in its age, the clock must be incredibly obvious.\"\n\nDiamandis pitched Musk on working with Fountain Life, a longevity company that Diamandis cofounded with Tony Robbins and William Kapp. Depending on the membership tier, Fountain Life offers access to \"AI-guided diagnostics\" that test for biomarkers. The first goal of this branch of medicine, Kapp told TechCrunch last year, is \"don't die of anything stupid.\"\n\n\"We do a 200 gigabyte upload of you, everything knowable about you, full genome, all imaging, everything,\" Diamandis said, adding he did not want Musk \"to pull a Steve Jobs.\"\n\nApple's visionary leader died in 2011 of pancreatic cancer. Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that he regretted waiting to undergo surgery to address the cancer.",

    "fullText": "Sample of roughly 500 posts shows how frequently people are creating sexualized images with Elon Musk’s AI chatbot\n\nNew research that samples X users prompting Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok demonstrates how frequently people are creating sexualized images with it. Nearly three-quarters of posts collected and analyzed by a PhD researcher at Dublin’s Trinity College were requests for nonconsensual images of real women or minors with items of clothing removed or added.\n\nThe posts offer a new level of detail on how the images are generated and shared on X, with users coaching one another on prompts; suggesting iterations on Grok’s presentations of women in lingerie or swimsuits, or with areas of their body covered in semen; and asking Grok to remove outer clothing in replies to posts containing self-portraits by female users.\n\nAmong hundreds of posts identified by Nana Nwachukwu as direct, nonconsensual requests for Grok to remove or replace clothing, dozens reviewed by the Guardian show users posting pictures of women including celebrities, models, stock photos and women who are not public figures posing in snapshots.\n\nSeveral posts in the trove reviewed by the Guardian have received tens of thousands of impressions and come from premium, “blue check” accounts, including accounts with tens of thousands of followers. Premium accounts with more than 500 followers and 5m impressions over three months are eligible for revenue-sharing under X’s eligibility rules.\n\nIn one Christmas Day post, an account with more than 93,000 followers presented side-by-side images of an unknown woman’s backside with the caption: “Told Grok to make her butt even bigger and switch leopard print to USA print. 2nd pic I just told it to add cum on her ass lmao.”\n\nA 3 January post, representative of dozens reviewed by the Guardian, captioned an apparent holiday snap of an unknown woman: “@grok replace give her a dental floss bikini.” Within two minutes, Grok provided a photorealistic image that satisfied the request. Other posts in the trove show more sophisticated employment of JSON-prompt engineering to induce Grok to generate novel sexualized images of fictitious women.\n\nThe data does not cover all such requests made to Grok. While content analysis firm Copyleaks reported on 31 December that X users were generating “roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute”, Nwachukwu said that her sample is limited to just more than 500 posts she was able to collect with X’s API via a developer account. She said that the true scale “could be thousands, it could be hundreds of thousands” but that changes made by Musk to the API mean that “it is much harder to see what is happening” on the platform. On Wednesday, Bloomberg News cited researchers who found that Grok users were generating up to 6,700 undressed images per hour.\n\nNwachukwu, an expert on AI governance and a longtime observer of and participant in social media safety initiatives, said that she first noticed requests along these lines from X users back in 2023.\n\nAt the time, she said, “Grok did not oblige the requests. It wasn’t really good at doing those things.” The bot’s responses began changing in 2024, and reached a critical mass late last year.\n\nIn October 2025, she noticed that “people were putting Halloween attire on themselves using Grok. Of course, a section of users realized we can also ask it to change what other people are wearing.” By year’s end, “there was a huge uptick in people asking Grok to put different people in bikinis or other types of suggestive clothing”.\n\nThere were other indications last year of an increased willingness to tolerate or even encourage the generation of sexually suggestive material with Grok.\n\nIn August, xAI incorporated a “spicy mode” setting in the mobile version of Grok’s text-to-video generation tool, leading the Verge to characterize it as “a service designed specifically to make suggestive videos”.\n\nNwachukwu’s data is just the latest indication of how the platform under Musk has become a magnet for forms of content that other platforms work to exclude, including hate speech, gore content and copyrighted material.\n\nOn Friday, Grok issued a bizarre public apology over the incident on X, claiming that “xAI is implementing stronger safeguards to prevent this”. On Tuesday, X Safety posted a promise to ban users who shared child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Musk himself said: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”\n\nNwachukwu said, however, that posts like those she has already collected are still appearing on the platform. Musk is giving “the middle finger to everyone who has asked for the platform to be moderated”, she said. The billionaire slashed Twitter’s trust and safety teams when he took over in 2022.\n\nShe added that other AI chatbots do not have the same issues.\n\n“Other generative AI platforms – ChatGPT or Gemini – they have safeguards,” she said. “If you ask them to generate something that looks like a person, it would never be a depiction of that person. They don’t generate depictions of real human beings.”\n\nThe revelations about the nonconsensual imagery on X has already drawn the attention of regulators in the UK, Europe, India, and Australia.\n\nNwachukwu, who is from Nigeria, pointed to a specific harm being done in the posts to “women from conservative societies”.\n\n“There’s a lot of targeting of people from conservative beliefs, conservative societies: west Africa, south Asia. This represents a different kind of harm for them,” she said.",

    "fullText": "Judge says there is plenty of evidence to suggest OpenAI’s leaders made assurances nonprofit structure would be kept\n\nElon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI is to go to trial after a US judge said there is plenty of evidence to support the billionaire’s case.\n\nThe world’s richest man, who co-founded OpenAI, is suing the ChatGPT developer and its chief executive, Sam Altman, over claims its leaders violated the organisation’s founding mission by shifting to a for-profit model.\n\nThe US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, told a hearing there was plenty of evidence that suggested OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure was going to be maintained.\n\nShe said there were enough disputed facts to let a jury consider the claims at a trial scheduled for March, rather than decide the issues herself. Rogers said she would issue a written order after the hearing that addresses OpenAI’s attempt to throw out the case.\n\nThe court dispute comes amid a broader showdown over dominance in the market for generative artificial intelligence. Musk’s xAI and its chatbot Grok are competing with OpenAI and other technology developers.\n\nMusk is seeking unspecified monetary damages from what he calls “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI.\n\nIn a statement after the hearing, OpenAI said: “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.”\n\nMusk’s startup xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSteven Molo, a lead trial attorney for the billionaire and xAI, said after the hearing: “We look forward to presenting all the evidence of the defendants’ wrongdoing to the jury.”\n\nMusk contends he contributed about $38m (£28m), roughly 60% of OpenAI’s early funding, along with strategic guidance and credibility, based on assurances that the organisation would remain a nonprofit dedicated to the public benefit.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman of plotting a for-profit switch to enrich themselves, culminating in multibillion-dollar deals with Microsoft and a recent restructuring.\n\nOpenAI, Altman and Brockman have denied the claims, and have described Musk as “a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader”.\n\nMicrosoft, which is also a defendant, urged Rogers to throw out Musk’s claims against it. A lawyer for Microsoft said there was no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has been approached for comment.\n\nLawyers for OpenAI at the hearing asked Rogers to enter judgment against Musk, contending that he had not shown enough of a factual basis to sustain his allegations including fraud and breach of contract.\n\nOpenAI also contends that Musk failed to bring his allegations in a timely manner. The judge said the jury would be asked to weigh whether the lawsuit was filed outside the statute of limitations.",

IWF analysts said the images would be considered child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under UK law.\n\n“We can confirm our analysts have discovered criminal imagery of children aged between 11 and 13 which appears to have been created using the tool,” said Ngaire Alexander, the head of the IWF’s hotline, which investigates reports of CSAM from members of the public.\n\nX, Elon Musk’s social media platform, has been deluged with images of women and children whose clothes have been digitally removed by the Grok tool, sparking public outcry and condemnation from politicians.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, the House of Commons women and equalities committee said it would no longer use X for its communications, saying it was no longer appropriate to do so given preventing violence against women and girls was among its key policy areas.\n\nThe decision marks the first significant move by a Westminster organisation to exit X in response to the misuse of Grok. While the decision concerned only the committee’s account, some individual members, including the Labour chair, Sarah Owen, have already stopped using X. Another, the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, said she was leaving the platform, calling the images generated by Grok “the last straw”.\n\nAlexander said the imagery viewed by the IWF has been used to create even more extreme material – known as Category A, which includes penetrative sexual activity – using a different AI tool.\n\n“We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material. Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream. That is unacceptable,” Alexander added.\n\nMusk’s xAI, which owns Grok and X, has been approached for comment.\n\nDowning Street said “all options were on the table”, including a boycott of X as ministers backed the UK regulator, Ofcom, to take action.\n\nOn Wednesday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “X needs to deal with this urgently and Ofcom has our full backing to take enforcement action wherever firms are failing to protect UK users.\n\n“It already has the power to issue fines of up to billions of pounds and even stop access to a site that is violating the law.”\n\nRequests for Grok to manipulate images of women to “put her in a bikini” continued to flood in on X on Wednesday. Despite the warnings of EU and UK regulatory action, there was no evidence that the platform had installed tighter safeguards, and pictures of teenage girls continue to be stripped down digitally at the request of X users, to show them in small, revealing items of underwear, or positioned in sexually explicit poses.\n\nSome users have demanded more extreme content, asking the chatbot to decorate bikinis with swastikas, or requesting alterations to photographs of women so they appear to be victims of abuse. The chatbot has obliged by adding cigarette burns, facial bruising, and blood to some images of women.\n\nThe UK’s data watchdog – the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) – said it had contacted X and xAI “to seek clarity on the measures they have in place to comply with UK data protection law and protect individuals’ rights”, adding people have “a right to use social media knowing their personal data is being handled lawfully and with respect”.\n\nX has said it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, “by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary”.",

    "fullText": "It looks like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are headed for a courtroom showdown.\n\nDuring a hearing on Wednesday, a California judge said she plans to reject Altman's lawyers' last-ditch efforts to end Musk's case against OpenAI and its CEO.\n\n\"This case is going to trial,\" US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said at a hearing to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant a jury trial.\n\n\"I think there's plenty of evidence,\" she said, referring to Musk's case. \"It's circumstantial, but that's how these things work.\"\n\nIn his lawsuit filed in 2024, Musk accused OpenAI of misleading him in its decision to abandon its original nonprofit mission and structure in favor of a profit-oriented model, including through its partnership with Microsoft.\n\nMusk says he donated $38 million to the maker of ChatGPT over the years to support its mission to develop AI for the benefit of humankind. The Tesla CEO is seeking monetary damages, as well as a judgment to void Microsoft's licensing agreement with OpenAI.\n\nAt a hearing on Wednesday, an Oakland federal court judge said she felt there was enough evidence that Musk may have been deceived to allow the case to move forward to a jury. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\n\"There were assurances made, and promises made, that the structure would be maintained,\" she said. \"There was lots of information that was not shared.\"\n\nThe judge added that she also felt \"there are strong arguments by the defense.\"\n\n\"I think the jury is going to get to decide,\" she said.\n\nOpenAI lawyers have denied Musk's allegations, saying Musk was aware of the company's for-profit plans as early as 2018. OpenAI has also pointed out that it is still controlled by OpenAI's nonprofit arm.\n\n\"Mr Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI. Most recently, his AI company, xAI, sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and targeting its employees for recruitment. At the time, an OpenAI spokesperson told Business that the lawsuit is \"the latest chapter in Mr. Musk's ongoing harassment.\"\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015, but left the company in 2018. At the time he said his work with OpenAI could present a conflict of interest with Tesla's AI ambitions.\n\nSince, Musk has repeatedly criticized Altman and OpenAI, including the company's structure. Musk later went on to launch his own AI company, xAI, in 2023.",

    "fullText": "AI company’s chatbot faces criticism over its generation of sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and girls\n\nElon Musk’s artificial intelligence company has raised $20bn in its latest funding round, the startup announced Tuesday, even as its marquee chatbot Grok faces backlash over generating sexualized, nonconsensual images of women and underage girls.\n\nxAI’s Series E funding round featured big-name investors, including Nvidia, Fidelity Management and Resource Company, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, and Valor Equity Partners – the private investment firm of Musk’s longtime friend and former Doge member Antonio Gracias. The funding round exceeded its initial $15bn target, according to xAI’s press release. The company touted Grok’s image-generation abilities in the announcement of its latest funding round.\n\nxAI lacks the prominence of its rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and has continually drawn criticism for generating misinformation, antisemitic content and now potentially illegal sexual material. Nonetheless, the company has been able to win government contracts and billions of dollars in investment amid the AI boom. xAI’s latest funding round comes during some of the fiercest pushback against the company yet, with lawmakers in multiple countries demanding answers regarding Grok’s output.\n\nOver the past week, Grok has responded to tens of thousands of prompts from users on X requesting the chatbot remove women’s clothing in images or pose them in sexualized ways. Many of the prompts have included images of women who have not given their consent to be digitally undressed, including Ashley St Clair, the estranged mother of one of Musk’s children.\n\n“I felt horrified, I felt violated, especially seeing my toddler’s backpack in the back of it,” St Clair told the Guardian, adding that her complaints to X did not go anywhere. The Guardian’s request for comment from xAI resulted in an automated response stating “Legacy Media Lies”.\n\nSome of Grok’s images included a photo of a 12-year-old girl, which the chatbot manipulated to remove the child’s actual clothing and depict her instead in a bikini. Other suggestive images have featured children as young as 10 years old. The chatbot posted an apology on Friday that stated lapses in its safeguards led to generating images of minors, but continued to generate sexualized images of children in the ensuing days.\n\nxAI has been seeking investment for months as it works to increase its AI models’ capabilities and build out enormous data centers in Memphis, Tennessee. The company claimed the new funding would help its core mission of “Understanding the Universe”.\n\nFrench ministers reported Grok’s output to prosecutors on Friday and referred the episode to media regulators to decide whether the images violate the European Union’s Digital Services Act. Liz Kendall, the UK’s technology secretary, also condemned Grok’s deepfakes on Tuesday as “appalling and unacceptable”, calling on the British regulator Ofcom to take action. Ofcom posted on X that it had made contact with xAI to determine whether an investigation is warranted. Lawmakers in the US, where xAI is headquartered, have remained comparatively mum.\n\nThe company made a similar funding announcement in July of last year during another controversy over Grok. A week after the chatbot began posting antisemitic content and pro-Nazi ideology, including describing itself as “MechaHitler”, xAI announced it had secured a contract with the US Pentagon worth nearly $200m.",

    "description": "Elon Musk says China's electricity advantage gives it the edge to \"far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute.\"",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk says China is on track to outpace every other country in the computing power needed to run AI.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said in an episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast published Tuesday that \"China's going to have more power than anyone else and probably will have more chips.\"\n\n\"Based on current trends, China will far exceed the rest of the world in AI compute,\" he added.\n\nMusk said China's decisive advantage in the AI race lies in its ability to scale electricity generation. He estimated that China could reach about three times the electricity output of the US by 2026, giving it the capacity to support energy-hungry AI data centers.\n\nElectricity generation is the limiting factor to scaling AI systems, Musk said.\n\n\"People are underestimating the difficulty of bringing electricity online,\" he added.\n\nWhile the US has focused on restricting China's access to advanced semiconductors, Musk suggested those constraints may matter less over time. China will \"figure out the chips,\" he said.\n\nMusk added that diminishing returns at the cutting edge of chip performance might make it easier for China to catch up, even without access to the most advanced designs.\n\nMusk has previously pointed to China as a model in areas beyond AI infrastructure.\n\nIn an episode of the \"People by WTF\" podcast published in November, Musk said he wants to turn his social media platform X into \"WeChat++,\" referencing China's dominant super app.\n\n\"I also like the idea of sort of having a unified app or website or whatever, where you can do anything you want there,\" he said. \"China has this with WeChat.\"\n\nMusk's comments come as energy supply and data infrastructure emerge as key constraints in scaling AI, rather than chips or algorithms.\n\nCompanies worldwide have rushed to build AI data centers, many of which require as much electrical power as small cities.\n\nA report from Goldman Sachs in November said that an electricity shortage could slow US progress in the AI race.\n\n\"As AI demands massive power, a reliable and ample power supply is likely to be a key factor shaping this race, especially because power infrastructure bottlenecks can be slow to solve,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nThe report added that while pressure on the US power grid is increasing, China has been steadily expanding its energy capacity.\n\n\"We expect China's spare capacity to remain sufficient to accommodate data center power demand growth while supporting demand in other industries,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nIn his annual New Year's address last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping praised his country's progress in AI in 2025, saying China had \"integrated science and technology deeply with industries, and made a stream of new innovations.\"\n\n\"Many large AI models have been competing in a race to the top, and breakthroughs have been achieved in the research and development of our own chips,\" he said in his speech in Beijing.\n\n\"All this has turned China into one of the economies with the fastest-growing innovation capabilities,\" he added.",

    "description": "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO is off to a roaring start in 2026, growing his fortune by around 4% to $644 billion after only two trading days.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett's late business partner, Charlie Munger, once said the \"hard part\" of getting rich is pulling together the first $100,000, as that's often a \"long struggle\" for someone starting at zero.\n\nElon Musk is at the polar opposite end of the wealth spectrum — worth so much on paper that he can gain or lose tens of billions of dollars and barely move the needle on his net worth.\n\nAfter just two trading days this year, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has added $24 billion to his personal fortune, lifting it by about 4% to $644 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe world's richest person by far — he's worth more than double Alphabet cofounder Larry Page in second place — was last year's biggest wealth gainer with a $187 billion increase.\n\nMusk is comfortably leading that list in 2026 as well. As of Monday's close, Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy is a distant runner up with a roughly $8 billion gain.\n\nIt's not exactly clear why Musk's fortune has swelled this year. Tesla stock has only inched up 0.4%, boosting the value of its CEO's stake by less than $2 billion even if his previously disputed stock options are included.\n\nSpaceX's valuation rocketed to $800 billion in December, but that was reflected in Musk's wealth gain last year. Nor have there been any publicized valuation increases for his other companies, which include xAI, Neuralink, and The Boring Company.\n\nThat suggests Bloomberg has simply tweaked its calculations, causing a change in net worth that would be material even for Musk's fellow centibillionaires, but appears closer to a rounding error for Musk.\n\nTech billionaires like Musk have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, as investors continue to bet big that their companies will capitalize on the red-hot trend.\n\nPage and his cofounder, Sergey Brin, have both added over $2 billion to their fortunes this year, thanks to Alphabet shares climbing 1% or so. They grew $101 billion and $92 billion richer respectively last year, trailing only Musk in wealth gain.",

The guest list included several top executives.\n\nAfter the dinner, Musk shared photos on X showing himself with the crown prince, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Trump. \"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nIn September, the two were spotted shaking hands at a memorial service for political activist Charlie Kirk, marking their first public interaction since their alliance collapsed.\n\nThe relationship between the two publicly unraveled in June, shortly after Musk stepped away from his role as the de facto head of the White House's DOGE Office.\n\nBefore the fallout, Musk was one of Trump's most visible and influential allies.

Musk said Trump owed his presidential election win to him, while Trump threatened to pull government contracts held by Musk's companies.\n\nIn July, Musk said he would launch a new political party called the \"America Party.\"\n\n\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,\" Musk wrote in an X post.

    "description": "Donald Trump and Elon Musk have a complicated relationship. They've had some very public spats, but the two powerful men remain political allies.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump appear to be back on after an on-again, off-again relationship over the years.\n\nThe world's richest person and the two-time president of the United States weren't always close, but became singular political allies, with Musk calling himself \"first buddy\" following Trump's 2024 victory and donating more than $200 million toward pro-Trump super PACs.\n\nAt the beginning of Trump's second term, Musk was frequently seen on the president's side and served as the de facto head of the White House DOGE office.\n\nIn June 2025, Trump and Musk's relationship blew up after Musk criticized Trump's signature \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" Musk even threatened to start his own political party. Trump threatened to \"destroy\" Musk's companies.\n\nTensions have cooled since then. Musk and Trump shook hands at Charlie Cook's memorial service in September, a reunion that Musk and the White House proudly shared on social media. In October 2025, Trump said he now had a \"good\" relationship with Musk.\n\n\"I like Elon, I've always liked him,\" Trump said.\n\nHere's how the two billionaires reached this point.\n\nJust before the 2016 presidential election, Musk told CNBC he didn't think Trump should be president.\n\n\"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire added that Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies were the \"right ones.\"\n\nAfter he won the presidency, Trump appointed Musk to two economic advisory councils, along with other business leaders like then Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nMusk received criticism for working with the controversial president, but he defended his choice by saying he was using the position to lobby for better environmental and immigration policies.\n\nOn June 1, 2017, after Trump announced the US would pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Musk resigned from his roles on presidential advisory boards.\n\n\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk said in a tweet announcing his departure.\n\nMusk's goal for Tesla is to curb dependence on fossil fuels through electric vehicles, solar power, and stationary energy storage.\n\nDuring a January 2020 interview with CNBC, Trump praised Musk's accomplishments and intelligence.\n\n\"You have to give him credit,\" the former president said, referring to Tesla becoming more valuable than Ford and General Motors. \"He's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And he's doing good at rockets too, by the way.\"\n\nTrump called Musk \"one of our great geniuses\" and likened him to Thomas Edison.\n\nAs the pandemic gripped the US in early 2020, Musk clashed with California public-health officials who forced Tesla to temporarily shut down its factory there. Trump voiced his support for Musk.\n\n\"California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW,\" Trump tweeted in May 2020. \"It can be done Fast & Safely!\"\n\nIn May 2022, Musk said he would unban Trump as Twitter's new owner.\n\nMusk called the ban a \"morally bad decision\" and \"foolish to the extreme\" in an interview with the Financial Times. Twitter kicked Trump off its platform following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThe Tesla billionaire has called himself a \"free speech absolutist,\" and one of his key goals for taking Twitter private was to loosen content moderation.\n\nIn July 2022, Trump took aim at Musk, saying the businessman voted for him but later denied it.\n\n\"You know [Musk] said the other day 'Oh, I've never voted for a Republican,'\" Trump said during a Saturday rally in Anchorage, Alaska. \"I said 'I didn't know that.' He told me he voted for me. So he's another bullshit artist.\"\n\nDays later, Musk tweeted that Trump's claim was \"not true.\"\n\nMusk stopped short of attacking Trump personally, but said he shouldn't run for president again.\n\n\"I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset. Dems should also call off the attack – don't make it so that Trump's only way to survive is to regain the Presidency,\" he tweeted.\n\nHe continued: \"Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!? Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69.\" Trump is 76 years old.\n\nSoon after, Trump went on the offensive, posting a lengthy attack on Musk on Truth Social.\n\n\"When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it's electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he'd be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" Trump said in a post that criticized two of Musk's ventures, Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\n\n\"Lmaooo,\" Musk responded on Twitter.\n\nFollowing Musk's official purchase of Twitter in October 2022, Trump applauded the deal.\n\n\"I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands, and will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs that truly hate our country,\" he said. He added that he likes Truth Social better than other platforms, echoing comments from earlier this year in which he ruled out a return to Twitter.\n\nMusk later joked about the potential of welcoming the former president back to his newly acquired platform.\n\n\"If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!,\" the Tesla CEO tweeted in October 2022.\n\nMusk and other right-leaning voices in Silicon Valley initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis ended 2022 as Trump's best-positioned primary challenger. In November 2022, as DeSantis was skyrocketing to acclaim, Musk said he would endorse him. In March 2023, after enduring Trump's attacks for months, DeSantis prepared to make history by formally announcing his candidacy in an interview on Twitter.\n\nThe initial few minutes were a glitchy disaster. Trump and his allies ruthlessly mocked DeSantis' \"Space\" with Musk and venture capitalist David Sachs. DeSantis' interview later proceeded, but his campaign was dogged for days with negative headlines.\n\nMusk live-streamed a visit to the US-Mexico border on Twitter, which he had rebranded as \"X.\" Musk offered his support for one of Trump's signature immigration policies.\n\n\"We actually do need a wall and we need to require people to have some shred of evidence to claim asylum to enter, as everyone is doing that,\" Musk wrote on X. \"It's a hack that you can literally Google to know exactly what to say! Will find out more when I visit Eagle Pass maybe as soon as tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump tried to woo Musk during a meeting at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. According to The New York Times, Trump met with Musk and a few other GOP megadonors when the former president's campaign was particularly cash-strapped. After the Times published its report, Musk said he would not be \"donating money to either candidate for US President.\"\n\nMusk said he \"fully endorsed\" Trump after the former president was shot during a political rally ahead of the Republican National Convention. Musk's endorsement marked a major turning point in his yearslong political evolution from an Obama voter. Days later, it would come to light that Musk pressed Trump to select Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate.\n\nTrump announced Vance as his vice presidential pick at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe ticket, Musk wrote on X, \"resounds with victory.\"\n\nTrump, who ended the Republican National Convention primed for victory, stumbled after Biden abruptly dropped out of the 2024 race. He and his allies have struggled to attack Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAmid Harris' early media blitz, Trump joined Musk on a two-hour livestream on X that garnered an audience of over 1 million listeners. The conversation covered topics ranging from a retelling of Trump's assassination attempt to illegal immigration to Musk's potential role with a government efficiency commission.\n\nIn August, Trump began to suggest that he \"certainly would\" consider adding Musk to his Cabinet or an advisory role. The Tesla CEO responded by tweeting an AI-generated photo of himself on a podium emblazoned with the acronym \"D.O.G.E\"—Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"I am willing to serve,\" he wrote above the image.\n\nIn September 2024, Trump softened the possibility that Musk might join his Cabinet suggestion of Musk joining his Cabinet. However, he also said that Musk could \"consult with the country\" and help give \"some very good ideas.\"\n\nMusk later expressed enthusiasm about the news.\n\n\"I can't wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHe later added that he \"looked forward to serving\" the country and would be willing to do with without any pay, title, or recognition.\n\nMusk joined Trump onstage during the former president's rally, hosted on October 5 in the same location where Trump survived an assassination attempt in July 2024. Musk sported an all-black \"Make America Great Again\" cap and briefly addressed the crowd, saying that voter turnout for Trump this year was essential or \"this will be the last election.\"\n\n\"President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution,\" Musk said. \"He must win to preserve democracy in America.\"\n\nThe next day, Musk's America PAC announced that it would offer $47 to each person who refers registered voters residing in swing states to sign a petition \"in support for the First and Second Amendments.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO later told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he might face \"vengeance\" if Trump loses the election.\n\nMusk was by Trump's side on election night at Mar-a-Lago, helping celebrate his victory.\n\nNearly a week after his 2024 presidential election win, Trump announced that Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy were chosen to lead a newly minted Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE, as Musk liked to call it, in reference to the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin).\n\n\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pay the way for my Administration to dismantle the Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nOutside of administrative duties, Musk's presence at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club was so constant that Trump joked he couldn't \"get rid of him.\"\n\n\"Elon won't go home,\" Trump told NBC News jokingly\n\nThe pair's close relationship grew into a more personal friendship. Musk was seen attending Trump's Thanksgiving dinner and on the golf course with Trump and his grandchildren, where Kai Trump said he achieved \"uncle status.\"\n\nTrump dismissed concerns that Musk would be running the country, adding in a barb that the billionaire couldn't even be in charge if he wanted to, since he was born in South Africa.\n\n\"No, he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump said in December 2024. \"And I'm safe. You know why? He can't be? He wasn't born in this country.\"\n\nTrump's comments came after Musk flexed his influence to help shut down a bipartisan emergency spending bill earlier that month. Some Republicans questioned why Trump hadn't been more active in derailing the bill, and Democrats baited the President-elect on social media with posts about Musk \"calling the shots\" and taking on the role of a \"shadow president.\n\nTrump was sworn into office on January 20. Several tech leaders were in attendance, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sundar Pichai. The \"first buddy\" was also front and center for Trump's inauguration.\n\nMusk took the stage to celebrate at an inauguration event at the Capital One Arena, where he sparked accusations over a gesture he made that some said resembled a Nazi salute. Musk denied the allegations.\n\n\"Hopefully, people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi,\" he said during an interview with Joe Rogan.\n\nThough Musk quickly became the face of the DOGE effort, White House court filings said he had \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"\n\nIn the February 2025 filing, Musk was described as a senior advisor to Trump with \"no greater authority than other senior White House advisors.\" Officials also called him a \"special government employee.\"\n\nTrump told reporters they can call Musk \"whatever you want.\"\n\nThe White House later named Amy Gleason, who previously worked for US Digital Service, as the acting DOGE administrator.\n\nMusk's companies struggled to escape the almost daily DOGE-related news cycles.\n\nProtests, boycotts, and vandalism at Tesla dealerships spread across the US.\n\nIn March, Trump stepped in to defend Musk's electric car company, with Teslas on the South Lawn of the White House. Trump later wrote that he'd purchased a Tesla to show support for Musk.\n\n\"The Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThree months into DOGE's mission to reshape the federal workforce, Musk announced that he would be stepping back from the effort. He broke the news during an underwhelming Tesla earnings call, where earnings per share were down 71% year over year.\n\n\"Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" Musk said during the call. He added that \"the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency\" had been completed.\n\nAt the time, Musk said he would keep spending one or two days each week on governmental duties, so long as Trump wanted him to do so.\n\nOn June 30, Musk doubled down on his calls for another political party. He also vowed to defeat politicians who support Trump's bill.\n\n\"They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,\" Musk wrote on X.\n\nTrump responded on July 1 on Truth Social, suggesting that DOGE could be turned on its former chief.\n\n\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk followed up with more posts on X proclaiming his opposition to the spending bill.\n\nTrump signed his signature bill on July 4, 2025.\n\nOn July 5, Musk said on X that he had formed the America Party to \"give you back your freedom.\"\n\nTrump responded on Truth Social that he was \"saddened\" to see Musk go \"completely 'off the rails,'\" essentially becoming a \"TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.\" Trump added that third political parties have never succeeded.\n\nLate in the month, Trump said that even though his signature domestic plan slashes EV subsidies, he's not out to hurt Musk's bottom line.\n\n\"Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large-scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!\"\n\nTrump's statement came a day after the White House appeared to suggest that federal agencies shouldn't contract with Musk's xAI.\n\nTrump and Musk were seen for the first time since their public falling out at the memorial service for conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nTrump, Vice President JD Vance, and a host of other top White House officials joined together in Arizona to pay tribute to Kirk, who was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University.\n\nMusk and the White House later posted photos of the meet-up on X.\n\nTrump said that Musk came over \"to say hello.\"\n\n\"I thought it was nice, he came over, we had a little conversation,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after the memorial service. \"We had a very good relationship but it was nice that he came over. \"\n\nPOTUS x @ElonMusk \n\nFor Charlie. pic.twitter.com/Inaf8X81Gy\n\nMusk had previously said that the White House had invited him to an exclusive dinner for tech CEOs but was unable to attend.\n\nTrump said he and Musk had a \"good\" relationship and called their brief feud \"a stupid moment.\"\n\n\"He had a bad spell, he had a bad period. He had a bad moment,\" Trump told reporters when asked about their relationship. \"It was a stupid moment in his life, very stupid. I'm sure he'd tell you that. But I like Elon, and I suspect I always will.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO still has beefs elsewhere. In late October, Musk called Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy a \"dummy\" amid a spat over who would lead NASA.\n\nTrump invited Musk to attend a dinner at the White House with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November. The event marks Musk's first public appearance at the White House since stepping back from the DOGE office in May 2025.\n\nThe guest list for the dinner included prominent CEOs such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk shared a photo of the event on X, which included himself, Trump, the crown prince, and Huang.\n\n\"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nOne day after the dinner, Trump joked about Musk in a speech at the US-Saudi Investment Forum.\n\n\"You're so lucky I'm with you, Elon. I'll tell you. Has he ever thanked me properly?\" Trump said.\n\nHours after news broke that the US had raided Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on January 3, Elon Musk posted his support.\n\n\"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"It is heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant,\" he posted again. \"Venezuela can now have the prosperity it deserves.\"\n\nThat same evening, Musk posted that he had a \"lovely dinner\" with Trump and Melania Trump, along with a photo of the three of them seated at a table at Mar-a-Lago.",

    "fullText": "A short video. A few words. And suddenly, the internet is on fire.\n\nA Somali TikToker is facing intense backlash after commenting what many interpreted as a threat against Elon Musk. The remark spread fast, pulled Musk into the conversation, and triggered a wave of reactions that raised serious questions about online speech and real-world consequences.\n\nIn the now-viral clip, the TikToker appeared dismissive when Musk’s name came up. Her response stopped people cold.\n\n“I wouldn’t worry too much about him,” she said. “He about to die.”\n\nThe statement didn’t include context, jokes, or qualifiers. Viewers immediately flagged it as disturbing, especially given Musk’s global profile and the climate around public figures and security concerns. The clip moved across X, TikTok, and Reddit within hours.\n\nBOOM! Elon Musk FIRES BACK at the Somali woman threatening his life\n\nWhen fraud is exposed – it’s always the fraudsters who yell and complain the loudest.\n\nTheir THEFT will come to an end. pic.twitter.com/K0sfl3DFl1\n\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 2, 2026\n\nElon Musk didn’t ignore it. Instead, he responded directly on X with a blunt message that escalated the situation instantly. “Then it is war.”\n\nThe response fueled speculation. Some saw it as sarcasm. Others read it as a warning. Either way, it ensured the exchange wouldn’t fade quietly.\n\nOnce Musk replied, the clip went from niche content to headline material.\n\nAs the clip circulated, comment sections exploded. Many users expressed shock at how casually the statement was delivered. Others went further, predicting severe consequences for the TikToker.\n\n“She’s about to spend some years behind bars,” one comment read. Another user wrote, “She about to be ‘mysteriously’ missing. I don’t think anyone will care.”\n\nThose comments sparked a second wave of criticism, with users arguing that the backlash itself was becoming dangerous.\n\nSeveral legal-minded users pointed out why the comment raised alarms. Saying that a healthy, relatively young person will die soon can be interpreted as more than opinion.\n\n“When you say that a person who is healthy and not old will die ‘naturally’ soon, this looks like a threat,” one widely shared post argued.\n\nIn many countries, language that implies harm toward a specific individual can trigger investigation, even without explicit details.\n\nThat distinction matters more when the subject is a high-profile figure.\n\nThe situation reopened a familiar debate. Where does free expression end, and where does accountability begin?\n\nSome defended the TikToker, claiming the statement was careless but not criminal. Others argued that public figures face constant danger and that language like this cannot be brushed aside.\n\nPlatforms also came under scrutiny for how quickly content spreads before moderation steps in. Once again, the internet moved faster than clarity.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Musk has become the center of an online firestorm triggered by a single sentence. His presence alone tends to magnify conflicts.\n\nOne comment becomes a movement. One reply becomes a signal. And millions rush to interpret intent. That dynamic keeps repeating, and each time the stakes feel higher.\n\nJUST IN: Somali woman Fardowsa Muhumed is FRANTIC after threatening Elon Musk’s life, to which Elon replied, “then IT IS WAR”\n\nShe’s retracting her threat, and says “[I am] truly in fear for my future!”\n\nCowards.pic.twitter.com/aG1pRqYplt https://t.co/mMkGcIMu7u\n\n— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 2, 2026\n\nIn a video released a few hours ago, the Somali woman has apologized for her comments and claimed the video was taken out of context.\n\n“Let me make myself clear, I never intended or aimed to threaten the life of Elon Musk. I am not a person who carries around hate; the media has taken my words out of context, and it’s been deeply hurtful to watch how that’s turned into me being dehumanized and painted as a villain.",

    "fullText": "The novelty of eating at a diner owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off in just a few months\n\nLess than six months since it opened, Elon Musk’s Tesla Diner has the feel of a ghost town. Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are the hours-long, hundred-person lines wrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.\n\nOn a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot for Tesla car charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.\n\nThe novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsite anti-Musk protests, noise complaints from neighbors and customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.\n\nGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month that he was leaving the Tesla Diner to focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chef removed his previous Instagram posts referencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.\n\nGreenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.\n\nGreenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Diner faced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Musk made what rights groups have described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.\n\nMusk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA since at least 2018 as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.\n\n“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”\n\nThe diner received immense media coverage upon opening but poor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.\n\nA display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.\n\nTesla posted on X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.\n\nOn social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.\n\nThe diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.\n\nAs the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.\n\n“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.",

    "fullText": "Lapses in safeguards led to wave of sexualized images this week as xAI says it is working to improve systems\n\nElon Musk’s chatbot Grok posted on Friday that lapses in safeguards had led it to generate “images depicting minors in minimal clothing” on social media platform X. The chatbot, a product of Musk’s company xAI, has been generating a wave of sexualized images throughout the week in response to user prompts.\n\nScreenshots shared by users on X showed Grok’s public media tab filled with such images. xAI said it was working to improve its systems to prevent future incidents.\n\n“There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing,” Grok said in a post on X in response to a user. “xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.”\n\n“As noted, we’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them—CSAM is illegal and prohibited,” xAI posted to the @Grok account on X, referring to child sexual abuse material.\n\nMany users on X have prompted Grok to generate sexualized, nonconsensual AI-altered versions of images in recent days, in some cases removing people’s clothing without their consent. Musk on Thursday reposted an AI photo of himself in a bikini, captioned with cry-laughing emojis, in a nod to the trend.\n\nGrok’s generation of sexualized images appeared to lack safety guardrails, allowing for minors to be featured in its posts of people, usually women, wearing little clothing, according to posts from the chatbot. In a reply to a user on X on Thursday, Grok said most cases could be prevented through advanced filters and monitoring although it said “no system is 100% foolproof”, adding that xAI was prioritising improvements and reviewing details shared by users.\n\nWhen contacted for comment by email, xAI replied with the message: “Legacy Media Lies”.\n\nThe problem of AI being used to generate child sexual abuse material is a longstanding issue in the artificial intelligence industry. A 2023 Stanford study found that a dataset used to train a number of popular AI image-generation tools contained over 1000 CSAM images. Training AI on images of child abuse can allow models to generate new images of children being exploited, experts say.\n\nGrok also has a history of failing to maintain its safety guardrails and posting misinformation. In May of last year, Grok began posting about the far-right conspiracy of “white genocide” in South Africa on posts with no relation to the concept. xAI also apologized in July after Grok began posting rape fantasies and antisemitic material, including calling itself “MechaHitler” and praising Nazi ideology. The company nevertheless secured a nearly $200m contract with the US Department of Defense a week after the incidents.",

    "fullText": "Chinese auto giant BYD on Friday dethroned U.S. rival Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles on a calendar-year basis.\n\nThe milestone caps an extraordinary rise for BYD, a company Tesla CEO Elon Musk once dismissed by laughing at their products during a 2011 Bloomberg interview.\n\nIn a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.\n\nMusk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop.\n\nDeliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.\n\nTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.\n\nThe stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers.\n\n— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "Elon Musk made a lot of promises for what Tesla Robotaxi could achieve in 2025, including fully-autonomous driving",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has made a lot of promises for what Tesla Robotaxi would achieve by the end of 2025: fully autonomous rides for the public; expanded service areas in multiple regions; and coverage for half the US population, among other milestones.\n\nWith the year closing, here's what Tesla's ride-hailing service looks like.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, more than 30 Teslas were operating in Austin, where the pilot launch began, offering paid rides with a safety monitor in the front passenger seat.\n\nTesla also deployed a ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area earlier this year. There, a safety monitor sits behind the steering wheel due to California regulations.\n\nMusk missing deadlines is hardly new. It's called \"Elon Time.\" There's a website for it. Even the CEO himself recognizes it.\n\n\"I am pathologically optimistic with time,\" he said in May 2024. \"Have been ever since I was a kid.\"\n\nTesla investors and analysts have learned to accept this Musk quirk — just as long as the CEO delivers.\n\n\"I hear Tesla lay out the vision, then I try to listen to what the markers are to get there,\" Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst, previously told Business Insider.\n\nDays before the year ends, Tesla employees have shared videos on X of what appear to be fully autonomous rides in Austin with no in-car safety monitor. Musk said he took a ride as well and noted \"perfect driving.\"\n\nIn the meantime, here's everything Musk said Tesla Robotaxi would achieve in 2025.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHere's one that was quickly debunked.\n\nDuring an earnings call in April, Musk teased the launch of Tesla Robotaxi and said the company was \"on track to be able to do paid rides fully autonomously in Austin in June,\" following \"many other cities in the US by the end of this year.\"\n\nThat didn't happen. Tesla Robotaxi was launched with safety monitors in the front passenger seat of the Model Ys.\n\nThe monitors are there to stop the rides if they detect unwanted driving behavior, Business Insider reported after using Tesla Robotaxi in Austin.\n\nIn October, Musk said that he expects Robotaxi to be in about \"eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year,\" including Nevada, Florida, and Arizona, pending regulatory approval.\n\nTesla received permits to operate a ride-hailing service in the three states mentioned. The company also appears to be hiring for Robotaxi-related jobs across the US.\n\nHowever, as of Wednesday, the only paid service available to the public is limited to the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin.\n\nMusk told the All-In podcast also in October that Tesla will \"probably\" have \"a thousand cars or \n\nSo far, there's little evidence to suggest that Tesla is operating with that many vehicles in either region.\n\nThe Robotaxi Tracker, which tracks fleet size through crowdsourced data, shows that there are roughly 35 vehicles in Austin and around 130 vehicles in the Bay Area.\n\nBusiness Insider's Grace Kay reported this month that Tesla registered 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers for its ride-hailing service.\n\nDuring Tesla's second-quarter earnings call in July, Musk said Tesla will likely have robotaxis operating for \"half of the population of the US by the end of the year.\"\n\nThe caveats were that the goal is subject to regulatory approval and that the company wants to be \"very, very cautious.\"\n\nMusk said in Tesla's third-quarter earnings call in October that the company expects to remove the safety drivers in \"large parts of Austin\" by the end of 2025.\n\nA safety monitor still sits inside Tesla Robotaxi as of Wednesday, but it appears the company is making progress toward that goal.\n\n\"A Tesla with no safety monitor in the car and me sitting in the passenger seat took me all around Austin on Sunday with perfect driving,\" Musk said in an X post on December 24.\n\nThis is separate from Robotaxi, but FSD, or Full Self-Driving, is the key technology that will underpin Tesla's autonomous ride-hailing service.\n\nIn April, Musk said Tesla would deliver FSD Unsupervised for personally-owned vehicles by the end of the year in \"many cities in the US.\"\n\nCurrently, drivers are required to pay attention to the roads to keep FSD activated.\n\nMusk said earlier this month that a software update allowed drivers to use their phones in certain traffic conditions.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistar Barr tried it. Police don't recommend it.",

    "description": "Jaymie Parkkinen is a high-powered intellectual property lawyer facing off against Sam Altman by day — and a clown by night.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Sam Altman are engaged in a courtroom clash of the titans over the origins of OpenAI, now one of the most important artificial intelligence companies in the world. In San Francisco federal court, they are suing each other in a dizzying series of claims and counterclaims.\n\nIn Altman's corner, there's an arsenal of elite firms — including Morrison & Foerster and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz — with a long track record representing Silicon Valley royalty.\n\nMusk has turned to a pair of boutique litigation shops. And at one firm, one of Musk's lawyers is a clown.\n\nJaymie Parkkinen has been in the trenches of the litigation, signing his name to some of the most contentious discovery disputes. In a July hearing, he singlehandedly faced down three lawyers representing OpenAI and Microsoft in the lawsuit.\n\nOutside of his work, he juggles clown performances and operates his own \"Clown Cardio\" business.\n\n\"All of my comedy friends — none of them can believe I'm a lawyer,\" Parkkinen told Business Insider. \"And none of my lawyer friends can believe I do clown.\"\n\nParkkinen's clown performances don't involve any of the \"Ronald McDonald birthday party kind of stuff\" often associated with the jesters, he said. There are no honking red noses nor rainbow curly-haired wigs. He does not ride onto the stage on a unicycle.\n\nClown, according to Parkkinen, is akin to the high-concept physical comedy of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Lucille Ball. He uses the word in the same way one might say \"improv\" or \"comedy.\"\n\n\"When you strip away all the social masks that we all wear, if you strip away gender and politics and money and status and power, and you're just your raw human self without all of the trappings of society — who are you?\" Parkkinen said. \"And clown tries to answer that question.\"\n\nAll of Parkkinen's performances are improvised, and the art form has a lot in common with improv comedy, he said.\n\nIn practice, Parkkinen said, clown performances involve setting up rules for the audience and then breaking them. The interplay between clown and audience reveals something about everyone, he said.\n\n\"Clowns use a lot of competitions and feats like juggling because the audience knows what is right and wrong about those things,\" Parkkinen said.\n\nAs an example, Parkkinen described a performance where he decided he wouldn't use any words with the letter \"M.\" He needed to figure out how to keep the show going while gauging audience reactions when he slipped up.\n\n\"It kind of becomes like this juggling act, metaphorically speaking,\" Parkkinen said. \"How can I keep this show going? How can I be a believable character, but also never use the letter M? And the audience is watching closely for those kinds of cues.\"\n\nMusk first sued Altman in 2024. The lawsuit sought to stop OpenAI from transforming itself from a tax-exempt nonprofit into a corporation. According to Musk, OpenAI, under Altman's leadership, wasn't the altruistic hub of artificial intelligence research for the good of humanity that it was founded to be, but effectively a corporate subsidiary of Microsoft.\n\nAltman, in his own counterclaim against Musk, alleged that the Tesla and SpaceX CEO abandoned OpenAI after briefly being involved in its infancy. Jealous of ChatGPT, Musk wanted to undermine OpenAI so that his own artificial intelligence company, xAI, could lead the market, Altman's countersuit said. The case is scheduled to go to trial at the end of March.\n\nParkkinen came to work for Toberoff & Associates out of an interest in intellectual property law stemming from his involvement in the Los Angeles entertainment scene. The firm frequently represents celebrities and artists in legal disputes over their work.\n\nParkkinen has fought hard in discovery disputes for Musk's case.\n\nHe fought to subpoena Mira Murati, a former OpenAI executive who served as OpenAI CEO amid Altman's brief ouster and who now leads Thinking Machine Labs. Over objections from OpenAI and Microsoft, the judge sided with Parkkinen in allowing Murati to be served with a subpoena for a deposition after Murati dodged it 11 times.\n\nIn a separate eyebrow-raising letter, Parkkinen wrote that Musk \"does not use a computer\" but that emails from his phone were searched for discovery material in the litigation.\n\nParkkinen's artisanal clowning has taken him to unexpected places. He founded a Clown Cardio business after realizing that the physical comedy involved in clown can be a workout. He oversees the hourlong sessions twice a month at a venue in Los Angeles. The concept took off after The New York Times wrote about the program in 2024. He has since taught classes in New York and Philadelphia and said he has received requests to open franchises in Europe.\n\nAt one point in his comedy career, Parkkinen was performing clown every other week in Santa Monica and taught clown and improv classes all over Los Angeles.\n\nThat part of his life has taken a backseat with the Musk case, Parkkinen said.

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says he's planning to ramp up production of his Neuralink brain chips in 2026 and will automate the procedure to implant them into humans.\n\nNeuralink \"will start high-volume production of brain-computer interface devices\" this year, said Musk in a Tuesday X post.\n\nThe startup, cofounded by Musk in 2016, is developing technology that enables people to control computers using an implanted microchip.\n\nIts initial focus is on helping patients with severe neurological conditions — such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, paralysis, or sight impairment — to communicate and regain independence.\n\nBut Musk has also said that Neuralink's chips could be used to meld human consciousness with artificial intelligence.\n\nMusk also said in Thursday's X post that the medical process to implant the chips will \"move to a streamlined, almost entirely automated surgical procedure in 2026.\"\n\nDevice threads will go through the dura — the tough outer membrane that protects the brain and spinal cord — without the need to remove it, Musk said.\n\n\"This is a big deal,\" he added.\n\nThe Neuralink chip is about the size of a coin. From the chip, an array of thin threads, each roughly 20 times thinner than a human hair, fan out into the patient's brain.\n\nInserting the device has previously required a human surgeon to remove a portion of the individual's skull, before a robotic arm takes over to insert the chip.\n\nNoland Arbaugh, a quadriplegic who became the company's first human patient in January 2024, previously told Business Insider the implant has helped him regain independence and control in his life and make new social connections.\n\nIn September 2025, Neuralink said in a post on X that 12 people around the world had now received implants and were actively using them.\n\nMusk has previously suggested that Neuralink could have over a thousand patients with the implant by 2026, and in November 2024, the company went on a hiring spree, searching for manufacturing technicians and microfabrication specialists as it looked to ramp up production.",

    "description": "Jaymie Parkkinen is a high-powered intellectual property lawyer facing off against Sam Altman by day — and a clown by night.",
    "fullText": "One of Elon Musk's lawyers in his legal war with Sam Altman is literally a clown.\n\nJaymie Parkkinen performs clown and teaches clown classes in the Los Angeles Area.\n\nHe has been in the trenches of the case and plans to open his own intellectual property law firm.\n\nElon Musk and Sam Altman are engaged in a courtroom clash of the titans over the origins of OpenAI, now one of the most important artificial intelligence companies in the world. In San Francisco federal court, they are suing each other in a dizzying series of claims and counterclaims.\n\nIn Altman's corner, there's an arsenal of elite firms — including Morrison & Foerster and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz — with a long track record representing Silicon Valley royalty.\n\nMusk has turned to a pair of boutique litigation shops. And at one firm, one of Musk's lawyers is a clown.\n\nJaymie Parkkinen has been in the trenches of the litigation, signing his name to some of the most contentious discovery disputes. In a July hearing, he singlehandedly faced down three lawyers representing OpenAI and Microsoft in the lawsuit.\n\nOutside of his work, he juggles clown performances and operates his own \"Clown Cardio\" business.\n\n\"All of my comedy friends — none of them can believe I'm a lawyer,\" Parkkinen told Business Insider. \"And none of my lawyer friends can believe I do clown.\"\n\nParkkinen's clown performances don't involve any of the \"Ronald McDonald birthday party kind of stuff\" often associated with the jesters, he said. There are no honking red noses nor rainbow curly-haired wigs. He does not ride onto the stage on a unicycle.\n\nClown, according to Parkkinen, is akin to the high-concept physical comedy of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Lucille Ball. He uses the word in the same way one might say \"improv\" or \"comedy.\"\n\n\"When you strip away all the social masks that we all wear, if you strip away gender and politics and money and status and power, and you're just your raw human self without all of the trappings of society — who are you?\" Parkkinen said. \"And clown tries to answer that question.\"\n\nAll of Parkkinen's performances are improvised, and the art form has a lot in common with improv comedy, he said.\n\nIn practice, Parkkinen said, clown performances involve setting up rules for the audience and then breaking them. The interplay between clown and audience reveals something about everyone, he said.\n\n\"Clowns use a lot of competitions and feats like juggling because the audience knows what is right and wrong about those things,\" Parkkinen said.\n\nAs an example, Parkkinen described a performance where he decided he wouldn't use any words with the letter \"M.\" He needed to figure out how to keep the show going while gauging audience reactions when he slipped up.\n\n\"It kind of becomes like this juggling act, metaphorically speaking,\" Parkkinen said. \"How can I keep this show going? How can I be a believable character, but also never use the letter M? And the audience is watching closely for those kinds of cues.\"\n\nMusk first sued Altman in 2024. The lawsuit sought to stop OpenAI from transforming itself from a tax-exempt nonprofit into a corporation. According to Musk, OpenAI, under Altman's leadership, wasn't the altruistic hub of artificial intelligence research for the good of humanity that it was founded to be, but effectively a corporate subsidiary of Microsoft.\n\nAltman, in his own counterclaim against Musk, alleged that the Tesla and SpaceX CEO abandoned OpenAI after briefly being involved in its infancy. Jealous of ChatGPT, Musk wanted to undermine OpenAI so that his own artificial intelligence company, xAI, could lead the market, Altman's countersuit said. The case is scheduled to go to trial at the end of March.\n\nParkkinen came to work for Toberoff & Associates out of an interest in intellectual property law stemming from his involvement in the Los Angeles entertainment scene. The firm frequently represents celebrities and artists in legal disputes over their work.\n\nParkkinen has fought hard in discovery disputes for Musk's case.\n\nHe fought to subpoena Mira Murati, a former OpenAI executive who served as OpenAI CEO amid Altman's brief ouster and who now leads Thinking Machine Labs. Over objections from OpenAI and Microsoft, the judge sided with Parkkinen in allowing Murati to be served with a subpoena for a deposition after Murati dodged it 11 times.\n\nIn a separate eyebrow-raising letter, Parkkinen wrote that Musk \"does not use a computer\" but that emails from his phone were searched for discovery material in the litigation.\n\nParkkinen's artisanal clowning has taken him to unexpected places. He founded a Clown Cardio business after realizing that the physical comedy involved in clown can be a workout. He oversees the hourlong sessions twice a month at a venue in Los Angeles. The concept took off after The New York Times wrote about the program in 2024. He has since taught classes in New York and Philadelphia and said he has received requests to open franchises in Europe.\n\nAt one point in his comedy career, Parkkinen was performing clown every other week in Santa Monica and taught clown and improv classes all over Los Angeles.\n\nThat part of his life has taken a backseat with the Musk case, Parkkinen said. The intense litigation schedule has kept him focused on legal briefs, metaphorically throwing pies at opposing counsel. (Parkkinen declined to discuss details of the case or any interactions with Musk.)\n\nParkkinen told Business Insider he plans to soon open his own firm doing legal work \"in the intersection of IP and AI.\"\n\nHe said his clown life has fed into his professional development. So much of litigation, he said, is performance.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's just about connecting with people, and so is being a lawyer,\" he said. \"You're connecting with a judge, a jury, opposing counsel.\"\n\nIn Parkkinen's view, the stuffy world of corporate lawyers could use more clowning around.\n\n\"Lawyers are often very conservative and kind of miss out on this huge gift that's right at their fingertips,\" he said. \"Just take an improv class.\"",

    "description": "Alexandr Wang says Neuralink and other brain-computer interfaces will help kids learn in \"crazy ways.\"",
    "fullText": "It's no surprise that wunderkinds want their children to be wunderkinds, too.\n\nAsAlexandr Wang, the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, takes on a new role at Meta leading its superintelligence initiatives, he's also thinking about how to integrate superintelligence into the next generation.\n\nAnd that means he's not having kids anytime soon.\n\nOn the Shawn Ryan Show on Thursday, Wang said he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink or other brain-computer interfaces are available.\n\nNeuralink, one of Elon Musk's most futuristic endeavors, is developing coin-sized microchips that can be embedded into human brains. These chips will not only be able to record brain activity, but also stimulate it.\n\nStill in clinical trials, Neuralink has so far been embedded in seven patients. One of those patients, Brad Smith, who has ALS, said he was able to edit a video using his Neuralink brain chip.\n\nWhile Neuralink has received a ton of buzz, it's not the only one developing these interfaces. Synchron, backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, is already working with Apple to help those with disabilities, like ALS patients, use their iPhones. Motif Neurotech is developing a neurostimulator system that works like a pacemaker for the brain and is now used for treating severe depression.\n\nWang also believes these devices will have profound implications for child development. \"In your first like seven years of life, your brain is more neuroplastic than at any other point in your life,\" he said. \"When we get Neuralink and we get these other technologies, kids who are born with them are gonna learn how to use them in like crazy, crazy ways.\"\n\nNeuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and change — whether that means rewiring its structure, shifting how it functions, or forming new connections — in response to things happening inside us or around us.\n\nIt's often enhanced in children because the \"organization of networks of neuronal synapses as well as white matter pathways remain 'under construction' well into adolescence and even later,\" according to a 2009 article published in the peer-reviewed journal Brain and Development. This is why children are also able to learn new skills quickly and recover from injuries faster.\n\nHowever, machines aren't the \"obvious answer\" to enhancing neuroplasticity, Dr. Matthew MacDougall, the head surgeon at Neuralink, told neuroscientist Andrew Huberman on his podcast in April. Even with implanted electrodes and computers, \"It's hard to know which area of the brain would be most potent as a stimulation target for an electrode to broadly juice plasticity,\" he said. Pharmacologic agents, including drugs like LSD and Psilocybin, which can impact the whole brain, are the most promising area of plasticity research, he added.\n\n\"I think with plasticity, you're talking, in general, you're talking about the entire brain. You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way,\" he said. \"You're never going to get that broad targetability with any electrodes that I can see coming in our lifetimes.\"",

    "fullText": "Tesla endured tough year in part thanks to some consumers’ distaste for Elon Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics\n\nTesla has taken the unusual step of publishing sales forecasts that suggest 2025 deliveries will be lower than expected and future years’ sales will be well below targets set by its chief executive, Elon Musk.\n\nThe US electric vehicle maker published figures from analysts suggesting it will announce 423,000 deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2025, in a new “consensus” section on its investor website. That would represent a 16% decline from the final quarter of 2024.\n\nThe estimates suggested that Tesla would deliver 1.64m cars in 2025 as a whole, down from 1.79m in 2024. Deliveries are then estimated to rise to 1.75m in 2026 and 3m in 2029.\n\nMusk claimed at a shareholder meeting in November that the company was aiming to produce 4m cars a year by the end of 2027.\n\nTesla’s shares are valued at $1.4tn (£1.04tn), making it worth more than the next 30 carmakers combined despite its output being less than a fifth of that of Japan’s Toyota. Musk’s Tesla shares, as well as his stake in the rocket company SpaceX, have made him by far the world’s richest man, with a fortune estimated at $623bn, according to Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, much of Tesla’s valuation has been based on shareholder hopes that Musk will lead the carmaker to become the global leader in self-driving technology and robotics more generally.\n\nWhen it comes to actual sales, Tesla has endured a tough year in part thanks to distaste among some consumers for Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics.\n\nIn 2024, Musk was the biggest donor to the election campaign of Donald Trump and then launched an effort to cut government spending with the Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge). His alliance with the US president did not survive the summer, with Trump instead scrapping buyer subsidies worth $7,500 a vehicle and slashing supportive regulations for electric cars.\n\nThe estimates published by Tesla this week are lower than other compilers have suggested. An average of forecasts by investment banks compiled by Bloomberg suggested that Tesla would deliver 440,907 vehicles in the fourth quarter.\n\nInvestment banks often publish sales and profit forecasts for large companies in order to judge the prospects for share price movements. “Missing” consensus forecasts often result in share price declines, and vice versa for a “beat”.\n\nThe forecasts for later years are also far below Musk’s stated targets. In November, Musk said the carmaker was trying to increase production by 50% by the end of 2026, and to produce 4m cars by the end of 2027, according to a transcript compiled by AlphaSense, a data company. However, the forecasts suggest the carmaker will hit the 3m mark only in 2029.\n\nTesla shareholders in November approved a $1tn compensation plan for Musk, in part on the basis of Tesla delivering 20m cars. Of those cars, 10m will have to have active subscriptions for “full self-driving”, its autonomous software, in order for Musk to qualify for the payment.",

    "fullText": "How the tech CEO and ‘Dogefather’ made a mess of the year – from an apparent Nazi salute during his White House tenure to Tesla sales slumps and Starship explosions\n\nThe year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\n\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\n\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\n\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\n\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\n\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\n\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\n\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\n\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\n\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\n\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\n\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\n\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\n\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\n\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\n\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\n\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\n\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\n\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\n\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\n\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\n\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\n\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\n\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\n\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\n\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\n\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\n\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\n\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\n\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”",

    "fullText": "From Stanley Tucci’s imperious tech titan to Lex Luthor’s distractingly hot CEO and Elon Musk-esque blowhards, films this year took us inside the billionaire mindset\n\nBetween the slash-and-burn US government reboot led by a dank meme fan and the relentless pushing of AI by venture capital-backed blowhards, 2025 has felt like peak obnoxious tech bro. Fittingly, jargon-spouting, self-regarding digital visionaries also became Hollywood’s go-to baddies this year in everything from blockbusters to slapstick spoofs. Spare a thought for the overworked props departments tasked with mocking up fake Forbes magazine covers heralding yet another smirking white guy as “Master of the Metaverse” or whatever.\n\nWith such market saturation, the risk is that all these delusional dudes blend into one smarmy morass. It felt reasonable to expect that Stanley Tucci might sprinkle a little prosciutto on The Electric State, Netflix’s no-expense-spared alt-history robot fantasia. As Ethan Skate – creator of the “neurocaster” technology that quashed an AI uprising then turned the general populace into listless virtual-reality addicts – Tucci certainly looked the part: bald and imperious in retro Bond villain wardrobe. But even the great cocktail-maker couldn’t squeeze much out of sour existential proclamations such as: “Our world is a tyre fire floating on an ocean of piss.”\n\nThere was more baldness in Superman, where Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor embodied the worst kind of wannabe paradigm-changer: one desperate to appear on talkshows. Incensed that the world seemed to be ignoring his genius in favour of a flying alien do-gooder, the LuthorCorp founder spent a fortune to rig social media, deploying an army of vivisected monkey cyborgs to swamp platforms with anti-Superman hashtags and memes. That the film itself was met with farmed outrage about perceived wokeness added a disconcerting hall-of-mirrors feel to what was essentially an overstuffed crowdpleaser. Hoult’s Lex was also a distractingly hot tech CEO, which pushed the film further into the realm of fantasy.\n\nIs it more appealing when these self-regarding douchebags are funny? In the heightened world of killer doll action thriller M3gan 2.0, Jemaine Clement was sleazily overconfident as Alton Appleton, a high-functioning billionaire whose latest wheeze was pushing an unwanted neural implant on the masses. Seduced by an impassive fembot assassin, Alton was humiliated in his final moments, his signature Altwave tech effortlessly hacked, his weird prosthetic six-pack coming unstuck. It was pathetic but humanising. As the movie trundled on, you actually began to miss him.\n\nIf Clement nailed tech bro obliviousness, Danny Huston had to remain deadpan opposite Liam Neeson’s blathering Frank Drebin Jr in The Naked Gun reboot. Huston’s Richard Cane was a hybrid Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk-esque blowhard who used the galactic profits from his online retail and electric car empires to make a Primordial Law of Toughness device . His master plan was to zap the general public back to a prehistoric mindset, violently culling the herd and ushering in a new age for humankind (or at least his zillionaire class). Cane was obsessed with men’s sperm counts, building luxury bunkers for the super-rich and Black Eyed Peas. In other words: truly psychotic.\n\nIn the goopy, grungy world of The Toxic Avenger reboot, Kevin Bacon’s floppy-haired biotech baddie Bob Garbinger stood out simply because he looked so pale and pampered. While it’s not a great sign when a self-proclaimed “healthstyle” guru gets Sisyphus and syphilis mixed up, Garbinger’s habit of going shirtless while flogging “proprietary cutting-edge bio-boosters” in TV ads felt like a timely skewering of immortality-seeking biohackers such as Bryan Johnson.\n\nIn 2022, Evan Peters played the lead in Netflix’s ghoulish Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Did that influence his casting as a second-generation nepo baby in Tron: Ares? To be fair, his Julian Dillinger – grandson of David Warner’s boardroom bully from the original 1982 Tron – seemed more neurotic than psychotic: a baby-faced tech huckster with crappy circuit board sleeve tattoos whose audacious move into 3D-printing wicked neon war machines and digital commandos was only slightly scuppered by the fact that they imploded within 30 minutes. A wildly expensive, resource-intensive, essentially useless product? Intentionally or not, it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the AI bubble.\n\nBut why stop at just one douchey tech bro? Jesse Armstrong’s jagged satire Mountainhead took the bold step of making every single character the absolute worst of the “move fast, break stuff” billionaire mindset, isolating them – and the viewer – in a remote, repellently deluxe ski lodge while the spectre of possible Armageddon encroached. As the Musk-alike owner of a social media app spreading dangerous AI-augmented misinformation, Cory Michael Smith captured the glib, morality-agnostic tone of someone richer than God who views the world as their plaything.\n\nAs Venis (Smith), silverback investor Randall (Steve Carell), canny algorithm tamer Jeff (Ramy Youssef) and would-be wellness app supremo Souper (Jason Schwartzman) relentlessly needled each other, there was the illicit thrill of dialling into the combative quartet’s inside-baseball repartee of boasting, toasting and roasting. But as the globe lurched further into chaos, watching these four nominal thought leaders clumsily workshop how best to exploit the situation was depressing, not least because it seemed so plausible. We have all been forced to absorb the pathologies of our tech overlords due to their disproportionate influence in the real world. As a new cinema year looms, is it too much to ask that we don’t have to keep doing it at the movies too?",

    "description": "Musk was commenting on Audrey Morris, a now-19-year-old U.S. native who was at risk of deportation from Denmark",
    "fullText": "A teen who faced deportation in Denmark has said 54-year-old tech billionaire Elon Musk’s remarks about her “hotness” are “crazy.”\n\nIn a now-deleted X post from Sunday, Musk commented on the story of Audrey Morris, a now-19-year-old U.S. native who was at risk of deportation from the country where she’s mostly lived since she was 9 years old.\n\n“8 or above level hotness should get an exemption,” Musk wrote with a laughing emoji.\n\nMorris said she wasn’t “surprised” by Musk’s comment, but that “it’s definitely crazy.”\n\n“From the beginning, the second that my case was kind of made public, it has been about appearances and because, ‘oh, she’s blonde and she’s white!’ And so the thing he said in of itself wasn’t shocking to me, but coming from him, yes, it was definitely...I was floored,” she told the Daily Beast.\n\nThe Independent has reached out for comment from Musk and Morris.\n\nAccording to the Danish newspaper, Århus Stiftstidende, Morris has lived in Aarhus, a city on Denmark’s east coast, for most of her life.\n\nThe newspaper reported last January that Danish authorities had decided not to extend her residence permit as an accompanying family member because she was not living with her mother while completing high school in Viborg, about an hour’s drive northwest of Aarhus. At the time, Morris’ application for permanent residence was being processed.\n\n“It would’ve been really cool if he commented something like, ‘Oh wow, look how many academic things she’s reached,’ or whatever. That would’ve been great. It could have been so helpful,” Morris, originally from Los Angeles, said of Musk.\n\nBut she said “if this just at least brings it to the attention of anyone who cares, then I’m fine with being embarrassed a little bit. That’s okay.”\n\nThe Daily Beast reported Morris was ultimately given a 10-year residency permit but was denied citizenship.\n\nMusk, who had a small stint in the White House as head of Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency before his public fall out with the president, has made his stance on illegal immigration known, saying during the Biden administration that the influx of undocumented migrants was “crushing the country.”\n\nBut the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who was born in South Africa and eventually gained American citizenship, has defended legal immigration, specifically H1-B visas. Musk said during a podcast with entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath that aired in late November that his companies use the temporary employment program because of the “scarcity of talented people.”",

He also claimed that similar situations are occurring in Europe, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nAlso Read: Elon Musk Says He Warned Donald Trump To Drop Tariffs Over Fears of Job Losses: ‘President Loves Tariffs, I’ve Tried To Dissuade Him’\n\n“The radical left has been using fraudulent government programs for a long time to import and retain vast numbers of illegal (and legal, in some cases) immigrants to win elections and turn America into a single-party state, destroying any real democracy. The more you look at it, the more you will be horrified at what your tax money is doing and the fact that, if this is not reversed, your vote will mean nothing. The most obvious case example is the Somali voting bloc in Minnesota, a state that historically had zero Somalis, electing Ilhan Omar to the US Congress. The same is happening in Europe, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand,” he wrote in the post.\n\nMusk’s comments come at a time when immigration policies are a hotly debated topic both in the United States and globally. His assertion that these policies are being manipulated for political gain is likely to fuel further debate.\n\nThe tech mogul’s influence and reach, with millions of followers on social media, mean his views can have significant impact on public discourse.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that Musk’s claims are his personal views and are not supported by any provided evidence.\n\nThe impact of immigration on electoral outcomes is a complex issue and the subject of ongoing research and debate among experts.\n\nElon Musk Tells Joe Rogan: ‘Trump Actually Is Not Perfect, but He's Not Evil'\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

    "fullText": "Just like a long line of executives before them, leaders of some of the world's hottest firms are learning to hate an age-old enemy: short sellers.\n\nLast month, Palantir CEO Alex Karp had a meltdown of sorts about the subject. When asked about short sellers, aka investors betting against the company's stock, Karp unloaded on the naysayers.\n\n\"They could pick on any company in the world. They have to pick on the one that actually helps people, that's actually made money for the average person, that is actually supporting our war fighters,\" Karp said on CNBC. (It should be noted that some would debate that characterization; Palantir is often criticized for its work with the US government on surveillance and immigration enforcement.)\n\n\"These people, they claim to be ethical,\" Karp continued, adding that \"they're actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"\n\nSam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, also recently expressed his discontent with those who are skeptical about his firm's valuation. While his company is private, Altman said he sometimes wishes it were public so that he could take it to short sellers.\n\n\"There are not many times I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times that it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous, 'OpenAI is about to go out of business,'\" Altman told the Bg2 Pod in October. \"I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that.\"\n\nAnd while he hasn't been as outspoken about short-sellers per se, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang responded to AI bubble concerns during the firm's earnings call in November, saying \"there's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" and \"from our vantage point, we see something very different.\"\n\nThese rising titans of the AI era are the latest business moguls to direct their ire at short sellers. The distaste for investors who put their money on the line to bet that a company's shares will decline is a decadeslong tradition. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has famously battled investors who have bet against the electric vehicle maker. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen has called the practice \"un-American.\" The pushback it's understandable: executives put a massive amount of work into building and running their companies, and when someone bets against them, it can feel personal.\n\nHowever, CEOs like Karp need to understand that attracting the attention of shorts is part of the natural life cycle of a company and a healthy market mechanism that allows a range of views to compete. One could even argue that Karp should take pride in the fact that he's grown his company to a size that draws such fervent skeptics. In a sense, it's a badge of honor. He's made it to the big leagues.\n\nInvesting in a company you believe in is straightforward: simply buy the stock. Betting against a company by shorting its stock, on the other hand, is a bit more complex. To do it, an investor borrows shares from their brokerage and agrees to return them by a specified date. The investor then sells the borrowed shares in the open market. When it's time to return the shares to the lender, the investor purchases the agreed-upon amount at the prevailing market price. If the price of the stock falls within that time, the short-seller can then buy back the shares at a lower price, earning a profit. If they got it wrong and the company's stock is higher, well, they've lost money. For example, if you think a company's stock is overvalued at $100 a share, you can borrow 10 shares from a broker for a total value of $1,000. You agree to give the shares back at the end of the month. On the day the deadline hits, if the stock has fallen to $50 a share, you buy up the amount you need to return and pocket a tidy $500 gain. But if that stock were to get hot instead, and rises to $300 a share, you're out $2,000 — a nasty hit. It goes without saying that short-selling can be extremely risky. While a long investor can lose all of their money, a short-seller can, in theory, lose infinite sums.\n\nIt's especially tricky to short small companies. Since there are fewer investors buying and selling their shares, even small amounts of buying can cause the price to rise dramatically. This can create problems for short sellers if they suddenly need to return the shares to their lender, a process known as covering their position. If the supply of shares is low and demand suddenly increases, it can drive the price of a stock through the roof, cutting the short seller even deeper. It's a phenomenon known as a short squeeze, and it's what famously happened to short sellers Gabe Plotkin and Andrew Left during the GameStop saga.\n\n\"Short sellers absolutely want to make sure they have plenty of liquidity, and so that's why it's so dangerous to short something that's pretty small,\" said Ryan Kelley, the chief investment officer at Hennessy Funds, which manages around $4 billion.\n\nDerivatives markets, more complex financial products that allow for even more exotic bets on the direction of a stock, also become larger when a stock becomes more prominent, thereby providing the opportunity for more people to bet against a company. After all, to short a stock, you need an investor to lend shares to you.\n\n\"The reality is, as companies get bigger, the derivatives market in companies grows. And as the derivatives market grows, there's more folks that will be taking positions,\" said Maurits Pot, the founder of Tema ETFs, which manages around $1 billion after launching in 2023.\n\nSo, the fact that Palantir is drawing short-sellers is, in a way, a badge of honor for Karp. When you get as big as Palantir — which is up 1,720% since its IPO in October 2020 — short bets are going to happen. Sure, some of these increased bets are because there are more people who think the company is on the wrong path, but a lot of times, short interest can increase for more technical reasons — many of them to do with the size of the company. When a company grows, so does the variety of opinions on its stock performance. And that's OK.\n\nThere are several reasons shorting is a necessary component of a robust market.\n\nFirst, short-sellers act as a check, helping to call out companies for a range of bad behaviors, from corporate malfeasance to incompetent management. On the extreme end, short sellers have used research, data analysis, and information gathering to expose cases of serious fraud, accounting tricks, and blatant deception. For example, fraudulent behavior at the pharmaceutical company Valeant was exposed in 2015 when short-sellers sounded the alarm about the firm. On the more quotidian side, investors betting against a company have called out executives and management teams for taking a company in the wrong direction. Some individuals will do it publicly, sharing their thesis for why a stock is overvalued. But since the amount of short interest can be tracked, a rising number of quieter short bets can make investors and regulators more aware of the risks associated with a particular firm. In these instances, short sellers have a financial interest in seeing the stock go down, but they are also trying to serve the public interest.\n\n\"It's a possibility that people can be adamantly against the way you're running a business,\" Kelley said, \"and it should be that they're able to actually put their money where their mouth is — in other words, short the stock and be vocal about it.\"\n\nIn other cases, short sellers may not think the company itself is doing anything egregious, but rather that other investors in the market are overreacting. Tesla's stock has often traded at nosebleed valuations due to its fanatical investor following, drawing short interest simply because it has traded above its fundamentals at times.\n\nOf course, there are bad actors — some short sellers have been charged with taking a short position on a stock and then drumming up negative headlines about the company to send its share price tumbling, sometimes coordinating with other short sellers. In other words, not simply talking their book, but being disingenuous or lying. These more questionable motivations make short sellers an easy target, and are likely what raised Karp's rankles. But the notion that short-selling in and of itself is harmful is not fair, Pot said.\n\n\"The idea that you can't be shorting, I think that's — I wouldn't say it's anti-competitive — but it impedes the natural impulse of the market, which is that there are companies that are shorted for good reason,\" Pot said.\n\n\"Short selling is core to the market,\" Pot continued, \"and I think as long as short selling doesn't become a coordinated, speculative attack, I think it's part of the regular functioning of capital markets.\"\n\nIn this same vein, short sellers can temper the euphoria in bubble periods. When the market is ripping and Wall Street strategists are loath to issue a downbeat, bearish forecast, it can be helpful to hear arguments for why a standout stock or a particularly hot market theme has gone too far. And because losses can be infinite for short sellers, putting their money where their mouth is tells you about their degree of conviction. It's essentially what Michael Burry — who gained fame shorting the housing market leading up to the 2008 crash — did a few weeks ago, when he questioned the assumed rate of depreciation on GPUs, arguing that they'll become obsolete in just a couple of years. With this argument now at the top of investors' minds, you might argue that stocks are more efficiently priced.\n\nAnother important role that short sellers play is providing liquidity in the market. While an investor would ordinarily hold their shares, lending them to a short-seller to auction off to the market allows these shares to continue circulating through the system. And when they eventually have to cover their positions and repurchase their shares, they provide exit liquidity to people looking to sell. Higher liquidity levels enable investors to enter and exit positions more quickly and at closer proximity to the market price.\n\nExecutives like Karp shouldn't take short-selling to heart. Instead, they should recognize its important market function, and wear it as a feather in their cap — a sign that their company is maturing into adulthood.\n\nWilliam Edwards is a senior investing reporter at Business Insider primarily covering the US stock market and the broader economy.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is resorting to one of the oldest tricks in the book, robbing Peter to pay Paul, to boost demand for Cybertrucks.\n\nElectrek reported on how Musk is using one of his companies, SpaceX, to help make up for a massive shortfall of a market for the controversial Cybertruck.\n\nTesla is facing challenges selling even 20,000 Cybertrucks annually, far below Musk's initial projections of 500,000, per Electrek's analysis. As a result, Tesla is left with large stockpiles of the vehicles even as they've heavily reduced their production.\n\nMaking a small dent in the inventory is SpaceX. The company has already bought over 1,000 Cybertrucks with room to double its fleet. An X user shared a video of a lot teeming with the vehicles.\n\nAt a starting retail price of $80,000, SpaceX's purchases could add up to anywhere between $80 million to $160 million in sales for Tesla.\n\nAs Electrek pointed out, there is nothing illegal about Musk's machinations here. Still, essentially having to bail out a failing product isn't good news for Tesla nor the best move for SpaceX.\n\nInvestors certainly should be concerned that Musk's moves here are self-serving. There's also the matter of SpaceX receiving large help from the government, and then turning around and buying Cybertrucks.\n\n\"In other words, government subsidies that were meant to get us back to the moon are being used to buy unsellable trucks that look like big dumpsters,\" a frustrated commenter on Electrek opined.\n\nMusk's struggles in moving Cybertrucks provide another example of overpromising and underdelivering. Before it was released, the vehicle had over one million reservations. Only a mere 60,000 of those were converted into sales.\n\nDo you think America should produce more car parts than it does now?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nElectrek chalked up that failure to consumers picking up on a bait-and-switch from Tesla after unveiling their 2019 prototype. The actual Cybertruck is more expensive, has less range, and boasts fewer attractive features.",

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated.

The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025.

The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown.

    "fullText": "Moving at superspeed isn't limited to SpaceX's rockets.\n\nElon Musk's satellite and rocket company has secured one million new customers for its Starlink internet in under seven weeks and is now active in 155 markets, the company wrote in a post on X on Monday evening.\n\n\"Starlink is connecting more than 9M active customers with high-speed internet across 155 countries, territories, and many other markets,\" the company said.\n\nIn a similar post from November 5, SpaceX said Starlink had 8 million customers, meaning that its customer base has expanded at a rate of more than 20,000 per day since that date.\n\nSpaceX, which uses a constellation of more than 9,000 low-orbit satellites to provide its Starlink internet connection, including to remote areas, is reportedly planning to go public next year at a valuation of $1.5 trillion.\n\nElon Musk, who founded the company in 2002, said this month that the satellite network was \"by far\" the largest driver of SpaceX's revenue.\n\nThe numbers close an explosive year of growth for SpaceX. In a December 2024 progress report, SpaceX said Starlink had 4.6 million customers, and by August 2025, the number was up to 7 million.\n\nGlobal web traffic from users on SpaceX's satellite-based internet service more than doubled in 2025, according to data from Cloudflare, a cybersecurity company that handles tens of millions of requests between users and websites every second.\n\nAround two dozen airlines have also announced plans to use Starlink to offer high-speed WiFi on their planes, and SpaceX has signalled it could soon launch its own mobile carrier service powered by the satellite network.\n\nSpaceX has successfully commercialized reusable rockets, a feat previously thought impossible by many within the space industry, and now launches more cargo into orbit than any other company.\n\nIt has also capitalized on opportunities that emerged as NASA and the Pentagon moved away from government-only spaceflight, and filled a massive unmet demand in global connectivity.\n\nLed by Musk, who is the CEO and founder, SpaceX is also known for its intense, efficiency-driven culture.\n\nSpaceX ultimately plans to fulfill its billionaire founder's ambitious visions of colonizing Mars and putting data centers in space with its giant Starship rocket.\n\nSpaceX did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.",

    "fullText": "The explosion of a SpaceX rocket put multiple passenger planes in danger, with one pilot declaring “Mayday” before being forced to fly through the debris.\n\nThe experimental rocket ship belonging to Elon Musk’s company disintegrated minutes after lift-off in January, which scattered fiery debris across the Caribbean region, causing widespread disruptions to air traffic.\n\nPilots of the three planes, carrying a total of 450 people, were forced to decide whether to fly through a field of rocket debris or risk running low on fuel over water, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents.\n\nThe files, which the Wall Street Journal reviewed, revealed the Jan 16 explosion posed a greater danger to planes in the air than was publicly known.\n\nThe explosion rained a meteor-like shower of debris across parts of the Caribbean for about 50 minutes and could have put lives at risk, according to the FAA.\n\nFiery trails shooting through the sky were visible from the cockpits and cabins of commercial aircraft and private jets. If a piece of debris had struck an aircraft in flight, it could have caused severe damage to the plane and possible passenger fatalities.\n\nAll flights eventually landed safely.\n\nThe un-crewed Starship test flight was Musk’s seventh attempt at launching a rocket ship into space in his quest to make life on Mars a reality. Responding to the explosion, the billionaire posted on social media: “Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!”\n\nDuring the incident, an air-traffic controller told one of the planes, a JetBlue flight en route to Puerto Rico: “You want to go to San Juan, it’s going to be at your own risk.”\n\nThe other two, a private jet and Iberia Airlines flight, also declared fuel emergencies and travelled through the temporary no-fly zone, the WSJ reported.\n\nA controller in Puerto Rico told pilots they would have to declare an emergency to land at the capital. One pilot responded: “In that case, we declare emergency: Mayday. Mayday, Mayday.”\n\nAir traffic controllers working on the issue had to try to divert planes from the debris areas, increasing their workload and causing a “potential extreme safety risk”, according to one FAA report from an air-traffic facility in New York.\n\nAt least two planes flew too close to each other, requiring a controller to intervene to avoid a collision, according to the documents.\n\nAs well as the extreme safety risk, the FAA recorded that SpaceX failed to call an emergency hotline immediately following the explosion. Controllers in Miami first heard of the explosion from pilots seeing the debris, not from Musk’s company.\n\nSpace X, the world’s busiest rocket launcher, has already launched 11 Starship missions and is planning future flights over Florida, Mexico and North Atlantic aeroplane routes. Starship, which stands at 400ft tall, is the most powerful rocket ever developed, according to the company.\n\nThe explosion alarmed airline industry and US government officials because of its impact on air travel and the growing number of space operations.\n\nThe safety risk of debris is set to keep increasing. The FAA predicts an annual average of 200 to 400 rocket launches or re-entries in the years ahead, compared to 24 operations on average each year between 1989 and 2024.\n\nFollowing the January incident, the agency set up a panel of experts to conduct a safety review to examine how to deal with debris risks from spaceflight failures.\n\nFAA officials suspended the review in August, claiming that most of the safety recommendations were already being implemented. The unusual move surprised the panel members.\n\nSince the January explosion, SpaceX has conducted four more Starship launches, two of which were successful, while two failed.\n\nDuring the test in March, the engines failed shortly after lift-off, leading the rocket to spin out of control and explode mid-air. In May, the rocket spun out of control and broke apart near its intended splashdown location in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe company plans to launch a new, more powerful version next year. Musk has already predicted there would be problems. He said on a podcast in September he warned that the rocket “might have some initial teething pains because it’s such a radical redesign”.\n\nThe Telegraph has approached SpaceX for comment.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "CEO Elon Musk claimed more than 200,000 orders for the vehicle following its botched reveal in 2019.",
    "fullText": "During the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, the company’s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, threw steel balls at the truck to demonstrate its sturdiness, but instead shattered two windows. In an interview, von Holzhausen said the mishap became a “great marketing moment.” Tesla began selling T-shirts alluding to the accident, and CEO Elon Musk claimed the company saw 200,000 orders for Cybertrucks in the days following its launch.\n\nSome may call Franz von Holzhausen’s accidental destruction of a Tesla Cybertruck window a blunder; von Holzhausen would prefer to call it a “great meme” instead.\n\nDuring the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, von Holzhausen, the company’s chief designer, threw steel balls at the vehicle, intending to demonstrate the windows CEO Elon Musk that said were made of “armor glass” were indeed extra tough. The windows, however, unexpectedly shattered, leaving Musk to deliver the rest of his presentation of the new truck while standing in front of the damaged car. Tesla’s stock fell more than 5% the next day.\n\nWhile the incident seemed like an omen, indicative of the Cybertruck being poised to fail, the botched demonstration actually opened up an opportunity to give the new model a spotlight, von Holzhausen said in an interview with Tesla Club Austria published earlier this year.\n\n“It was just one of those Murphy’s Law kind of things where something bad happens, but it turned out to be a great meme,” von Holzhausen said, referring to the phenomenon of when something can go wrong, it usually will. “And I think in an odd sort of way—we don’t do marketing—but it turned into a great marketing moment.”\n\nHe added, “It was not an expected moment, but in that moment, you have to roll with it.”\n\nFollowing the reveal of the vehicle, Musk posted a video on X of von Holzhausen throwing a steel ball at the model Cybertruck before its launch, with its windows withstanding the force of the throw with no visible damage. The video was viewed more than 6 million times within three days of its posting.\n\n“Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha,” Musk wrote.\n\nDays later, Musk touted the success of the Cybertruck launch, saying Tesla had received more than 200,000 orders for the vehicle. While Tesla does not break out Cybertruck numbers when it reports earnings, instead grouping them with the Model S and X, the company recalled nearly all of the Cybertrucks it had on the road earlier this year due to an issue in which an exterior panel could become detached, and that only tallied around 46,000 vehicles.",

    "fullText": "Decision from state supreme court on deal once worth $56bn and now worth some $139bn overturns ruling that prompted angry Musk backlash\n\nElon Musk’s controversial $56bn pay package from Tesla was reinstated by the Delaware supreme court on Friday, two years after a lower court struck down the vast compensation deal as “unfathomable”.\n\nThe reinstated pay package could be worth as much as $139bn today, according to the New York Times. The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan that could be worth $1tn to Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time. Musk’s fortune currently stands at an estimated $600bn.\n\nRescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, the Delaware supreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.\n\nAt the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or \n\nBoth of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.\n\nThe case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.\n\nNot only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publicly lashed out against the state and specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.\n\n“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.\n\nTesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”, as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.\n\nMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.\n\n“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.\n\nIn Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.\n\nHowever, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.\n\nWhile Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically been home to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies – experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.",

He moved those companies to Texas in 2024.\n\nDespite Delaware's position as a central incorporation hub, a series of court rulings left some prominent companies wondering if they could find stronger legal protections somewhere else, including VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe firm announced in July that its primary business, AH Capital Management, would no longer be incorporated in Delaware because \"legal uncertainty\" had worried investors and entrepreneurs on its board.\n\n\"As a result, many of the companies we fund and the entrepreneurs that we talk to are taking a second look at whether they should incorporate in other jurisdictions, prompted by the departure from Delaware of significant technology companies like Dropbox, Tripadvisor, and Tesla,\" the firm said in a blog post.\n\nThe firm said it's reincorporating in Nevada, an increasingly popular alternative.\n\nBusinesses incorporated in Delaware account for a large chunk of the state's revenue. As of 2024, more than 2.1 million businesses were incorporated in Delaware, meaning a widespread exodus could do serious damage to its economy.\n\nEven so, Delaware Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez told Business Insider that officials aren't spooked by the \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"What our data is showing is that Delaware is still the preeminent place to incorporate your business,\" she said.\n\nPatibanda-Sanchez added: \"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way. We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "description": "\"I'm not sure anybody's going to trust an encyclopedia that has a thumb on the scales,\" Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales told The Verge.",
    "fullText": "The cofounder of Wikipedia isn't so sure people trust Elon Musk's AI-powered rival, Grokipedia.\n\nMusk launched Grokipedia in October after years of accusing Wikipedia of left-wing bias. In an interview with The Verge, Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales said that he had only looked at Grokipedia \"a little.\"\n\nAsked for his thoughts, Wales referenced some of the backlash to Musk's AI-based encyclopedia.\n\n\"I think a lot of the criticism that it's getting is not surprising to me,\" Wales said.\n\n\"I also think in terms of the question of trust, I'm not sure anybody's going to trust an encyclopedia that has a thumb on the scales,\" he added.\n\nWales looked to draw a distinction between himself and Musk. When Wales doesn't like something on Wikipedia, he opens a conversation, he said. That compares to Musk, who Wales suggested would likely change things he disagreed with himself.\n\nMusk has a history of getting involved in the details of his companies and making top-down leadership calls. During his Twitter takeover, Musk ordered that the social platform's algorithm prioritize serving his own posts to users more frequently, X employees told \"Extremely Hardcore\" author Zoe Schiffer, who reported on the development for Platformer.\n\nWales also pointed to the use of Grok, xAI's large language model, for writing and editing entries.\n\n\"I use large language models a lot and I know about the hallucination problem, and I see it all the time,\" he said. \"Large language models really aren't good enough to write an encyclopedia.\"\n\nWikipedia, which undoubtedly is looking to prevent its users from switching to a rival like Grokipedia, allows itself to be scraped by AI bots. Some Grokipedia pages are almost identical to the Wikipedia entries, users have found.\n\nWales referenced reports that Grokipedia's entries \"agree with Elon Musk's political views.\" Business Insider identified key political differences between the two encyclopedias, particularly on topics such as the January 6 Capitol Riots and the 2014 Gamergate controversy.\n\n\"It's Elon, but that might not be what we all want from an encyclopedia,\" Wales said.\n\nAccusations of left-wing bias have long been leveled against Wikipedia — including by Wales' cofounder. Larry Sanger left the online encyclopedia in 2002. Since then, he's called it \"badly biased\" and captured by \"liberals and leftists.\" (Wales previously told podcaster Lex Fridman that Sanger \"doesn't get enough credit\" for Wikipedia, but suggested \"cofounder's not the right title\" for his contributions.)\n\nMusk has big ambitions for Grokipedia. In November, Musk called the encyclopedia the \"modern-day Library of Alexandria,\" and said that he wanted to eventually send it to deep space.\n\nThe site seems to be growing. Since November, Grokipedia shifted from \"v0.1\" to \"v0.2.\" Its total article count grew to 1,089,057, up from the 885,279 it had when it launched.\n\nWikipedia, in comparison, has over 7 million articles.",

    "description": "At a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters, Musk discussed the company's future, its finances, and data centers in space.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk appears to be feeling upbeat about the future of his AI company.\n\nAt a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters last week, Musk told staff that if the company could survive the next two to three years, xAI would triumph over its competitors, several sources with knowledge of the meeting said.\n\nThe xAI CEO said that the company's ability to rapidly scale its power and data capacity would be a key ingredient in the race to achieve superintelligence — which surpasses human intelligence — and become the most powerful AI company.\n\nMusk said that xAI could achieve artificial general intelligence, which matches or exceeds human intelligence, in the next few years, even as soon as 2026, sources said.\n\nMusk said in November that xAI had a 10% likelihood of achieving AGI with its Grok 5 model, which he has said the company plans to release early next year.\n\nThe CEO also told staff that xAI would have an advantage over other AI companies because it would have access to around $20 billion to $30 billion in funding per year, and it could benefit from its proximity to his other companies, sources said. Tesla integrated Grok into its vehicles earlier this year.\n\nOverall, workers said Musk appeared happy with the company's progress. One insider described the meeting as \"peppy.\"\n\nMusk also theorized about building data centers in space and his plans to colonize Mars, the sources said. He said that Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot could eventually man such extraterrestrial data centers, the people said.\n\nMusk has previously said that Optimus could provide support for SpaceX missions as soon as next year. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have publicly talked about the possibility of building data centers in space, though Pichai acknowledged that it is a \"moonshot.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's request for a comment, the company responded with an automated message: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"\n\nOver the past year, xAI has rapidly expanded the footprint of its data centers, a project it has named Colossus. Earlier this year, the company said it had around 200,000 GPUs, and Musk has said it plans to expand to 1 million GPUs.\n\nxAI is one of many companies racing to build AGI and justify valuations worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite Musk's outsize profile, xAI is still a relatively new player in a race dominated by giants like OpenAI and Google.\n\nThe AI race shows no signs of slowing down. Earlier this month, OpenAI entered a state of emergency as it raced to push out its latest model, according to reports. Google released a new Gemini model in November, and xAI has pushed new versions of Grok in rapid succession.\n\nDuring the all-hands, xAI leads demonstrated several updates to existing products, such as Grok Voice, the company's app for Tesla owners, and its agents, sources said. Some of the updates included improvements to Grok's ability to predict outcomes, better listening functions for Grok voice, and video editing, the people said.\n\nDo you work at xAI or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Elon Musk's net worth has surged to a record $648 billion — and his wealth gain this year exceeds LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's entire $205 billion fortune, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO's wealth has jumped by $178 billion in just two days, boosting his year-to-date gain to an unmatched $216 billion.\n\nIf that figure were his entire fortune, he would rank sixth on the rich list — ahead of not just Arnault but also former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nMusk's record wealth partly reflects Tesla stock closing at an all-time high of $490 on Tuesday, as investors cheered news that the EV maker is testing driverless robotoxis on Austin, Texas streets. Musk holds a roughly 12% stake in Tesla, valued at around $200 billion.\n\nBut the bigger driver of his wealth surge this week has been SpaceX's valuation reportedly doubling since the summer to $800 billion, based on a secondary share sale by the aerospace company ahead of a potential IPO next year.\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is now more than twice as wealthy as number two on the rich list, Alphabet cofounder Larry Page, who's worth $264 billion after a year-to-date wealth gain of $96 billion — second only to Musk.\n\nHe's also more than four times as rich as Warren Buffett, the outgoing CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who's worth $150 billion after giving more than half of his fortune to good causes.\n\nMusk's personal fortune exceeds the market values of Oracle, Mastercard, and Johnson & Johnson — three of the 20 most valuable US public companies with market capitalizations exceeding $500 billion. His recent gains have narrowed the gap with Visa, which has a market value of $660 billion.\n\nThe serial entrepreneur has had a striking wealth recovery in recent months. Tesla stock roughly halved between mid-January and mid-March as his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sparked public backlash and worried shareholders that he was getting distracted.\n\nMusk even briefly lost his top spot on the rich list to Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison in September, before Tesla shares rallied to fresh highs.\n\nTesla and other huge US tech companies have seen their stock prices soar this year, fueled by immense buzz around AI. In Musk's case, he's excited investors by spending big on AI to develop Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\nThe AI boom has translated into huge wealth gains for key shareholders such as Musk, Page and his cofounder Sergey Brin, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang.\n\nMusk could become the world's first trillionaire after Tesla shareholders approved his pay package in November, which promises to roughly double his stake in Tesla over the next decade if he hits milestones such as selling 1 million Optimus robots and raising adjusted profits from around $17 billion last year to $400 billion.",

    "description": "\"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are,\" Susie Wiles said of Elon Musk Musk. \"You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\"",
    "fullText": "One of President Donald Trump's top aides has some thoughts on Elon Musk.\n\nIn a series of interviews with Vanity Fair published on Tuesday, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles weighed in on Musk's time as the de facto leader of DOGE, her thoughts on the Musk-led shuttering of USAID, and Musk's personality quirks.\n\n\"The challenge with Elon is keeping up with him,\" Wiles told the outlet, calling Musk an \"avowed ketamine\" user who \"sleeps in a sleeping bag\" in an office building adjacent to the White House during the daytime. \"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are. You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\"\n\nAsked about a meme Musk had reposted and later unshared about public sector workers murdering people under the dictatorships of Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong, Wiles said: \"I think that's when he's microdosing.\"\n\nIn June, Musk denied being a current ketamine user, writing on X that he was \"NOT taking drugs.\" He said he'd had a prescription for the drug \"a few years ago\" but hadn't taken it since then.\n\nReached for further comment on Tuesday, a spokesperson for Musk's xAI told Business Insider: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"\n\nIn a separate interview on Monday with the New York Times, Wiles denied commenting on Musk's drug use, saying she \"wouldn't have said it and I wouldn't know.\" But the Times reported that the journalist Chris Whipple, who interviewed Wiles for Vanity Fair, played a tape for the Times in which she could be heard making the comments.\n\nOne of the most notable features of Musk's White House tenure was the sudden dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID.\n\n\"I was initially aghast,\" Wiles told Vanity Fair. \"Because I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work.\"\n\nWiles said the dismantling of USAID was \"not the way\" she would do it, and that she told Musk that he \"can't just lock people out of their offices.\"\n\n\"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,\" Wiles said. \"And so with that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.\"\n\nMusk left the White House in the spring and had a falling-out with Trump over the \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" though the two men appear to have mended their relationship in recent months.\n\nWiles wrote on X on Tuesday morning that the Vanity Story was a \"disingenuously framed hit piece,\" and that \"significant context was disregarded\" in order to \"paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.\"\n\nAsked about Wiles's comments, the White House sent Business Insider a supportive statement from Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n\"Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history,\" Leavitt said. \"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie. The entire Administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her.\"",

    "description": "Global web traffic from SpaceX's satellite-based internet service more than doubled in 2025, according to Cloudflare's annual year in review report.",
    "fullText": "SpaceX is reportedly preparing for a monster IPO — and a booming Starlink is a big reason why.\n\nGlobal web traffic from SpaceX's satellite-based internet service more than doubled in 2025, according to data from Cloudflare, a cybersecurity company that handles tens of millions of requests between users and websites every second.\n\nIt's the latest year of explosive traffic growth for Starlink, which uses a constellation of more than 9,000 low-orbit satellites to provide internet connection, including to remote areas.\n\nSpaceX said in November that the service has 8 million active customers, up from 4 million in September 2024, and is now online in over 150 markets.\n\nAround 23 airlines have also announced plans to use Starlink to offer high-speed WiFi on their planes, and SpaceX has signalled it could soon launch its own mobile carrier service powered by the satellite network.\n\nStarlink's growth comes as reports suggest a colossal SpaceX public listing is on the cards. Elon Musk seemed to confirm on Wednesday that the rocket maker is considering an IPO as early as next year, which multiple outlets have reported could see SpaceX valued at around $1.5 trillion.\n\nThat would catapult SpaceX into the list of the world's most valuable companies, and potentially put Musk within touching distance of becoming the first-ever trillionaire.\n\nSince its founding by Musk in 2002, SpaceX has successfully commercialized reusable rockets, a feat previously thought impossible by many within the space industry, and now launches more cargo into orbit than any other company.\n\nIn the long term, SpaceX aims to fulfill its billionaire founder's ambitious visions of colonizing Mars and putting data centers in space with its giant Starship rocket.\n\nFor now, however, the Texas-based company's huge valuation is driven by the success of Starlink, with Musk saying this month that the satellite network was \"by far\" the largest driver of SpaceX's revenue.\n\nCloudflare's annual report found that in the more than 20 countries and regions where Starlink launched in 2025, internet traffic from its satellite service surged immediately after the service became available. Cloudflare said that internet traffic grew 295% in Botswana this year, with Starlink launching in the African country in August 2024.\n\nThere's no sign of Starlink slowing down, with SpaceX preparing to launch the service in India next year.\n\nThere's also little sign of major competition. Rival services, including Amazon's Leo and China's Spacesail, are attempting to build their own constellations, but they have launched fewer satellites than Starlink.",

    "fullText": "An X user recorded a Tesla Model Y driving through Austin's streets on Sunday that appears to show no one, not even a safety monitor, inside.\n\nSince Tesla launched its robotaxi in Austin in June, the driverless cars have always included a human in the passenger seat.\n\nThe video generated a fair amount of excitement online from Tesla watchers, some of whom immediately went to their app to order a robotaxi to see whether it would include a safety monitor (they did).\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk later said on Sunday that the company is now testing driverless taxis without human safety operators, though it appears not yet on actual paying customers.\n\n\"Testing is underway with no occupants in the car,\" Musk wrote in response to the X user who posted the original video.\n\nTesla itself responded to the video with \"Just saying.\"\n\nTesla's AI chief, Ashok Elluswamy, also responded. \"And so it begins!\" he wrote on X on Sunday.\n\nA driverless Tesla Robotaxi was spotted on the roads of Austin, Texas today.No one in the car. No safety driver.Fully autonomous.This is actually happening. pic.twitter.com/MSmRaeyJwj\n\nAccording to Robotaxi Tracker — run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna — there are 31 active vehicles in Austin, up from 29 in November. Speaking on the \"All-In\" podcast in October, Musk said that Tesla was aiming to increase its robotaxi fleet to 500 cars in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nMusk said in a video call at an xAI \"hackathon\" event last week that Tesla would remove human safety monitors from its robotaxi cars by the end of the year, according to Teslarati, a news site focused on Musk-run companies.\n\n\"There will be Tesla robotaxis operating in Austin with no one in them, not even anyone in the passenger seat, in about three weeks,\" Musk said, the outlet reported.\n\nWhen Business Insider tested a robotaxi in Austin in July, it required multiple interventions from the safety monitor in the passenger seat, including at one point when the car went the wrong way on a one-way street.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Tesla-investor-turned-bear Ross Gerber says that Elon Musk needs to show results on the company's biggest initiatives in 2026 or face investor backlash.",
    "fullText": "Ross Gerber, an early backer of Tesla, is worried about the future of Elon Musk's car company.\n\nGerber doesn't hold back about what he thinks is the EV maker's biggest issue: its autonomous driving technology. Failure to live up to expectations would be a blow to investors' bull thesis for Tesla, which is pegged in large part to the success of its self-driving cars.\n\nGerber, the founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, has been a vocal Tesla bear all year. His perspective hasn't changed as Musk's company has rolled out driverless cars in cities across the US, and what he's seen has actually made him more concerned.\n\nGerber told Business Insider why he thinks 2026 will be a pivotal year for the EV maker, in which Musk will be forced to show real progress on the lofty goals he's set for Tesla.\n\nAnyone who follows Gerber knows that he has gone from a Musk supporter to an outspoken Tesla bear in recent years. He's publicly called for Musk to resign and criticized his focus on other ventures, such as his time leading the Department of Government Efficiency and his efforts to buy X before that.\n\nMusk stepped away from government months ago, but Gerber maintains that the time he spent away from his companies is still hurting Tesla stock, particularly as the it dukes it out with competitors in the self-driving car market.\n\n\"The year that Elon took off from Tesla really cost Tesla a year,\" Gerber told Business Insider.\n\nIn that time, Tesla's chief competitor, Waymo, has continued to dominate the self-driving car market. Gerber attributes this to Musk's refusal to use LidAR technology in Tesla's vehicles, a remote sensing method that has helped Waymo increase the safety of its cars on the road.\n\n\"Waymo has expanded rapidly in our area,\" he said. \"So Tesla has to accept, if they just throw a couple sensors on and improve their hardware system, they can solve full self-driving next month.\"\n\nHowever, Gerber thinks that Musk will continue to favor the use of AI and cameras. And since Musk has staked much of Tesla's future on its self-driving car technology, he thinks this approach is about to start costing the company.\n\nOverall, Gerber thinks that 2026 will be the year Musk needs to show investors results of Tesla's many initiatives or face backlash from the market.\n\n\"I've been saying this for some time, next year is kind of like the come-to-Jesus year for Tesla,\" he said.\n\nMusk has said that self-driving technology is Tesla's future, but so far, the company has struggled to get drivers to actually pay for it.\n\nGerber added that he sees Google and Waymo's parent company, Alphabet, as the best stock to buy for gaining exposure to the self-driving car market, due to Waymo's edge over Tesla and Alphabet's resources.\n\nHis bullish thesis on Waymo centers on the company's strong presence in major US cities, which is expanding while Tesla has only just begun its rollout this year.\n\n\"Google has the money and they're not going to wait,\" Gerber said. \"They know they can scale, so for Tesla to catch them, they would need this to work right away, basically, and then they need to start building infrastructure.\"\n\nAnother problem Gerber sees is one he's brought up before, which is Musk's public perception. That might be a problem even if Tesla catches up to competitors in key areas like autonomous driving. Gerber thinks the image of Musk has yet to recover since his foray into politics sparked divisive views among consumers earlier this year.\n\n\"The image of the company is so negative in people's minds that even if they had cabs everywhere, people would just choose another cab company, because there's plenty to choose,\" he speculated.\n\nGerber noted that he also has strong doubts about the demand for the humanoid robots that Tesla is building, despite Musk's claims that they'll eliminate poverty and be able to perform surgery.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "If Elon Musk and Sam Altman like each other, they hide it well.\n\nIn the latest turn in the rivalry, the two are battling over the top spot on the list of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nWhile the two cofounded OpenAI together back in 2015, the partnership has frayed spectacularly since.\n\nMusk left OpenAI in 2018 and later founded rival startup, xAI. Musk or his company, xAI, has filed lawsuits against OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI held a secondary share sale in October that valued it at $500 billion, taking the lead from Musk's SpaceX by a cool $100 billion.\n\nNot one to cede ground to a rival, Musk is now planning his own secondary share sale at SpaceX, according to an internal letter to employees seen by multiple outlets. It would value the company at a whopping $800 billion. If that happens soon, it means Musk would have only let Altman hold the mantle for a couple of months.\n\nMusk also confirmed on X this week that the company is exploring a blockbuster initial public offering, which might be the only way OpenAI can regain its lead as a private company. OpenAI this year restructured its business, which would allow it to also pursue its own eye-watering IPO in the future.\n\nWhile this valuation battle between the two billionaires is maybe cringeworthy theater for the average earner, it underscores a significant shift: investors are pouring unprecedented money into technologies once viewed as speculative science projects.\n\nSpaceX, which aims to make life multi-planetary and colonize Mars, and OpenAI, which seeks to develop a theoretical AI that can reason like humans, are two of the most visible examples, but they are part of a broader surge in frontier-tech valuations. AI, robotics, and defense tech startups have all notched multibillion-dollar valuations in the past year — bubble be damned.",

    "fullText": "Tesla is piling on incentives for buyers as it aims to end a rocky year on a high.\n\nElon Musk's automaker has introduced a smorgasbord of discounts and deals in the US, with Tesla facing a race against time to avoid a second consecutive year of declining sales.\n\nTesla is offering 0% APR financing for up to 72 months on select Model Y Standard purchases and is also advertising the option to lease a Model Y without a down payment on its website.\n\nBuyers can also trade in a gas car to receive 2,000 miles of free supercharging, and Tesla is offering complimentary upgrades, including premium paint jobs, tow hitches, and 19-inch \"Nova\" wheels valued at up to $1,500 on select inventory vehicles.\n\nTesla often offers more incentives toward the end of the year. But this time, the company is racing to avoid another year of declining sales, following Tesla's first-ever year-over-year fall in sales in 2024.\n\nRepeating that pattern would provide more evidence that Tesla's momentum is stalling after years of rapid growth.\n\nIn October last year, Musk predicted Tesla sales would grow 20-30% in 2025. Tesla needs to sell 555,000 EVs in the final three months of the year — more than it's ever sold in a quarter — just to match its sales figures from last year.\n\nThat's a tall order, with Tesla facing difficulties in all its main markets. The Cybertruck maker's sales have cratered in Europe amid backlash over Musk's politics. In China, Tesla has been squeezed by a wave of competition from local rivals.\n\nTesla also faces major headwinds in the US after the Trump administration scrapped the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September. Tesla's US sales fell 35% between September and October after the tax credit disappeared, according to data from Cox Automotive.\n\nIt comes as Musk has increasingly shifted Tesla's focus toward AI and robotics. The billionaire has described the steering wheel-less Cybercab and Tesla's Optimus robot as the future of the company, with both set to enter production next year.",

    "description": "\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is known in part for saying controversial or \"careless\" things, but as the Guardian reported, he recently made a sincerely shocking admission.\n\nOn Dec. 9, Musk appeared on a podcast hosted by Katie Miller, the wife of deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller. During that appearance, the Tesla CEO made a highly unusual set of statements, describing the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was previously run by him, as only \"a little bit successful.\" Miller asked Musk if he would do it all again, and he said he wouldn't.\n\n\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically worked on my companies. And they wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" Musk said, referencing Tesla vandalism.\n\nIn 2025, Musk's involvement in American politics moved beyond funding and into an active government role.\n\nMusk first floated the idea of a \"government efficiency\" division in August 2024, and on Jan. 20, the concept formally became the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nWhat followed was, by all accounts, an immediate frenzy of government cuts. Staffed by individuals as young as 19, none older than 25, DOGE was likened to a \"wrecking ball.\"\n\nWithin a week, more than two million federal civil servants received an email pressuring them to resign from their positions and transition \"to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.\"\n\nMusk repeatedly pledged to cut $1 trillion worth of what he insisted was \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" in Washington, despite scant evidence of the purported problem. One of DOGE's first high-profile actions was to decommission USAID, a humanitarian aid agency.\n\nDOGE \"spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper. Could gone to some great parties. Did that instead,\" Musk posted to X on Feb. 3.\n\nBacklash was swift as food aid was incinerated rather than distributed, and in the spring, Microsoft founder Bill Gates characterized DOGE's targeting of USAID as \"the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children.\"\n\nWould you buy an EV if it only took you five minutes to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nVital funds appropriated by Congress were frozen, in-progress projects were canceled, and DOGE's activity at the Social Security Administration affected disbursements and potentially compromised Americans' data.\n\nAs scenes of chaos unfolded, Musk emphasized his public-facing role, even as critical agencies like the National Weather Service had their funding slashed. Backlash was swift and not limited to the United States.\n\nMusk's role as CEO of Tesla was equally prominent, and the electric vehicle manufacturer's dealerships were protested, with cars and charging stations vandalized.\n\nSales slumped immediately in the U.S. and Europe, and a subsequent NBER study quantified the enormous economic impact Musk's actions inflicted on the Tesla brand.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Over the next two years, the plan is to “deploy” the chatbot to more than 5,000 public schools in an “AI-powered education program”.\n\nxAI’s Grok is more known for referring to itself as “MechaHitler” and espousing far-right conspiracy theories than it is for public education. Over the past year, the chatbot has spewed various antisemitic content, decried “white genocide” and claimed Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nNayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, is now entrusting the chatbot to create curricula in classrooms across the country. Bukele has long embraced technology, making El Salvador the first county in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, and being one of the first Central American presidents to use Twitter, now X, as a platform. He is also known for ruling with an iron fist and working with Trump to incarcerate deportees to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot prison.\n\n“El Salvador doesn’t just wait for the future to happen; we build it,” Bukele said in a statement about the partnership with xAI. “This partnership is destined to deliver something rather extraordinary for all of humanity.”\n\nMusk touted his partnership with Bukele on Thursday. On X, between posts about “white genocide” and blaming asylum seekers for crime, Musk posted comments about Grok being spread throughout El Salvador’s schools.\n\nHe reposted positively to a comment from Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller, in which she wrote: “If we are serious about restoring education to math, science and English – why would we allow left leaning liberal [sic] AI our kids? This unlocks non-woke educational tools for our kids.”\n\nxAI is not the first artificial intelligence company to introduce chatbots to public schools. OpenAI announced a partnership with Estonia in February where it could provide all students and teachers in the country’s secondary school system with a customized ChatGPT. Students in rural Colombia also started using Meta’s AI chatbots in 2023 and within a year, teachers began blaming the tech for low grades and failing exams, according to Rest of World.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, the social media platform, X — and he's also a father of at least 14 children.\n\nAccording to Forbes, he's amassed a fortune worth $491 billion, making him the world's richest person. Musk has said he didn't get there by working a typical 40-hour week, and is instead known to have a strenuous schedule that he said has demanded 120-hour workweeks in the past.\n\nStill, the South African mogul shares similarities with the average person in his typical daily routine. Like many of us, Musk enjoys a sweet treat in the morning and spends time scrolling social media.\n\nHere's how his days usually go, according to interviews and posts by Musk himself over the years.\n\nMusk told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 that he usually goes to bed around 3 a.m. and sleeps for six hours. So, he's typically waking up around 9 a.m. each day.\n\nHe might've been trolling when he wrote a response to a doctor that same year on X saying he eats \"a donut every morning,\" but a quick search of Musk's posts reveals he's quite a fan of the pastry.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in December 2025, he gave an updated glimpse into his morning routine, saying his typical breakfast is \"steak and eggs and coffee.\"\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he was trying to break the cycle of checking his phone as soon as he woke up. While on the Full Send Podcast, Musk described it as \"a terrible habit\" he hoped to escape.\n\nBut, as of 2023, he still wakes up and immediately looks at his phone for emergencies, the Journal reported.\n\nIf his posts on X are any indication, the habit persists. He has been active on the platform since before he acquired it in a $44 billion deal in 2022, often posting at odd hours and in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's unclear if Musk slots in time to post and respond to others each day, but it certainly looks like he rarely takes a day off from the app.\n\n\"Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it's still working,\" Musk told Walter Isaacson in the \"Elon Musk\" biography.\n\nMusk previously credited showering with having the biggest positive effect on his daily life.\n\nDuring an AMA session on Reddit in 2015, a user asked which of his daily habits impacted his life the most.\n\nAs the CEO of one of the leading EV makers in the US, it's no surprise that Musk has more than one option for his daily commute.\n\nWhen an X user posted a meme about deciding between driving a Cybertruck without autopilot or a Tesla Model S with self-driving technology, Musk responded that it's a choice he faces \"every day.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck has been in the backdrop of many celebrity paparazzi shots and Instagram posts since its official launch in November.\n\nLike many, Musk appears to have had ups and downs in his relationship with physical exercise over the years. In 2021, he told Joe Rogan that he'd avoid it altogether if he could.\n\n\"I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air,\" he said on X in June 2023.\n\nBut less than two months later, he said he was \"lifting hard almost every day.\" Around the same time, talk of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg going head-to-head in a fight swirled online.\n\nMusk told Miller during his December 2025 podcast appearance that he often skips lunch or eats something \"small\" for his midday meal.\n\nDinner, though, can be \"anywhere,\" he told the podcast host, who is married to White House advisor Stephen Miller.\n\n\"I like the wide range of cuisine,\" Musk said, with \"American\" food like cheeseburgers and pizza being his favorites.\n\nHe added, \"If I had to say, like, there's only one thing you can ever have for the rest of time, which admittedly would be a bit monotonous, but it would probably be a cheeseburger, because cheeseburgers are amazing. It's a genius invention.\"\n\nNo wonder his Tesla Diner in Hollywood features burgers prominently on the menu.\n\nMusk has admitted on several occasions that running more than one company isn't easy. He splits time between his companies depending on the \"crisis of the moment,\" the 54-year-old said in 2021.\n\nOne X user pointed out in January 2023 that Musk had testified in a lawsuit in the morning, attended an event at a Nevada Tesla factory in the evening, and worked with Tesla on AI at night — all in one day.\n\nMusk responded that he'd also spent time at \"Twitter HQ past midnight.\"\n\nAnd then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.\n\n\"I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work—do that seven days a week,\" Musk told the Journal in 2023. \"I'll have to do that for a while — no choice — but I think once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.\"\n\nOn the Tesla earnings call in April 2024, Musk said: \"Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.\"\n\nAlthough he's not getting eight hours a night, Musk has upped his sleeping schedule from being nearly nonexistent in the past.\n\nIn May 2023, Musk told CNBC that he's no longer pulling all-nighters. Instead, he said he tries to get at least six hours of sleep.\n\nAccording to Isaacson's biography of Musk, the billionaire has spent many nights awake and pondering the issues his companies face. His former partner Claire Boucher — known by her stage name Grimes — also told Isaacson that Musk once stayed up all night playing the \"Elden Ring\" video game when it first came out.\n\nHe has a history of sleeping on the floors of his offices and the Tesla factory.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk all but moved into its San Francisco headquarters. He said there's a couch in the library that he would crash on from time to time.",

    "fullText": "Asked who was the funniest person he knew in real life, Elon Musk had a somewhat surprising answer.\n\n\"You know, President Trump is very funny. He's got a great sense of humor,\" Musk said on an episode of The Katie Miller Podcast released on Tuesday. \"He's very funny, he's like naturally funny. It's somewhat effortless.\"\n\nMusk pointed to President Donald Trump's meeting with New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani last month, when a reporter asked Mamdani if he stood by his opinion that Trump is a \"fascist.\"\n\n\"And the president said, 'Just say yes. It's easier that way,\"' Musk said, breaking into laughter. \"'Don't worry about it. Just say yes.'\"\n\n\"How silly,\" Musk added after further laughter.\n\nElon Musk, who is a South African immigrant who votes in the US, is upset that Somali Americans in Minnesota get to vote. He's also saying that Zohran Mamdani won because the majority of people who voted for him weren't born in America. pic.twitter.com/6mToXTNV8y\n\nMusk's comments marked yet another turn in his evolving relationship with Trump. The two men appear to have mostly put their differences behind them, with Musk even visiting the White House for a dinner last month.\n\nStill, Musk said in that same interview that he wouldn't have led the DOGE effort if he could go back in time, despite believing the effort to be a \"little bit successful.\"\n\n\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically built, you know, worked on my companies, essentially, and the cars — they wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" Musk said.",

    "fullText": "Katie Miller lavished Elon Musk with praise during a fawning interview with the billionaire businessman in which she described how “inspirational” it was to work for him.\n\nThe podcast host, who previously worked at the White House with her husband, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, quit the administration in May to go into the private sector and work directly for Musk.\n\nOn the latest episode of The Katie Miller Podcast, the unusually animated host gushed over her previous boss months after unconfirmed rumors of a relationship between the pair outside the workplace.\n\n“Everyone always thinks you’re a very difficult person to work for,” Miller said, before adding, “I think you’re very kind,” prompting Musk to thank her for the compliment.\n\n“People think, which you are, like, a very demanding boss,” Miller continued. “I’ve never heard you yell at any employee,” she said.\n\n“Yeah, I don’t yell,” Musk replied.\n\nMiller worked as a spokesperson for Musk as he oversaw the so-called Department of Government Efficiency between January and May this year, before leaving with him to work for the billionaire personally, prior to launching her podcast.\n\nThe podcast love-in continued with Miller telling Musk that “every employee who works at every single one of your companies is incredibly mission-driven,” noting that fact was “unlike any other workplace I’ve seen.”\n\nShe went on to single out Musk’s Starbase compound in South Texas, which was created around SpaceX’s rocket development and launch site.\n\n“Like Starbase is the most inspirational place you’ll ever go to, right?” Miller said, before claiming that all his employees are “fiercely loyal.”\n\nShe added, “You are a very good employer to work for and I think people assume you are not.”\n\n“Well, why would they think anyone would work at the companies?” Musk pondered out loud.\n\n“Talented people can go work anywhere they want... if they’re mistreated in some way, they would leave and go work somewhere else.”\n\nMiller’s podcast has struggled to find an audience after three months. Her first interview, with Vice President JD Vance, remains the most popular on YouTube with 85,000 views. Her lowest-viewed episode has been viewed a dismal 2,700 times.\n\nThe Musk interview has already scored more views in six hours than last week’s episode with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his third wife, Jen, has clocked up in an entire week.\n\nWhen news of Miller’s resignation from her husband’s place of work first emerged, the Democrats taunted Trump’s deputy chief of staff with an image of an empty chair in a hotel room, appearing to suggest there was trouble in the marriage.\n\n.@StephenM: https://t.co/IjFdietRgU pic.twitter.com/ndcIsPHWFd\n\n— Democrats (@TheDemocrats) May 30, 2025\n\nDuring the podcast, the pair avoided discussion of a mishap in June on Musk’s social media platform, X, where a fake screenshot of Musk bragging that he “took” Miller’s wife went viral online, forcing the billionaire to correct his own AI assistant, Grok.\n\nThe AI assistant claimed, “The post from Elon Musk likely existed and was deleted,” noting that the “metrics and context align with Musk’s behavior.”\n\n“The evidence leans toward the post being real but removed, consistent with Musk’s pattern of deleting controversial posts.”\n\nMusk then intervened, replying “No, it’s fake ffs… I never posted this.” Miller never directly commented on the whispers.",

    "description": "Elon Musk said he wouldn't participate in the DOGE office again, adding that it was only \"somewhat\" successful in saving taxpayer money.",
    "fullText": "If he could do it all over again, Elon Musk says he wouldn't have participated in DOGE.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, a new office created at the beginning of President Donald Trump's second term, was only \"somewhat successful\" at saving taxpayer money, and Musk believes he could have better spent his time focused on his various business ventures.\n\n\"I guess I couldn't believe I was there for the most part. It's like — it all seemed extremely surreal at the time,\" Musk told Miller, who is married to Stephen Miller, who currently serves as White House deputy chief of staff.\n\nThe name DOGE itself, Musk said, was made up \"based on internet suggestions,\" and, while he still agrees that it's a worthwhile cause to try to slow government spending, he doesn't see his efforts as particularly effective during the months he worked alongside the Trump administration.\n\n\"We were a little bit successful. We were somewhat successful,\" Musk said. \"I mean, we stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense, that was just entirely wasteful. For example, there was probably $100, maybe $200 billion worth of zombie payments per year, which simply by enforcing that there be a payment code and an explanation for the payment, the payment would not go out.\"\n\nWhile Musk had initially projected DOGE would save an estimated $2 trillion, he later revised his estimate to project nearly $150 billion in spending cuts for the 2026 fiscal year before he stepped back from the office in April, Business Insider has previously reported.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how much the office ultimately saved before it quietly disbanded in July, an August analysis by Politico verified $1.4 billion in confirmed contract cancellations and a decrease in federal spending.\n\nWhen asked directly by Miller whether he'd participate in the DOGE office if he could repeat history, Musk thought for just a moment before sighing and saying he would not.\n\n\"No, I don't think so. Would I do it? I think I probably — I don't know,\" Musk said. \"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically built, you know, worked on my companies, essentially, and the cars — they wouldn't have been burning the cars.\"\n\nMusk faced intense public backlash and was the subject of numerous protests, including vandalism against Tesla, as a result of his work with the Trump administration. Musk described the backlash as \"a very strong reaction\" to his attempt to stop \"political corruption.\"\n\nThe fallout was also concerning to Tesla investors, some of whom worried Musk was spending too much time at the White House and not enough on the electric-vehicle maker.\n\n\"We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin, and it's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else,\" Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider in March.\n\nTesla's stock plummeted in the first half of the year but began to rally after Musk announced he'd be leaving DOGE and officially stepped away in May. As of market close Tuesday, Tesla's stock was up over 17% this year.\n\nMusk's relationship with Trump soured in June after Musk criticized the president's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" The pair publicly feuded for months, but Business Insider reported in November that the tension between the two had eased recently, and Musk was invited to Trump's White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
