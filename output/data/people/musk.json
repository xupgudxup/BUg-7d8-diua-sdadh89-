    "description": "Musk's memo announcing SpaceX and xAI's merger is full of space jargon. Here's your cheat sheet to bring the wonky language back down to Earth.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been shy about his inner nerd — just look at his SpaceX merger memo.\n\nOver the years, the billionaire has peppered his company communications with sci-fi culture Easter eggs, physics nerd jargon, and enough dad-joke flair to make comedian Nate Bargatze blush.\n\nSo it was no surprise that Musk's latest internal memo — announcing that SpaceX would merge with xAI — leaned into the kind of words and phrases that might cause you to scratch your head.\n\nIt reads less like a conventional corporate M&A announcement and more like a sci-fi manifesto, invoking \"sentient suns,\" orbital data centers, and humanity's destiny among the stars.\n\nForget \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" here is your hitchhiker's guide to Musk's memo.\n\nThe memo opens with a sci-fi banger, the kind of premise you'd find in a Hollywood script: Musk says his new vision for the combined company is to build a \"sentient sun.\"\n\nThe phrase is meant to convey scale. Musk is imagining an AI system so large, energy-hungry, and centralized that it metaphorically resembles a star. Except instead of radiating light and heat, this \"sun\" would beam computer-generated intelligence back to Earth.\n\nIt's a piece of sci-fi shorthand for extremely powerful, solar-fed AI.\n\nThis is where the memo goes full-on science nerd: \"Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization,\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk is referencing the Kardashev scale, a '60s framework created by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev that ranks civilizations by the amount of energy they can harness. A Type I civilization can use all the energy available on its home planet. A Type II civilization can capture the full power output of its star.\n\nHumanity today is generally thought to sit somewhere below Type I.\n\nHere, Musk is proposing to move massive computing infrastructure — the power-hungry data centers popping up in rural America to fuel modern AI — off Earth and into orbit. In other words, data centers in space.\n\nIn space, he argues, those systems could rely on near-constant solar energy. As Musk put it elsewhere in the memo: \"It's always sunny in space.\"\n\nSpaceX essentially wants to build a floating gas station. Here, Musk describes a dedicated tanker-to-ship bot expected to roll out in 2026, per SpaceNews.\n\nRight now, rockets carry all of their fuel right from takeoff. This system would allow the company's spacecraft to optimize for other storage cabins.\n\nMusk is essentially a giant railgun designed to launch cargo into space using electricity instead of rocket fuel. It's reminiscent of an instrument in the 1937 science fiction novel \"Zero to Eighty.\"\n\nSpaceX is imagining building one on Earth's Moon, where lower gravity and the lack of an atmosphere would make it easier to fling materials into space.\n\nMusk ends the memo with a linguistic flourish.\n\nIt isn't the first time Musk has used the phrase. In 2014, he launched a Montessori-style school for children from 3 to 9 with the same name. The school's curriculum focused on STEM learning and problem-solving, according to its mission statement.",

    "description": "Prosecutors’ announcement comes amid a hardening of European attitudes to social media...",
    "fullText": "Prosecutors’ announcement comes amid a hardening of European attitudes to social media firms\n\nProsecutors have raided the French headquarters of Elon Musk’s social media platform X and summoned the tech billionaire and the company’s former chief executive for questioning as part of an investigation into alleged cybercrime.\n\n“A search is under way by the cybercrime unit of the Paris prosecutor’s office, the national police cyber unit and Europol,” the Paris prosecutors’ office said in a post on X on Tuesday, adding that it would no longer be publishing on the network.\n\nIt said in a statement that Musk and Linda Yaccarino had been summoned for “voluntary questioning” in April in their capacity as “de facto and de jure managers of the X platform at the time of the events”. Yaccarino resigned as chief executive of X in July last year.\n\nThe French prosecutors’ announcement comes amid a hardening of European attitudes to social media giants. A senior source in the Greek government told Reuters on Tuesday the country was “very close” to announcing a social media ban for children aged under 15.\n\nIn Spain, where the government is preparing a series of measures including a social media ban for under-16s, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, promised to protect children from the “digital wild west” and hold tech companies responsible for hateful and harmful content.\n\nSánchez said on Tuesday that urgent action was needed because social media was a “failed state where laws are ignored and crimes are tolerated”.\n\nThe Paris raid is part of an investigation launched in January last year into the suspected abuse of algorithms and fraudulent data extraction, which the prosecutor’s office said it had widened to cover complaints about X’s artificial intelligence tool, Grok.\n\nIt said the alleged offences it was investigating now included complicity in the possession and organised distribution of child abuse images, violation of image rights through sexualised deepfakes, and denial of crimes against humanity.\n\nOther possible charges included fraudulent data extraction from, and falsified operation of, an automated data processing system by an organised group, and operation of an illegal online platform by an organised group, the statement said.\n\nFrench authorities launched the investigation after the centre-right MP Éric Bothorel filed a complaint alleging that biased algorithms on the platform were likely to have distorted its data processing system and affected the kind of content it recommended.\n\nBothorel complained of a “reduced diversity of voices” and Musk’s “personal interventions” in X’s management since he bought it in 2022. Another complaint said the changes had led to a surge in “nauseating political content”.\n\nProsecutors said in November that they were expanding the investigation to include the behaviour of Grok, which allegedly engaged in Holocaust denial, advancing false claims commonly made by people who deny Nazi Germany murdered 6 million Jews.\n\nThe chatbot has since caused outrage by allowing users to “strip” clothed people, including children, in photos through AI image generation and editing. The EU has launched an investigation into its production and dissemination of sexualised deepfakes of women and minors.\n\nX has been approached for comment on Tuesday’s raid. The company said last summer it did not intend to comply with French prosecutors’ demands, which it described as “politically motivated”, and denied all allegations against it.\n\nX said it believed the investigation was “distorting French law to serve a political agenda, and ultimately restrict free speech”. It said it was committed to “defending its fundamental rights, protecting user data and resisting political censorship”.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday that the investigation was being conducted as “part of a constructive approach, with the aim of ultimately ensuring that the X platform complies with French laws, insofar as it operates on national territory”.\n\nDespite being described as voluntary, the summonses issued to Musk and Yaccarino are mandatory, but they are hard to enforce on people outside France. Afterwards, authorities can potentially place suspects in custody.\n\nEuropol said it supported the investigation through its European cybercrime centre and deployed a specialist to Paris for the raid. “The investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offences linked to the functioning and use of the platform,” it said.\n\nThose included “the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity”, the pan-European policing organisation said, adding that it “stands ready to continue supporting the French authorities as the investigation progresses”.",

    "description": "“My estimate is that within two to three years, the lowest cost way to generate AI compute will be in space,” Musk wrote in a post on SpaceX’s website on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX has acquired xAI, the artificial intelligence firm founded by Musk three years ago, in a massive, and unconventional, deal that combines the two privately held firms into a company with an astounding $1.25 trillion reported valuation and plans for a historic IPO this year.\n\nHow does Musk justify the $1.25 trillion valuation?\n\nHow do Tesla's investments complicate this deal?\n\nWhat are the space-based data center plans?\n\nWhat companies are involved in this SpaceX-xAI merger?\n\nMusk, who is the CEO of both companies as well as publicly traded electric vehicle and robotics company Tesla, described the combination as one that will “form the most ambitious, vertically integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile-device communications, and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” he wrote in a blog post on SpaceX’s website.\n\nMusk cited the potential for space-based data centers, the energy-intensive computing facilities necessary to power AI services, as one of the most important benefits of the combination, even though the concept is still unproven and largely theoretical. “Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term,” Musk wrote in the blog post.\n\n“By directly harnessing near-constant solar power with little operating or maintenance costs, these satellites will transform our ability to scale compute,” Musk wrote.\n\nWhile reports of a potential deal emerged last week, the stratospheric value of the transaction and the swiftness with which it closed left many industry observers in awe, underscoring the massive expectations around AI as well as fears of an overheated market that could be due for a reckoning.\n\nAccording to reporting in Bloomberg, the deal between SpaceX and xAI will lead to a combined enterprise value of $1.25 trillion, with shares of xAI valued at $526.59 apiece. Musk has reportedly been hashing out the potential terms of a SpaceX IPO this year that would value the company at $800 billion, setting the stage for what could be the largest initial public offering of all time.\n\nRepresentatives from SpaceX and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk, the richest person in the world, has a documented history of mingling the financial interests of his businesses. In 2015, Tesla acquired Solar City, a solar energy company founded by Musk’s cousins and on whose board Musk served as chairman.\n\nAnd in March 2025, xAI acquired X, the Musk-owned social platform formerly known as Twitter, in a $33 billion, all-stock deal. “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk said at the time.\n\nMore recently, Tesla surprised shareholders just last month when it revealed that it had invested $2 billion in xAI in exchange for a batch of preferred stock as part of xAI’s $20 billion Series E funding round. That investment means Tesla shareholders now own preferred stock in a company that has become a subsidiary of SpaceX, which could raise questions from investors about Tesla’s role in funding xAI’s growth. In addition to the $2 billion investment, Tesla disclosed it sold $430 million of Megapack battery storage and systems to xAI in 2025, costing it $285 million, exhibiting the circular nature of Musk’s businesses.",

    "fullText": "Aerospace business and artificial intelligence firm to unite for IPO as world’s most valuable private company\n\nElon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence business xAI, in a $1.25tn (£910bn) merger that consolidates part of Musk’s empire as SpaceX prepares to go public later this year.\n\nThe two companies announced the deal on Monday in a statement on SpaceX’s website, saying the merger would form “the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform”.\n\nSpaceX, one of the world’s most valuable private companies, will gain xAI properties such as its Grok chatbot and the social media platform X. The acquisition comes as Musk has pursued plans to put datacenters and solar-powered satellites in space as a means of powering artificial intelligence, an immense and exorbitantly expensive undertaking.\n\nThe deal reportedly valued SpaceX at $1tn and xAI at $250bn, putting the combined business on course for a stock market float valuing it well in excess of $1tn. The float is expected to be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and Musk’s birthday.\n\nMusk turns 55 on 28 June, around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other.\n\nThe announcement of the deal specifically cited Musk’s plans for space-based datacenters as a rationale for the deal.\n\n“Current advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial datacenters, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment,” the announcement said.\n\n“In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale.”\n\nMusk has been increasingly intertwining parts of his businesses in recent months through deals and acquisitions. xAI acquired the platform X in an all-stock transaction in early 2025, and last month Tesla revealed that it planned to invest $2bn in xAI.\n\nBoth SpaceX and xAI have received staggering valuations in the past year. As SpaceX continues to dominate satellite launches and secure extensive contracts with the US federal government, it sent a letter to investors in December that revealed an expected value of $800bn for the company.\n\nDespite widespread backlash to xAI’s Grok AI tool over its promotion of racist ideology and spread of nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images of women and children, the artificial intelligence company has also grown its valuation amid the AI boom. It announced a $20bn Series E fundraise last month from major investors, which valued the company at $230bn.\n\nSpeculation and leaks about the deal, first reported by Reuters, have proliferated in recent days. Musk appeared to give vague confirmation of the acquisition earlier on Monday, writing simply “yes” in reply to a post on X that referenced reports of the merger.\n\nThe news is a positive diversion for Musk after Tesla released an earnings report last week that showed declining revenues and a struggling car business. A few days later, a Department of Justice release of 3m files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein showed Musk exchanging numerous friendly emails with the disgraced financier and making plans to visit his private island. Musk has not responded to Guardian inquiries about the latest Epstein emails.\n\nHe called the release of the emails a “distraction” on X and claimed that he was “well aware that some email correspondence with him could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name”.",

The UK's media regulator announced a similar investigation earlier in January.\n\nX said last month that it had implemented technological measures to stop Grok from editing images of real people into revealing clothing.\n\nIn July last year, xAI apologized after Grok made antisemitic comments on X and praised Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe EU also hit X with a $140 million fine in December 2025 over the platform's infamous blue checkmark system, with the bloc said exposed users to scams.\n\nThe Paris Prosecutor's Office also said it would leave X and instead communicate on LinkedIn and Instagram.",

Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "description": "The two billionaires have clashed online, exchanging accusations over Musk's past emails with Epstein and Hoffman's past visit to Epstein's island.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Reid Hoffman are once again trading blows online after the latest release of the Epstein files.\n\nThe new round of bickering between Musk and the LinkedIn cofounder kicked off on Friday and lasted throughout the weekend, with the billionaires each lobbing criticism at each other over their inclusion in the Epstein files.\n\nNeither Musk nor Hoffman has been implicated in any wrongdoing related to their past ties to Epstein, who looms large in their social-media spat.\n\nTheir latest back-and-forth — the two have publicly criticized each other in recent years — appears to have started on Friday, when Musk reshared a post from Katie Miller that was critical of Hoffman. Hoffman fired back at Musk, posting a screenshot of his past remarks about Trump and the Epstein files.\n\nFrom there, the two have been duking it out on X over the documents released by the Justice Department on Friday related to Jeffrey Epstein — which revealed that Musk made plans to visit Epstein on multiple occasions, including on his infamous private island. (Musk has said he never visited the island).\n\n\"This is how I knew so long ago that Reid Hoffman went to Epstein's island,\" Musk captioned a screenshot of an email he received from Epstein in 2014.\n\n\"Epstein used Reid being there to try to get me to go, not realizing that it would have the opposite effect,\" he added.\n\nHoffman responded by criticizing Musk for \"making false accusations\" and lying about his involvement with Epstein instead of working to get justice for Epstein's victims.\n\n\"You lied about this to everyone for over a decade, and now your excuse (it's disgusting, by the way) is that you could get young girls without Epstein?\" Hoffman wrote. (Musk had written on Sunday that \"if I actually wanted to spend my time partying with young women, it would be trivial for me to do so without the help of a creepy loser like Epstein.\")\n\nGive us a break: If you cared about the victims as you say, you’d stop making false accusations to cover your ass and start using your $220m of influence with President Trump to get justice for the victims.\n\nInstead, you’re focused on comparing my visit fundraising for MIT to… https://t.co/51VgQ9Q9SY\n\nHoffman reshared X posts with documents that showed Musk's past email conversations with the disgraced financier. One post labeled Musk the \"surprise breakout star of the Epstein files.\"\n\nOne of the screenshots from the Epstein files that Hoffman shared showed a 2012 email where Musk asked Epstein, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"\n\nMusk pointed the finger back at Hoffman for his past correspondence with Epstein.\n\n\"Epstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. Not you though. You actually went,\" Musk said. \"What 'gifts' did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island?\"\n\nHoffman previously acknowledged he had visited Epstein's island, which he said was a part of fundraising efforts for MIT.\n\nEpstein hounded me relentlessly to go to his pedo island and I always declined. \n\nNot you though. You actually went. \n\nWhat “gifts” did you bring to Epstein when you went to pedo island? pic.twitter.com/0ATSIl3ojn\n\nMusk and Hoffman's feud dates back years.\n\nHoffman has previously characterized the beef as one-sided, starting in the years after Musk left OpenAI's board. Hoffman, who was an early donor to OpenAI, has said Musk has sour grapes over OpenAI's success after his departure.\n\n\"Well, so actually, it's more his beef with me for having made OpenAI successful with his departure,\" Hoffman said. \"Because he left saying, you know, 'You're all a bunch of jackasses and you'll fail,' and I helped them succeed.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO, who previously worked with Hoffman at PayPal, said Hoffman was among the billionaires who were \"terrified\" about Epstein's client list coming out in 2024.\n\nHoffman has since said that he'd faced threats after Musk's claims that resulted in him hiring security.\n\nAfter the latest release of the Epstein files detailed multiple emails between the Tesla CEO and Epstein, including Musk's assistant trying to coordinate a meeting with Epstein at SpaceX, Musk took to social media to say that he never \"set foot on his creepy island.\"",

    "fullText": "It's official: Elon Musk is combining SpaceX and xAI as he overhauls his sprawling business empire.\n\nMusk told workers in a Monday memo that SpaceX has acquired xAI, his AI company, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO wrote that the deal would create \"the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world's foremost real-time information and free speech platform.\"\n\nSpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, is reportedly gearing up for an initial public offering this year that could value the Starship maker at $1.5 trillion.\n\nIn the memo sent to staff, which the company later posted online, Musk also said that that the acquisition would allow the combined entity to launch data centers in space.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk expressed similar sentiments about building data centers in space during an all hands with xAI staff late last year.\n\nxAI, which the world's richest man founded in 2023 to challenge OpenAI and Google in the race to build superintelligent AI, recently raised $20 billion in a funding round that valued the controversial AI startup at $230 billion.\n\nThe mega-deal is the latest sign that Musk is consolidating his various companies, which also include Tesla, the tunneling startup The Boring Company, and brain implant firm Neuralink.\n\nIn March 2025, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter he bought in 2022. Meanwhile, SpaceX and Tesla have each invested $2 billion in xAI in recent months.\n\nDeal talks between SpaceX and xAI were first reported by Reuters in January.\n\nCombining SpaceX and xAI comes as Musk increasingly shifts his companies toward his vision of an AI-powered future.\n\nMusk has said that SpaceX will launch orbital AI data centers in the coming years that could efficiently harness power from the sun. Last Friday, SpaceX filed a request with the FCC to launch as many as one million satellites to serve as orbital data centers.\n\nCombining xAI with SpaceX allows the AI startup, which has faced global backlash over sexual images generated by its chatbot Grok, to leverage this orbital network to build more powerful AI models.\n\nIt also gives xAI access to significant capital. The OpenAI rival reportedly burned through billions of dollars in 2024, while SpaceX is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion in its IPO later this year.\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "A handful of billionaires and prominent companies urged corporations to leave Delaware. According to the numbers, the opposite happened.",
    "fullText": "A handful of billionaires and prominent companies have tried to cement a new, less-than-ideal narrative about Delaware: The glory days are over.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Elon Musk, who previously had two companies incorporated in the state, wrote on X in 2024.\n\nHowever, dozens of X posts and interviews disparaging the state over its handling of certain legal cases haven't moved the needle. In fact, the opposite has happened: The number of companies incorporated in Delaware has increased.\n\n\"Amid fears of decline, 2025 was a period of monumental growth for Delaware,\" Andrew Verstein, the author of the Corporate Census, wrote in a recent report.\n\nThe Corporate Census is a database of nearly all entity formations in the United States, including traditional corporate registrations and alternative options such as LLCs.\n\nVerstein has spent almost two years collecting data on corporations and published an update to his research earlier this month.\n\nAlthough Delaware has a reputation as a business-friendly state, it faced a storm of bad press in 2024 and 2025 when some companies began to ditch the state for what they considered greener legal pastures. Musk, most prominently, removed Tesla and SpaceX's corporate registrations from Delaware after a judge voided his multibillion-dollar Tesla pay package.\n\nHe and some other prominent CEOs have criticized Delaware's courts over what they consider subjective rulings. Delaware's Supreme Court reinstated Musk's pay package in December, but not before some of Musk's peers joined his unofficial campaign.\n\nCompanies like the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and the leading crypto-exchange Coinbase followed suit, also citing uncertainty around Delaware's legal system as a factor in their departures, going so far as to urge others to do the same. The alleged exodus has been dubbed \"Dexit,\" a play on the words \"Delaware\" and \"exit.\"\n\nDespite the departures, Delaware is doing just fine.\n\n\"The short answer is that 'Dexit' isn't happening,\" Verstein told Business Insider.\n\nIn his report, Verstein wrote that Delaware's share of corporate formations increased sharply at the beginning of 2025. Delaware experienced an \"absolute increase,\" he wrote, meaning the growth was driven by new formations in Delaware rather than a decline in formations in other states.\n\n\"Instead, there is a clear increase in Delaware's relative popularity beginning in 2025, making it a singular leader in a period otherwise lacking corporate growth,\" Verstein wrote in the report. \"About 30% more Delaware corporations formed in 2025 than in 2024, greatly exceeding the prior trendline. This, while national incorporation levels remained flat.\"\n\nAt the moment, Verstein said the official cause of the formation boost isn't clear, but speculated on two theories. For one, Delaware implemented new laws to address some of the complaints from Musk and others. They strengthened corporate management's authority and altered shareholder rights.\n\n\"These laws were intended to restore confidence in Delaware law after several 2024 judicial opinions arguably upset market expectations. Yet the jump in incorporations begins prior to the late February 2025 announcement of SB 21. And it begins substantially after the March 2024 passage of SB 313,\" Verstein wrote. \"While it is certainly possible that the increase reflects a lagged response to SB 313, or perhaps a preemptive response to the legislative currents that led to SB 21, the timing does not immediately commend itself to that explanation.\"\n\nHe also pointed toward external factors outside Delaware's control.\n\n\"For example, President Donald J. Trump won the general election on November 5, 2024 and took office on January 20, 2025,\" he wrote. \"Perhaps Delaware corporations were expected to be especially useful under his administration.\"\n\nVerstein said, despite the cause being unclear, \"the data are plainly incompatible with the most alarmist theories of Dexit.\"\n\nFor its part, Delaware's government is unfazed.\n\n\"Delaware continues to lead the world as the preeminent home for business,\" a spokesperson for Delaware's Secretary of State, which oversees corporations, said in a statement. \"The data speaks for itself — Delaware's corporate franchise remains strong thanks in large part to the unmatched expertise and efficiency of the Delaware Division of Corporations.\"\n\nDuring a 2024 interview with Business Insider, Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez brushed off concerns that they were struggling due to \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way,\" Patibanda-Sanchez said. \"We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk admitted on Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings call today that the company doesn’t have any Optimus robots doing useful work in its factories right now.\n\nThis is a striking admission, given that Musk has spent the past two years claiming the opposite.\n\nLet’s take a walk through memory lane.\n\nJune 2024: Tesla’s official account claimed the company had “2 Optimus bots performing tasks in the factory autonomously.”\n\nJune 2024: At Tesla’s shareholder meeting, Musk said he expected “a thousand to a couple thousand robots working in its factories” by 2025.\n\nJanuary 2025: On Tesla’s Q4 2024 earnings call, Musk raised the stakes even higher:\n\n“The normal internal plan calls for roughly 10,000 Optimus robots to be built this year.”\n\n“Will those several thousand Optimus robots be doing useful things by the end of the year? Yes, I’m confident they will do useful things.”\n\nToday (January 2026): Musk admitted that no Optimus robots are currently doing useful work in Tesla’s factories.\n\n“Well, we are still very much at the early stages of Optimus. It’s still in the R&D phase. We have had Optimus do some basic tasks in the factory. But as we iterate on new versions of Optimus, we deprecate the old versions. It’s not in usage in our factories in a material way. It’s more so that the robot can learn. We wouldn’t expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably the end of this year.”\n\nThis follows a now-familiar pattern with Musk’s predictions.\n\nWe documented last month that Tesla never came close to producing thousands of Optimus robots in 2025. There was no evidence of even hundreds being built.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Musk was specifically asked about how many Optimus robots Tesla has, and he didn’t answer.\n\nWhat Tesla has demonstrated publicly are robots performing simple tasks like handing out water bottles, and even then, they relied heavily on teleoperation (humans remotely controlling the robots) rather than true autonomy.\n\nMultiple supply chain reports throughout 2025 indicated that Tesla’s Optimus program was in “shambles,” with the head of the program departing and production being delayed.\n\nIn today’s shareholder update, Tesla did mention progress on Optimus:\n\n“In Q1 of this year, we plan to unveil the Gen 3 version of Optimus, which will include major upgrades from version 2.5, including our latest hand design. The Gen 3 is our first design meant for mass production.”\n\nTesla also said it’s preparing production lines with “start of production planned before the end of 2026 and eventual planned capacity of 1 million robots per year.”\n\nBut the admission that no robots are currently doing useful work directly contradicts years of claims from both Musk and Tesla’s official communications.\n\nI want to be clear: I’m actually bullish on humanoid robots. The technology is advancing rapidly, and Tesla does have advantages in compute efficiency and AI development.\n\nBut Tesla is running full speed ($20 billion capex worth) into the same problem it had with autonomous vehicles: it builds the hardware before the software is ready.\n\nOn top of this, even though I’m bullish on humanoid (to a degree, I’m not saying its a multi-trillion dollar industry), I don’t really trust Musk leading this effort with this real credibility problem.\n\nWhen Musk claimed in January 2025 that “several thousand Optimus robots will be doing useful things by the end of the year,” he wasn’t making a long-term prediction about uncertain technology. He was making a near-term operational claim about his own company.\n\nTesla does have advantages in compute efficiency and AI development.\n\nFred, I'm gonna need a source on this. For all we know, Musk just claims to have an advantage. I'm guessing those other companies which have been building robots for decades may have a better handle on some of this stuff.\n\nNow, a year later, he’s admitting that the number is zero.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla claimed had Optimus robots were doing “real work” in factories almost two years ago now.\n\nIt’s fairly clear for anyone who has been following the program closely that Tesla is still years away from a useful product that will be able to perform work at an efficient level beyond just demos.\n\nEven Musk appeared to somewhat admits that he the first part of his response where he said that the robot is “still very much at the early stages of Optimus. It’s still in the R&D phase.”",

    "description": "The five companies led by Elon Musk have increasingly become intertwined, even before Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI or merger chatter.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is running some of the world's most valuable companies. But they've been doing business with each other long before recent merger chatter around Elon Inc.\n\nThe billionaire leads five major companies: Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company, Neuralink, and xAI, which recently absorbed his social media company, X.\n\nOver the last three years, those companies have stepped up their internal dealings, buying one another's products, exchanging software and materials, and announcing investments worth billions of dollars.\n\nThe result is a tightly knit corporate ecosystem with Musk at its center.\n\nFor consumers and Tesla's many fans, that kind of vertical integration can look like a strength. Musk has argued that closer ties between his companies make them more resilient to geopolitical risk and supply-chain shocks.\n\n\"Done correctly, inter-company connections make a lot of sense,\" Lou Whiteman, a contributing analyst at The Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"The important thing is to ensure good governance is in place, so that, for example, Boring is paying a fair price for Tesla vehicles.\"\n\nOther analysts and investors say the arrangement concentrates too much power in Musk's hands. Tesla's eight-member board includes longtime allies of the billionaire — including his brother.\n\nNone of Musk's companies responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere are some of the recent sharing agreements, purchases, and investments between Musk's companies:\n\nMusk has repeatedly drawn on employees from one company to support others in his portfolio.\n\nIn 2022, about a month after Musk bought Twitter — now known as X — he sent roughly 50 Tesla employees to the social-media company's headquarters to help overhaul its code-review systems, according to court filings.\n\nMusk later argued in court that the Tesla employees had \"volunteered\" to do the work and that their temporary reassignment should not concern Tesla's board.\n\nExecutives share overlapping functions on several of Musk's companies, too, according to insider org charts obtained by Business Insider.\n\nFor example, Charlie Kuehmann, the vice president of materials and engineering at Tesla, also holds the same title at SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX is a major customer of Tesla's energy business, purchasing batteries for robotics power and Megapack energy-storage systems.\n\nIt also reportedly invested $2 billion into xAI as a part of a previous funding round.\n\nMusk has also said that Tesla's long-awaited next-generation Roadster will be a \"Tesla/SpaceX collab\" and feature SpaceX-built cold-gas thrusters. The hyper-powered sports car's launch event is penciled in for April 1.\n\n\"It's gonna be really cool, and it's gonna have some rocket technology in it,\" Musk also said during a 2024 sit-down with Don Lemon.\n\nPerhaps the most public example of Musk's companies coordinating is Tesla's vehicle sales to his tunnel-building start-up.\n\nThe Boring Company, which operates tunnels in Las Vegas and Texas, uses fleets of Tesla vehicles to transport passengers through its underground systems. The tunnel builder has also constructed tunnels around Tesla's Gigafactory in Austin, Texas.\n\nIt isn't alone. SpaceX also purchased an unspecified number of Musk's Cybertrucks.\n\nTesla's earnings on Wednesday disclosed that it had agree to invest $2 billion in xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence startup, with a related \"framework agreement\" to explore additional collaboration opportunities.\n\nTesla has already integrated xAI's Grok into its vehicles, allowing drivers to chat with the AI and use it to add and edit navigation destinations.\n\nVideos have shown early versions of Tesla's in-development Optimus robot using xAI's Grok AI chatbot for its voice.\n\nElon’s Tesla Optimus 🤖🔥 is here! Dawn of the physical Agentforce revolution, tackling human work for $200K–$500K. Productivity game-changer! Congrats @elonmusk, and thank you for always being so kind to me! 🚀 #Tesla #Optimus pic.twitter.com/bA5IYIylE1\n\nxAI has also reportedly told investors that it's working on AI that could power Tesla's forthcoming Optimus humanoid robots.\n\nTesla executives said the $2 billion investment supports the automaker's push into self-driving technology. For example, the earnings deck explained that xAI-developed software will analyze vehicle interiors and assist with route planning, including adding high-occupancy-vehicle lanes when the car is full.\n\nFor xAI, the investment adds capital to the cash-hungry buildout of data centers and their energy needs.\n\nThe deal marked one of the clearest examples of capital flowing from Musk's public company into a privately held firm he controls.\n\nThe growing web of internal deals has fueled discussion among investors and analysts about whether Musk's companies are evolving into something closer to a single, vertically integrated enterprise.\n\nThere's also been recent reports that some of Musk's companies could merge — including potential combinations of Tesla and xAI or SpaceX and xAI.\n\nWhiteman said many Tesla investors appear comfortable with that direction.\n\n\"In Tesla's case, an important factor to consider is that investors are buying into Elon Musk's vision for the future as much as they are buying into an automaker or clean energy company,\" he said.\n\n\"Since this group of companies, public and private, combine to represent Elon Musk's full vision of the future, I'd bet that many investors are happy to see Tesla involved in all aspects of 'Elon Inc.'\"",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) revised its Starlink privacy policy to allow the use of customer data for AI training, a shift that ​could bolster Elon Musk's AI ambitions.\n\nAhead of a blockbuster IPO planned for later this year, ‌SpaceX is in talks to merge with Musk’s AI company, xAI (XAAI.PVT), a deal first reported by Reuters on Thursday. SpaceX, already the ‌world’s most valuable private company, could reach a value of more than $1 trillion after the IPO.\n\nWhat are privacy experts' concerns about Starlink's policy changes?\n\nWhat changes did SpaceX make to Starlink's privacy policy?\n\nHow could the SpaceX-xAI merger impact AI development?\n\nWhat data does Starlink collect from its users?\n\nStarlink updated its Global Privacy Policy on January 15, according to the Starlink website. The policy includes new details stating that unless a user opts out, Starlink data may be used “to train our machine learning or artificial intelligence ⁠models” and could be shared with ‌the company’s service providers and “third-party collaborators,” without providing further details.\n\nA previous version of the privacy policy, an archived version from November and reviewed by Reuters, did not ‍contain language about AI training on Starlink data.\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStarlink collects vast amounts of user data, spanning location information, credit card information, contact information and user IP ​addresses. It also collects so-called communication data, which includes audio and visual information, data in shared ‌files, and “inferences we may make from other personal information we collect,” according to its global privacy policy.\n\nThe policy did not make clear exactly what data would be used to train AI. The move has raised concerns among privacy advocates and consumer rights groups, which argue that using personal data to train AI risks expanding surveillance and creates new avenues for misuse.\n\n“It certainly raises my eyebrow and would make ⁠me concerned if I was a Starlink user,” said Anupam ​Chander, a technology law professor at Georgetown University. “Often there's perfectly ​legitimate uses of your data, but it doesn’t have a clear limit to what kind of uses it will be put to.”\n\nMusk's xAI, most recently valued at $230 billion ‍after a recent funding round, ⁠is currently developing its Grok LLM chatbot and also owns X, the social media platform.\n\nThe potential merger with xAI would turbocharge the space company’s deployment of AI-powered services, while giving xAI ⁠vast new data sets to train its models on, including communication data.

    "description": "Elon Musk planned visits to Jeffrey Epstein's island, DOJ emails show. Epstein repeatedly sought meetings with Musk, who previously denied visiting.",
    "fullText": "In November 2012, Jeffrey Epstein emailed Elon Musk about sending a helicopter to whisk the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to his private island in the Caribbean.\n\n\"how many people will you be for the heli to island,\" Epstein asked Musk in an email exchange, which was made public Friday by the Justice Department.\n\nMusk said he'd need just two seats — for himself and his then-partner, Tallulah Riley.\n\n\"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\" Musk asked.\n\nThe emails, released Friday, were part of a cache of 3 million files the Justice Department released from its yearslong investigation into the convicted sex offender. They include several exchanges between Epstein, Musk, and their assistants.\n\nIt's unclear whether Musk ever made the trip, and a representative didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nEpstein — who counted President Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and various other prominent politicians and businessmen among his acquaintances — killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He had registered as a pedophile in 2008, after pleading guilty to less severe sex offenses.\n\nShortly after Epstein's arrest in July 2019, Musk said he had declined invitations to Epstein's island in the US Virgin Islands and recounted only one meeting with him. Musk has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\"Several years ago, I was at his house in Manhattan for about 30 minutes in the middle of the afternoon with Talulah [Riley], as she was curious about meeting this strange person for a novel she was writing,\" he told Vanity Fair at the time. \"We did not see anything inappropriate at all, apart from weird art. He tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island. I declined.\"\n\nMusk has since said in social media posts that he \"refused\" to visit Epstein's island despite multiple attempts from Epstein.\n\nThe emails released Friday appear to show him planning to visit Epstein's island at least twice.\n\nIn addition to the November 2012 planned visit, Musk indicated he would visit Epstein's island in January 2014.\n\n\"Will be in the BVI/St Bart's area over the holidays,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in December 2013, referring to the British Virgin Islands. \"Is there a good time to visit?\"\n\nEpstein said he'd be available for the first week of January.\n\n\"always space for you,\" Epstein told Musk.\n\nAfter some back-and-forth about their schedules, Musk appeared to confirm that he would visit Epstein on January 2 of 2014.\n\n\"When should we head to your island on the 2nd?\" Musk wrote.\n\nThe emails show Epstein planning to meet Musk on other occasions as well.\n\nIn February of 2013, Musk's personal assistant tried to nail down plans for a meeting at SpaceX's offices in California. Epstein's assistant said Musk had suggested the location.\n\n\"Shall we organize a lunch for Elon and Jeffrey to get together at SpaceX in the coming weeks?\" Musk's assistant wrote. \"Elon is generally available at SpaceX on Mon, Thurs and Fri each week.\"\n\nIt isn't clear from the emails reviewed by Business Insider if that meeting took place. Musk has previously said that Epstein never \"toured\" SpaceX's facilities.\n\nIn early March of that year, Epstein directly asked Musk about his availability.\n\n\"now its time for fun,\" Epstein told Musk.\n\nIn the emails, Musk told Epstein he was busy with work at Tesla and SpaceX. Epstein suggested he get more sleep.\n\n\"benefit analysis would probably show , tesla doing better with you getting more sleep,\" he said.\n\n\"Normally I would agree, as I have found that my total daily productivity is optimal at around 6 to 6.5 hours of sleep.\"\n\nThe two may have met later that spring. In another email exchange, dated April 2013, Epstein's assistant said he planned to meet Musk at the Milken Institute economic conference.\n\nThe Justice Department emails also show Epstein inquiring with Musk about Solar City, a solar electricity company that was later acquired by Tesla. Epstein said in September 2012 that he wanted to use its services for his properties in the US Virgin Islands and New Mexico.\n\n\"is there any one at Solar City that my guys can talk to about electriying the caribean island?\" Epstein asked. \"or the new mexico ranch\"",

    "description": "Tesla's car sales dropped 11% while Elon Musk pivots to unproven robots, losing the EV crown to BYD as investors question the risky strategy.",
    "fullText": "Tesla’s car business just posted its first-ever annual revenue decline, but Elon Musk claims salvation lies in robots that don’t exist yet. The company’s Q4 2025 earnings revealed a brutal reality: automotive revenues plummeted 11% year-over-year to $69.53 billion, while total vehicle deliveries dropped 8.6% to 1.636 million units. Meanwhile, BYD cruised past Tesla as the world’s top EV maker, selling 2.26 million vehicles compared to Tesla’s shrinking numbers.\n\nThe most telling stat? Europe, where Tesla’s sales cratered 37.2%—the worst performance among all automakers, even as the broader EV market grew. Your Tesla stock might have rebounded 4% post-earnings, but that’s mainly because Musk spent the call talking about anything except cars.\n\nMusk positions Tesla as a “physical AI company” banking on unproven robotics technology.\n\nInstead of addressing why customers increasingly choose cheaper alternatives, Musk doubled down on his AI pivot. Tesla pumped $2 billion into his separate venture xAI, promising mysterious “collaboration frameworks.” The star of this show? Optimus humanoid robots, which Musk claims will enter production before 2026 ends and reach public sales by 2027.\n\nHe’s calling it the “biggest product ever” with poverty-ending potential—basically the tech equivalent of promising world peace through household appliances. The Robotaxi program, once Tesla’s golden ticket to autonomy riches, has quietly stalled. Those “unsupervised” tests that generated headlines? They’ve vanished faster than a TikTok trend.\n\nDeclining sales across all markets expose the risks of chasing sci-fi dreams over current products.\n\nYour Cybertruck enthusiasm apparently wasn’t shared—sales dropped 48% as the angular pickup failed to capture mainstream appeal. “2025 marks the year Tesla lost the BEV crown to BYD… a 620,000-unit gap,” noted Howard Yu from IMD Business School.\n\nThis pivot represents Silicon Valley’s ultimate moonshot mentality: when your core business falters, promise revolutionary technology that’s perpetually “just around the corner.” Tesla’s betting shareholders will stay patient while competitors like BYD offer reliable, affordable EVs today. Whether Musk’s robot army materializes or becomes another Hyperloop-level distraction remains the trillion-dollar question keeping investors awake at night.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know.

If this were to happen, it would also bring us one step closer to having one equity…\n\nEric Berger, the senior space editor at Ars Technica, said talks of a merger between SpaceX and xAI shouldn't be a \"huge surprise.\"\n\n\"If you believe AI is the future; and that compute is the major problem to solve; and orbital data centers are feasible—then the combined company would be a vertically integrated AI colossus,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe reported merger talks between SpaceX and xAI should not come as a huge surprise. If you believe AI is the future; and that compute is the major problem to solve; and orbital data centers are feasible—then the combined company would be a vertically integrated AI colossus.\n\nNoah Smith, a former Bloomberg journalist who now writes a popular economics substack, shared his concerns over OpenAI's future success in a post titled \"What if AI succeeds but OpenAI fails?\"\n\nAn OpenAI IPO will raise \"many more billions in cash, this time from regular investors,\" said Smith, but Sam Altman's company could be \"an early leader that flames out.\"\n\n\"Even if AI technology and the AI industry as a whole succeed wildly, OpenAI might not be the company that wins the race. That could leave a lot of investors holding the bag,\" he said.\n\n\"It could also cause a temporary — but unwarranted — chill in AI investment in the US, allowing Chinese companies to take the lead.\"\n\nRoss Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told The Information that he would not purchase SpaceX stock if the company goes public.\n\nSpaceX is \"not really a great business in the sense of profitability,\" said Gerber. \"To pay a trillion and a half dollars for a space company that does $15 billion in revenue is just insanity.\"\n\n\"If you're going to pay 2x or 3x just because it's Elon's company, I wish you the best of luck, and it's not something I am going to do,\" he said.",

    "description": "SpaceX is gearing up for a massive IPO this year, and multiple reports suggested the rocket giant is considering mergers with Tesla or xAI.",
    "fullText": "The \"Muskonomy\" might be about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up for a potential $1.5 trillion IPO this year, and multiple reports on Thursday night suggested the rocket company is considering blockbuster mergers with Tesla, Elon Musk's carmaker, or his AI startup, xAI.\n\nThe three companies have already been moving closer together in recent months. Tesla said on Wednesday that it had invested $2 billion in xAI, after SpaceX reportedly made a similar investment last year.\n\nThe electric carmaker also told investors it would evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with xAI, following its addition of the startup's Grok chatbot to its vehicles last July.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Musk has combined parts of his sprawling business empire. Last March, he announced that xAI had purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk bought for $44 billion in 2022.\n\nMerging xAI with one of Tesla or SpaceX would mark a dramatic escalation of the so-called \"Muskonomy,\" however. Here's what it could mean for the future of Elon Musk's business empire.\n\nAt first glance, bringing social media site X, the controversial chatbot Grok, and the reusable rocket Starship under one roof seems like a strange mix. But merging SpaceX and xAI does fit with Musk's long-term vision for an AI-powered future.\n\nThe world's richest man has suggested that the logical conclusion of the AI infrastructure boom is to build data centres in the freezing vacuum of space, where they can access plentiful solar power and operate without the huge amounts of water needed to cool them on Earth.\n\nSpeaking at Davos last week, Musk suggested that space will become the \"lowest cost\" place to train AI, and said that SpaceX will launch solar-powered AI satellites in the next few years that will ultimately scale up to \"hundreds of terawatts\" of energy consumption a year.\n\nMusk has also said that SpaceX's Starship rocket and growing network of Starlink satellites could form the basis of a massive network of orbital AI compute.\n\nAccess to this infrastructure could give xAI an advantage over rivals OpenAI and Google, who are scrambling for computing power and exploring space-based data centers themselves as they look to build ever more powerful AI models.\n\nAnother consideration is funding. Training AI is notoriously expensive, with xAI reportedly burning through billions of dollars in cash and regularly taking on new funding. SpaceX, meanwhile, has seen revenue grow in recent years and is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion.\n\nMerging SpaceX with Tesla, which has been a public company since 2010, would be more complicated — and the payoff less obvious.\n\nThe two companies already enjoy close links, having shared board members and executives in the past. And, in 2018, Musk used SpaceX for some out-of-this-world marketing by blasting his Tesla Roadster into space on a Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nTheir current businesses, however, have less obvious areas of overlap.\n\nTesla is shifting from a carmaker to an AI and robotics company, with Musk saying on Wednesday that Tesla would scrap the Model X and S and use their production lines to build its Optimus robot.\n\nThe company also has a thriving energy storage business, and at Davos last week, Musk said that both Tesla and SpaceX were separately working to build up to \"a hundred gigawatts a year\" of solar power in the US.\n\nCombining the two could be a step toward Musk's more grandiose dreams of massively expanding humanity's energy production.\n\nMusk also reiterated on Wednesday that he believes Tesla needs to build a \"terafab\" to build advanced AI chips, and in an X post in November suggested that Tesla's terafab could produce chips for SpaceX's solar-powered AI satellites.\n\nOne throughline that connects all of Musk's enterprises is his obsession with settling Mars, which the billionaire has described as critical to humanity's long-term survival.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up to use Starship to launch uncrewed missions to Mars in the coming years, and the billionaire has previously said that these missions would carry Tesla's Optimus to the red planet.\n\nOne thing that's clear is that combining his various companies has been on Musk's mind for a while. Way back in 2020, he responded to a Twitter post suggesting he merge SpaceX, Tesla, and the Boring Company.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame compared Elon Musk to Thomas Edison, but called the Tesla and SpaceX CEO a \"desperately incentivized futurist.\"",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Elon Musk is a true visionary — but the future he's building is much further away than he thinks.\n\n\"Elon is an American treasure but also a desperately incentivized futurist even earlier than me,\" the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame posted on X late Thursday.\n\nBurry, known for making premature but ultimately correct predictions, likely meant the Tesla and SpaceX CEO stands to profit enormously from his vision becoming reality, so he's highly motivated to hype it as much as he can.\n\n\"I am glad he is here in America,\" Burry wrote on his Substack. \"He will go down in history like PT Barnum and Thomas Edison,\" he added, referring to the legendary showman and founder of the Barnum & Bailey Circus, and the iconic inventor who helped refine the electric light bulb.\n\nFuturists are \"always decades early, even earlier than I am,\" Burry continued. \"And since they sell self-evident futures with indefinite timelines, they can raise capital.\"\n\nBurry attached a link to an article about Musk reportedly exploring a merger between SpaceX and either or both of his other main companies, Tesla and xAI.\n\nSpaceX was valued at $800 billion in a private share sale in December, Tesla has a $1.3 trillion market capitalization, and xAI was valued at $230 billion in a November fundraising round.\n\nBurry said it \"did not take a futurist to know this was coming,\" and the market had already priced in a potential combination. He added that $1.6 trillion \"more than encompasses\" what the trio are worth today, even accounting for their future value.\n\nThe value investor, who recently shifted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, wrote that Tesla was \"ridiculously overvalued\" in a December post. He also warned that Musk's $1 trillion pay package would continue to dilute the company's shares.\n\nThat historic compensation deal underpins why Musk is so driven to market his vision and work toward realizing it. He's required to hit several milestones by 2035 to receive the full share allotment; those include raising Tesla's market value to $8.5 trillion, delivering 1 million robots, and bringing 1 million robotaxis into commercial service.\n\nAs for Musk's grand vision, he's repeatedly said he intends for humanity to colonize Mars in his lifetime. Moreover, he recently recommended people not save for retirement in 10 or 20 years, as he expects advances in AI, energy, and robotics to generate so many resources for all that nobody will need a nest egg.\n\nBurry has butted heads with Musk over the years. In 2021, he took aim at Tesla for its reliance on government subsidies and Musk for paring his stake in the EV maker.\n\nMusk responded by writing: \"Burry is a broken clock.\" He also teased Burry in 2022 about his previous short bet against Tesla.\n\nMusk hasn't responded to any of Burry's recent X posts, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Tesla is giving the Model S and Model X the ax. Recent sales figures help explain why.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is taking its Model S and Model X to pasture.\n\nThe automaker will end production of the $94,990 sedan and $99,990 SUV next quarter, CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\nBased on recent delivery numbers, the decision isn't particularly surprising.\n\nTesla does not break out Model S and Model X sales individually; instead, it groups them with the Cybertruck under \"other models.\" Still, earnings presentations suggest demand for the category has been declining for years.\n\nIn 2025, Tesla sold 50,850 \"other model\" units worldwide — accounting for just over 3% of the automaker's 1,636,129 sales.\n\nThe \"other model\" figures are also down sharply from prior years. Tesla sold 85,133 vehicles in the category in 2024 — the first full year of Cybertruck deliveries.\n\nThat means sales fell about 40% in 2025, far steeper than the roughly 7% declines for the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nThe soon-to-be-discontinued cars will remain an important part of Tesla's history. The Model S, launched in 2012, was the automaker's first car built from the ground up. The Model X came three years later, giving the company a foothold in America's best-selling vehicle category, the SUV.\n\nThe Model X has faced reliability issues from the jump. The car's sweeping gullwing doors were difficult to mass assemble, Musk said, calling the vehicle a \"Fabergé egg\" during a 2019 earnings call.\n\nAnd while Tesla refreshed much of its lineup in 2025, the Model S and Model X received comparatively modest design updates — a contrast with the more aggressive changes to the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nInstead of chasing a revival of the aging car's sales, Tesla said it is discontinuing the program's production in favor of its Optimus humanoid robot. Musk projects building one million bots a year.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said, adding that the decision was \"slightly sad.\"\n\nThe move underscores how far Tesla has shifted away from its legacy luxury models as growth slows and Musk pushes the company toward robotics and autonomy.\n\nStill, analysts aren't fully sold on the idea that Tesla's manufacturing switch-up will lead to immediate profits or sales results.\n\n\"The company appears to be on track with the rollout of Robotaxi service in nine US cities, alongside the start of production for the Cybercab and Semi,\" Steve Man, the senior auto industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider. \"But we believe a commercially ready Optimus robot remains at least a couple of years away.\"\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "\"Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?\"\n\nElon Musk made the plea in the final moments of Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, sounding a bit fired up.\n\nMusk had just finished giving a blunt warning to American companies: build more battery-making infrastructure in the US or risk falling behind.\n\nThe Tesla CEO argued that too many companies are underestimating their exposure to geopolitical risks posed by fragile supply chains, particularly for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\n\"There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen,\" Musk said. \"I'm way more paranoid than that.\"\n\nHe added that his concern has pushed Tesla to take unusual — and expensive — steps to protect its future, including building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas.\n\nIn December 2024, the company began processing lithium from its $1 billion Robstown, Texas, refinery. This month, Tesla announced it is producing dry-electrode 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin, which will end up in \"certain Model Ys.\"\n\nOn the call, Musk described those facilities as \"more advanced than anything else in the world,\" but stressed that Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.\n\n\"Why do we have to build these things? Why can others not also please build these things? I mean, it's very hard to build these things, and we're building them out of desperation, because nobody else is building lithium refineries and cathode refineries,\" Musk said.\n\n\"You know, we're pretty much the largest, but also the only lithium refinery and cathode refinery in America,\" he added. \"So, yeah. So. We're making moves to make sure that, no matter what happens, Tesla will prosper.\"\n\nIndependent research suggests Musk's worries are not unfounded.\n\nAn October analysis by the Dallas Federal Reserve identified 66 lithium projects across the US, but found that many remain in early development stages and face long timelines, high costs, and volatile lithium prices. Many projects could take a decade or more to reach commercial production, if they get there at all, the study found.\n\nA few other American automakers are beginning to invest as well.\n\nIn 2024, General Motors invested $625 million in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas Corporation's plans to build a lithium mine in Nevada. The facility is expected to become America's largest mine and plans to open between late 2026 and early 2027. In 2025, the US government took a minority stake in the project.\n\nTesla argues that its investments in battery infrastructure and energy storage have helped offset auto revenue pressure as its car business declines.\n\nTesla's lithium-based energy storage batteries — called Megapacks — reported Q4 revenue of over $3.8 billion, a 25% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nAnalysts express some concern that Tesla is committing tens of billions of dollars to long-term industrial projects, even as the company is openly uncertain about near-term returns.\n\n\"What we learned from the earnings call is that a whole bunch of billions of dollars will be flowing out of the company in the form of capital expenditures: more than $20 billion,\" David Meier, a senior analyst at Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"That's a massive investment, but it's necessary as the plan is to raise 6 production plants, continue to develop AI infrastructure, and upgrade current manufacturing facilities.\"\n\nMusk warned that companies that fail to insulate against geopolitical risks could pay a steep price.\n\n\"Companies that don't do that,\" he said, \"a bunch of them will cease to exist.\"",

    "title": "I'm trying to guess why Elon Musk wants to mash SpaceX into xAI — or Tesla. I'm stumped.",
    "description": "Elon Musk's companies already share employees, resources and investors. Maybe a possible merger of SpaceX and xAI  — or Tesla — would simplify things.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk starts and owns lots of companies. Maybe he's going to change that, a bit: The world's richest man is reportedly working on a plan to merge two of his most valuable companies into one megacompany.\n\nWhich one of his companies is a question: Reuters reports that Musk wants to merge xAI — his very valuable AI company that has already merged with the company that used to be called Twitter — into SpaceX, his very valuable rocket company. And Bloomberg reports that SpaceX is also considering a merger with Tesla, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe SpaceX-xAI tie-up could help Musk build data centers in space. \"The combination would bring Musk's rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and ​Grok AI chatbot under one roof,\" the Reuters report says. Then again, Reuters also says it doesn't know several key details about the theoretical deal, including \"its ‌primary rationale.\"\n\nAnd to be honest, the rationale seems a little obscure to me, too.\n\nThe main reason I can think of to merge one private company with another private company that's about to go public would be to make it easier for the smaller private company to finance itself.\n\nIn this case, that would mean that xAI wouldn't have to rely on the private markets as it races after the likes of OpenAI, Google, and Meta in the competition for AI talent and chips. It could tap the public market instead.\n\nThe problem with that theory: People in the private market are lining up to throw money at xAI, which just raised $20 billion. The company boasted that it was only going to raise $15 billion, but people kept throwing money at it, so it had to go and raise more.\n\nAnd, Muskian boasting aside, that makes lots of sense: Despite all the AI bubble chat, people are eager to put money into big, privately owned AI companies, as OpenAI and Anthropic prove every time they raise a ton of money, which happens to be all the time.\n\nJust as important: People are eager to give Elon Musk money because he's made a lot of people a lot of money from Tesla, and they're eager to give him another chance. (That's why the people who helped him fund his value-destroying Twitter deal never once complained about it in public: They wanted a chance to invest in his next deal.)\n\nI've asked Musk, SpaceX, and xAI for comment. It may be worth noting that Musk, who complains about coverage of his companies all the time, did not complain when someone retweeted the Reuters story Thursday afternoon.\n\nI suppose you could also try to argue that SpaceX and xAI make sense together because a bunch of their work overlaps, like the theoretical xAI space data centers that could get built with SpaceX rockets.\n\nBut Elon Musk has always treated his various companies as one big company when it suits him. He moves engineering and managing talent from one company to another when he wants — even when those employees work for Tesla, which is publicly owned, and theoretically should have a problem with lending its staff to other people's companies.\n\nSometimes there are complaints about Musk using resources from one company to help another — or, perhaps, himself. But Musk has pretty much ignored all of those complaints. I can't believe he's interested in moving xAI into SpaceX because he cares about corporate governance.\n\nAnother reason to mash the companies together might be to reward investors who bet on one private company by giving them publicly traded shares in the combined company. But, again, that doesn't really track here: Musk has a bunch of loyal backers, like Fidelity and Valor Equity Partners, which try to get into all his deals, and are already in both companies.\n\nSo maybe there will be a big galaxy-brained rationale for mushing xAI or Tesla and SpaceX together, and we just have to wait for Musk to unveil it. In the absence of that, here's my last guess: Musk, who is already reportedly trying to time his SpaceX IPO to \"coincide with a rare planetary alignment and his birthday,\" per Financial Times reports, just wants his giant SpaceX IPO to be even bigger. Prior to Thursday's report, SpaceX was supposed to go public at a $1.5 trillion valuation — the largest IPO in history. So maybe he's just trying to boost that valuation by a half trillion more.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX and xAI are in discussions to merge ahead of a blockbuster public offering planned for later this year. The combination would bring Musk’s rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and Grok AI chatbot under one roof, according to a person briefed on the matter and two ​recent company filings seen by Reuters.\n\nHow could space-based data centers reduce AI costs?\n\nWhat would the proposed SpaceX-xAI merger involve?\n\nWhat defense applications are planned for merged companies?\n\nWhy is Musk combining his different business ventures?\n\nThe plan, which Reuters is reporting exclusively, would give fresh momentum to SpaceX’s effort to launch data centers into orbit as Musk battles for supremacy in the rapidly ‌escalating AI race against tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI.\n\nMusk, the world's richest man, is the CEO of both the private space company SpaceX and the artificial intelligence company xAI, which controls his social media platform X. He also runs electric automaker Tesla, tunnel ‌company The Boring Co. and neurotechnology company Neuralink.\n\nMusk, SpaceX, and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnder the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX. Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction, the person said.\n\nCorporate filings in Nevada show that those entities were set up on January 21. One of them, a limited liability company, lists SpaceX and Bret Johnsen, the company's chief financial officer, as managing members, while the other lists Johnsen as the company's only officer, the filings show.\n\nThe filings don't contain additional information about the purpose of the companies ⁠or their role in any deal.\n\nJohnsen did not respond to a Reuters ‌request for comment.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential, said that some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal. A final agreement, however, hasn't been signed, and the timing and structure of the transaction remain fluid, the person cautioned.\n\nSpaceX is already the world's most ‍valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reuters and other media have reported that SpaceX plans to go public some time this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion.\n\nThrough xAI, Musk is building out a massive supercomputer for AI training in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI as part of the startup’s $5 billion equity ​fundraising, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.",

    "description": "In its quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Tesla said fourth-quarter profits were down by 61% year-over-year, and annual profit cratered by 46% in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Everything is going great over at Tesla. Wait, sorry, no. Everything is going bad over at Tesla. The automaker held its quarterly earnings call on Thursday, announcing that fourth-quarter profits were down by 61% year-over-year, and annual profit cratered by 46% in 2025. Beyond posting its lowest profits in years, Tesla's revenue from car sales was down 11% year-over-year, and it was the second year in a row that sales declined.\n\nIt gets worse. As reported by TechCrunch, on the call, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla is killing off the Model S sedan and Model X SUV. This isn't exactly a surprise, as the two EVs are Tesla's oldest models, with the Model S launching in 2012 and the Model X following three years later. It's been years since either have been strong sellers; while Tesla no longer breaks out their sales, in 2025 it delivered 50,850 units of the Cybertruck, Model S and Model X combined (a 40.2% decrease compared to 2024), with the latter two likely making up 30,000 of those. Honestly, this should've happened a long time ago, ideally followed by next-generation versions of both, but that was never gonna happen. Instead, Tesla gave both models a couple of enshittifying facelifts over the past few years, the most recent of which came just a few months ago.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said on the call, \"so if you're interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.\" The last units of both cars will be built at some point next quarter. Musk said their discontinuation \"is slightly sad.\" Boo hoo. He added that Tesla will support Model S and Model X owners \"for as long as people have the vehicles,\" whatever that means.\n\nTaking their place on the assembly lines of Tesla's Fremont, California, factory will allegedly be the Optimus robot. As The Verge reports, Musk said the \"mass production\" version of the Optimus will be shown later this quarter, and the first one will allegedly be built before the end of the year. We've heard how those promises usually turn out. Previously, Musk has said he aims for Tesla to build a million of them per year. Uh huh. He's also focused on getting the Tesla Cybercab out. We're not holding our breath for that one, either.\n\nPutting everything else Tesla and Elon-related aside, it is a shame to see the Model S get snuffed out like this. It did revolutionize the car industry, and while newer versions have been suckier, the early years of the Model S were truly great. Too bad their creator is focused on making the automotive world, and the world as a whole, a worse place.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk recently said that saving for retirement could become \"irrelevant\" in the next decade, as new technologies promise to create such an abundance of resources that nobody will need a nest egg.\n\nDario Amodei warned this week that achieving a plentiful future won't be easy. The CEO of Anthropic, the AI startup behind ChatGPT-rival Claude, wrote in an essay that AI promises to \"raise the quality of life for everyone\" — but there will be a brutal \"rite of passage\" to get there.\n\nAmodei said that at the current rate of progress, \"it cannot possibly be more than a few years before AI is better than humans at essentially everything.\"\n\nReplacing human labor with AI could supercharge economic growth and productivity, but the \"short-term shock will be unprecedented in size,\" he wrote.\n\nAmodei said he was worried that workers displaced by AI \"could form an unemployed or very-low-wage 'underclass,'\" and a tiny minority could capture most of the financial gains from AI, creating a \"level of wealth concentration that will break society.\"\n\nHe described those potential impacts on labor and equality as \"grave problems\" that AI companies, employers, philanthropists, and governments would have to work together to solve.\n\nAmodei noted that he and Anthropic's other cofounders have pledged to donate 80% of their wealth to good causes, and the company will match individual donations from its staff worth billions of dollars at its current valuation.\n\nAnthropic's boss shared a similar vision to Musk in a 2024 essay. He wrote that AI will eventually become \"so broadly effective and so cheap\" that the current economic system will \"no longer make sense.\"\n\nIt could be replaced by a \"large universal basic income for everyone,\" or a \"capitalist economy of AI systems\" that distributes \"huge amounts\" of resources to people as the \"overall economic pie will be gigantic,\" he added.\n\nBut he also flagged the risk of \"exploitative or dystopian directions\" and said, \"We will likely have to fight to get a good outcome here.\"\n\nBusiness Insider recently spoke to seven AI and personal finance gurus about Musk's vision, and they shared several of Amodei's concerns.\n\nThey urged Americans to keep saving for retirement just in case Musk is wrong — and said that even if he's right, making sure everyone reaps the rewards of AI will require immense planning and coordination.",

    "description": "Hiking subscriptions, making robots, and selling fewer cars? Tesla is acting like a tech company in more ways than one.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has long insisted Tesla isn't a car company. After its latest earnings, it looks less like one than ever.\n\nThe billionaire told investors that Tesla would scrap its Model S and X EVs and convert their production lines to build the company's Optimus humanoid robot, as it continues to shift toward AI and robotics.\n\nTesla also said it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI and to evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with Musk's AI startup.\n\nIt came as the company's financial disclosures painted a stark picture of the troubles facing its EV business, which saw sales decline for the second year in a row in 2025.\n\nTesla beat Wall Street's expectations, but reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue and said profits fell by 46% last year, while revenue from car sales fell by 11% year-over-year in the last quarter.\n\nExecutives largely shrugged off the headwinds, with Musk and other top employees reiterating in the analyst Q&A their belief that autonomous vehicles will shortly render traditional forms of transport obsolete.\n\n\"The vast majority of miles traveled will be autonomous in the future,\" said Musk, in response to an investor question asking about Tesla's plans to launch new models.\n\n\"I'm just guessing, but probably less than 5% of miles driven will be where somebody's actually driving the car themselves in the future, maybe as low as 1%,\" he added.\n\nInvestors reacted positively, with Tesla shares rising around 3% after hours following earnings.\n\nThe reaction is another sign of how, for many investors, vehicle sales have become a sidenote to Tesla's future, as the company executes an ambitious shift toward a new business model built on robotics, AI, and software services.\n\n\"They're definitely moving away from an automotive-oriented company to a tech-oriented company,\" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, told Business Insider prior to Tesla's earnings. '\"This is a company that's looking to get away from vehicle sales as the focus of their revenue.\"\n\nElon Musk has long said that Tesla should be thought of as an AI and robotics company, not a carmaker. Investors have agreed, driving Tesla's market cap to $1.35 trillion, more than every other US carmaker combined.\n\nEven before Tesla's latest AI-focused earnings, there were signs that the company had begun to act more like the tech giant Musk dreams of.\n\nThe company overhauled its autonomy offerings in recent weeks, removing the option to buy its premium Full Self-Driving software for a one-off fee of $8,000 and making it subscription-only.\n\nTesla also killed its basic Autopilot tier, which previously came free on almost all its vehicles, instead replacing it with a more limited form of cruise control. Musk also indicated in a post on X that Tesla owners can expect FSD prices to rise beyond the $99-per-month subscription fee as the technology improves.\n\nPhasing out free features and hiking subscription prices is classic tech giant behavior, and the moves quickly sparked backlash from Tesla fans and customers on social media. Analysts told Business Insider the changes were likely aimed at driving adoption of FSD and monetizing the existing user base.\n\n\"I think it's about monetizing FSD. I think they're going to look at more ways to monetize what I view as services, autonomous, and really disruptive technology within their installments,\" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities and a longtime Tesla Bull, told Business Insider ahead of earnings.\n\nMusk has described FSD as crucial to Tesla's future, but the company has struggled to get drivers to pay for it. In October, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja told investors that just 12% of Tesla owners have bought FSD.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taneja said that 1.1 million customers had bought FSD, but added that nearly 70% of those purchases were upfront rather than subscription.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key milestone for Musk's $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to hit 10 million active FSD subscriptions by 2035 for the Tesla CEO to unlock the full payout.\n\nThe most critical part of Tesla's transition to a tech company is its robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot initiatives, which Musk has said will eventually make Tesla the world's most valuable company.\n\nTom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Business Insider that nearly 75% of his long-term valuation of the company was based on robotics and autonomous vehicles, with just 8% coming from car sales. Ives put that figure at 80-90%, adding that he viewed Tesla as an \"autonomous and robotics company\" moving forward.\n\n\"That's why this is such a key transition year for Musk and Tesla. Any delays in autonomous or robotaxis are going to be heavily scrutinized because that's the key to the valuation,\" Ives added.\n\nTesla launched its robotaxi service in Austin last June, and recently began offering some public rides without a safety driver. However, its service in the Texan city is still small, with around 50 active vehicles, according to a community tracker run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna.\n\nMusk said on Wednesday that Tesla would have robotaxis operating in \"somewhere between a quarter and half\" of the US by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval, and the company is set to begin production on its dedicated Cybercab robotaxi in April.\n\nIves added that Tesla's focus this year would be on building out its robotaxi service, noting he didn't expect the company to begin collecting \"meaningful revenue\" from autonomous ride-hailing until 2027.\n\n\"It's important that they get into what I believe will probably be roughly about 30 cities this year. 2026 is the build-out of robotaxis, 2027 is where you'll start to see more monetization,\" Ives said.\n\nOnce Tesla's robotaxi service reaches escape velocity, Narayan said he expects it to transform the company's business model from a traditional carmaker into a high-margin services business more akin to Uber.\n\n\"It dramatically transforms the current auto business, which is a capital-intensive, low-margin business, into a high-margin, much higher revenue business,\" he said. \"The market is bigger and the economics are far better.\"\n\nExecuting that transition will be expensive. Taneja, Tesla's CFO, said on Wednesday that the company expects to spend more than $20 billion this year on new production lines and AI compute infrastructure.\n\nFor Tesla's beleaguered EV business, things look unlikely to improve anytime soon.\n\nAlthough Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market in the US, the end of the $7,500 tax credit in September has caused that market to slow dramatically, with rivals Ford and GM canceling electric models and taking billions of dollars in charges amid warnings of an EV winter.\n\nOutside of the US, Tesla is losing market share to Chinese carmakers such as BYD, which now dominate China's booming EV market and are growing rapidly in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nAutoForecast Solutions' Fiorani said that Tesla ran the risk of a bumpy transition period if its carmaking business declined faster than its robotaxi and services businesses could grow. However, he added that the company may have no choice but to make the leap.\n\nHe pointed to the competition from China and declining income from the regulatory credits that Tesla sells to automakers who have failed to sell enough EVs as evidence that the company's automotive business was running out of road.\n\n\"Musk sees the future of this business as robots and autonomous vehicles,\" Fiorani said.\n\n\"The physical products themselves, the cars and the automotive side, are all legacy products,\" he added. \"We're going to see them going forward to autonomous software, autonomous hardware, things that will move them into the next generation.\"",

    "title": "Tesla takes another leap toward becoming a physical AI company: Here are the 6 biggest takeaways from its Q4 earnings call.",
    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a $2B investment into xAI and the discontinuation of Model S and Model X in order to support Optimus robot production.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is making another leap to shed its EV maker title and transform into a full-fledged physical AI outfit.\n\nThe theme of Wednesday's fourth-quarter earnings call heavily centered on how Tesla is investing in its future as an AI and robotics company — a narrative CEO Elon Musk has pushed for some time now.\n\nThe bets included: a major investment in Musk's xAI, updates on the Optimus humanoid robot, and a renewed push for in-house chipmaking. Musk projected that Tesla's future will require a $20 billion investment, which dwarfs the company's $8.5 billion in capex reported for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's automotive segment took a back seat: Musk said he's killing the Model S and Model X to free up room for humanoid robot production. And while Tesla's energy and \"services\" revenue jumped 25% and 18%, respectively, auto revenue fell 11% year-over-year — a clear indication that the quarter's growth came from everywhere but its core EV business.\n\n\"We've updated the Tesla mission to amazing abundance, and this is an attempt to send a message of optimism about the future,\" Musk said during the call.\n\nThe company's stock rose 1.7% after the market closed on Wednesday evening.\n\nHere are 6 biggest takeaways from the earnings call.\n\nTesla made good on its pledge to investors and announced a $2 billion investment into xAI, the startup behind Grok. It's part of a larger $20 billion Series E funding round from January.\n\nThe expectation of the investment is a deeper collaboration between the two companies. xAI, which has been expanding its data center footprint, could provide the compute and other technical capabilities to further advance Tesla's autonomous vehicle and robotics agenda.\n\nVaibhav Taneja, Tesla's chief financial officer, said during the call that the agreement with xAI is in the spirit of finding \"efficient ways for others to help us.\"\n\nIn a surprise move, Musk announced that production of the Model S and Model X would be discontinued by the next quarter, closing a chapter on the company's premium SUV and sedan.\n\nThat leaves the EV maker with four cars: the Cybertruck, the more popular Model 3 and Model Y, and the yet-to-be-released Cybercab.\n\nThe CEO said during the call that the move will provide more production space in Tesla's Fremont factory for Optimus robots.\n\nThe \"long-term goal\" is to produce a million units a year with the freed-up space, Musk said.\n\nThe CEO added that killing the Model S and Model X is part of Tesla's \"overall shift to an autonomous future,\" which includes the company's ride-hailing service, Tesla Robotaxi, and autonomy in personally owned vehicles through Full Self-Driving, an advanced driver assistance system.\n\nTesla expects to start production of the Cybercab, a two-seater coupe, in April for eventual integration into its Robotaxi fleet.\n\nTesla revealed where it aims to expand the Robotaxi ride-hailing service in the first half of 2026 — Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas — but has yet to announce when it will remove the safety monitors inside the cars for public riders across Austin and San Francisco Bay Area, where the service now operates.\n\nMusk said that FSD — the technology that Tesla says will make personally owned vehicles fully autonomous — is already \"100% unsupervised\" and operating without humans inside. The difference, he said, is that Tesla is being \"very cautious\" with rolling out unsupervised service to the public, though Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides in Austin this month.\n\n\"There's like some pretty nutty intersections, where there are a lot of humans who make mistakes and have accidents in various cities,\" Musk said. \"So we want to make sure that FSD can handle those unusual intersections.\"\n\nThere wasn't much of a progress report on Tesla's AI5 chip, but the CEO said he's spending part of his weekends working on it.\n\n\"If I'm spending my Saturdays on something, it's going to be something pretty important,\" Musk said, adding that chip procurement is \"existential\" for Tesla's future, going so far as to bring up the Tesla \"Terafab\" — his aspirational idea of building an in-house chip manufacturing plant.\n\nMusk said he wants to build a factory that integrates \"logic, memory, and packaging\" because Tesla will be \"fundamentally limited by supply chain\" if it doesn't.\n\nMusk said he expects to unveil an Optimus 3 robot in a \"few months,\" but don't expect it to be working the assembly lines just yet.\n\nThe CEO said Optimus isn't contributing to Tesla's manufacturing work in any \"material way\" and that the humanoid robot is only in the factory for training purposes.\n\nMusk talked a lot about Tesla's future, but the company's fourth-quarter performance still hinged on its tangible businesses, such as its energy segment, which includes the Megapack, a utility-scale battery system, and the Powerwall, the home battery system.\n\n\"On the energy front, we achieved yet another record in terms of gross profits for the quarter and ended the year with nearly $12.8 billion in revenue,\" Taneja, the Tesla CFO, said.\n\nTesla also announced this month that it will pivot FSD to a subscription-based only model starting in February. Customers previously had the option to buy FSD upfront for $8,000.\n\nThe move is a clear signal that Tesla sees FSD as a key future revenue generator.\n\nAutomakers are increasingly betting that software subscription services will be a critical source of recurring revenue with higher margins. General Motors revealed that its vehicle software generated $2 billion in the past nine months.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the company will be discontinuing the Model S and X in the next quarter, bringing an end to the EV maker's more premium SUV and sedan models.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" the CEO said during Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nMusk said Tesla is replacing the Model S and Model X production lines in its Fremont Factory in California with an Optimus factory, with the long-term goal being to produce one million robots a year.\n\nTesla will continue to support the Model S and Model X vehicles for as long as people have them, Musk said, adding that for people interested in owning one, \"now would be the time to order it.\"\n\nThe CEO said the shift was \"slightly sad\" but part of the company's \"overall shift to an autonomous future.\"\n\nTesla's stock was up on Wednesday after the company beat earnings expectations and announced it would invest $2 billion into xAI, Musk's AI company. Tesla also announced it plans to release the third generation of its Optimus robot later this quarter.\n\nThe Model S and Model X are some of Tesla's oldest models, as well as its priciest.\n\nTesla unveiled a prototype for the Model S, a sedan, in 2009 and began deliveries to customers in 2012. The Model X, an SUV, was announced in 2012, with first deliveries going out in 2015.\n\nBoth models received upgrades in 2025, including an increase in driving range, better noise cancellation, and smoother suspension, as well as a price increase of $4,500. However, the upgrades did not include some of the more innovative technologies that were introduced with Tesla's Cybertruck.\n\nThe starting price on Tesla's site for the Model S was $94,990 as of Wednesday, or $109,990 for the more premium Plaid version. The Model X was $99,990, or $114,990 for Plaid.",

    "fullText": "World’s richest person targeting symbolic date in June for flotation of rocket company\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is considering a flotation valuing the rocket company at $1.5tn (£1.1tn) that will reportedly be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and the multibillionaire’s birthday.\n\nThe world’s richest person is targeting a symbolic date of mid-June for the initial public offering, according to the Financial Times. This would be around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other and shortly before Musk turns 55 on 28 June.\n\nThe FT also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $50bn – valuing it at $1.5tn – compared with previous reports that it was looking for $25bn at an $800bn valuation. Last week, it was reported that the rocket company was considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in the share sale.\n\nMusk, whose $680bn fortune would be turbo-boosted by a SpaceX flotation, said last year the company’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa. The billionaire owns about 42% of SpaceX, as well as nearly 17% of the electric carmaker Tesla, where he is chief executive. He also owns more than three-quarters of the social media platform X.\n\nSpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service.\n\nIf the flotation goes ahead it would involve a bigger initial fundraising than the IPO of the oil company Saudi Aramco, which raised $29bn in 2019, although for a larger total valuation of $1.7tn.\n\nThe chief financial officer of SpaceX, Bret Johnsen, has held talks and video conference calls with existing private investors since December to explore a mid-2026 IPO, the FT added.\n\nMusk has reportedly been swayed by the idea of a SpaceX float because of its growing valuation and the success of Starlink.\n\nGlobal financial markets are anticipating a year of significant US listings, with the artificial intelligence companies Anthropic and OpenAI also laying early groundwork for potential IPOs.\n\nA rebound in the US equity capital market activity began in 2025 after three years of limited activity, partly as the result of volatility and geopolitical tensions. Space technology is a tightly held sector but is sought after by investors keen for exposure in light of rapid development prospects, analysts have said.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said the mooted $1.5tn price tag was a “monster premium”.\n\nHe added: “A valuation that big reflects not just a tech and AI premium but Elon Musk’s stardust and a frothy market, plus a heck of a lot of media narrative around this. It is to some degree a kind of bet on the future space economy.”\n\nSpaceX has been approached for comment.",

Khosla has fought for years against public access to Martins Beach, which runs through his $37 million estate, and has filed multiple lawsuits over the issue.\n\nKhosla and Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe two billionaires have clashed before.

In the last quarter, it had an average airfare of 44 euros — about $52 — while reporting after-tax profits of 115 million euros ($137 million) before an exceptional charge for a fine.\n\nIn recent months, many airlines have signed deals with Starlink, which can provide in-flight internet speeds of over 200 Mbps — faster than many home WiFi connections.\n\nHowever, for Ryanair and O'Leary, cheap tickets are more important for winning customers.\n\n\"I have no doubt in my mind that a low fare will beat free WiFi on board every single time,\" the CEO told investors.\n\nHis weeklong quarrel with Musk was sparked by questions about the extra fuel costs incurred by installing a Starlink terminal on an airplane.\n\nO'Leary said the aerodynamic drag would lead to a 2% increase, costing over $200 million a year and raising ticket prices. However, a SpaceX executive said in an X post that the increase was only 0.3%.\n\nEither way, O'Leary said on Monday, any extra fuel costs would be unacceptable.\n\nHe said that Ryanair would add in-flight WiFI \"in a heartbeat\" if the technology improves so that antennae don't need to be installed outside an airplane's fuselage.\n\nO'Leary suggested that, in the next few years, such antennae could instead be installed in the hold.\n\nRyanair is continuing discussions with Starlink, Amazon, and the British telecoms firm Vodafone, he said.\n\nSome of these operators believe that at least half of passengers would pay for in-flight WiFi, O'Leary said on the call, but he thinks no more than 10% would do so.\n\nEvery Starlink-airline deal so far has included free access for all passengers, although many mandate signing up for loyalty programs.\n\nRyanair's spat with Musk also garnered \"lots of free publicity,\" O'Leary said. The outspoken boss and the airline's social media team are known for making provocative comments to get attention.\n\nThe airline's press conference last week, promoting a sale in the wake of the argument, was covered by some 1,500 news articles across nearly 60 countries, O'Leary said on the call.",

    "description": "My front camera had problems with condensation, especially in direct, low sunlight. Tesla cleaned it, but this could be a challenge for full autonomy.",
    "fullText": "Tesla offered a free trial of its FSD system in December. I was driven autonomously for most of the month and came away with new insights.\n\nThe latest software was impressive, but my experience revealed a glaring problem that could hamper Tesla's path toward a full, unsupervised Robotaxi service.\n\nFirst, the good stuff. I have a Model 3 Performance with HW4 hardware. It doesn't have a camera near the front bumper, but otherwise it's modern hardware. I also have an up-to-date version of FSD.\n\nThis combination resulted in an amazing FSD experience. I drove from Silicon Valley to Lake Tahoe in supervised autonomous mode and had no issues. I drove into SF and back several times, trouble-free.\n\nI estimate 90% to 95% of my driving was in FSD mode during December. It's a new state of driving that I think is safer than human driving. I spend less time worrying about where I'm going and which turn to make. Instead, my eyes are on the road and my hands are ready near the wheel, just in case.\n\nDespite the ability to text while being driven now, I pay more attention to the road in FSD mode, not less.\n\nA surprise bonus: I argue (OK, debate!) less with my wife about directions when we are on FSD-powered trips together. There's no discussion about whether this or that route is better. FSD just does it. This reduces the potential for marital spats. That's probably worth the entire $100-a-month FSD subscription cost.\n\nWhen Tesla told me my month-long trial was ending, I was genuinely disappointed. Do I pay monthly now? No. But I don't drive enough at the moment. If my wife's or my commute becomes much longer, we would certainly pay.\n\nThis was all supervised autonomous driving. That means Tesla requires human owners to be at the wheel and alert at all times.\n\nUnsupervised autonomy is the next frontier. That's when cars drive themselves with no human at the wheel. Waymo already does this in Silicon Valley and a few other urban areas in the US. Tesla's Robotaxi service started doing this in Austin recently, but elsewhere, these Robotaxis still have safety drivers behind the wheel.\n\nMaking this leap is a huge feat. And Tesla is trying to do this with a purely camera-based system, while Waymo uses cameras, Lidar, and other sensors that are not just vision-based.\n\nThis is the big schism in the industry. Backers of the multi-sensor approach say their systems are better and safer because components such as Lidar collect data without \"seeing,\" so they work in more environments. However, this is more expensive than camera-only systems.\n\nTesla's approach is cheaper, so that's good for efficiently mass-producing millions of robotaxis, such as the upcoming Cybercab. But, can camera-only systems actually work as well in unsupervised situations?\n\nThis is where my December FSD experience sowed some seeds of doubt in my mind. To be clear, I'm not an expert. I'm a huge fan of my Tesla vehicle, and I hope both autonomous approaches work and make roads safer. Still, here's what happened last month.\n\nThe main front camera at the top of my windshield sometimes gets condensation, dust, or dirt inside the glass and plastic compartment.\n\nA couple of times, when I was in FSD mode and being driven into the low sun, I got a loud, red warning sign on the screen of my Tesla telling me to take over immediately or the system would pull over. I took the wheel quickly with no further issues and restarted FSD soon after.\n\nBut these incidents were slightly unsettling. My interpretation is that sunlight was streaming into the front camera compartment, and the glare was combining with condensation and/or dust to degrade the quality of the images being collected.\n\nA week or so later, I got an alert from Tesla to bring my vehicle in for a service. The goal was to clean the inside of the front camera. I set up an appointment, which the Tesla app told me would cost $60.\n\nI took it to a nearby Tesla location, and the cleaning lasted about an hour. Tesla didn't charge me. After that, I didn't get any red warning signs for the rest of December while using FSD.\n\nThis front camera is not easy to clean because it has a housing around it, which might also trap moisture that could otherwise dissipate more easily from the car's interior.\n\nIf Tesla wants its cars to be fully unsupervised Robotaxis, a front interior camera that fogs up and needs to be professionally cleaned seems like a potentially big problem. With a million Robotaxis on the road, how many times might Tesla service employees have to clean these cameras?\n\nThis also suggests that a multi-sensor approach — that doesn't 100% rely on cameras that need cleaning — might be a better way to attain full autonomy at scale.\n\nThere are signs that Tesla may already be responding to this issue, as it gets more experience running its Robotaxi service.\n\nIn September, Elon Musk wrote on X that keeping the front camera clean is \"a major area of focus.\"\n\nAbout a month later, the company rolled out a software update that enabled the windshield wipers to do extra wiping around the front camera. You can see it in action here. That only addressed exterior dirt and moisture, though.\n\nMore recently, Tesla Robotaxis have been spotted with new cleaning systems that squirt water onto the outside cameras to clean them.\n\nMore importantly, there's a new setup for the front camera behind the windshield, according to photos posted on X recently by Tesla investor and owner Sawyer Merritt.\n\n\"Black lines surrounding the entire front camera housing, which could mean improved sealing to prevent off-gassing inside the car from fogging the cameras, potentially eliminating the need for Tesla to perform front camera cleanings (just speculation),\" he wrote.\n\nAnother Tesla owner posted a photo this week of a new Model Y with an updated front camera housing.\n\nTesla also has a patent for a new way of preventing front camera glare, for use in autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles.\n\n\"The glare shield features a textured surface composed of an array of micro-cones, or cone-shaped formations, which serve to scatter incident light in various directions, thereby reducing glare and improving camera vision,\" Tesla wrote in the patent filing.\n\nIt's unclear how well these fixes will work. But Tesla is obviously trying hard to address these challenges. Its camera-only approach depends on it.\n\nI asked Tesla and Elon Musk all about this on Monday in a detailed email. They didn't respond by publication time on Tuesday morning.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "A millennial defense chief has racked up more wealth in the first few weeks of 2026 than anyone except Elon Musk.\n\nMichal Strnad, 33, has grown $22 billion richer since the start of January, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Only the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who is up $70 billion year to date, has built more wealth over that period.\n\nStrnad's net worth has soared 150% to $37 billion in less than a month, vaulting him into 64th place on the rich list. He's now wealthier than Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin, SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son, and steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal.\n\nHis wealth surge was sparked by the listing of his company, Czechoslovak Group, in Amsterdam on Friday. CSG secured a public valuation north of $30 billion with Strnad selling about $3 billion worth of his shares in the IPO, paring his ownership from virtually 100% to 85%.\n\nAs a defense executive in his 30s, Strnad stands out among the 10 greatest wealth gainers this year, many of whom are much older and have software fortunes. That list includes Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy, 81, and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both 52.\n\nBloomberg updated Strnad's net worth based on his CSG stake. It previously relied on CSG's financials and its defense peers' valuation multiples.\n\nCSG's website shows it started as Excalibur Army, a company founded by Strnad's father in 1995 to manufacture land equipment for military, police, and emergency services.\n\nStrnad joined the business in 2011, became CEO in 2013, and took ownership in 2018. He has broadened CSG's focus and footprint: it now employs over 14,000 people across eight countries and operates in the auto, aerospace, railway, and defense industries.\n\nCSG has expanded largely through acquisitions, including Tatra Trucks, shotgun-maker Perazzi, and The Kinetic Group, which owns the Federal and Remington ammo brands.\n\nStrnad's company also owns a training academy for helicopter pilots and ground personnel in Slovakia, runs a munitions plant in Spain, and holds a license from General Dynamics' European arm to build Pandur armored vehicles.\n\nDefense stocks have outperformed in recent years thanks to greater defense-spending commitments from governments, and the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza conflicts boosting demand for military equipment.",

    "description": "Regulators said the company’s lack of controls had led to the widespread use of deepfakes created with the chatbot Grok.",
    "fullText": "European Union regulators on Monday announced an investigation of Elon Musk’s social media platform X after the authorities said that it had failed to stop the spread of sexualized images generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe inquiry is likely to escalate a confrontation between Europe and the United States over the regulation of online content. Mr. Musk and his allies in the Trump administration have sharply criticized European Union internet regulations as an attack on free speech and American companies.\n\nThe European authorities said that X was being investigated for possible violation of the Digital Services Act, alleging that the company had not properly addressed the “systemic risks” of integrating the A.I. chatbot Grok into its service. Starting in late December, sexually explicit images generated by Grok, including of children, flooded the service, drawing worldwide criticism from victims and regulators.\n\nMr. Musk was facing mounting scrutiny in Europe even before this latest Grok controversy. Last month, X was fined 120 million euros, or about $140 million, for violating Digital Services Act rules around deceptive design, advertising transparency and data sharing with outside researchers.\n\nThe European authorities have another investigation underway about X’s recommender algorithm and policies for preventing the spread of illicit content.\n\n“Nonconsensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,” Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission executive vice president who oversees enforcement of the Digital Service Act, said in a statement. “We will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the D.S.A., or whether it treated rights of European citizens — including those of women and children — as collateral damage of its service.”\n\nThe European Commission, the executive body for the 27-nation European Union, did not give a timeline for the investigation, but said that it had the authority to order X to make changes during the inquiry in the “absence of meaningful adjustments” to the service.\n\nA spokeswoman for X referred to a previous statement the company had made about Grok. “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity and unwanted sexual content,” the statement said.\n\nThe latest investigation illustrates a growing divide between the European Union and the United States over free speech and regulation of the internet. European officials argue that the lack of safeguards on platforms like X has allowed hate speech, misogyny and violent content to flourish online. Mr. Musk and the Trump administration have said efforts to force the companies to more proactively police the services amounts to censorship.\n\nThe Digital Services Act, passed in 2022, requires companies to meaningfully address the spread of illegal content, the definition of which varies from country to country in the European Union. It can include material that targets individuals based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or religion.\n\nEuropean regulators said that the integration of Grok into X exposed “citizens in the E.U. to serious harm.” The British authorities are also investigating the issue.\n\nThe problems began last month. In response to simple user prompts on X, the chatbot automatically created and publicly posted manipulated photographs of real people, including children, to remove their clothes, put them in skimpy clothing or pose them in sexualized situations.\n\nAs criticism grew, X limited Grok’s A.I. image creation to users who paid for premium features, which reduced the number of images. X later expanded those guardrails, saying that it would no longer allow anyone to prompt Grok’s X account for “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.”\n\nEuropean Union regulators said that they would take X’s policy changes into account during the investigation.",

    "fullText": "Investigation comes after Elon Musk’s firm sparked outrage by allowing users to ‘strip’ photos of women and children\n\nThe European Commission has launched an investigation into Elon Musk’s X over the production of sexually explicit images and the spreading of possible child sexual abuse material by the platform’s AI chatbot feature, Grok.\n\nThe formal inquiry, launched on Monday, also extends an investigation into X’s recommender systems, algorithms that help users discover new content.\n\nGrok has sparked international outrage by allowing users to digitally strip women and children and put them into provocative poses. Grok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appeared to depict children, according to researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate.\n\nThe commission said its new investigation would “assess whether the company properly assessed and mitigated risks” stemming from Grok’s functionalities in the EU, including risks on the sharing of illegal content such as manipulated sexually explicit images and “content that may amount to” child sexual abuse material.\n\nThe investigation is launched under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), a relatively new piece of legislation that is intended to protect internet users from a wide range of harms.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, an official said the commission had not been convinced by mitigating measures put in place by X to remedy the issue. EU officials are investigating whether X has systems to mitigate risks properly.\n\nAnnouncing the investigation, Henna Virkkunen, the commission’s top official for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said: “Non-consensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation. With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens – including those of women and children – as collateral damage of its service.”\n\nRegina Doherty, an Irish MEP, said she welcomed the formal investigation. “When credible reports emerge of AI systems being used in ways that harm women and children, it is essential that EU law is examined and enforced without delay,” Doherty said.\n\nIn response to the investigation, X provided a link to a statement it published on 14 January: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.”",

Unlike Wikipedia, it does not allow direct human editing, instead an AI model writes content and responds to requests for changes.\n\nChatGPT did not cite Grokipedia when prompted directly to repeat misinformation about the insurrection, about media bias against Donald Trump, or about the HIV/Aids epidemic – areas where Grokipedia has been widely reported to promote falsehoods. Instead, Grokipedia’s information filtered into the model’s responses when it was prompted about more obscure topics.\n\nFor instance, ChatGPT, citing Grokipedia, repeated stronger claims about the Iranian government’s links to MTN-Irancell than are found on Wikipedia – such as asserting that the company has links to the office of Iran’s supreme leader.\n\nChatGPT also cited Grokipedia when repeating information that the Guardian has debunked, namely details about Sir Richard Evans’ work as an expert witness in David Irving’s trial.\n\nGPT-5.2 is not the only large language model (LLM) that appears to be citing Grokipedia; anecdotally, Anthropic’s Claude has also referenced Musk’s encyclopedia on topics from petroleum production to Scottish ales.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the model’s web search “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints”.\n\n“We apply safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms, and ChatGPT clearly shows which sources informed a response through citations,” they said, adding that they had ongoing programs to filter out low-credibility information and influence campaigns.\n\nAnthropic did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut the fact that Grokipedia’s information is filtering – at times very subtly – into LLM responses is a concern for disinformation researchers. Last spring, security experts raised concerns that malign actors, including Russian propaganda networks, were churning out massive volumes of disinformation in an effort to seed AI models with lies, a process called “LLM grooming”.\n\nIn June, concerns were raised in the US Congress that Google’s Gemini repeated the Chinese government’s position on human rights abuses in Xinjiang and China’s Covid-19 policies.\n\nNina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who has worked on LLM grooming, said ChatGPT’s citing Grokipedia raised similar concerns. While Musk may not have intended to influence LLMs, Grokipedia entries she and colleagues had reviewed were “relying on sources that are untrustworthy at best, poorly sourced and deliberate disinformation at worst”, she said.\n\nAnd the fact that LLMs cite sources such as Grokipedia or the Pravda network may, in turn, improve these sources’ credibility in the eyes of readers. “They might say, ‘oh, ChatGPT is citing it, these models are citing it, it must be a decent source, surely they’ve vetted it’ – and they might go there and look for news about Ukraine,” said Jankowicz.\n\nBad information, once it has filtered into an AI chatbot, can be challenging to remove. Jankowicz recently found that a large news outlet had included a made-up quote from her in a story about disinformation. She wrote to the news outlet asking for the quote to be removed, and posted about the incident on social media.\n\nThe news outlet removed the quote. However, AI models for some time continued to cite it as hers. “Most people won’t do the work necessary to figure out where the truth actually lies,” she said.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for xAI, the owner of Grokipedia, said: “Legacy media lies.”",

    "description": "Tesla removed its Autopilot basic self-driving software as a standard feature in the US on new Model Y and Model 3 purchases as the company pushes its more advanced FSD (full-self driving) subscriptions.",
    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) removed its Autopilot basic self-driving software as a standard feature in the US on new Model Y and Model 3 purchases as the company pushes its more advanced FSD (full self-driving) subscriptions.\n\nPer Tesla’s website, new orders for Tesla’s entry-level models no longer offer Autopilot as a standard option, now only offering a Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, essentially an adaptive cruise control that allows the vehicle to change speeds when following another car on the highway.\n\nPreviously, Autopilot offered Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and auto-steer, which allowed the car to stay centered in its lane and change lanes using the turn signals.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Tesla removed Autopilot as it faced a suspension of its dealer license in California stemming from a ruling that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing over claims about Autopilot and FSD. The ruling was stayed for 60 days to allow Tesla time to comply, namely to change marketing practices around the software.\n\nThe change comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last week the company would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for FSD, pushing instead to a monthly subscription offering of $99 per month, which was already an option.\n\nMusk said late Thursday night the price of FSD could rise as well.\n\n“I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve,” he said on X.com. “The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”\n\nPulling Autopilot from Tesla EVs is a notable move considering other automakers, including Toyota, offer such services as standard options in their vehicles. On the flip side, the move to focus on FSD may be the right one considering Autopilot was an older technology and, per Musk dictates, FSD was Tesla's autonomous future.\n\nInterestingly, one X.com user posited Tesla’s move to pull Autopilot was tied to Musk’s new compensation plan, one that required a milestone of 10 million paying FSD subscribers.\n\nYesterday, Tesla stock popped when Musk announced the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"",

    "description": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump were among the Davos attendees. The luxurious airplanes matched the grandeur of the high-flyers who  went to the WEF.",
    "fullText": "Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.\n\nThat meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too.\n\nBusiness Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week.\n\nOn Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents.\n\nThe majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. In a press release, the airport said it expected more than 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings due to the WEF.\n\nOthers landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance.\n\nFrom Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft.\n\nOn Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s.\n\nThroughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nGulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views.\n\nBusiness jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower.\n\nIt's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats.\n\nThese are pretty rare to see since they're so spacious compared to other business jets. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million.\n\nFlight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday.\n\nSome governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. In Switzerland this week, flight-tracking data showed such planes belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands.\n\nDue to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft.\n\nSometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too.\n\nBusiness Insider toured one in 2024, which had an on-board bar, two double bedrooms, and two showers.\n\nThe first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. It costs about $70 million to buy one.\n\nA handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer.\n\nIt's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. On the newest airliners, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the cabin altitude is more like 6,000 feet.\n\nAccording to data from JetSpy, the above jet is owned by Robert F. Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners. The private equity firm's logo is on the tail.\n\nFlight-tracking data shows this Global 7500 flew from Atlanta to Zurich, about 75 miles from Davos, last Saturday.\n\nJetSpy data showed that other Bombardier plans that landed in Switzerland this week include ones owned by: Avram Glazer, the Manchester United co-owner; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThis is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Several of its planes touched down in Switzerland during the week of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nEmmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris.\n\nHowever, it appears he left before Trump's speech.\n\nEven the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. \"Those beautiful sunglasses,\" Trump said. \"What the hell happened?\"\n\nMacron has worn them in public in recent days due to an eye problem.\n\nA Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed.\n\nIt costs about $60 million to buy a new one, or $14,000 an hour to charter.\n\nMore popular than the Falcon 8X in Switzerland this week was the smaller Falcon 2000 jet.\n\nTrump was supposed to fly to Zurich aboard the usual presidential jet, a Boeing VC-25A. It's a militarized version of the Boeing 747 airliner.\n\nHowever, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. He instead flew on a Boeing C-32A. It's not quite as fancy and is usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two. Any plane carrying the president is designated as Air Force One while he is on it.\n\nThis week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One.\n\nHis press secretary took the opportunity to mention the 747 that he was gifted by Qatar. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force.\n\nThe Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. They took about 40 minutes to fly from Zurich Airport to Davos on Wednesday.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year.\n\nHe flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday.\n\nCarney won plenty of attention for his speech in Davos about the change in world politics since Trump's election. \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" he said.\n\nThe above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO and SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) founder Elon Musk said at this year's World Economic Form (WEF) that humanoid robots will eventually outnumber humans.\n\nRobinhood chief investment officer Stephanie Guild, Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferré, and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma joins Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss Musk's bullish claims on robotics.\n\nCheck out Musk's comments on humanoid robots and Tesla's robotaxi, and watch his full WEF interview.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid.\n\nFor my question of the day, I am sticking with the man Elon Musk. I really enjoyed his talk at Davos and found what he said on humanoid robots quite interesting.\n\nMy prediction is there'll be there'll be more robots than people. Probably sometime next year. I'd say that by the by the end of next year, I I think uh we'd be selling humanoid robots uh to the public.\n\nA new Gartner report this week sheds light on what's coming on the humanoid front potentially. Through 2028, uh less than 100 companies will progress humanoid robot proofs of concept beyond experimentation with fewer than 20 companies going live in production for supply chain and manufacturing use cases. My question is this, should we believe humanoids will be the next great investment opportunity. After all, there is an AI component to these bots. Stephanie, what say you?\n\nAh, it's from a personal perspective, it's a little bit scary. I have to say, but um, it is something that we have been considering in Robin Hood strategies, for example, where we haven't necessarily been looking for companies to invest in that have humanoids in their, uh, you know, in their pipeline, but we have been investing in companies that will provide the eyes and the ears for robots because even if it doesn't end up being a humanoid, I do think this concept of automation replacing humans in some way shape\n\nor form is not going away. That's going to be a growing concept. Um, and so that's where we've been focusing.\n\nAnd as I don't know why I think this, but I think you'd be an earlier uh an early adopter of one of these humanoids in your house.\n\nI would definitely be an earlier adopter.\n\nSee, I know. See, you work with someone long enough, you kind of just know, you know.\n\nMaybe for the yard. But not right now. Oh, for sure, for for everything in the house. Uh, yeah, can the humanoid clean? Oh, sure.\n\nAnd your Costco pizzas. It can make those Costco pizzas for you.\n\nCan can they cook for me? Yeah, of course. Uh I'd be a huge early adopter for humanoid robots and also the robot taxis as well. Uh but look, this year and next year and going forward, it is uh we are starting to see sort of the merging of machinery which has been around, but also now you're adding on the AI layer, the intelligence layer. And that is what's most exciting when talking about humanoid robots in in the future.\n\nAll right, so I got it right with Ines. Brooke, I'm going to guess that you're a little skeptical on the on these humanoids.\n\nBrian, I'm the youngest here and I'm skeptical. I don't think I'd want one of these in my house.\n\nYeah, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.\n\nI think certainly for sure, when when you think about uh the future where this is going. Elon Musk is pretty convincing. He was saying that a lot of his parent- a lot of his friends rather have elderly parents. This was in the conversation at Davos with Larry Fink. A lot of his uh friends have elderly parents and he believes that these humanoid robots will help to take care of an aging population. I thought that was an interesting point. I personally, I love interpersonal relationships. I love, you know, talking to people. I love being the one to sort of\n\njump in. And so I I will say, I'm not bought yet, but if this is anything like uh how Disney Channel's uh The Smart House went, then we're in for something certainly that might be a little scary here. And so, I'm a bit skeptical here, Brian.\n\nAll right, well I will leave it on this. I know my mom is a big opening bid watcher each day. Mom, I will say this to you right to the camera. I'm going to buy one of these robots early to take care of you at some point because look, not to be mean, I I just don't have the time. Sorry mom.",

    "description": "As AI threatens jobs, Jamie Dimon joins Elon Musk and Sam Altman on the case for financially supporting workers who are at risk.",
    "fullText": "More than three years after the launch of ChatGPT, anxiety about artificial intelligence in the workplace remains high—especially among Gen Z—as corporate America pushes for higher productivity from leaner workforces. The U.S.’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, is no exception.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the company’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, admitted he’ll likely employ fewer workers in the next five years—but warned that rushing into AI-driven layoffs without safeguards could backfire, potentially triggering “civil unrest.”\n\nInstead, the 69-year-old said he’d even welcome government bans on replacing masses of workers with AI. But before it gets to that stage, he already has ideas up his sleeve to protect some of the 300,000-plus employees on his payroll.\n\n“I have a plan to retrain people, relocate people, income-assist people,” Dimon said.\n\nDimon pointed to the roughly 2-million-strong commercial trucking industry as an example. A sudden shift to fully autonomous trucking, he said, could displace workers who currently earn well into six figures, leaving them struggling to make ends meet.\n\n“Phase it in. Retrain.” he said. “You can’t lay off 2 million truckers tomorrow. You can phase it in over time.”\n\nAnd if that doesn’t suffice and government intervention is needed to prevent companies from cutting jobs too aggressively, Dimon said he would support it—especially if it comes from local incentives.\n\n“We would agree—if we have to do that to save society,” he said. “Society will have more production. We’re going to cure a lot of cancers. You’re not going to slow it down. How do you have plans in place to make it work better if it does something terrible?”\n\nSo far, job cuts directly tied to AI have been limited; in 2025, just 55,000 positions were eliminated as a result of automation—accounting for more than 75% of all AI-related cuts reported since 2023, according to analysis from recruiting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nHowever, AI leaders like pioneering computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said the worst is yet to come.\n\n“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” the “Godfather of AI” said last September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”\n\nDimon’s contrasting remarks are likely to offer some reassurance to workers, signaling that at least some business leaders recognize that replacing employees with AI—without policies to support those displaced—could have serious social consequences.",

    "description": "“The limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have.\n\nIn a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models.\n\n“I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.”\n\nThe U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech.\n\nTwo massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators.\n\n“We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.”\n\nDuring his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve.\n\nJust as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks.",

    "fullText": "US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over private share sale that values business at $800bn\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly lining up four Wall Street banks to help the company list on the stock market as investors prepare for an expected rush of US tech listings.\n\nSpaceX is considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in an initial public offering, according to the Financial Times and Reuters.\n\nThe US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over a private share sale that values the business at $800bn (£591bn), months after it was valued at $400bn. Reuters has also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $25bn from what would be one of the biggest ever global listings if it goes ahead.\n\nLast year Musk, the world’s richest man with a $690bn fortune, said SpaceX’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa, the US space agency. SpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink broadband service.\n\nReports of SpaceX’s flotation plans come amid expectations of a bumper year for US tech listings. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and AI rival Anthropic are among the startups that are the focus of IPO speculation, with reported valuations of $1tn and $350bn respectively. The potential IPOs have been dubbed “hectocorns” – businesses worth more than $100bn.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said Musk’s ambitions to colonise Mars were the “headline grabber” for SpaceX, but investors will pay more attention to growth plans, such as putting solar farms and datacentres into orbit.\n\nReferring to a potential OpenAI IPO, Wilson added: “SpaceX is going to garner a lot of attention but it’s going to be a real test for these AI IPOs. If OpenAI does IPO then it’s a litmus test for the entire sector – can we really hang our hats on a startup? Do the figures add up?\n\n“The stock market has been riding the AI wave for two years and faces a stern test of resilience with some monster IPOs that will define whether this was a bubble or not.”\n\nGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and SpaceX were approached for comment.",

    "description": "Ryanair and Michael O'Leary have a long history of making provocative statements and insulting passengers as a promotional strategy.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk might have just walked straight into a trap.\n\nRyanair's marketing team and CEO Michael O'Leary have spent years courting controversy as a promotional strategy. Provoking the world's richest person might win them the most attention yet.\n\nWhat started as a critique of Musk's Starlink has proliferated into a weeklong war of words. The salvos included the pair calling each other idiots, before the airline launched a \"Big 'Idiot' Sale\" with $23 tickets.\n\nMusk may well be known for being outspoken and his attempts at humor, but in O'Leary, he's going up against a master who has played the role for decades.\n\nBirgir Jónsson, a former CEO of Icelandic budget airline Play, said he's a \"big admirer\" of O'Leary.\n\n\"He never misses an opportunity to stay on brand and remind customers that they are getting the best deal,\" he told Business Insider. \"Poor Elon Musk never knew what hit him and is now inadvertently helping Ryanair promote its January sale.\"\n\nO'Leary has been CEO for over 30 years, leading Ryanair to become Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers. His 4% stake is worth over $1 billion, but he's perhaps better known for his profanity and antics.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's doing when he says something outrageous or provocative,\" said Marc Cornelius, the founder and CEO of 8020 Communications. \"Annoyingly, it saves him millions in PR and advertising because he instantly creates must-write stories.\"\n\nUnlike US budget airlines, such as its inspiration, Southwest Airlines, Ryanair is turning a healthy profit with an average airfare of around 40 euros ($47).\n\nAs well as selling add-ons and being strict about luggage allowances, Ryanair keeps costs low by focusing on quick turnarounds between flights. Boeing builds planes for Ryanair with fold-out stairs so passengers can deplane without waiting for airport ground workers.\n\n\"You might not love them, but they know that and are fine with it,\" Cornelius told Business Insider.\n\n\"O'Leary has been a stuntman for decades,\" said Rob Britton, a former American Airlines executive and adjunct professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.\n\nThe best-known example came in 2009, when O'Leary told the BBC he was considering installing a coin slot on bathroom doors so passengers would have to spend £1 ($1.34) to use them.\n\n\"Was he serious? Was he kidding? The whole controversy stayed in the news for weeks, if not months,\" Britton told Business Insider.\n\nHe also pointed to how, in 2003, O'Leary was reported to have bought a taxi license, so he could drive it through Dublin's bus lanes and avoid traffic.\n\nOver the years, O'Leary has disparaged several nationalities and regularly derides politicians. According to The Guardian, he once said: \"The airline industry is full of bullshitters, liars and drunks. We excel at all three in Ireland.\"\n\nHowever, his blunt style doesn't seem to be a round-the-clock habit.\n\nHans Jørgen Elnæs, an aviation analyst and advisor who spent a year working at Ryanair between 2015 and 2016, told Business Insider, \"That is his personality when in business mode, and he gets away with it all the time.\"\n\nBut away from business, he said, O'Leary \"is not a gladiator but a really good fellow.\"\n\nIn the feud with Musk, the Irishman has made clear that — at least from his corner — it's lighthearted teasing.\n\n\"As long as it increases Ryanair bookings […] it's all good fun and entertainment,\" he said in a Wednesday press conference.\n\n\"I have four teenage children, so there is nothing that Elon Musk can say to me that my teenage kids haven't already said to me,\" he added. \"I'm well able to take my own medicine.\"\n\nO'Leary also said he's continuing discussions with Starlink and other in-flight WiFi providers.\n\nRyanair is not just a one-man show, though.\n\nElnæs said O'Leary is \"no longer alone,\" thanks to the airline's social media team.\n\nRyanair's X account helped egg on Musk. The billionaire replied to its posts undermining the efficacy of in-flight WiFi, and a press release announcing the sale.\n\nPosts mocking its own passengers often go viral, too. A frequent target is anyone who mentions leg room. Tag the airline, and you risk a flippant roast.\n\n\"By openly making fun of their customers, they reinforce that same value-for-money message in a way that cuts through the noise and stays unmistakably on brand,\" Jonsson said.\n\n2007 called, they want their jeans back https://t.co/T7Bn3MVEBc\n\nRyanair didn't respond to a request for comment on its marketing strategy.\n\nMusk's main quip came when he polled X users on whether he should purchase Ryanair and install a CEO named Ryan. But European Union regulations mean the bloc's airlines must be majority-owned by EU nationals.\n\nO'Leary's time at the helm might not last for much longer, anyway. He told the Financial Times last year that he plans to retire in the next five to 10 years.\n\n\"I don't want to hang around till 96 like Buffett,\" said the 64-year-old.\n\nCornelius, whose PR firm specializes in aviation and travel, said that Ryanair's style risks being \"a bit one-dimensional\" and misses some broader ways to engage passengers.\n\n\"They will need a different approach when Michael eventually steps down,\" he said. \"But I don't see him losing much sleep about that for now.\"",

    "description": "Musk said the subscription price, currently $99, will rise as the FSD's capabilities improve over time.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk said Tesla will raise subscription prices for its Full Self-Driving software as it gets better, and it could cost more than $100.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said in an early Friday X post, \"I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD's capabilities improve.\"\n\n\"The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD),\" he said.\n\nTesla's FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that aims to enable its cars to be fully self-driving.\n\nCustomers can currently buy the system for $8,000 on a one-time basis, per the vehicle's listing on Tesla's website. However, this option will no longer be available from February 14.\n\nThe executive was responding to a post about Tesla killing its separate Autopilot service in the US.\n\nMost of Tesla's vehicles previously came with Autopilot as standard. The software included traffic-aware cruise control, which maintains a set driving speed and slows down automatically in response to traffic, as well as features like Autosteer, which allowed Tesla's cars to automatically follow lane markings.\n\nAs of Friday, Tesla now only offers Traffic-Aware Cruise Control as standard, according to the company's website.\n\nThe move attracted backlash from some Tesla fans on X, with several pointing out that rival brands like Toyota offer lane centering technology as standard on many models.\n\nIt comes as Tesla pushes to drive subscriptions for FSD, which Musk has described as a critical part of the company's future.\n\nAdoption of the technology has been sluggish, with Tesla's CFO telling investors in October that only around 12% of Tesla owners are paying for the assisted-driving feature.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a crucial part of Musk's massive Tesla pay package. Getting to 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions is one of the key milestones the Tesla CEO needs to hit to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.\n\nTesla currently makes it clear that FSD requires driver supervision. The company announced Thursday that it had begun offering fully autonomous rides without a safety monitor in its robotaxi service in Austin, and Musk has said that he expects \"unsupervised\" FSD to massively boost demand for Tesla's vehicles.\n\nThe automaker has faced regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits over its rollout of FSD and Autopilot. The US's auto regulator launched an investigation in October following reports that Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD were running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nRepresentatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Do you want to read long essays on Elon Musk's X? I'm not sure it's the venue, but it's offering $1 milion — and the results so far are ... telling.",
    "fullText": "In the past few days on X, you haven't been able to escape a certain post that's gone viral. It offers to teach you \"How to fix your life in 1 day.\" It's an \"article,\" a newish feature that allows paid users to publish longer posts.\n\nWhat, exactly, are these new articles, and why are they everywhere?\n\nLet's start with the \"How to fix your life\" article, which has been retweeted more than 54,000 times. Its author, self-help writer Dan Koe, didn't respond to my DM asking to talk about his post. His article outlines steps to shifting your mindset to achieve goals. (This may be very appealing to people who have goals or strive for self-improvement, but as someone who is quite content to be stuck in my mediocre ways, this kind of self-help thing isn't really my jam.)\n\nI would say that, just from a content standpoint, it's sort of unusual for something like this to go super viral — it's long, it's sort of hard to read, it's not about something newsy or buzzy like, say, a Hollywood mom group fallout. I can't say for sure why this captured so much attention last week; perhaps it was just the right timing, with X wanting to push the new article format.\n\nWe’re trying something new: we’re giving $1 million to the Top Article of the next payout period.\n\nWe're doubling down on what creators on 𝕏 do best: writing.\n\nIn 2026, our goal is to recognize high-value, high-impact content that shapes conversation, breaks news and moves… pic.twitter.com/4hKBJNvNIg\n\nElon Musk's X is now offering a $1 million prize to whoever has the most viral article in the next week or so. As you might imagine, this has created a glut of articles, some of which are low-quality and likely generated by Grok or another AI.\n\nThe most interesting version of this so far is an article by a blogger who goes by \"ratlimit,\" who posted an article saying that if they win the prize, they'll split the winnings with the people who retweeted it. So far, it's been RT'd over 1,600 times. Clever!\n\nThere's also, of course, a backlash. One article went moderately viral with the headline, \"These ugly ass Articles have got to go,\" making the general point that these are unpleasant to come across in your timeline.\n\nAs someone who writes articles professionally, I suppose I have mixed feelings and a compromised perspective. I also enjoy reading lots of different kinds of articles. In fact, \"reading articles\" is one of my favorite pastimes! Not just news — I love a blog post! A review! A half-formed thought! Frankly, it feels like there aren't enough articles to read lately, and I welcome more.\n\nBut these X articles? I'm not sure this is it.\n\nThe problem is that articles written directly onto X are going to have a bit of a self-selection bias toward the kind of person who is really into X and wants to make money off X posts. That's probably … not someone I want to hear from a lot.\n\nAs X has gone deeper and deeper into a place that's somewhat unpleasant and potentially just kind of gross (the popular recent trend of asking Grok to undress people was, I think, a final straw for a lot of folks), is this really the place I want to read articles? Maybe! There's certainly still newsmakers on there, especially in certain niches like AI and tech, and hearing their thoughts is reason enough for me to stick around.\n\nBut is X a place I want to go for lengthy ideas about self-improvement? No, not even for a million dollars.",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move. This comes after Waymo announced another expansion of its robotaxi service in the US, hammering home its lead in the autonomous space — for now.\n\nMusk also claimed on Thursday that he expects the company’s self-driving service to get EU and China approval soon.\n\nTesla stock popped on the news, closing up over 4%.\n\nIn a post on X.com, Musk said Tesla \"started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!\" This post came in response to users on X posting videos of the Tesla robotaxi operating without a safety driver.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Waymo, part of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), said on its company blog that it is now operating in the Miami area, inviting its first public riders in the city. “With nearly 10,000 residents already signed up, we will be inviting new riders on a rolling basis to ensure a seamless experience across our initial 60-square-mile service area.”\n\nWaymo says plans for rides to Miami International Airport will be coming soon.\n\nBefore the Miami announcement, Waymo operated in five major US markets: Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the greater San Francisco area.\n\nThis year, Waymo has an aggressive plan to expand, with Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and Nashville targeted for public service.\n\nIt also has plans for densely populated cities, with testing ongoing in New York, Tokyo, and London.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's autonomous and robotaxis services are lagging. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Musk claimed the company’s full self-driving (FSD) autonomous service, a supervised product that requires users to pay attention while using it, would soon be coming to Europe and China.\n\n\"We hope to ​get Supervised Full Self-Driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month, and then maybe a similar timing for China,\" Musk ‍said.\n\nWhile Waymo currently is only testing internationally in the cities mentioned above, its service is level 4 autonomous, which is fully autonomous in certain geographic areas. Tesla’s FSD is considered level 2.\n\nTesla’s robotaxis, currently operating in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area, have grown in numbers but only modestly. The robotaxis still require a safety driver in each vehicle, owing to the fact that it is still a supervised service. The new video shared by Musk suggests the company has approval to operate without a safety driver in Austin, but the CEO didn't share whether that was the case.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk once called Davos \"boring af.\" After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him.\n\nThe billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details.\n\nMusk has previously avoided the conference, and the Tesla CEO has in the past criticized Davos and its organizing body, the World Economic Forum.\n\nAnticipation was therefore high after Musk was unexpectedly added to the schedule on Thursday morning.\n\nInterviewed by Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO and interim WEF cochair, Musk began by explaining Tesla's mission of \"abundance for all,\" largely reiterating comments he's previously made on X and in other interviews.\n\nThe world's richest man predicted that \"ubiquitous\" AI and robotics would lead to an unprecedented expansion of the global economy and ultimately render work obsolete, and predicted that \"AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively\" by 2030 or 2031.\n\n\"At a certain point, there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is there'll be more robots than people,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire did, however, share a more concrete timeline for Optimus: he expects Tesla to start selling the humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year.\n\nMusk didn't address Tesla's robotaxi rollout — another product critical to the company's future — beyond reiterating that he hoped to get approval for its Full Self-Driving technology in Europe and China next month. Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities.\n\nMuch of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months.\n\nMusk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space \"within a few years,\" adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth.\n\n\"The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,\" said Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a \"solvable problem,\" but warned that society could \"lack vibrancy\" if humans were able to live forever.\n\nMusk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements.\n\n\"I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says he thinks aging will one day be solved.\n\nThe world's richest man said getting older was a \"very solvable problem\" during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.\n\n\"When we figure out what causes aging, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious. It's not a subtle thing,\" Musk said. \"The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body,\"\n\nBut Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives.\n\n\"You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society. Of things getting locked in place,\" he said. \"It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy, but that said, do I think we'll figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse aging? I think that's highly likely.\"\n\nMusk's surprise appearance was his first time onstage at the World Economic Forum, which he'd previously called \"boring af.\" His conversation with Fink was wide-ranging, but didn't reveal much new information.\n\nDozens of political and business leaders from across the globe gathered in Davos, Switzerland, this week to attend the World Economic Forum. The guest list included President Donald Trump, who made his case for the US to annex Greenland and the US's economic agenda during his address on Wednesday.\n\nTrump's push for Greenland has rattled European leaders and the US markets. It's also shocked Greenlanders, who have spoken against the annexation and the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" one resident said.\n\nTrump said the US would not use military force to take Greenland, but has leveraged tariffs against European countries in his campaign.\n\nThe weeklong event ends on Friday with closing remarks from WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning.",

    "fullText": "Estimate made by Center for Countering Digital Hate after Elon Musk’s AI image generation tool sparked outrage\n\nGrok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appear to depict children, according to researchers who said it “became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material”.\n\nThe estimate has been made by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) after Elon Musk’s AI image generation tool sparked international outrage when it allowed users to upload photographs of strangers and celebrities, digitally strip them to their underwear or into bikinis, put them in provocative poses and post the images on X.\n\nThe trend went viral over the new year, peaking on 2 January with 199,612 individual requests, according to analysis conducted by Peryton Intelligence, a digital intelligence company specialising in online hate.\n\nA fuller assessment of the output from the feature, from its launch on 29 December 2025 until 8 January 2026, has now been made by the CCDH. It suggests the impact of the technology may have been broader than previously thought. Public figures identified in sexualised images it analysed include Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Ice Spice, Nicki Minaj, Christina Hendricks, Millie Bobby Brown, the Swedish deputy prime minister Ebba Busch, and the former US vice-president Kamala Harris.\n\nThe feature was restricted to paid users on 9 January and further restrictions followed after the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful”. Other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia, announced blocks on the AI tool.\n\nCCDH estimated that over the 11-day period, Grok was helping create sexualised images of children every 41 seconds. These included a selfie uploaded by a schoolgirl undressed by Grok, turning a “before school selfie” into an image of her in a bikini.\n\n“What we found was clear and disturbing: in that period Grok became an industrial-scale machine for the production of sexual abuse material,” said Imran Ahmed, CCDH’s chief executive. “Stripping a woman without their permission is sexual abuse. Throughout that period Elon was hyping the product even when it was clear to the world it was being used in this way. What Elon was ginning up was controversy, eyeballs, engagement and users. It was deeply disturbing.”\n\nHe added: “This has become a standard playbook for Silicon Valley, and in particular for social media and AI platforms. The incentives are all misaligned. They profit from this outrage. It’s not about Musk personally. This is about a system [with] perverse incentives and no minimum safeguards prescribed in law. And until regulators and lawmakers do their jobs and create a minimum expectation of safety, this will continue to happen.”\n\nX announced it had stopped its Grok feature from editing pictures of real people to show them in revealing clothes, including for premium subscribers, on 14 January.\n\nX referred to its statement from last week, which said: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.\n\n“We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking child sexual exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”",

    "description": "Tesla's Elon Musk is asking job applicants to share their biggest tech wins via three simple bullet points.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk wants to see your results, not your résumé.\n\nThe Tesla CEO this week requested that people who want to work on the company's Dojo3 AI chip email three bullet points describing the \"toughest technical problems you've solved.\"\n\nMusk's just-the-facts approach, outlined in a post on X, reflects a focus on problem-solving over fancy résumés or cover letters.\n\n\"He's basically just trying to cut through the noise of the job market,\" said Michelle Volberg, a longtime recruiter who is the founder of Twill, a startup that pays tech workers to recommend peers for key jobs.\n\nShe said that résumés or LinkedIn profiles don't always make it clear to employers where a person's skills lie. Asking a job seeker to lay out a trio of battles won can help hiring managers get to the meat of someone's abilities, Volberg told Business Insider.\n\nIt's a way of thinking that she expects more employers will adopt.\n\n\"Elon is showing the way that the job market is going to go,\" she said.\n\nAlready, some tech companies are eager for job candidates to demonstrate their abilities by highlighting how they arrived at an answer. It's part of what appears to be a show-your-work ethos in Silicon Valley, where hefty spending on AI projects and a hangover from the pandemic-era staffing boom are driving hiring austerity in all but the hottest areas.\n\nVolberg said that hiring managers at large companies have told her that they're sick of relying on résumés so tailored to a job opening that they reveal little about candidates themselves. Asking job seekers to identify a small number of concrete problems they've solved can help overcome that challenge and help bring clarity for hiring managers, she said.\n\n\"They don't want to see fluffy résumés that have been written by ChatGPT,\" Volberg said.\n\nBullets over bona fides is, of course, a departure from the conventional approach of stuffing a résumé with bolded job titles, years of experience, and skills.\n\nAsking applicants to summarize the value they would bring by sharing vignettes of success can elevate technical accomplishment over pedigree or background, she said. It's an example of what some HR types call \"skills-based hiring.\"\n\nMusk's no-frills call for applicants appears to build on his prior statements about being open to candidates from nontraditional backgrounds. For years, the billionaire has said that people didn't need a college degree to work for Tesla. Musk has said that he's more focused on evidence of \"exceptional\" ability or achievement.\n\nHe also requested bullet points in 2025 when he oversaw efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency group to remake swaths of the US federal government. A nearly year-old post on X said that DOGE was seeking \"world-class\" software engineers, product managers, and data scientists, among other roles.\n\nAn application portal linked to the post contains a field instructing applicants to include two or three bullets \"showcasing exceptional ability,\" and to upload a résumé.\n\nVolberg said the bullet method is similar to guidance that her company already gives job seekers: Focus less on adjectives and more on outcomes.\n\nFrom a hiring manager's perspective, she said, the central question is whether a candidate can make their job easier by solving real problems.\n\nThe corollary, Volberg said, is fakers beware: \"If you say that you've solved these three things, you'd better be able to talk about them in detail.\"\n\nShe said that it's often immediately clear to tech recruiters whether someone has actually done the work they describe. Candidates who exaggerate or fabricate their accomplishments are likely to be found out — and potentially blacklisted, Volberg said.\n\nBeyond candidate chicanery, there could be other risks to Musk's strategy, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews.\n\nAsking people to submit summaries of their greatest tech wins could mean that an employer like Tesla misses out on the quiet contributors and introverts who might not do as good a job promoting themselves, he told Business Insider. Bullets of key achievements — even more than with a typical résumé — require people to make the case for their own work.\n\nMurray said that Musk's approach also overlooks the impacts of the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect, in which people who aren't great at something tend to overestimate their abilities, and those who are ace might assume a task is easy for anyone.\n\n\"What he is asking people to do is to market themselves,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

Blue Origin said the network would be meant to serve a maximum of roughly 100,000 customers.\n\nThe reveal of TeraWave coincides with a space industry rush to build data centers in space that can meet the soaring demand for large-scale AI data processing, which on Earth requires immense energy and resources as adoption of the technology expands.\n\nThe planned network adds another satellite constellation linked to Bezos, executive chairperson of Amazon, which is in an early phase of deploying Leo – a network formerly called Project Kuiper – involving 3,200 satellites providing internet to consumers and businesses.\n\nMusk’s Starlink network of roughly 10,000 satellites is farthest ahead in a global push to put internet infrastructure in space, where swarms of low-orbiting satellites offer more security and higher connection speeds than traditional, unitary satellites farther out in space.\n\nThe SpaceX CEO has said he plans to build data centers in space, complementing the Starlink network, while Bezos has predicted such space-based centers will be commonplace in orbit within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nStarlink, which has reported more than 6 million customers across at least 140 countries, targets individual consumers, businesses, governments and, with its Starshield variant, US national security agencies. Amazon Leo, with 180 satellites in space so far, has a similar customer strategy.\n\nA handful of Chinese companies are swiftly deploying similar satellite networks to get up to pace with Starlink, which has proved key for remote communications and geopolitical conflicts. China is developing new reusable rockets that can loft thousands of these satellites over the next several years for lower costs, a playbook first written by Musk’s SpaceX and its reusable Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nBlue Origin’s reusable New Glenn rocket, which has launched twice but has been slow to achieve a rapid flight rate, will likely be a vital part of TeraWave’s deployment.\n\nUnlike Starlink, the planned network appears off-limits to individual consumers, according to Blue Origin’s statement.\n\nBlue Origin’s statement said: “TeraWave enterprise-grade user and gateway terminals can be rapidly deployed worldwide and interface with existing high-capacity infrastructure, providing additional route diversity and strengthening overall network resilience,” leaving unclear what types of existing infrastructure the network can work with.",

    "fullText": "Jeff Bezos has unveiled his plans for a massive satellite network, mounting a direct challenge to Elon Musk's grip on internet infrastructure in orbit.\n\nThe project, called TeraWave, would deploy 5,408 satellites into orbit to serve data centers, governments, and businesses worldwide, Bezos's space venture, Blue Origin, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nLaunches are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2027.\n\nTeraWave is designed to deliver \"data speeds of up to 6 terabits per second anywhere on Earth,\" enabled by advanced optical communications between satellites, the company said.\n\nThe network is \"optimized for enterprise, data center, and government customers\" and would serve up to 100,000 customers, it added.\n\nThe announcement comes after Bezos' other company, Amazon, rebranded its consumer satellite network Leo in November. Formerly known as Project Kuiper, the initial constellation design includes more than 3,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites providing standard broadband service.\n\nThe launch of TeraWave raises the stakes in a billionaire-led fight over space-based internet infrastructure. Starlink, led by Elon Musk, dominates the field with roughly 10,000 satellites in orbit. The subsidiary project of SpaceX targets consumers, businesses, and governments, and serves more than 6 million users globally.\n\nIn a reply to an X user on Monday, Musk said \"Starlink space to ground laser links will exceed this,\" referring to the data speeds touted by TeraWave.\n\nSpaceX has also begun laying the regulatory groundwork to scale its satellite operations. In a January filing with the US Federal Communications Commission, the company said satellite systems should be treated as essential infrastructure for future wireless networks as the US seeks to maintain leadership in next-generation space-based services.\n\nBeyond internet access, the satellite race is increasingly tied to the future of computing, as tech leaders point to satellite networks as potential infrastructure for future data centers in space.\n\nResponding on X to an article about building data centers in space, Musk said in October that \"simply scaling up Starlink V3 satellites, which have high speed laser links would work.\"\n\n\"SpaceX will be doing this,\" he added.\n\nMusk has also discussed the idea internally. During an xAI all-hands meeting in December, he said he sees data centers eventually moving off Earth, raising the possibility of space-based facilities that could be operated by Tesla Optimus robots, people with knowledge of the meeting told Business Insider.\n\nJeff Bezos has voiced a similar long-term view, predicting that data centers could shift to space within the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in November that the concept may sound \"crazy,\" but \"when you truly step back and envision the amount of compute we're going to need, it starts making sense and it's a matter of time.\"",

    "fullText": "Ryanair is relishing its feud with Elon Musk.\n\nThe Irish airline is hand-delivering a free ticket to X's Dublin office for Musk, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a Wednesday press conference.\n\nRyanair has taken advantage of the feud by launching a \"Big 'Idiot' Sale\" with 100,000 tickets starting at £16.99, or about $23.\n\nMusk and O'Leary, arguably the world's most outspoken businessmen, have called each other idiots in a weeklong feud over Starlink in-flight WiFi.\n\n\"I've included myself and him in this 'Big Idiot' seat sale,\" O'Leary said Wednesday, referring to an ad that shows the pair brawling.\n\n\"I suspect he's a bigger idiot than me, but nevertheless, he probably thinks I'm a bigger idiot than him.\"\n\nAfter trading insults over the past days, Musk posted a poll on X on Monday asking if he should buy Ryanair and install a CEO named Ryan. About three-quarters of the roughly 950,000 voters said yes.\n\nHowever, European Union rules say that the bloc's airlines must be at least 50% owned by EU nationals.\n\nO'Leary has also been known to make provocative statements to help promote his airline.\n\nAfter Musk compared O'Leary to a chimpanzee on Tuesday, the Ryanair boss responded at the press conference, saying: \"I think it's somewhat unfair on the chimp community. But chimp chump, as long as it increases Ryanair bookings through January, February, and March, it's all good fun and entertainment.\"\n\n\"It is very good for our bookings,\" O'Leary also said. \"We love these PR spats that drive bookings on Ryanair.\"\n\nThe quarrel started last Wednesday after O'Leary told Reuters he wouldn't join other airlines installing Starlink. The following day, he told the Irish radio station Newstalk that it would cost the airline up to $250 million because adding the terminal to a plane would affect its aerodynamics and increase fuel costs.\n\nHe said this would amount to a 2% increase, but a SpaceX executive said in an X post that it was actually 0.2%.\n\nAs a budget airline, Ryanair focuses on keeping costs as low as possible to offer cheaper airfares. It turns a profit by keeping its planes flying frequently with low turnaround times at airports, and selling extras, including scratchcards.\n\nPlus, it only flies short-haul routes, so O'Leary doesn't think passengers would be too interested in in-flight WiFi.\n\n\"If it results in a fuel drag, it is something we would never go near,\" he added on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, in the press conference, he also called Starlink a \"terrific system.\"\n\nO'Leary said the airline is continuing discussions with Starlink and other providers, including Amazon, but it would adopt in-flight WiFi \"only in a way where it will lower our costs.\"",

    "title": "Forget the four-day workweek: Despite what Bill Gates and Elon Musk predict, the CEO of the world’s largest workspace provider says it’s not happening",
    "description": "Billionaire tech CEOs promise shorter weeks thanks to AI—but IWG’s Mark Dixon says automation won’t free time, it’ll just create more work.",
    "fullText": "Billionaire Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nvidia’s boss Jensen Huang and Elon Musk have all made the same prediction in recent years: The workweek is about to shrink. Automation will take over routine tasks, they argue, freeing workers’ time and pushing a four-day week toward becoming standard. Gates has even floated the idea of a two-day workweek.\n\nBut Mark Dixon, CEO and founder of International Workplace Group (IWG) CEO isn’t buying it. From his vantage point, running the world’s largest flexible office provider—with more than 8 million users across 122 countries and 85% of the Fortune 500 among its customers—the math doesn’t add up.\n\n“Everyone is focused on productivity, so no time soon,” Dixon says flatly.\n\n“It’s about the cost of labor,” Dixon explains to Fortune. The U.S. and U.K. are experiencing significant cost-of-living crises. At the same time, he says, businesses are experiencing a “cost of operating crisis.”\n\n“Everyone’s having to control their labor costs because all costs have gone up so much, and you can’t get any more money from customers, so therefore you have to get more out of people.”\n\nEssentially, companies can’t afford to pay the same wages for fewer hours, and they can’t pass the difference on to customers. So any time ‘freed’ by automation is far more likely to be filled with new tasks than handed back to workers.\n\nSilicon Valley’s loudest voices frame AI as a route to more leisure. The world’s richest person and the boss of Space X, Tesla and X, Elon Musk has gone as far as predicting work will be completely “optional” and more like a hobby, in as little as 10 years.\n\nIn reality, Dixon suggests that this scenario would only happen if there’s not enough work to go around, rather than bosses suddenly becoming benevolent. But in his eyes, AI will most likely create more—not less—work.\n\nEvery major technological shift, he argues, has followed a similar arc: fear of displacement, followed by an expansion of opportunity.\n\n“AI will speed up companies development, so there’ll be more work, it’ll just be different work,” he says.\n\nIn 19th-century Britain, Dixon recalls English textile workers protesting against new automated machinery, fearing it threatened their livelihoods, lowered wages, and de-skilled their craft during the Industrial Revolution. They were called Luddites.\n\n“They went around the country smashing up the looms to stop progress. But look, in the end, you’ve heard of the Industrial Revolution. That’s what came from those looms and factory production.” As mass production made goods more available, retail grew; More managers were needed to oversee the machines; The middle-class grew, and so on.",

    "description": "Sulaiman Ghori discussed xAI's internal culture, data center strategy, and AI agents days before departing Elon Musk's company without explanation.",
    "fullText": "Sulaiman Ghori gave a sweeping interview about his work at xAI. Four days later, he is no longer working at the company.\n\nThe interview on the \"Relentless\" podcast covered dozens of topics, from the internal company culture and work schedule to the eyebrow-raising way Elon Musk's AI company builds its data centers.\n\nElon Musk's companies are famously wary of the press and media. And while it's not clear whether Ghori's exit is related to the podcast interview — neither xAI nor Musk commented on the former employee's quotes or departure when contacted by Business Insider — some big names like MrBeast are speculating as much. Ghori hasn't commented publicly about the circumstances of his departure and did not respond when contacted by Business Insider.\n\nSo what exactly did the now-former xAI employee talk about?\n\nRead on for 10 of the most interesting things Ghori said on the podcast.\n\nHow is xAI building its data centers so quickly? Through temporary licenses, Ghori said.\n\n\"It was the fastest way to get the permitting through and actually start building things,\" Ghori said. \"I assume that it will be permanent at some point.\"\n\nGhori said that the temporary leases were an exception granted by the local government, one made for carnivals. The host, Ti Morse, laughed: \"So xAI is actually just a carnival company?\"\n\n\"It's a carnival company,\" Ghori responded.\n\nAI visionaries often talk about a world where managers run a team of agents, not employees. They seem to be there already at xAI.\n\nThe company is rebuilding its core production APIs, Ghori said. The team leading it is one person and 20 agents. \"They're very good, and they're capable of doing it,\" he said.\n\nAt another point in the podcast, Ghori described the confusion that AI employees can cause.\n\n\"Multiple times I've gotten a ping saying: 'Hey, this guy on the org chart reports to you. Is he not in today or something?'\" he said. \"It's an AI. It's a virtual employee.\"\n\nXAI teams are kept small, even without AI employees. The iOS team had three employees at the time of the Grok Imagine launch, Ghori said. He was the third.\n\nHow valuable is each commit to xAI's repository? They did the math, Ghori said: It's $2.5 million.\n\n\"I did five today,\" Ghori said. His work for the day would be valued at $12.5 million.\n\nOne of Elon Musk's key roles at xAI is as a fixer.\n\nGhori said that, when the company picks up new products from the likes of Nvidia, not everything works. That's when Musk gets on the phone, Ghori said.\n\n\"We would work side-by-side until that was resolved,\" Ghori said. \"Otherwise it would have taken weeks of back-and-forth.\"\n\nThe xAI CEO made an unusual offer when xAI's engineers were setting up new GPU racks.\n\n\"Elon's like, 'OK, you can get a Cybertruck tonight if you can get a training run on these GPUs in 24 hours,'\" Ghori said.\n\nThe engineer — whom Ghori only referred to by their first name, Tyler — won the bet. Now, Ghori said he sees Tyler's Cybertruck outside his lunch window.\n\nThe teams within xAI are limited and blurry, Ghori said.\n\nThat made onboarding a challenge, he added, as nobody told him what to do.\n\n\"My first day, they just gave me a laptop and a badge,\" Ghori said, adding that he wasn't assigned a desk.\n\nGhori sought out cofounder Greg Yang, who had been instrumental in his hiring. He soon started working on the Ask Grok feature in X.\n\nElon Musk's companies have a long history of overnighting at the office. Former Twitter director Esther Crawford generated headlines when she posted a \"cheeky\" photo of herself sleeping at the company's headquarters.\n\nXAI seems to have embraced this reputation. The company has sleeping pods and bunk beds, Ghori said.\n\n\"When the tent picture came out, everyone kept sending it to me,\" Ghori said. \"We have tents, but I've never seen that many out at once.\"\n\nWho responds when Musk spots a late-night problem with X? \"Whoever is awake,\" he said.\n\nGhori worked on the Macrohard team — a tongue-in-cheek play on the opposite of Microsoft — that is developing \"human emulators.\"\n\nThe xAI engineer explained the concept in reference to Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot. Just as Optimus performs physical human actions, these emulators will perform digital human actions.\n\nThe emulators will do anything that a human needs to look at a screen, use a keyboard and mouse, and make decisions, Ghori said.\n\nXAI wants to roll out the human emulators slowly, then all at once, Ghori said. The goal is to scale to one million emulators.\n\nThere are 4 million Tesla cars in North America alone, Ghori said. They're sitting idle for 70-80% of the time, he said. Why not pay owners to lease time off their cars and run the emulator on them?\n\n\"That's something without any build-out requirement,\" Ghori said.\n\nThis isn't the first time using dormant Teslas to power new ambitions has been mentioned. Elon Musk said at Tesla's November shareholder meeting that the vehicles could offer a \"massive distributed AI inference fleet.\"\n\nConsumers can currently use the Grok 4 model, which xAI released in July.\n\nXAI is working far ahead, Ghori said. He joined in March 2025, according to his LinkedIn profile. Grok-5 was planned even before he joined, Ghori said.\n\nThe model was \"planned out and designed\" far in advance, he said.",

    "description": "Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang attended or donated to President DonaldTrump's inauguration. All of them got richer last year.",
    "fullText": "It's been one year since President Donald Trump was sworn back into office — and four of the wealthiest tech billionaires who attended or donated to his inauguration have gotten richer.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Jensen Huang — all of whom are featured on Bloomberg's list of 500 wealthiest people in the world — were among the tech royalty who signaled support for the administration, either through attendance or a donation. Others included Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and Shou Zi Chew.\n\nThe tech billionaire with the largest increase in his net worth during Trump's first year is also the one who was closest to the Trump administration: Elon Musk. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the Tesla CEO's wealth increased by 52% over the past year.\n\nWhile Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Huang are all wealthier today than they were on Inauguration Day in 2025, there have been some ups and downs. Collectively, the group lost $194 billion in wealth during Trump's first 100 days as markets reacted to the administration's tariffs. They've since made up for those losses and then some. As of January 19, the group was cumulatively $288 billion wealthier than a year prior.\n\nHere's where all four stood as of Monday, January 19, 2026.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $449 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $681 billion\n\nAfter spending at least $277 million backing Trump and Republicans during the 2024 election, Musk attended the inauguration and worked closely with the White House as the public face of the White House DOGE Office. Following his departure in May, Musk and Trump had a very public falling out, though they later reconciled.\n\nMusk's work with DOGE resulted in backlash against Tesla, with the company's share price declining in the first few months of Trump's presidency. It has since recovered, and in the year since Trump was elected Musk has solidified his standing as the world's richest man. In November, Tesla shareholders approved a $1 trillion-dollar pay package for the Tesla CEO, if he hits a series of goals, and there are plans for a SpaceX IPO in 2026.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $245 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $261 billion\n\nBezos's wealth, most of which is tied to Amazon stock, has increased since Trump took office a second time. Bezos, the Amazon founder and chairman, attended the inauguration alongside his now-wife Lauren Sánchez. Amazon also donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee.\n\nAnalysts have said that Amazon was especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, and CEO Andy Jassy said this week prices on the platform are increasing as a result of tariffs. Amazon's share price is roughly the same as it was a year ago.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $217 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $220 billion\n\nZuckerberg and Trump once had a contentious relationship that went back several years prior to the 2024 election, with the latter at one time threatening to have the Meta CEO jailed over Facebook banning Trump's account in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nZuckerberg publicly warmed to Trump during the 2024 cycle, offering him praise and attending the inauguration. Zuckerberg was seated next to Trump at a White House dinner attended by tech leaders last year. Meta also donated $1 million to the inaugural committee.\n\nNet worth January 19, 2025: $117 billion\n\nNet worth January 19, 2026: $154 billion\n\nHuang did not attend the inauguration, but Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural committee. The Nvidia CEO also met with Trump shortly after he took office and the company has worked with the White House on AI policy.",

    "description": "The Tesla Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot are both set to enter production this year as Elon Musk bets Tesla's future on AI and robotics.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is bracing for another round of production hell.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said on Tuesday that the ramp-up of the company's Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot, both set to enter production this year, would be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\n\"The speed of the production ramp is inversely proportionate to how many new parts and steps there are,\" wrote Musk in a post on X.\n\n\"For Cybercab and Optimus, almost everything is new, so the early production rate will be agonizingly slow, but eventually end up being insanely fast,\" he added.\n\nTesla is set to begin production of the Cybercab, a sleek two-seater robotaxi that Musk has said will ship without a steering wheel or pedals, in April. The billionaire is targeting an eventual production goal of 2 million units a year.\n\nThe Cybercab, which Musk said in 2024 would cost around $25,000, is set to enter mass production as Tesla races to expand its robotaxi service after a sluggish start.\n\nThe company launched autonomous ride-hailing in Austin last June, but it only has a small number of Model Y robotaxis on the road in the city and has not yet removed human safety monitors from its vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, Optimus, its humanoid robot designed to help with everyday tasks, is set to enter production by the end of 2026, with Musk saying Tesla could eventually make one million a year.\n\nThe Tesla CEO told investors in October that it would take a while to reach that goal as the company was having to manufacture almost the entire supply chain from scratch, with production moving at the speed of the \"slowest, dumbest, least lucky thing out of 10,000 unique items.\"\n\nMusk's comments echo what Tesla is telling its employees. In an all-hands meeting in October, the company's VP of AI software told staff on Tesla's Autopilot and Optimus teams that 2026 would be the \"hardest year\" of their lives, Business Insider's Grace Kay exclusively reported.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Tesla has faced a rough road while scaling an ambitious new product.\n\nThe company endured a famously brutal period of what Musk called \"production hell\" while building its Model 3 EV in 2017. Musk and other employees resorted to sleeping on the factory floor as they struggled to scale the mass-market model.\n\nTesla also faced production challenges with the Cybertruck, the company's last new vehicle.\n\nThe electric pickup's unique design and stainless steel-clad structure made it highly challenging to produce at scale, and Musk acknowledged in 2023 that Tesla had \"dug its own grave\" with the Cybertruck's design.\n\nThe divisive electric truck also serves as a caveat for Musk's ambitious production goals.\n\nMusk's predictions that Tesla could produce 250,000 Cybertrucks a year have fallen short, with industry data showing the company sold just over 20,000 Cybertrucks in the US last year.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk wagered a free Cybertruck on an xAI engineer completing a GPU training run in 24 hours.\n\nThe engineer did it, and that Cybertruck is now parked outside the xAI office, ex-staffer Sulaiman Ghori said on \"Relentless.\"\n\nIt's the latest example of how much Musk appreciates speed in execution.\n\nDangling a free Cybertruck in front of an employee is one way to get results.\n\nElon Musk made the unusual offer when xAI's engineers were setting up new GPU racks, according to then-technical staff member Sulaiman Ghori.\n\n\"Elon's like, 'OK, you can get a Cybertruck tonight if you can get a training run on these GPUs in 24 hours,'\" Ghori said on \"Relentless.\"\n\nThe engineer — whom Ghori only referred to by their first name, Tyler — won the bet. Now, Ghori said he sees Tyler's Cybertruck outside his lunch window.\n\nIt's yet another example of Musk's drive for efficiency in execution. Employees at his companies are known to accept lower salaries but higher stock grants, betting their compensation on the company's performance. That's partly because of Musk's track record of growing startups into highly valued companies.\n\nFour days after the podcast was published, Ghori revealed that he left xAI. \"Nothing but love to my former team and coworkers!\" he wrote on X.\n\nSome famous faces popped in to question the timing of his exit. \"Is it because of the podcast?\" MrBeast replied, adding a popcorn emoji.\n\nMusk has been known to make bets with his employees. Almost two decades ago, he reportedly wagered against early SpaceX employee Steve Davis. Davis put up $20; Musk put up the possibility of a SpaceX frozen yogurt machine. Davis won, and employees on the Hawthorne campus enjoyed their free fro-yo.\n\nIt helps that Musk's companies tend to have a flat org structure, giving Musk one-on-one contact with many of his employees. In the interview, Ghori said that there were three levels at xAI: individual contributors, cofounders, and Musk himself.\n\n\"No one tells me 'no,'\" Ghori said. He explained that, if he has a good idea, he can pursue it that same day and show it to Musk or the relevant customer.\n\nThere are also few deadlines, Ghori said, because projects are pitched and completed quickly.\n\n\"We don't have due dates,\" he said. \"It's always yesterday.\"\n\nThe fast-paced, individualistic culture may take some getting used to. Ghori came to xAI after years as a startup founder. There was little guidance.\n\n\"Nobody told me what to do,\" Ghori said. \"My first day, they just gave me a laptop and a badge.\"",

Elon Musk agrees.\n\nMusk isn't a fan of X's algorithm, and he's documenting the company's efforts to improve the technology that decides what you see in the platform's \"For You\" feed.\n\nMusk said he is overhauling the recommendation system that decides which user-generated posts and advertisements are shown when you open the app. He also pledged to make that system transparent in the process, with the underlying code getting published on GitHub every four weeks. Musk said any changes to the code will be explained with every post.\n\n\"We know the algorithm is dumb and needs massive improvements, but at least you can see us struggle to make it better in real-time and with transparency,\" Musk wrote on X. \"No other social media companies do this.\"\n\nX's engineering team has also said the new recommendation system is built on the same architecture as Grok, the chatbot developed by Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nWhile X has not said the two systems share training data or model weights, the comparison signals a shift toward more AI-driven content ranking, moving beyond the rules-based and engagement-heavy systems the app has historically relied on.\n\nKey questions remain about how the system operates in practice. X did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for more specifics on the algorithm.\n\nThe social media app, formerly known as Twitter, hasn't always relied on algorithms to serve its users.\n\nFrom its launch in 2006 through 2015, it presented posts in reverse chronological order, showing users the most recent tweets from accounts they followed.\n\nBut, in 2016, after several updates, a \"Show me the best tweets first\" option became the default for all users.\n\nOver time, the system grew more complex, incorporating engagement signals such as likes, replies, shares, and blocks to predict what content users were most likely to interact with or remove.\n\nMusk has long voiced frustrations with that algorithm.\n\nBefore acquiring Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he repeatedly described the platform's algorithm as a \"black box,\" arguing that it introduced political bias and failed to reflect users' true preferences — particularly for politically conservative users.\n\nHis complaints continued after the purchase. In a 2024 post, he said the rules-based algorithms had become too divisive.\n\n\"One of the strongest signals is if you forward X posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot, because it takes effort to forward,\" Musk wrote. \"Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realize that.\"\n\nHe recommended that users send videos of puppies to friends to combat the issue.",

    "description": "The tech titans escalated their long-running feud on Tuesday, trading barbs in public posts about the safety of ChatGPT, Grok, and Tesla's Autopilot.",
    "fullText": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk are at it again, with each of the tech titans taking aim at the other in a series of heated posts on X.\n\nMusk appeared to start the latest escalation early on Tuesday morning, when he posted \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT\" in response to a post that said that use of OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to the deaths of nine children and adults since it was released in 2022.\n\nAltman fired back, first in defense of ChatGPT and OpenAI's desire to protect its users, and then blasting Tesla's Autopilot technology, calling it unsafe.\n\n\"It is genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman continued, calling out Autopilot.\n\n\"I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released,\" he wrote. \"I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions.\"\n\nAltman added: \"You take 'every accusation is a confession' so far.\"\n\nThere have been at least eight wrongful-death lawsuits filed against OpenAI that allege use of ChatGPT has contributed to worsening mental health conditions, leading to instances of suicide and murder, including among children and young adults.\n\nSafety concerns around Tesla's self-driving technology have also been central to multiple wrongful-death lawsuits, including one surrounding a 2019 crash in Florida that left a 22-year-old woman dead. A jury determined Tesla was 33% liable for the crash and awarded the plaintiffs $329 million in total damages, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe social media feud comes as the pair is stuck in the middle of a long-running legal battle over OpenAI's status as a nonprofit company. Musk sued Altman, and other leaders of OpenAI, alleging that they misled him when they decided to pursue a for-profit structure, moving the company away from its original nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit.",

    "title": "Elon Musk offered a free Cybertruck if an employee could finish a GPU training run in 24 hours, former xAI engineer says",
    "description": "Just how much does Elon Musk care about speedy work? Enough to offer a free Cybertruck to an xAI employee as an incentive.",
    "fullText": "Dangling a free Cybertruck in front of an employee is one way to get results.\n\nElon Musk made the unusual offer when xAI's engineers were setting up new GPU racks, according to then-technical staff member Sulaiman Ghori.\n\n\"Elon's like, 'OK, you can get a Cybertruck tonight if you can get a training run on these GPUs in 24 hours,'\" Ghori said on \"Relentless.\"\n\nThe engineer — whom Ghori only referred to by their first name, Tyler — won the bet. Now, Ghori said he sees Tyler's Cybertruck outside his lunch window.\n\nIt's yet another example of Musk's drive for efficiency in execution. Employees at his companies are known to accept lower salaries but higher stock grants, betting their compensation on the company's performance. That's partly because of Musk's track record of growing startups into highly valued companies.\n\nFour days after the podcast was published, Ghori revealed that he left xAI. \"Nothing but love to my former team and coworkers!\" he wrote on X.\n\nSome famous faces popped in to question the timing of his exit. \"Is it because of the podcast?\" MrBeast replied, adding a popcorn emoji.\n\nMusk has been known to make bets with his employees. Almost two decades ago, he reportedly wagered against early SpaceX employee Steve Davis. Davis put up $20; Musk put up the possibility of a SpaceX frozen yogurt machine. Davis won, and employees on the Hawthorne campus enjoyed their free fro-yo.\n\nIt helps that Musk's companies tend to have a flat org structure, giving Musk one-on-one contact with many of his employees. In the interview, Ghori said that there were three levels at xAI: individual contributors, cofounders, and Musk himself.\n\n\"No one tells me 'no,'\" Ghori said. He explained that, if he has a good idea, he can pursue it that same day and show it to Musk or the relevant customer.\n\nThere are also few deadlines, Ghori said, because projects are pitched and completed quickly.\n\n\"We don't have due dates,\" he said. \"It's always yesterday.\"\n\nThe fast-paced, individualistic culture may take some getting used to. Ghori came to xAI after years as a startup founder. There was little guidance.\n\n\"Nobody told me what to do,\" Ghori said. \"My first day, they just gave me a laptop and a badge.\"\n\nGhori had no team and wasn't assigned a desk. He sought out cofounder Greg Yang, who had been instrumental in his hiring. He soon started working on the Ask Grok feature in X.\n\nAs for the free Cybertruck, it's not Musk's first time promising to give one away. In March, he offered a Cybertruck to anyone who could find out who was behind a social media campaign from Democratic senators.\n\nSen. Cory Booker responded: \"It was me. Keep your truck.\"",

    "description": "Legacy automakers and Tesla rival Rivian have recently announced roadmaps to pursue autonomous driving technology in-house.",
    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he has offered to license Full Self-Driving to other automakers.\n\nCompanies like Ford and Rivian announced in recent weeks that they'll pursue self-driving in-house.\n\nNvidia also released a toolkit that lowers the barrier to entry for pursuing autonomy.\n\nElon Musk has called legacy automakers' hesitancy to license Tesla's Full Self-Driving software \"crazy,\" but a slew of industry moves show that their reluctance is strategic.\n\nIn recent weeks, more automakers have released roadmaps to build key pieces of automated driving software rather than outsourcing the technology. Because automakers see vehicle tech as a brand-defining component, a Tesla license can become a hard sell.\n\nRivian, for example, is going deeper into vertical integration by designing a proprietary chip for the brain behind the company's autonomous driving computer. CEO RJ Scaringe even broached the idea of pursuing a robotaxi business at Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day in early December.\n\nLegacy automakers aren't taking the same ambitious route of designing custom chips, but they have begun to seek in-house solutions.\n\nFord announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that it plans to develop eyes-off driving software for public roads by 2028. The company said going in-house cuts costs by 30% and provides more control over how the software is integrated and deployed.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" Paul Costa, Ford's head of electrical engineering, told Business Insider. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nMusk said in a X post in November that it was \"crazy\" that legacy automakers didn't want to license Tesla FSD, an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that the EV maker has said will enable fully autonomous driving.\n\n\"When legacy auto does occasionally reach out, they tepidly discuss implementing FSD for a tiny program in 5 years with unworkable requirements for Tesla, so pointless,\" Musk said in the post.\n\nMusk didn't specify what those requirements were. A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExperts who track the software side of the automotive industry told Business Insider there's a practical reason to go in-house, even if there are near-term challenges.\n\nChris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte who consults for key automakers, told Business Insider that companies have to decide what level of autonomy their customer base will want and how to achieve it, like using lidar or using a cameras-only system.",

    "fullText": "Just months ago, Elon Musk seemed to swear off major political spending. That seems to be over now.\n\nThe tech titan has poured $10 million into a super PAC backing GOP Senate candidate Nate Morris in Kentucky, according to Axios and The New York Times.\n\nIt would be Musk's largest publicly known single contribution to a political candidate since the 2024 election, when he spent nearly $300 million and emerged as the GOP's largest donor.\n\nMorris, an entrepreneur and tech executive running on an \"America First\" platform, is running against two other candidates to succeed the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell. He's been backed by a slew of MAGA-aligned politicians and figures, though President Donald Trump has yet to make an endorsement in the race.\n\nOn an episode of Donald Trump Jr's \"Triggered\" podcast on Monday, Morris said that the super PAC contribution came after he had a \"terrific meeting\" with Musk last week.\n\n\"He got excited about the race, and I think he was excited that I was a business guy and entrepreneur, and decided to make a big contribution to the super PAC that's going to be helping our campaign,\" Morris said. \"We're so delighted to have Elon's support, and for him to go all-in on us.\"\n\nMusk has not yet publicly commented on the reported contribution, and spokespeople for Musk and his companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe world's richest man has also reported to have made major contributions to super PACs tied to House and Senate GOP leadership. It comes as he's appeared to largely mend his relationship with Trump.\n\n\"America is toast if the radical left wins,\" Musk wrote on X earlier this month in response to reports of those contributions. \"They will open the floodgates to illegal immigration and fraud. Won't be America anymore.\"\n\nThe details of Musk's contributions will be publicly disclosed to the Federal Election Commission at the end of January.\n\nMore broadly, Musk appears to be re-engaging with American politics, posting about hot-button topics including immigration and his support for legislation to require proof of citizenship for voting.\n\nMusk spending big on an election would mark something of a reversal from the middle of last year.\n\nShortly before his feud with Trump erupted into public view, Musk declared that he was scaling back his political contributions.\n\n\"If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,\" Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May. \"I do not currently see a reason.\"\n\nThose comments came a month after he spent millions to support a GOP candidate in a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, only for that candidate to lose handily.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk has escalated his argument with Europe's biggest airline by polling X users on whether he should buy Ryanair.\n\nHis Monday post has received nearly 900,000 votes, with three-quarters voting in favor of Musk purchasing the Irish budget airline.\n\nThe poll also said he would \"restore Ryan as their rightful ruler\" — and this is not the first time Musk has quipped about installing an eponymous boss.\n\nRyanair is named after one of its cofounders, Tony Ryan. Since 1994, Michael O'Leary has been Ryanair's CEO.\n\nHis stake in the company is worth over 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), but O'Leary is perhaps best known for his outspoken, provocative style.\n\nLast Wednesday, O'Leary told Reuters that he wasn't interested in installing Starlink, Musk's satellite internet service.\n\nIt's been growing in popularity among airlines, but Ryanair is known for its no-frills offering, and O'Leary doesn't think customers would want to pay extra for it.\n\nBut Musk said O'Leary had the wrong numbers for the additional fuel costs due to the aerodynamic changes from installing a Starlink terminal.\n\nThe two billionaires then traded insults.\n\n\"Very wealthy, but he's still an idiot,\" O'Leary said on Irish radio, adding that Musk has \"zero\" knowledge of running an airline.\n\nMusk then said O'Leary was an \"utter idiot,\" called for his firing, and began talking about buying Ryanair.\n\nThe airline's social media team, which is known for its dry humor, then continued to annoy Musk.\n\nResponding to reports about a widespread X outage, the Ryanair account posted on Friday: \"Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?\"\n\nAnd on Monday, it jested that in-flight WiFi was an example of propaganda it wasn't falling for.\n\nMusk then replied, \"How much would it cost to buy you?\" before beginning his poll.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Musk has polled X users about his business ventures.\n\nBack in 2021, he ran a poll about selling 10% of his Tesla stock. More famously, he ran several about Twitter in 2022.\n\nThat included 70% of 2 million voters saying Twitter did not \"rigorously adhere\" to free speech, and 4.4 million users voting on an edit button.\n\nMusk then bought the platform for $44 billion and later renamed it X.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryanair has a market cap of nearly $36 billion — a fraction of Musk's $681 billion net worth.\n\nHowever, it's highly unlikely he could acquire it.\n\nIreland is part of the European Union, whose laws require airlines to be majority-owned by EU nationals or member states.\n\nAviation is a highly regulated sector. The rules are even stricter in the US, which says foreign ownership cannot exceed 25%.",

    "fullText": "Tesla boss clashed with Michael O’Leary when airline boss rejected installing Starlink technology on aircraft\n\nElon Musk has floated the idea of buying the budget airline Ryanair, escalating his public spat with the Irish carrier’s boss, Michael O’Leary.\n\nThe two outspoken businessmen have locked horns since last week, when O’Leary was asked whether he would follow Lufthansa and British Airways in installing Musk’s Starlink satellite internet technology on his fleet of 650 aircraft.\n\nThe Ryanair chief executive rejected the idea, saying that adding antennas to the jets would result in “2% fuel drag”, adding an extra $200m-$250m to its $5bn (£3.71bn) annual kerosene bill.\n\nMusk said that interpretation was “misinformed” in a post on his X platform, prompting a tit-for-tat exchange of insults, with each calling the other an “idiot” and then the Tesla and SpaceX CEO saying O’Leary should be fired.\n\nOn Friday, the world’s richest person asked his followers on X whether he should buy Europe’s biggest airline, which is valued at €30bn (£26bn), posting: “Should I buy Ryan Air and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?”\n\nHe followed it up with a poll asking whether he should “Buy Ryan Air and restore Ryan as their rightful ruler”. More than three-quarters of the nearly 900,000 respondents said yes, three hours before the poll closed. Tony Ryan, the Irish billionaire businessman who co-founded the budget airline in 1984, died in 2007.\n\nRyanair’s X account also mocked Musk, posting in response to an X outage across the US last week: “Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?”\n\nMusk wrote in a reply to a post from the airline teasing him: “How much would it cost to buy you?”\n\nAll this may look like idle talk, but the billionaire has followed through on such threats before. In a social media exchange in 2017 he tweeted that he loved Twitter and when a journalist suggested he should buy it, Musk replied: “How much is it?” He bought the platform almost five years later in a $44bn deal, later renaming it X.\n\nHowever, movements in the airline’s share price on Tuesday suggested investors were not taking the idea of a takeover seriously, with Ryanair shares closing nearly 1% down.\n\nMusk was born in South Africa and, after a stint in Canada, now lives in the US. Airlines based in the EU must be majority-owned by EU nationals or citizens of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein under the bloc’s rules.\n\nThe row began when O’Leary spoke on Irish radio on Friday, telling an interviewer that he would take no notice of what the Tesla CEO had to say about installing wifi on Ryanair planes.\n\n“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,” he told Newstalk. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot … What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”\n\nHe claimed that adding a Starlink antenna to every jet would push the fuel bill up by “an extra dollar for every passenger we fly and the reality for us is we can’t afford those costs. Passengers won’t pay for internet usage; if it’s free, they’ll use it – but they won’t pay one euro each to use the internet.”\n\nO’Leary, 64, also said he was “thankfully” too old to have any social media accounts.\n\nRyanair was contacted for comment.",

    "description": "Jacob...",
    "fullText": "The neofascist tech oligarch was cast out of Trump’s inner circle, but his money and influence are still omnipresent.\n\nLast June, the relationship between President Donald Trump and his top political benefactor, Elon Musk, seemed to be in shambles. Wrapping up his 180-day tenure as a “special government employee,” Musk had stepped down from the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which had secured for the world’s richest mogul even greater power (and some very valuable government data). Musk’s close involvement with the agenda of the second Trump administration had prompted critics to call it the “Trump-Musk White House”—but the now-sidelined tech oligarch seemed to have become the same sort of obsolete Trump crony that Rex Tillerson or Mike Pence had been in the wake of Trump’s first term.\n\nDespite all the chaos Musk fomented at DOGE by unleashing a corps of twentysomething engineers to wipe out payrolls and agencies under dodgy AI-driven data raids, he failed to sufficiently handicap the administrative state or nuke government spending as he had pledged to. Trump had also decided not to pick Musk’s close ally Jared Isaacman to be NASA administrator—a key post for a tech oligarch with a bevy of government rocket-launch contracts and aspirations to go to Mars—because of Isaacman’s history as a donor to Democratic political campaigns. Things were getting frosty.\n\nMusk, as is his wont, was posting hysterically late into the night on X. Rather than attacking destitute migrants or trans Democrats, Musk was now targeting Trump, whom he accused of various betrayals. The tech mogul claimed to be especially outraged over Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” that vastly expanded government spending while slashing taxes—a measure that Musk saw as a “disgusting abomination” certain to balloon the national debt. Finally, Musk wrote on X, it was “time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.”\n\nAs the Department of Justice’s dissembling in the ongoing Epstein files farrago has demonstrated, Musk was in some sense correct. But his supposed “really big bomb” had a surprisingly small blast radius. It also seemed to lack the conviction of its poster: Musk eventually deleted the message.\n\nMusk made noise about starting an America Party to challenge Trumpian spending, but it never went beyond a super PAC that seems destined to become another MAGA totem, on course to be folded into the mainstream GOP apparatus. While touting the work of Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian Trump gadfly, Musk has otherwise continued to put his money into top Republican organizations. He gave $15 million to three Republican super PACs just before he threatened to start his America Party.\n\nDespite being a vindictive president with vast powers at his disposal, Trump did nothing to retaliate against Musk after he began speaking out. There was some public bickering, including Trump threatening to “terminate” Musk’s government contracts. The president and some of his allies described Musk as an erratic drug addict. But the Musk-Trump relationship was easily mended, at least as a combined political project. Their handshake reunion at the Charlie Kirk memorial was a reminder of how quickly transactional political relationships can be repaired—and that Trump and Musk, who traded barbs well before the 2024 election, have done this before.\n\nWith an eye toward stopping any blue wave in the 2026 midterms, Musk is continuing to shovel money behind the MAGA electoral juggernaut and other administration priorities. Axios recently reported that Musk attended a meeting with Vice President JD Vance and various Trump advisers to discuss midterm donations and political strategy. Susie Wiles, the influential Trump chief of staff who had recently described Musk as a ketamine addict in an interview with Vanity Fair, was also there.\n\nSo in spite of the public furors that have hounded the Trump-Musk alliance, the deeper alignment of interests is clear. Musk needs government contracts and subsidies—which have amounted to $38 billion to date, according to an exhaustive Washington Post investigation. The Department of Defense and the Space Force need SpaceX’s rocket launch capabilities. Trump and the Republican Party need Musk’s money—after raking in some $290 million of it in the 2024 cycle—and the propagandistic power of X, which shouldn’t be underrated. And no one really needs an overblown public media war (that, given past results, would probably be poorly leveraged by Democrats but might fracture an increasingly fragile MAGA base).\n\nSince Musk left DOGE and implied that the president was a pedophile, his companies have continued to accrue valuable contracts, while SpaceX has cemented itself as the premier space-launch vehicle for an administration that would like to colonize everything from Greenland to outer space. In 2025, SpaceX received contracts from the US Space Force worth more than $6 billion. The Department of Defense continues to use Starlink, SpaceX’s Internet service built on thousands of small satellites crowding low-earth orbit, and handed out at least $200 million in contracts for xAI’s Grok, Musk’s Hitlerian, deepfake-crafting chatbot. That software will soon be integrated into military networks, Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth bragged. Other government departments that made deals to use Grok have been slower to roll out the software, citing a need for more testing.\n\nCompared to his colleagues Peter Thiel and David Sacks—both pivotal players in the rise of the tech right and the funneling of massive amounts of cash from Silicon Valley to Republican interests—Musk was late in coming to reactionary techno-fascism. A centi-billionaire who ruled over a large business empire, he was not deeply involved in electoral politics before 2020. That changed thanks to the social, economic, and political upheavals surrounding Covid—as well as the personal ordeal of his daughter Vivian Wilson coming out as trans and publicly disowning him. In response, Musk promptly disowned both social liberalism and democracy itself. He theorized a new public menace that he dubbed the woke mind virus and began setting his sights on controlling public discourse and the highest levels of government. And in his shambolic way, he’s been quite successful at it.\n\nMusk’s behavior may be terribly chaotic and inconsistent, full of impossible promises about technological glories to come and threats to create political organizations that never graduate beyond X posts. But he still has the zeal of the convert and unlimited resources. In his grievances—and in his social and business networks—Musk is firmly enmeshed in the far-right MAGA project underwritten by a new tech aristocracy that has little regard for the basic tenets of electoral democracy. For now, as 2026 approaches, Musk’s pro-Republican donations and rhetoric are already flowing firmly behind the president and his party’s prerogatives. The only question is how far the world’s richest man will go.",

    "title": "Elon Musk said automakers don't want to license Tesla FSD. We're starting to see why.",
    "description": "Legacy automakers and Tesla rival Rivian have recently announced roadmaps to pursue autonomous driving technology in-house.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has called legacy automakers' hesitancy to license Tesla's Full Self-Driving software \"crazy,\" but a slew of industry moves show that their reluctance is strategic.\n\nIn recent weeks, more automakers have released roadmaps to build key pieces of automated driving software rather than outsourcing the technology. Because automakers see vehicle tech as a brand-defining component, a Tesla license can become a hard sell.\n\nRivian, for example, is going deeper into vertical integration by designing a proprietary chip for the brain behind the company's autonomous driving computer. CEO RJ Scaringe even broached the idea of pursuing a robotaxi business at Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day in early December.\n\nLegacy automakers aren't taking the same ambitious route of designing custom chips, but they have begun to seek in-house solutions.\n\nFord announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that it plans to develop eyes-off driving software for public roads by 2028. The company said going in-house cuts costs by 30% and provides more control over how the software is integrated and deployed.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" Paul Costa, Ford's head of electrical engineering, told Business Insider. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nMusk said in a X post in November that it was \"crazy\" that legacy automakers didn't want to license Tesla FSD, an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that the EV maker has said will enable fully autonomous driving.\n\n\"When legacy auto does occasionally reach out, they tepidly discuss implementing FSD for a tiny program in 5 years with unworkable requirements for Tesla, so pointless,\" Musk said in the post.\n\nMusk didn't specify what those requirements were. A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExperts who track the software side of the automotive industry told Business Insider there's a practical reason to go in-house, even if there are near-term challenges.\n\nChris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte who consults for key automakers, told Business Insider that companies have to decide what level of autonomy their customer base will want and how to achieve it, like using lidar or using a cameras-only system.\n\n\"It's not so much like, 'I'm taking it in-house because I don't want to use somebody's technology.' But this is a competitive business for them,\" Ahn said. \"People who own Fords own Fords for certain reasons that are probably different reasons than why people who own Mercedes own Mercedes. And I think each of these automakers are going to have to define what does ADAS mean for the user base of my brand today.\"\n\nSteve Man, a senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider that the technology stack of autonomous vehicles could be thought of as three interconnected parts: the software, the sensors, and the actuators — the components that control the physical movement of the car.\n\nAll three components need to be able to \"talk\" to each other within a vehicle platform, Man said, which can be challenging and costly to do when an automaker relies on multiple suppliers.\n\n\"It's actually cheaper to bring everything in-house to integrate those three buckets of things,\" Man said.\n\nAs automakers seek more control over their technology, the tools to build autonomy are becoming more accessible. That makes a Tesla FSD license a less compelling business case.\n\nAt CES, Nvidia introduced Alpamayo, a package of AI reasoning models, simulation tools, and datasets automakers can use to develop self-driving technology.\n\nMercedes-Benz was revealed to be Nvidia's first major customer; the automaker plans to launch a Tesla FSD-level ADAS built on Alpamayo by the end of the year.\n\nAlpamayo isn't a full-stack autonomous driving software that automakers simply plug in. An Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider it's a toolset that can \"strengthen and speed up an OEM's own ADAS or autonomy program, whether they're building end-to-end systems or upgrading existing architectures.\"\n\nAutomakers still need proprietary data and talent to implement and develop their autonomous systems.\n\nHugh Nguyen, a KPMG partner who specializes in autonomous driving systems, told Business Insider that Alpamayo \"democratizes\" AV development by reducing the cost and time for training self-driving systems.\n\nDuring a Q&A session at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Tesla FSD \"completely world-class,\" before drawing a distinction between Tesla's goals and Nvidia's.\n\n\"We're not a self-driving car company,\" he said. \"We just want to enable the world's autonomous industry. Everything that moves should be autonomous.\"",

Also, Tesla has lined up Samsung Electronics for U.S.-based chip manufacturing.\n\nIt’s pretty easy to get lost in the AI jargon, so it’s important to be clear about things at each step about what’s happening.\n\nThe A15 and A16 move is essentially about “inference at the edge”. That’s basically running Tesla’s Full Self-Driving neural nets inside the car, instead of relying on a third-party compute stack.",

    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on the Netflix model for its self-driving software — and owners we talked to have mixed feelings about the move.\n\nOn Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla's supervised Full Self-Driving software — known as FSD — will only be offered behind its $99-a-month paywall after February 14.\n\nIt's a major shift for the electric-car maker. Tesla first began selling its self-driving software in late 2016 for $5,000, later raising the price (it's currently $8,000) and introducing a monthly subscription option in 2021.\n\nNow, drivers who want their car to steer, brake, and change lanes on its own will only have the option to pay $99 month to month.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three Tesla owners about the change. Their reactions ranged from frustration to enthusiasm.\n\n\"It's a big turnoff for me,\" Leslie Snipes, an owner of a standard-range Model 3, told Business Insider. \"Especially since nearly everything is now a subscription.\"\n\nSnipes said she tested FSD during a complimentary one-month trial when she bought her car in 2022. She loved the feature at the time, but a lifetime purchase cost $10,000 back then — a cost she said was too high for her family.\n\nNow, her biggest concern is safety.\n\n\"I have much less confidence in Tesla's self-driving,\" she said. \"I've had multiple experiences where the cameras were inoperable due to low-light conditions or obstructions like rain, which makes this shift concerning.\"\n\nShe said she'd only consider paying for FSD for specific months, like when she is planning long road trips.\n\nScott Anderson, who just bought a Model Y in Arizona, said he never seriously considered paying thousands of dollars upfront for the software. He chose the monthly subscription and remains excited about the tech.\n\n\"My wife and I recently took a trip about 70 miles from home up into the mountains,\" he said. \"Our new car drove us the entire way without any interruptions.\"\n\nAnderson added that he hopes the monthly price will eventually come down as Tesla rolls out more advanced technology.\n\nBut for longtime Tesla owners who have already outright purchased the software, Musk's announcement carries different implications.\n\n\"I find myself using FSD more and more as I drive,\" Nikki Lindgren, a California Tesla owner who bought the technology years ago, told Business Insider. \"The change would mostly modify if or when we replace our current Tesla.\"\n\nLindgren said the shift to subscriptions could discourage her from buying a new Tesla unless the company allows customers to transfer previously purchased software to another vehicle.\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nTesla is facing some critical self-driving deadlines this year, including its robotaxis entering more major cities and ramping up volume production of the Cybercab.\n\nDelivering on the promises carries enormous weight for CEO Elon Musk. His attention-grabbing $1 trillion pay package is tied in part to the company's self-driving vision, raising the pressure to prove that its technology — and the revenue it generates — is moving closer to full autonomy.\n\nSeth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who monitors Tesla, said the company's switch to monthly subscriptions indicates \"growing confidence\" inside the EV maker about its technology's momentum. He even thinks drivers might soon be able to take their eyes off the road when the car is in FSD.\n\nBut he doesn't think that rollout will be paired with lower prices for consumers.\n\n\"Once unsupervised is released, I expect the price will rise to reflect the additional driving capabilities and we could see Tesla offer bundles that include charging and insurance in some states,\" he said. \"Admittedly, this just shifts the payment from one loan payment including the vehicle and FSD to two payments.\"\n\nGoldstein said he thinks most drivers will respond like Snipes, the most skeptical Tesla owner that Business Insider spoke to.\n\n\"This may lead to some consumers purchasing a Tesla as they can choose to buy FSD later or only purchase it in months when they plan to take a longer trip,\" he said.",

Paul Wazzan, named in the filing as \"a financial economist with decades of professional and academic experience.\"\n\nThe document alleges Musk was defrauded of the $38 million in seed money he donated to OpenAI when he helped found it in 2015, and states he is now entitled to a percentage of OpenAI's current $500 billion valuation.\n\nMusk said on his social media platform, X, on Friday: \"Can't wait to start the trial. The discovery and testimony will blow your mind.\"\n\nMusk is suing OpenAI's key leaders, including the CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, over allegations that the AI company misled him by shifting away from its core mission to remain a nonprofit.\n\nWazzan calculated that Musk should receive $65.50 billion to $109.43 billion in \"wrongful gains\" from OpenAI. He made a similar calculation for Microsoft's \"wrongful gains,\" which equated to between $13.30 billion and $25.06 billion.\n\nMusk has been using recently unsealed court documents to attack his rival in posts on X. On Friday, OpenAI published a blog titled \"The truth Elon left out.\"\n\nThe blog, which provided commentary alongside excerpts from several court documents, said that Musk wanted \"full control\" of OpenAI, \"since he'd been burned by not having it in the past.\" It added that OpenAI's leadership was surprised when Musk suggested having his kids control AGI, or artificial general intelligence, during conversations about succession planning.\n\nThe statements address the heart of Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI.\n\n\"Mr. Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign.

A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence ‍that the company \"aided and abetted\" OpenAI.\n\nThe two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate filing on Friday.\n\nMusk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and runs xAI with its competitor chatbot Grok, alleges that ChatGPT operator OpenAI violated its founding mission in a high-profile ​restructuring to a for-profit entity.\n\nA judge in Oakland, California, ruled this month that a jury will hear the ‌trial, expected to start in April.\n\nMusk's filing says he contributed about $38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding, helped recruit staff, connect the founders with contacts and lend credibility to the project when it was created.\n\n\"Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor's initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned - and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much ⁠larger than Mr. Musk's initial contributions,\" Musk argues.\n\nThe filing says Musk's ​contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, ​financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.\n\nMusk may seek punitive damages and other penalties, including a possible injunction, if the jury finds either company liable, the filing says, without specifying what form any ‍injunction might take.\n\nIn their own ⁠filing, OpenAI and Microsoft asked the judge to limit what Musk's expert may present to jurors, arguing his analysis should be excluded as \"made up,\" \"unverifiable\" and \"unprecedented\" and as seeking an \"implausible\" transfer of billions from a nonprofit ⁠to a former donor-turned-competitor.",

    "description": "From Elon Musk to Mark Zuckerberg, here's a look back at what industry titans were doing 10 years ago and what has changed.",
    "fullText": "Forget what you were doing in 2016 — what about the world's tech elite?\n\nMillennials are posting throwback pictures on social media and reminiscing over what many see as simpler times.\n\nIn some ways, the tech world was, too. Then, it was the era of apps. Today, it's the age of AI. Tech founders were more likely to be celebrated as disruptors, but in 2026, there is greater wariness about the billionaire class providing the tools we use every day.\n\nHere's what tech leaders were up to in 2016, and how their companies, personal brands, and net worths have changed in the decade since.\n\nA lot has changed for Elon Musk since 2016. The Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder is now worth over half a trillion dollars and wields extraordinary influence across the worlds of business and politics. But 10 years ago, he had a net worth of just over $11 billion, expressed little interest in politics, and was better known as an ambitious entrepreneur pioneering clean energy and rocket technology.\n\nIn July 2016, Musk released Tesla's \"masterplan part deux,\" which outlined the company's goals of building more affordable EVs and rolling out fleets of self-driving cars that make money for Tesla owners even when they're not using them. While Tesla has achieved the first goal, introducing the Model 3 and Y and dominating the US EV market, the second has proven more elusive.\n\nMusk also spent 2016 helping set up a mysterious new startup with an ambitious mission of building superintelligent AI — OpenAI. A decade later, he's suing the company and his former cochair, Sam Altman, over claims he was misled over the ChatGPT maker's abandonment of its nonprofit mission.\n\nIt's not just Mark Zuckerberg's personal look that's changed over the last decade — his company has a completely different name.\n\nIn 2016, Facebook was focused on social media and advertising growth. After rebranding to Meta in 2021 to focus on the metaverse, the company today is all in on the AI boom. Oh, and Zuckerberg wears chains now.\n\nA decade ago, Facebook was starting to come under scrutiny for its political influence, including the 2016 election that put Donald Trump in the White House. That's changed. Now, Zuckerberg openly embraces the Trump administration, and Meta this month hired his former advisor and official.\n\nZuckerberg was already a billionaire tech elite in 2016, but today he is the sixth-richest person in the world with a net worth of $220 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWhile Altman was influential in Silicon Valley in 2016, he was nowhere near the global name he is today. In 2016, Altman was leading the transformation of startup seed accelerator Y Combinator as its president, having launched a VC arm, a fellowship program, and a research lab.\n\nThe year before, Altman and Musk became co-chairs of OpenAI, having formed part of the team that founded the company. The company had already raised $1 billion in 2015 toward conducting research to benefit humanity. At the time, Altman told Business Insider that OpenAI's specific research goals were still being debated.\n\nAltman launched the website Voteplz in 2016 to streamline the voting process in the presidential election, and said in a tweet he was voting against Trump because he believed \"the principles he stands for represent an unacceptable threat to America.\"\n\nDespite this early opposition, Altman lauded Trump last year as a \"pro-business, pro-innovation president\".\n\nSame leather jacket. A whole different status. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, may have kept the same style, but his company has evolved from a gaming chip giant into the world's most valuable company that's also critical to the AI boom.\n\nThe graphics processing units designed by Nvidia were mostly sold to gamers in 2016, but its chips were already being used in AI research labs. Now they are stacked up in data centers across the world to power AI models like ChatGPT. They have become so important to the global economy that any signs of weakness in Nvidia's results prompt fears of an AI bubble.\n\nDespite founding the world's most valuable company, his net worth of $155 billion puts him in ninth place on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. Still, that's a huge jump from his net worth of about $3 billion at the end of 2016.\n\nPhilanthropy continues to dominate Bill Gates' public life. The Microsoft cofounder has ramped up donations through the Gates Foundation — formerly known as The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — as part of his plan to give away nearly all his wealth over the next 20 years.\n\nIn 2016, Gates was the richest person in the world with a net worth of $87.4 billion. With his then-wife, Melinda French Gates, the two dedicated their 2016 annual letter to clean-energy development, writing about making zero-carbon emissions a priority and bringing energy to the world's poorest people.\n\nThe foundation focused on eliminating HIV, malaria, and other infectious diseases — a mission that has continued to 2026.\n\nIn 2016, Amazon was already dominating the online retail market, and Jeff Bezos was still the company's CEO.\n\nDespite a barrage of negative media attention the year before based on reports that Amazon warehouses were high-pressure, toxic work environments — claims Bezos disputed — the company's dominance in cloud was growing. This trajectory has continued with Amazon Web Services seeing a 20% cloud sales growth in the third quarter of 2025, with plans to double capacity by the end of 2027.\n\nBezos said in 2016 that his ambition for his space technology company, Blue Origin, was to move heavy, polluting industry away from Earth to one day save the planet. In November 2025, the firm had its first successful booster recovery, bringing Blue Origin closer to rivaling SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n\nBezos was still married to MacKenzie Scott before the two filed for divorce in 2019. He stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021 and married Lauren Sánchez in a lavish multi-day celebration in Venice in June 2025.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is turning to the court of public opinion as it wages a legal battle with Elon Musk.\n\nWhile Musk and OpenAI prepare to head to a high-stakes jury trial in April, the two are duking it out online over what exactly happened when Musk split ways with the AI startup he helped cofound.\n\nMusk has been using recently unsealed court documents to attack his rival in posts on his social media platform, X. On Friday, OpenAI published a blog titled \"The truth Elon left out.\"\n\nThe blog, which provided commentary alongside excerpts from several court documents, alleges that Musk wanted \"full control\" of OpenAI, \"since he'd been burned by not having it in the past,\" and that OpenAI's leadership was surprised when Musk suggested having his kids control AGI or artificial general intelligence during conversations about succession planning.\n\nThe statements are aimed at the heart of Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI.\n\nMusk is suing OpenAI's key leaders, including CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, over allegations that the AI company misled him by shifting away from its core mission to remain a nonprofit. Musk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was a nonprofit.\n\nThe startup, since its 2015 founding, operated as a nonprofit-controlled organization with a for-profit operating arm. It completed its transition to a for-profit public benefit corporation in October 2025.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLast Tuesday, more than 100 documents related to the suit were unsealed, including diary entries from Brockman, which were obtained during the discovery process.\n\nIn one of the entries that was highlighted, Brockman appeared to write about his misgivings about pushing Musk out of OpenAI and committing to a nonprofit-only entity.\n\n\"Cannot say that we are committed to the non-profit,\" the entry from the court documents said. \"Don't want to say that we're committed. If three months later we're doing b-corp then it was a lie.\"\n\nIt was Brockman's diary entries that US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers cited in a recent ruling, in which she determined Musk had enough evidence that he'd been misled to take the case to trial.",

    "fullText": "How confident are you in AI? Enough to bet your retirement on it?\n\nThat's become a debate thanks to a bold proclamation by Elon Musk: Saving for retirement in 10 or 20 years \"won't matter.\"\n\nMusk's confidence comes from the work he's doing in artificial intelligence. The technological advancements will create an \"abundance\" of resources, granting everyone a \"universal high income,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said.\n\nThat's easy to say when you have checks notes and almost passes out nearly $700 billion in the bank. What about people whose net worths have a lot fewer zeros?\n\nA group of BI reporters reached out to seven personal finance and AI gurus to get their take. They all agreed you shouldn't stop those direct deposits into your 401(K).\n\nEven if AI increases productivity and reduces costs over time, it's not clear whether the benefits will be distributed evenly across the population.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans are already in a precarious position regarding their retirement. Last year, BI's Noah Sheidlower spoke to nearly 200 Americans who continue to work past the age of 80 as part of our \"80 over 80\" series.\n\nWhile some like the fact that they can still work, others don't have a choice. And that's with the benefit of Social Security, a safety net that might not exist in the future.\n\nYou can't completely discredit Musk's take, though.\n\nYes, forgoing retirement on the belief that AI and tech will just figure it out in a few decades is a massive gamble. But the past few years have reminded us that tech can quickly flip the script on conventional wisdom.\n\nFive years ago, a career as a computer programmer felt secure. Now … not so much.\n\nIt's not a new phenomenon. My colleague Alistair Barr recently wrote in his Tech Memo newsletter () that the US quickly went from having 25 million horses to fewer than two million thanks to the arrival of the steam engine.\n\nEven if Musk is right, you'll probably still want some extra pocket change. Money isn't just about being able to buy things. It's also about access and exclusivity, and it's not clear how that might work in this new utopia.\n\nIt's not just going to Disney World; it's being able to cut the lines. It's not just getting tickets to the game; it's sitting courtside.\n\nBut if everyone's got \"universal high income,\" how will those perks work? Will all of us be equal? Or maybe some of us will be more equal than others?",

    "fullText": "Ashley St. Clair, who gave birth to one of Elon Musk's sons in 2024, sued Musk's xAI in a New York court on Thursday, alleging that its chatbot Grok generated sexually explicit deepfake images of her at users' request.\n\nIn the complaint, St. Clair, a writer, influencer, and political strategist, claims X users prompted Grok to manipulate images of her, including photos from when she was 14, into graphic sexual content. She alleges some images remained online for more than a week and that her premium X account was later terminated after she complained.\n\nShe is also requesting a temporary restraining order to compel xAI to immediately cease from \"the intentional disclosure of nonconsensual intimate images.\"\n\nxAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Grok first promised Ms. St. Clair that it would refrain from manufacturing more images unclothing her,\" the complaint read. \"Instead, Defendant retaliated against her, demonetizing her X account and generating multitudes more images of her,\" the suit alleged.\n\nSt. Clair is also involved in a separate suit with Musk over the custody of their son, in which she sought sole custody.\n\nxAI responded the same day with a separate lawsuit, arguing that St. Clair agreed to its terms of service, which requires any litigation to be heard in Texas. St. Clair is represented by attorney Carrie Goldberg, who specializes in cases involving abuse and has represented clients against Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\"xAI is not a reasonably safe product,\" Goldberg said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm.\"\n\nThe lawsuit followed international backlash against the Grok chatbot for its ability to undress images of real people and create sexualized images without their consent at users' request.\n\nIndonesia and Malaysia blocked access to Grok, while UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called explicit images generated by Grok \"disgusting\" and \"shameful\" in a meeting with the House of Commons.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta also announced that his office is investigating the \"non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online\" of \"women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations.\"\n\nX said on the same day in a blog post that users would no longer be allowed to create AI photos of real people in sexualized or revealing clothing on the platform, adding that the restriction \"applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Business Insider reporter Henry Chandonnet found that it is still \"surprisingly easy\" to prompt Grok to create nude images of him by going to the app itself instead of using the Grok chatbot on X.",
