    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg published a playlist of five songs he was pumping while building Facebook in 2004. It includes hard-rocking hits and some synth funk.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is feeling nostalgic.\n\nOn the 22nd anniversary of Facebook's founding, Zuckerberg reposted a meme about the fresh-faced Harvard student \"getting ready to make history.\" Then he linked a playlist titled \"2004 Facebook coding jams.\"\n\nZuckerberg said he \"had these bangers on repeat\" while building Facebook. The playlist's cover features the young founder — long before his bulked-up rebrand — listening to music on headphones.\n\nThe playlist's five songs feature a fair share of emo wails, electric guitars, and even some funky synthesizers. Some of them have receded into the tides of music history; others remain classics for weddings and bar mitzvahs.\n\nThey're also evocative of a quieter, easier time in tech. There were no culture wars, cage matches, or capex worries. What would a 2004 Zuckerberg think of $10 billion data centers?\n\nMusic speaks to how we feel. Here's what these five songs might say about a 19-year-old Zuckerberg — and just how far he's come.\n\nZuckerberg liked hard rock, it seems.\n\n\"Headstrong\" is a loud, thrashing song that feels built to be played on \"Guitar Hero.\" There's even a good guttural scream in there before one chorus. The lyrics are equally attacking. \"Back off, I'll take you on,\" Chris Taylor Brown sings.\n\nThe opening of \"Headstrong\" sounds like UFC walkout music, hyping up a big fight. That's now a favorite sport of Zuckerberg's. Some things never change.\n\n\"Like a Stone\" is about death and religion — two subjects that Zuckerberg has long been interested in.\n\nFrontman Chris Cornell prays to God and angels on their deathbed that they will get into heaven. \"In dreams until my death / I will wander on,\" he sings.\n\nZuckerberg seems more interested in extending human life than forecasting its end. His philanthropic initiative invests heavily in drug and disease research. He also has an intense fitness routine, including jiu-jitsu and CrossFit routines.\n\nAs for faith, Zuckerberg said in 2020 that he had \"become more religious.\" He cited two sources: The issues his company has faced in the prior years and the birth of his daughters.\n\nMostly, though, \"Like A Stone\" is another huge rock hit. It seems like Zuckerberg enjoyed the sound of banging drums and wailing guitar.\n\nNow this one is a nostalgia trip.\n\nYou can't help but feel something when Douglas Robb croons out, \"I'm not a perfect person.\" Was Zuckerberg a perfect person? Most people who have watched \"The Social Network\" would say no.\n\nIt's a romantic song. After considering their flaws, Robb sings out that they've found a reason to change. \"The reason is you,\" he repeats, over and over.\n\nZuckerberg met his wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2003, one year before this playlist's date. Maybe he was thinking of her.\n\nHe'd be less happy to hear that the song reemerged on TikTok — a Meta competitor — in a 2021 trend.\n\nWe all knew that Zuckerberg liked rap. He recorded his own version of T-Pain's \"Get Low\" in tribute to his wife. He also started dressing like Eminem.\n\n\"In the End\" is peak 2010s emo rap-rock. One of its refrains is \"I tried so hard.\" Zuckerberg did try so hard — he often worked till late into the night.\n\nThe song is more pessimistic in its outlook: \"In the end, it doesn't even matter.\" Zuckerberg would likely disagree here. He tried so hard — and in the end, it did matter. Meta is now a trillion-dollar company.\n\nHard pivot! After four hard rock tunes, Zuckerberg's last song leans into synth-funk.\n\nThe lyrics here feel self-explanatory for Zuckerberg's workplace ethos: \"Work it harder, make it better / Do it faster, makes us stronger / More than ever, hour after hour / Work is never over.\"\n\nAfter Meta's year of intensity, I'm sure that some of Zuckerberg's employees can relate.\n\nAlso, the Daft Punk helmet doesn't look that different from a Meta Quest.",

    "title": "iPod inventor says having kids has changed how Silicon Valley's founders think about privacy",
    "description": "iPod inventor Tony Fadell said founders like Meta' Mark Zuckerberg think differently about privacy issues after becoming parents.",
    "fullText": "Becoming parents has changed more than just the work schedules for Silicon Valley's elite, according to the \"father of the iPod.\"\n\nTony Fadell, the former Apple executive who invented the popular music player, said that founders he's worked with think differently about privacy issues after going through the life-changing experience of having kids.\n\n\"I remember a marked way difference in the way I thought about the world before I had kids and after I had kids,\" Fadell told Eric Newcomer during a recent interview on the journalist's podcast.\n\nFadell said that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin think about the world \"in a very different way\" now than before they had kids or were married.\n\n\"'I want everything all the time. I'll give away all my privacy. I don't care what happens with all this data,'\" Fadell said, describing the pre-parenthood viewpoint. \"As soon as you have kids and you start hearing about deepfakes, and you start hearing about social engineering, and you start hearing about all this other stuff, you start changing your view on how much data you want sucked up and how you're being protected.\"\n\nZuckerberg has previously spoken about how becoming a parent changed how he led Facebook, now Meta. Zuckerberg and his wife, pediatrician and philanthropist Priscilla Chan. Their eldest child was born in 2015.\n\n\"Having kids does change how you think about the world in a pretty dramatic way,\" Zuckerberg told students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in 2017, according to a CNBC report of his remarks.\n\nPage has two children with his wife, research scientist Lucinda Southworth. Brin has three children, two with his first wife Anne Wojcicki, the founder of genetics testing company 23andMe, and one with Nicole Shanahan, the founder of a legal-tech startup and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s former vice presidential running mate in the 2024 election.\n\nOn the broader issue of children, privacy, and AI, Congress and regulators around the globe are closely scrutinizing tech companies.\n\nElon Musk's xAI is facing probes ranging from the California Attorney General's office to Britain's Ofcom over Grok generating sexualized images of real people, including minors, without their permission. On January 14, xAI said it had implemented measures to prevent the Grok account from generating such images on the platform, though tests showed Grok continued to produce sexualized images of real people within the Grok app.\n\n\"We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X Rules,\"xAI's official account said in a post on X.\n\nIn August, a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider that the company was changing how its AI chatbots respond to children. Congressional lawmakers had pressed the social network after Reuters reported that internal Meta documents showed it was acceptable for a chatbot to engage in romantic conversations with children.\n\nFadell and Newcomer discussed how society, and even company leaders, might approach AI-enabled devices that require access to large amounts of personal data, including real-time inputs, to be truly revolutionary.\n\n\"I know for a fact I worked with these guys, some of these founders, that they think about the world differently, and they wish they would've made some different moves and different decisions early on, and would like to go back, but they can't,\" Fadell said.",

    "fullText": "Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts have claimed social media is intentionally addictive and harmful\n\nSocial media companies will have to answer to a jury – for the first time – for allegations that their products are intentionally addictive and harmful to young users’ mental health. Hundreds of parents, teens and school districts sued Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube, leading to a series of landmark trials that began this week. Jury selection in the first case started on Tuesday in Los Angeles court.\n\nMeta’s Mark Zuckerberg is among the big tech CEOs who are expected to testify. Both sides are likely to bring in experts to hash out the science behind alleged addiction to social media.\n\nThe initial trial involves a 20-year-old, identified by the initials KGM, who alleges she experienced physical and emotional harm after becoming addicted to social media at age 10. This case is expected to last six to eight weeks, and will be the first of about 22 “bellwether” trials. The outcome can signal, and influence, how courts and juries may handle similar lawsuits in the future. Snap and TikTok have settled with the plaintiff in the first case, leaving Meta and YouTube to stand trial.\n\n“Everybody’s looking at it as a data point,” said Benjamin Zipursky, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nThe legal proceedings follow years of heated criticism of tech companies from angry parents; they blame social networks for causing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts and anxiety in their children. The companies lay blame on the victims, plaintiffs’ lawyers and supporters say: “The tech companies blame parents for not being good parents,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, which has been involved in advocacy work for the plaintiffs. “Their experience has shown that you can be the best parent in the world – you can have conversations, you can limit screen time, you can turn on the bullshit parental controls – and your kid still dies.”\n\nThe cases and future settlements could eventually change the way social media platforms work; plaintiffs are asking for money, as well as injunctive relief that would establish industry-wide safety standards. Legislators around the world are watching; many are trying to impose liability on tech companies in a similar way as the plaintiffs. So even if juries declare the defendants aren’t liable in these cases, lawmakers will be taking notes–and adapting their own strategies, says Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University school of law. Some have already enacted laws that align with the plaintiff’s claims.\n\nThere’s more at stake now, legal experts say. “Bad press about how some members of Congress embarrass Zuckerberg is one thing,” Zipursky added. Changing the architecture of a social network may be another entirely.\n\nPlaintiffs want to know: how much did tech companies know about the alleged harm caused by their products, and to what extent did they fail to warn users? They take particular issue with design features such as infinite scroll, autoplay and content curated by algorithms, accusing social media companies of prioritising engagement over wellbeing. Their legal strategy has brought up comparisons with those used against tobacco companies in the 1990s.\n\nThe trial will explore what social media addiction consists of. Tech companies have questioned the scientific link between their platforms and addiction. They also highlight various safety features and parental controls they adopted in recent years. Even if this harm exists, they argue, it’s a result of problematic content, as opposed to a poorly designed system. In doing so, the companies have often relied on a federal law that shields them from liability for third-party content on their platforms: section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That defense hasn’t worked so far in this case, given the plaintiffs’ novel argument.\n\n“[Plaintiffs] have reconfigured it to say, look: the wrongful thing Meta is doing is running its whole platform in such a way that people get addicted,” Zipursky said. A key issue will be whether plaintiffs can prove the tech companies were wrongfully taking harmful risks, Zipursky added. Moreover, if the plaintiffs can prove that tech companies knowingly and intentionally caused harm, it will be easier to get punitive damages.\n\nSocial media addiction is not included in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the authoritative handbook for mental health treatment. Scientists have, however, catalogued compulsive use with severe consequences among young people, and legislators across the world are engaged in heated debate over its addictive potential and how to respond.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan and Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri are expected to testify in the initial trial. Snap and TikTok reached a settlement in that case but are still defendants in other suits in the state-level trial.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in an emailed comment that they strongly disagree with these allegations, and stressed that they have listened to parents and worked with experts and law enforcement to address safety issues. The company also cited the introduction of teen accounts, with additional protections.\n\nGoogle spokesperson José Castañeda called allegations in the lawsuits “simply not true”, and emphasized that the company had prioritized providing a safe and healthy experience for young people. Snap commented only on the first bellwether trial, saying they were “pleased to have been able to resolve this matter in an amicable manner”. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile much of the cases is yet to play out, some unsealed evidence has already drawn criticism of tech companies. That includes allegations that an Instagram employee compared the app to a drug, and that another suggested: “lol, we’re basically pushers.” A Meta spokesperson previously told Politico that the plaintiffs’ allegations relied on “cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture”.\n\nThe 20-year-old at the center of the initial trial started using social media around age 10, even as her mother tried to stop her from using the apps. She “developed a compulsion to engage with those products nonstop” as a result of their “addictive design” and “constant notifications”, the complaint notes, according to NPR.\n\nLegal experts expect all of these cases will eventually be appealed if they don’t reach a settlement, and there’s no certainty about outcomes until appellate courts have weighed in. They expect tech companies to raise several issues, including whether the Communications Decency Act or first amendment applies, as well as potential disputes over causation and expert testimony. “None of these companies are going to feel that they need to change what they do,” Zipursky said.\n\nStill, juries’ verdicts in the early cases can affect how much companies may pay out. “The jury might signal they’re completely persuaded by the plaintiff’s arguments,” Goldman said. “Then, if there’s any settlement, the price tag will go up substantially.”",

    "title": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg says Meta's AI story is about where it's headed, not just one model",
    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses AI strategy, highlighting steady progress over breakthrough models, with Wall Street awaiting results.",
    "fullText": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn't come to Meta's earnings call on Wednesday promising a breakthrough AI model that would silence the skeptics.\n\nInstead, he offered something more careful: a bet on momentum.\n\n\"I expect our first models will be good,\" Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks, \"but more importantly, we'll show the rapid trajectory that we're on, and then I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the year as we continue to release new models.\"\n\nIn June, Meta launched a new AI initiative, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), headed by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang. When Wall Street sought signs that this big, costly AI reset is working, Zuckerberg had a different ask: patience and faith that a steady drumbeat of releases in 2026 will matter more than a single big reveal.\n\n\"The AI strategy articulated on the call may leave some wanting more,\" wrote Barclays analyst Ross Sandler in a note to clients, \"but there was an underlying confidence and clearly a lot of new things in the works.\"\n\nZuckerberg said he could not yet share details of the company's AI strategy on the call and that it would roll out its initial set of models and products over the coming months.\n\n\"I think my answers to a lot of your questions on this particular call may be somewhat unfulfilling because we're in this interesting period where we've been rebuilding our AI effort. And we're six months into that, and I'm happy with how it's going,\" he said.\n\nThat didn't stop some analysts from pressing the CEO. When JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked Zuckerberg \n\n\"The first set of things that we put out, I think, are going to be more about showing the trajectory that we're on rather than being a single moment in time,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nBrian Mulberry, an analyst at Zacks Investment Management, told Business Insider that there was \"no real substance to any of Zuckerberg's comments that would move our analysis one way or the other.\"\n\n\"We want to see real bottom-line profits driven by AI, and it seems that Meta is still far from that reality,\" Mulberry said.\n\nRoger Beharry Lall, a research director at IDC, told Business Insider that Zuckerberg's remarks about the company's coming AI models and their \"trajectory\" show that the company is ambitious, though the lack of concrete information means its goals \"remain largely aspirational.\"\n\nMeta's financials show that its AI work is already improving its advertising business. The company said improvements to how it ranks and shows ads led to 3.5% more clicks on Facebook and over 1% gain in conversions on Instagram in the final quarter of 2025.\n\nMeta's revenue jumped 24% to $59.9 billion in the last three months of 2025, and the company generated $43.6 billion in free cash flow in 2025 even as it spent heavily on AI infrastructure. Ad impressions jumped 18% from this time last year, and what advertisers paid for each ad rose 6%.\n\nThat combination explains why Meta can afford to keep spending on AI even while Zuckerberg asks investors to wait for the bigger breakthroughs.\n\nMeta's patient approach carries some risk given the company's recent track record. In August, Business Insider reported that the company was pushing to release the next version of its Llama AI model by the end of the year, which didn't happen.\n\nLlama's previous release in April disappointed developers who said it lagged in coding and reasoning, precisely the capabilities that matter most in the AI race that Meta wants to catch up in.\n\nMeta's new model, called \"Mango\", will focus on images and videos, while another one called \"Avocado\" will be better at coding, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nSome analysts said that Zuckerberg's restraint may simply reflect Meta's early stage in its AI reset.\n\n\"Training the model with this new team is going to take a while,\" Mandeep Singh, Bloomberg Intelligence's global head of technology research, told Business Insider.\n\nTo make up ground, he expects Meta to sharpen its focus and specialize in certain areas, rather than \"trying to beat everyone everywhere all at once.\"\n\nSingh said that Meta's strong advertising business gave it a lot of runway.\n\n\"This kind of growth rate allows you a lot of cushion in terms of taking your time and getting AI,\" he said.\n\nHave a tip?
