    "title": "ICEBlock Was Purged from the App Store. Now Its Creator Is Suing Trump",
    "description": "It became a lightning rod for the right—and a target for what its developer says was an attack on free speech.",
    "fullText": "In May, I published an early report on ICEBlock, the iOS-exclusive app that allows you to anonymously notify other users of the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers within 5 miles of your location. Since then, the app has been on a wild journey. A June CNN segment on ICEBlock and its coder, Joshua Aaron, got the attention of Attorney General Pam Bondi, who told Sean Hannity that Aaron should “watch out”; the app subsequently topped the charts at Apple’s App Store, as Republicans demanded that Bondi investigate Aaron’s creation. Trump whisperer Laura Loomer also got involved, revealing the identity of Aaron’s wife and getting her fired from her job with the Justice Department. The simultaneous trends of liberal uptake and conservative outrage continued until Oct. 2—when Bondi directly instructed Apple to remove ICEBlock from the App Store.\n\nNot only did the Big Tech giant comply, but it also removed other apps with similar ICE-notification and -documentation functions, to the protests of myriad Americans. (Google’s Play Store, which never hosted ICEBlock, also followed suit with those other, similar apps.) By the time it was delisted, Aaron tells me, ICEBlock had “over 1.14 million users,” and it was “adding 15,000 to 20,000 a day.”\n\nYet while ICEBlock got blocked, it may not stay that way much longer.\n\nOn Monday, Aaron filed a federal lawsuit against Bondi and three other Trump administration officials, including White House “border czar” Tom Homan, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accusing them of violating the First Amendment by coercing a private entity to censor speech and threatening prosecution over the exercise of protected speech. The 39-page suit, which requests a jury trial, asks the D.C. court to bar the Trump administration from demanding that Apple delist ICEBlock, or any similar immigration-advocacy app, ever again. The filing also requests relief on behalf of Aaron himself and his ALL U Chart company, which formally owns ICEBlock. The two plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Sher Tremonte, the law firm that recently won a federal court judgment ruling Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s efforts to detain and deport pro-Palestine student protesters to be unconstitutional free speech violations.\n\n“We’re seeking a declaratory judgment that this kind of coercion and the threats of prosecution against Joshua violate the First Amendment,” Sher Tremonte lead counsel Noam Biale told me. “And we are seeking an injunction from the court to prevent the government officials whom we’re suing from doing those things again.”\n\nNo one will know for a while yet whether the district court will even take the case up. Assuming it does, Aaron says, “the biggest goal here is to set a precedent”—to get the sort of judgment that could apply to ICEBlock and to the other ICE-related apps that have been taken down at the request of the feds. (Aaron adds, however, that he doesn’t plan to have other plaintiffs join his suit for now.)\n\nDespite the popularity of platforms like the ICE video archive Eyes Up and the interactive crowdsourced map People Over Papers, it does seem that ICEBlock remains the central symbol of this digital movement. Just this Friday, the House Committee on Homeland Security sent letters to the CEOs of Apple and Google, accusing them of still hosting “apps that allow users to report and disseminate data to reveal the location and identification of DHS law enforcement.” By way of erroneous example, the letter exclusively mentions ICEBlock, which does not collect or display anybody’s identity. But to the committee, that app has a special notoriety.\n\n“As you are aware … ICEBlock was used by a gunman to track the movement of ICE agents prior to a deadly shooting in September at an ICE facility in Dallas,” the lawmakers write, pointing to the incident where a 29-year-old Oklahoman purportedly wished to attack ICE agents but ended up killing two detainees and himself.\n\nTo be clear, there was no evidence that the shooter used ICEBlock at any point; FBI Director Kash Patel tweeted after the incident that the gunman had “searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents,” per USA Today. That pretext then inspired Bondi to again call out the media-famous ICEBlock in particular and get Apple to take it down. At the time, Apple told Fox Digital that “information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock” spurred the company to delist the app. The newsletter Migrant Insider later reported, citing “internal correspondence” Apple had sent to a different developer, that App Store moderators now treated federal officers as a “targeted group” on par with typically recognized marginalized ethnicities and identities (race, sexual orientation, origin), using that justification to deplatform apps with “location information … that can be used to harm” ICE agents.\n\nThat takedown alert was addressed to Deicer, a tool that “provides real-time alerts about ICE sightings through community reports, giving users the option to be an ‘observer’ and keep an eye out for authorities,” according to Syracuse University’s Daily Orange. But the same App Store guideline about “targeted groups” had already been weaponized against ICEBlock, per the lawsuit—and this was how “the first known instance of Apple removing U.S.-based apps in response to U.S. government demands” came about. (That being said, public means of tracking airplanes used by ICE are still available.)\n\n“Nothing had changed about ICEBlock, after all that vetting from their legal team over that five-week period of time” before it first hit the App Store, as Aaron told me. “They didn’t provide any evidence of law enforcement being targeted. They didn’t give me any information about what specifically they were provided by law enforcement.”\n\nAs Aaron also pointed out, the government’s rhetoric around ICEBlock tends to be either misinformed or disingenuous. Bondi told the Senate that Americans used the app to “post where ICE officers lived” (even though it did not pinpoint agents’ home residences) and claiming the DOJ also “worked with” Google to remove ICEBlock (even though it was never listed on the Play Store). The House committee’s letter to the Big Tech firms cited the Supreme Court’s landmark Brandenburg v. Ohio decision to imply that ICEBlock was not covered by free-speech statutes, as a supposed example of advocacy “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action,” or likely to do so.\n\nThe lawsuit counters such arguments by pointing out that the app does not upload or store any media or user data, and has time-limit guardrails for reporting. Plus, there’s a disclaimer stating that the app is “not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.” Whether that will be enough to restore ICEBlock—itself classified as a form of speech in the suit—is yet to be seen.\n\nMeanwhile, for anyone who still has ICEBlock on their phones, the app is still usable, Aaron says. “Yes, I cannot issue updates and you can’t download it again,” he added. “But we want to encourage people to still use it. It’s still just as private and anonymous as it ever was.”",

    "fullText": "A federal judge investigating whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador said Monday he wants to hear from a whistleblower and top Justice Department official.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ordered the government to make Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign available for testimony on Dec. 16. Boasberg wants to hear a day earlier from fired Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni.\n\nThe order for testimony ratchets up the extraordinary clash between the judicial and executive branches.\n\nIn March, Boasberg ordered the Republican administration to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants.\n\nInstead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off the contempt probe. Boasberg is trying to determine whether the administration willfully ignored his order and should be referred for prosecution on a contempt charge.\n\nReuveni has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a Justice Department official suggested the Trump administration might have to ignore court orders as it prepared to deport Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. The administration has said the allegations are untrue.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Ensign conveyed Boasberg’s oral order and a subsequent written order to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn a written declaration submitted to the court Friday, Noem said she made the decision not to return the planes to the U.S. after receiving “privileged legal advice” from the Homeland Security Department’s acting general counsel and “through him from the senior leadership of the Department of Justice.”\n\nBoasberg, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, called Noem’s declaration “cursory.”\n\n“As this declaration does not provide enough information for the Court to determine whether her decision was a willful violation of the Court’s Order, the Court cannot at this juncture find probable cause that her actions constituted criminal contempt,” the judge wrote in Monday's order.\n\nThe administration has said it did not violate Boasberg’s order. The judge’s directive to return the planes was made verbally in court but not included in his written order, government attorneys said in a court filing in November.\n\nThat order blocked the administration from removing “any of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days,” but said nothing about the flights already airborne, they said.\n\nThe two planes had already departed U.S. territory and airspace, so the migrants aboard them had already been “removed” and therefore fell outside of the court’s order, Justice Department lawyers said in the court filing.\n\nJustice Department attorneys in a court filing Friday objected to any “live testimony,” urging Boasberg instead to “proceed promptly” with a criminal contempt referral if he believed his order was “sufficiently clear in imposing an obligation to halt the transfer of custody for detainees who had already been removed from the United States.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Monday falsely denied making a comment he had made on camera just five days prior. Then he launched a personal attack against the reporter who had accurately repeated his previous remark.\n\nTrump has a long history of falsely denying he ever said things he had said in public.\n\nThe subject of his latest false denial was the video footage of the September 2 US military strikes against a suspected drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean. The military conducted a follow-up strike to kill the people who had survived the first strike.\n\nThe Trump administration publicly released the video of the initial strike but not the video of the follow-up strike, which has been shown to members of Congress behind closed doors. On December 3, Trump said he has no problem releasing this video to the American people.\n\nHere’s the December 3 exchange he had with ABC News reporter Selina Wang at the White House:\n\nWang: Mr. President, you released video of that first boat strike on September 2nd, but not the second video. Will you release video of that strike so that the American people can see for themselves what happened?\n\nTrump: I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have we’d certainly release, no problem.\n\nOn Monday, another ABC News reporter, Rachel Scott, repeated Trump’s comment back to him while trying to ask a question about the potential release of the additional video. But the president denied he had said what he said:\n\nScott: Mr. President, you said you would have no problem with releasing the full video of that strike on September 2nd off the coast of Venezuela. Secretary Hegseth now says –\n\nTrump: I didn’t say that. That’s – you said that, I didn’t say that. This is ABC fake news.\n\nScott correctly noted, “You said that you would have no problem releasing the full vi(deo).” She then pivoted back to her question. She noted that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the question of whether to release the video is being reviewed, and she asked Trump if he is ordering Hegseth to release it.\n\n“Whatever he decides is okay with me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then offered a defense of the strikes, repeating his frequent false claim that each boat destroyed saves “25,000 American lives” and claiming the survivors “were trying to turn the boat back to where it could float, and we didn’t want to see that, because that boat was loaded up with drugs.” When Scott eventually interjected to try to return to the issue of releasing the video, he called her “the most obnoxious reporter in the whole place” and “actually a terrible reporter.”\n\nCNN has reached out to an ABC News spokesperson about the president’s remarks about Scott. Another ABC News journalist, Jonathan Karl, wrote on the social media platform X that Scott “quoted President Trump accurately.”",

    "fullText": "The Oval Office is looking a little bit different lately.\n\nEvery US president makes new interior design choices upon entering the White House, often reflecting their personal tastes or political views.\n\nIn his second nonconsecutive term, President Donald Trump has incorporated his love of maximalism and gold furnishings into the Oval Office.\n\nMore White House renovations are in the works. The East Wing was demolished in October to make way for the construction of a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot state ballroom.\n\nTake a look inside Trump's redecorated White House to see the changes he's made since former President Joe Biden left office.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPresident Joe Biden walked through the West Colonnade alongside Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in May 2023.\n\nTrump has criticized Biden's use of an autopen and sought to invalidate Biden's pardons and commutations that were signed with the device.\n\nThe Palm Room leads out into the Rose Garden.\n\n\"New lobby leading to Oval Office — Magnificent marble floor, compliments of President Donald J. Trump!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAside from a presidential seal above the door to the West Wing, the walls were empty.\n\nThe gold lettering spelling out \"The Oval Office\" was set in the Shelley Script font. Trump also added a gold decal to the top of the door.\n\nThe rug, which featured the presidential seal in the center, was designed by Kaki Hockersmith, an interior designer based in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThe rug's design includes the presidential seal, a sunbeam pattern, and olive branches along the border as a symbol of peace.\n\nTrump also used the rug during his first term.\n\nTrump's Oval Office features the flags of the Army, the Marine Corps, and the Navy.\n\nThe crown molding on the ceiling matched the cream wallpaper.\n\nThe gold embellishments matched the gold curtains, which remained in place from Biden's presidency.\n\nBiden also hung portraits of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton together to symbolize the benefits of different opinions, as well as portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nTrump added more portraits with decorative frames to create an Oval Office gallery wall. He also replaced Biden's portrait of FDR with one of George Washington and displayed historic gold urns and baskets from the White House collection on the mantle.\n\nTrump's love of gold decor is well-known. His Trump Tower penthouse in New York City features numerous gilded ceilings, furniture pieces, and artwork. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, also includes a ballroom covered in gold from floor to ceiling.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt added the plaster relief of the presidential seal to the Oval Office during a 1934 White House renovation.\n\nBoth the seal and the stars surrounding it were covered in gold paint.\n\nThe hyperrealistic portrait, painted by Robert McCurdy, was unveiled at the White House in 2023.\n\nArtist Marc Lipp painted a rendering of an Associated Press photo that captured Trump raising his fist in the air following an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore it was used for press conferences and events, first lady Ellen Wilson originally designed the outdoor space as a formal flower garden in 1913.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump added a limestone border around the lawn in 2020.\n\nTrump told Fox News that the grass in the Rose Garden was impractical for large events because it stayed wet when it rained and was too soft for attendees who wore high heels.\n\n\"The grass just doesn't work,\" Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in March.\n\nWorkers began transforming the lawn into a patio in June, replacing the grass with concrete and stone tiles. \"The Rose Garden Club\" was completed in August.\n\nThe East Room, the largest state room in the White House, has a seating capacity of 200 people. When Biden hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in 2023, he held the state dinner in a tent outside the White House to accommodate the larger crowd of over 300.\n\nThe 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which the White House called a \"much-needed and exquisite addition,\" will cost approximately $300 million to construct. Trump and other \"patriot donors\" will foot the bill for the project, the White House said.\n\nLocated in the West Wing near the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room overlooks the Rose Garden and features a large, oval-shaped mahogany table purchased by President Richard Nixon in 1970, according to Obama's archived White House website.\n\nSeating at the table is assigned in order of when each department was established, with the oldest departments sitting nearest to the president.\n\nTrump chose portraits of past presidents, including George Washington, John Adams, Andrew Jackson, James Polk, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Dwight Eisenhower, to decorate the Cabinet Room.\n\n\"The vaults are where we have a lot of great pictures and artwork,\" Trump told reporters in July. \"And I picked it all myself, I'm very proud of it.\"\n\nThe eagle sconces were installed as part of a 2004 refurbishment of the Cabinet Room that also included a new rug, curtains, and paint color.\n\n\"Some of the highest quality 24 Karat Gold used in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room of the White House,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post in September. \"Foreign Leaders, and everyone else, 'freak out' when they see the quality and beauty.\"",

    "description": "Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that his winning pitch to Trump for the company to buy Warner Bros. centered on protecting and creating jobs.",
    "fullText": "Before Netflix made its winning bid for Warner Bros., its co-CEO pitched President Donald Trump directly on the merits of the deal.\n\nThe pair found common ground, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said.\n\n\"The president's interests in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said of Trump at the UBS media conference on Monday afternoon.\n\nSarandos said he'd talked to Trump \"many times since the election about the different challenges facing the entertainment industry.\"\n\n\"The president cares deeply about the entertainment industry, and he loves the entertainment industry,\" Sarandos continued.\n\nTrump praised Sarandos on Sunday, calling him a \"great person\" who he said had done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" Still, Trump said Netflix's \"big market share\" in the streaming space \"could be a problem\" as it tries to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets.\n\nThe Netflix-Warner Bros. deal reached on Friday is worth $82.7 billion, including $72 billion in equity. WBD's TV networks like CNN or HGTV, aren't in the proposal.\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance responded on Monday with a hostile bid in the form of a $30-per-share, all-cash offer for all of WBD, including the declining TV networks. Netflix's offer is $27.75 per share, comprising mostly cash and some stock. There's debate among analysts about whether Netflix's or Paramount's renewed offer is more attractive, as it depends on the value of WBD's TV networks.\n\nParamount's move \"was entirely expected,\" Sarandos said.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison, who Trump has publicly praised, went on CNBC on Monday morning to tout his company's offer as \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\" Ellison said his company's offer had \"faster regulatory certainty to close\" than Netflix's. Ellison's father, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally and one of the richest people on the planet.\n\nHowever, Netflix also seems to be building rapport with Trump. That could help explain why Netflix's Sarandos and fellow co-CEO Greg Peters are optimistic about their deal.\n\n\"We are very confident that regulators should, and will, approve it,\" Peters said of the WBD deal.\n\nSarandos pitched the streaming giant's proposed acquisition as a net positive for the labor market, despite the concerns of many in Hollywood. He also said the company is \"deeply committed\" to releasing movies from Warner Bros. in theaters, \"exactly the way they've released those movies today.\"\n\nThat overture could help ease Trump's concerns. Sarandos pitched Netflix as a great job saver.\n\n\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos warned that Ellison would implement lots of layoffs if his bid won and said the Paramount CEO promised about $6 billion in cost savings from a WBD deal. Those so-called \"synergies,\" in analyst jargon, translate to a smaller workforce, Sarandos said.\n\n\"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,\" Sarandos said. \"We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"\n\nNetflix has promised investors $2 billion to $3 billion in its own cost savings from its Warner Bros. deal, however.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",

    "fullText": "\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry sounded early alarms about the subprime mortgage market's excesses — the same risks that later engulfed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nNow, Burry wrote in a Substack post on Monday that he owns \"good size\" positions in both companies' common stock — and believes a long-awaited plan to take them public again may finally be approaching.\n\n\"Once each company is released from capital restraint by their IPOs, I expect growth to accelerate naturally,\" he wrote.\n\nIn his 6,000-word analysis, Burry wrote that the mortgage giants contributed to the housing bubble by buying large volumes of risky loans that eventually blew up during the financial crisis.\n\nBurry recalled that he saw the danger early. In 2003, he called Freddie \"Frauddie Mac\" in an investor letter and bought credit-default swaps that would pay off if the company faltered.\n\nNow in 2025, Burry argues the landscape has changed. Fannie and Freddie have rebuilt tens of billions in capital since 2021 and remain essential pillars of the US mortgage market, owning 62% of outstanding home loans.\n\nWith the Trump administration now signaling interest in releasing them from conservatorship, Burry believes their IPOs may be nearing.\n\nHowever, \"there remains a final steep, windy and rocky climb to IPO for both,\" he wrote, citing regulatory and policy roadblocks.\n\nShares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which trade over the counter, rose 2% and 2.4%, respectively, on Monday.\n\nBurry's post came a month after he closed his hedge fund to outside investors, after terminating Scion Asset Management's SEC registration.\n\nSince then, he has launched his \"Cassandra Unchained\" Substack that promises a \"front row seat to his analytical efforts and projections for stocks, markets, and bubbles, often with an eye to history and its remarkably timeless patterns.\" It now has over 146,000 subscribers.",
